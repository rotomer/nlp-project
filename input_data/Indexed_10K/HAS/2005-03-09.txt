ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company included elsewhere in this document. This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward looking statements concerning the Companys expectations and beliefs. See "Business Forward Looking Information and Risk Factors That May Affect Future Results" for a discussion of other uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements. (Thousands of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share Data) Executive Summary The Company earns revenue and generates cash through the sale of a variety of toy and game products both within the United States and in International markets. Most of the Companys products are either internally developed or licensed from outside inventors. In addition to the products based on its own core brands, the Company also offers internally developed products tied to licensed movie and television based entertainment properties. The Companys principal business strategies focus on: Growing its core brands, Developing new and innovative toy and game products, and Increasing operating margins by optimizing efficiencies within the Company. Management views the Companys principal product opportunities as falling into three general categories: core brands, innovative new products and licensed entertainment based products. Although the Company intends to continue to offer products based on licensed entertainment properties, in the past four years the Company has actively sought to reduce its reliance on products based on theatrical properties and to achieve more consistent performance by focusing greater resources on the development and growth of its core brands and on developing innovative products. The Companys core brands represent Company owned or Company controlled brands, such as G.I. JOE, TRANSFORMERS, MY LITTLE PONY, MONOPOLY, MAGIC: THE GATHERING, PLAYSKOOL and TONKA, which the Company views as presenting potential to be successful over the long term. The Company has a large portfolio of owned and controlled brands, which can be introduced in new formats and platforms over time. By focusing on core brands, the Company is working to build a more consistent revenue stream and basis for future growth. However, the volatility of consumer preferences and the high level of competition in the toy and game industry make it difficult to maintain the long term success of existing product lines and to consistently introduce successful new products. In addition to its focus on core brands, the Companys strategy also involves trying to meet ever changing consumer preferences by identifying and offering innovative products based on market opportunities. In 2004, innovative products such as VIDEONOW COLOR were significant contributors to revenue for the Company. The Company believes its strategy of focusing on the development of its core brands and continuing to identify innovative new products will help to prevent the Company from being dependent on the success of any one product line. While the Companys strategy focuses on growing its core brands and the development of innovative, new products, the Company continues to evaluate and enter into arrangements to license movie and television entertainment based properties when the Company believes it is 23 economically beneficial. Theatrical entertainment based licenses in 2004 included DREAMWORKS SHREK II, DISNEYS THE INCREDIBLES, and LUCASFILMS STAR WARS. Although gross profits of theatrical entertainment based products are generally higher, this increased gross margin is offset by royalty expenses incurred on these sales, as well as amortization expense of property right based assets acquired from the licensor of such properties. In recent years, the Company has also focused on reducing its fixed costs and increasing its operating margins. In 2004, the Company reassessed the development process in its U.S. Toys segment, moving a greater amount of product development outside of the U.S., resulting in a streamlining of its U.S. Toy workforce. In 2003, the Company ceased manufacturing in its Valencia, Spain facility and announced the closure of the remaining retail stores operated under the Wizards of the Coast and Gamekeeper names. The Company will continue to review its operations in order to determine areas where greater efficiency can be achieved. The Companys recent strategy also focused on the reduction of long term debt. The goal of management has been to reduce the Companys debt to capitalization ratio, defined as total debt, both short term and long term, as a percentage of total equity plus total debt, to 25 30%. The Company has repurchased or repaid $55,658 and $367,545 in principal amount of long term debt during 2004 and 2003, respectively. The 2003 repurchases included amounts related to a tender offer, pursuant to which the Company repurchased $167,257 of aggregate principal amount of the 8.50% notes due 2006 previously issued by the Company. At December 26, 2004, the Companys debt to capitalization ratio was approximately 28%, which compared to approximately 34% at December 28, 2003. Due to the seasonal nature of the business, the Companys debt to capitalization ratio normally peaks at the end of the third quarter, when its working capital requirements are greatest. The September 26, 2004 ratio was approximately 30%. It is the Companys intent to continue to assess the desirability of using available cash from operations to reduce its outstanding long term debt and to maintain this target ratio, as market conditions and the Companys committed revolving credit agreement and other sources of financing allow. Consolidation in the toy and game industry and associated retail uncertainty continued in 2004, and included the pending reorganization of the Companys second largest customer, Toys R Us. As a result, the Companys remaining customer base continued to become more concentrated. The Companys top five customers accounted for approximately 50% of full year net revenues in 2004, with Wal Mart Stores, Inc., Toys R Us, Inc. and Target Corporation, its three largest customers, accounting for 46%. The consolidation of customers may provide certain benefits to the Company, such as potentially more efficient product distribution and other decreased costs of sales and distribution, including potential efficiencies related to SKU reductions. However, this consolidation also creates additional risks to the Companys business associated with a major customer having financial difficulties or reducing its business with the Company. In addition, increased customer concentration may decrease the prices the Company is able to obtain for some of its products. The Company believes that its strategy of seeking to produce sought after products, which provide value to both consumers and the Companys customers, will help protect the Company from any negative impact resulting from an environment of increasing retail consolidation. 24 Summary The relationship between various components of the results of operations, stated as a percent of net revenues, is illustrated below for the three fiscal years ended December 26, 2004. 2004 2003 2002 Net revenues 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 41.8 41.0 39.0 Gross profit 58.2 59.0 61.0 Amortization 2.4 2.4 3.4 Royalties 7.4 7.9 10.5 Research and product development 5.2 4.6 5.5 Advertising 12.9 11.6 10.5 Selling, distribution and administration 20.5 21.5 23.3 Interest expense 1.1 1.7 2.8 Other expense, net 0.0 1.5 1.3 Earnings before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change 8.7 7.8 3.7 Income taxes 2.2 2.2 1.0 Net earnings before cumulative effect of accounting change 6.5 5.6 2.7 Cumulative effect of accounting change, net of tax (0.6 ) (8.8 ) Net earnings (loss) 6.5 % 5.0 % (6.1 )% Results of Operations Net earnings for the fiscal year ended December 26, 2004 were $195,977, or $.96 per diluted share. This compares to net earnings (loss) for fiscal 2003 and 2002 of $157,664 and $(170,674), or $.85 and $(.90) per diluted share, respectively. Net earnings and basic and diluted earnings per share for 2004 include aggregate charges, net of tax, of approximately $19,600 related to the Companys licensing agreement with Disney, a non cash charge for the other than temporary decline in the value of the Companys investment in Infogrames Entertainment S.A. ("Infogrames") common stock, and severance costs related to a reduction in headcount in December, primarily in the U.S. Toys segment. Also included in net earnings and basic earnings per share for 2004 is $12,710 of non cash income relating to the decrease in fair value of certain warrants. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, diluted earnings per share for 2004 do not include the $12,710 favorable impact of the fair value warrant adjustment, but do include the dilutive impact of shares issuable under this agreement. In 2003 the Company incurred a non cash charge to earnings of $13,630 relating to the increase in fair value of these warrants. This had an anti dilutive effect on earnings per share, and accordingly the 2003 charge to earnings for the change in fair value of the contract was not eliminated and no shares related to this warrant were included in dilutive securities. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue 04 8, "The Effect of Contingently Convertible Instruments on Diluted Earnings per Share", which the Company adopted in December 2004, diluted earnings per share for 2003 and 2002 were restated to reflect the dilutive effect of the assumed conversion of the Companys Senior Convertible Debentures due 2021. The diluted earnings per share calculations for the three fiscal years ended December 26, 2004 include adjustments to add back to earnings the interest expense, net of tax, incurred on the convertible debentures, and to include in diluted weighted average shares the shares potentially issuable as if the contingent conversion features were met. The effect of this restatement was to reduce net 25 earnings before cumulative effect of accounting change per diluted share for 2003 by $0.04. There was no effect on 2002 diluted earnings per share before cumulative effect of accounting change. Based on its subsequent events review, the Company has adjusted the amounts reflected in its condensed annual results for fiscal 2004 as released on February 7, 2005, which resulted in a reduction of net revenues and net earnings by $1,708 and $211, respectively. These adjustments were individually and in the aggregate not material to the Companys financial statements. Net earnings and basic and diluted earnings per share for 2003 include a cumulative effect of accounting change, net of tax, of $(17,351), or $(.09) per diluted share, relating to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Liabilities and Equity" ("SFAS 150"). Net earnings in 2003 also included the impact of debt reduction activities and charges associated with the business efficiency activities of the Company, two of which were noted above. Associated cash charges in 2003 include a loss on the extinguishment of debt, net of taxes, of $12,612 relating to the repurchase of $367,545 in principal amount of the Companys debt mentioned above. Additionally, 2003 net earnings include cash charges, net of taxes, of $20,684 relating to severance and lease costs associated with the cessation of manufacturing at the Companys facility in Valencia, Spain and the disposition of substantially all of the Companys remaining retail stores. Included in the net loss for 2002 is a cumulative effect of accounting change, net of tax, of $(245,732), or $(1.33) per diluted share, relating to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS 142"). The 2002 net loss also includes a non cash charge, net of tax, of $31,747 for the write down of the Companys investment in Infogrames common stock. In addition, the 2002 net loss includes a charge of $7,566 relating to a fine imposed on the Companys United Kingdom affiliate by the Office of Fair Trading in the United Kingdom ("OFT") for alleged anti competitive pricing practices. The 2002 net loss was favorably impacted by interest income, net of tax, of $7,556, received on an IRS tax settlement. Consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 26, 2004 were $2,997,510 compared to $3,138,657 in 2003 and $2,816,230 in 2002. Most of the Companys revenues and operating profits are derived from its three principal segments: U.S. Toys, Games and International, which are discussed in detail below. The following table presents net revenues and operating profit data for the Companys three principal segments for each of the three fiscal years ended December 26, 2004. 2004 % Change 2003 % Change 2002 Net Revenues U.S. Toys $ 952,923 (10 )% $ 1,057,984 6 % $ 996,496 Games 796,032 (1 )% 804,547 9 % 739,782 International 1,194,630 1 % 1,184,532 22 % 970,825 Operating Profit U.S. Toys $ 7,185 (92 )% $ 91,996 22 % $ 75,664 Games 137,628 (21 )% 175,295 41 % 124,523 International 140,784 54 % 91,273 1663 % 5,177 U.S. Toys U.S. Toys segment net revenues for the year ended December 26, 2004 decreased 10% to $952,923 from 2003. The results reflect an overall softness in the boys toy business, as demonstrated primarily by decreased sales of BEYBLADE, and to a lesser extent, lower sales of 26 TRANSFORMERS and G.I. JOE products. Decreased sales of PLAYSKOOL and ZOIDS products also contributed to the overall decrease in revenues. These decreases were partially offset by increased sales of VIDEONOW products, increased shipments of MY LITTLE PONY products, which were reintroduced in the third quarter of 2003, and revenues from the new product launch of LAZER TAG. Net revenues in 2004 were also positively impacted by increased shipments of STAR WARS products over 2003. The decrease in U.S. Toys operating profit to $7,185 in 2004 from 2003, primarily relates to decreased gross profit as a result of the lower net revenues as well as a change in product mix, including the decline in sales of BEYBLADE products which carry a higher gross margin and increased sales of VIDEONOW hardware, which carry a lower gross margin. Competitive price pressures and customer sales allowances related to VIDEONOW also contributed to lower gross margin. To a lesser extent, the decrease relates to an increase in advertising expense, which is consistent with the Companys strategy to continue to focus on product promotions as a means to increase and sustain awareness of its core brands, as well as to introduce new products. U.S. Toys 2004 operating profit was also impacted by charges of $6,900 associated with organizational and staffing changes made in December 2004. The decrease in operating profit was partially offset by decreased royalties, driven by lower sales of BEYBLADE products, as well as lower selling, distribution, and administration expenses as a result of a combination of lower sales activity and the Companys cost reduction initiatives. Net revenues in the U.S. Toys segment increased by 6% in 2003 over 2002 to $1,057,984. The increase was due primarily to strong sales of BEYBLADE and FURREAL FRIENDS products, which were introduced in the second half of 2002. In addition, revenue from sales of VIDEONOW, which was introduced in 2003, and MY LITTLE PONY, which was reintroduced in 2003, contributed to the increase in revenues. Revenues were also positively impacted by increased shipments of products related to certain core brands, such as TRANSFORMERS and PLAYSKOOL products. Sales of DISNEY products also increased as a result of the theatrical, video and DVD releases of FINDING NEMO and the DVD and video re releases of THE LION KING in 2003. These increases were partially offset by the expected decrease in sales of STAR WARS products in a non movie year, as well as decreased sales of BOB THE BUILDER, E KARA, and ZOIDS products. The increase in operating profit from 2002 to 2003 was largely due to lower royalty and amortization expenses as the result of lower sales of entertainment based products, primarily STAR WARS related products. STAR WARS property rights are amortized in proportion to expected remaining sales. In periods with higher sales of STAR WARS products, such as 2002, the resulting amortization expense will be higher. The decreases in royalty and amortization expense were partially offset by decreased gross profits due to a change in product mix. Although revenues increased in 2003, the 2002 product mix included higher sales of STAR WARS products, which have higher gross margins, while the 2003 product mix included increased sales of lower gross margin products, resulting in an overall decrease in gross profits. Operating profit in 2003 was also impacted by higher advertising expense reflecting the Companys increased focus on marketing to raise awareness of its core brands and to launch new products. Games Games segment net revenues for the year ended December 26, 2004 decreased slightly by 1% to $796,032 from 2003. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to decreased sales of board games. Partially offsetting this decrease were increased revenues from products in the electronic and pre school categories including strong sales of ELEFUN and WHAC A MOLE. Revenues from trading card games increased slightly with sales of DUEL MASTERS, which was introduced in the fourth quarter of 2003 offsetting decreased revenues from other trading card games, including MAGIC: THE GATHERING, which had one less release in 2004 than in 2003. 27 Games segment operating profit decreased 21% to $137,628 in 2004 from 2003. The decrease reflects lower gross margin as a result of a change in the mix of trading card game revenue, higher product development and royalty expenses associated with DVD games, and increased advertising expense. The increase in Games segment revenues from 2002 to 2003 primarily related to strong shipments of TRIVIAL PURSUIT 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION, which was initially released in the U.S. in the third quarter of 2002, as well as shipments of TRIVIAL PURSUIT POP CULTURE DVD game, which was introduced in the fourth quarter of 2003; increased shipments of TWISTER products which include TWISTER MOVES; strong sales of MONOPOLY brand products; and increased revenues from shipments of other core brands, primarily MAGIC: THE GATHERING products, as well as higher revenues from other non licensed trading card games. These increases were partially offset by decreased sales of licensed trading card games including POKEMON and HARRY POTTER. The increase in operating profit in 2003 from 2002 was primarily due to increased gross profit from higher revenues, as well as lower royalty expense, resulting from decreased sales of licensed trading card games. These factors were partially offset by an increase in advertising expense due to the Companys strategy to increase advertising focused on increasing demand for its core brands. Operating profit for 2003 also benefited from decreased fixed expenses as the result of cost reduction initiatives. International International segment net revenues increased slightly by 1% to $1,194,630 in 2004 from 2003. International segment 2004 net revenues were positively impacted by currency translation of approximately $78,000 as the result of the weaker U.S. dollar. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign exchange, International net revenues decreased 6% in local currency for the year ended December 26, 2004. The decrease in local currency revenue was primarily the result of lower sales of BEYBLADE products, and, to a lesser extent, decreased sales of ACTION MAN. These decreases were partially offset by increased revenues from MY LITTLE PONY products, which were introduced in the third quarter of 2003, and higher sales of FURREAL FRIENDS, DUEL MASTERS, and VIDEONOW products. To a lesser extent, 2004 revenues were also positively impacted by increased sales of core brand products, including PLAYSKOOL and MONOPOLY products, as well as TRIVIAL PURSUIT products including TRIVIAL PURSUIT 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION. International segment operating profit increased significantly by 54% to $140,784 in 2004 from 2003. International gross profits and operating profits were positively impacted by the cessation of manufacturing at the Companys Valencia, Spain facility at the end of 2003. Operating profit in 2003 included cash charges of approximately $18,400 associated with severance related to this cost reduction initiative. The improvement in operating profit in 2004 over 2003 was also due to lower royalty expense primarily from decreased sales of BEYBLADE, which was partially offset by an increase in advertising expense as a result of the Companys ongoing initiative to raise awareness of its core brands. In 2004, there was a net favorable translation impact to International operating profit of approximately $4,800 for the year. International segment revenues increased 22% to $1,184,532 in 2003 compared to 2002. International segment 2003 net revenues were positively impacted by currency translation of approximately $127,900 as the result of the weaker U.S. dollar. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign exchange, 2003 International net revenues increased 9% in local currency for the year. Local currency revenue increases for 2003 were primarily a result of revenues from BEYBLADE products and to a lesser extent, FURREAL FRIENDS products, which were introduced in most markets in the fourth quarter of 2002. Revenues were also positively impacted by increased sales of core brand 28 products, including MY LITTLE PONY, as well as MAGIC: THE GATHERING, TRANSFORMERS, MONOPOLY and PLAYSKOOL products. These increases were partially offset by lower revenues from STAR WARS products, decreases in sales of licensed trading card games including HARRY POTTER and POKEMON, and decreased sales of E KARA products. The increase in operating profit in 2003 from 2002 was primarily due to increased gross profit on higher revenues, partially offset by increased advertising expense. The expected decrease in royalty expense relating to lower sales of STAR WARS products was largely offset by increased royalty expense associated with higher sales of BEYBLADE products and the foreign exchange impact of the weaker U.S. dollar. Selling, distribution and administration costs decreased as a percentage of sales, but increased in amount, largely due to the foreign exchange impact of the weaker U.S. dollar. Gross profit and operating profit in 2003 were also negatively impacted by the Companys decision to cease its manufacturing operations in Spain. Although revenues were positively impacted by the weaker U.S. dollar, as noted above, operating expenses were also impacted, with a resulting net positive translation impact to International operating profit of approximately $6,500 for 2003. Operating profit in 2002 was negatively impacted by a fine against the Company by the OFT for alleged anti competitive pricing practices, which resulted in a charge of $7,566 in the fourth quarter. Gross Profit The Companys gross profit margin decreased to 58.2% for the year ended December 26, 2004 from 59.0% in 2003 and 61.0% in 2002. The decrease in 2004 from 2003 was due to changes in product mix, primarily decreased sales of BEYBLADE products, which carry a higher gross margin. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by increased sales of VIDEONOW hardware products, which carry a lower gross margin, and decreased margin on VIDEONOW products due to competition and customer sales allowances. The decrease in gross margin from 2002 to 2003 also reflects the mix of products sold, with decreased sales of STAR WARS products in 2003 over 2002, partially offset by increased sales of BEYBLADE products. In addition to the mix of products sold, the decrease from 2002 gross margin levels also reflects 2003 charges incurred by the Company to cease manufacturing operations in Spain, comprised primarily of severance costs as well as non cash charges associated with fixed assets. The production activities previously performed in Spain were transferred to the Companys other manufacturing facilities or outsourced to third party suppliers. The Company aggressively monitors its levels of inventory, attempting to avoid unnecessary expenditures of cash and potential charges related to obsolescence. The Companys failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand could result in overproduction of less popular items, which could result in higher obsolescence costs, causing a reduction in gross profit. The Company expects a positive impact to gross margin in 2005 due to increased product revenue in connection with the anticipated release of STAR WARS EPISODE III: REVENGE OF THE SITH. However, the Company also expects increased revenues from this line to result in increased royalty and amortization expense. 29 Expenses The Companys operating expenses, stated as percentages of net revenues, are illustrated below for the three fiscal years ended December 26, 2004. 2004 2003 2002 Amortization 2.4 % 2.4 % 3.4 % Royalties 7.4 7.9 10.5 Research and product development 5.2 4.6 5.5 Advertising 12.9 11.6 10.5 Selling, distribution and administration 20.5 21.5 23.3 Amortization decreased to $70,562 in 2004 from $76,053 in 2003 and $94,576 in 2002. The decrease in amortization expense from 2003 primarily relates to 2003 charges related to certain unprofitable product lines. The decrease from 2002 to 2003 is primarily related to decreased amortization of the property rights related to STAR WARS. Amortization of these rights is based on actual sales of products under the related right as a portion of total expected sales of products related to this licensing right. The Company expects amortization expense to be higher in 2005 due to the increased product revenue anticipated in connection with the anticipated release of STAR WARS EPISODE III: REVENGE OF THE SITH. Royalty expense decreased to $223,193, or 7.4% of net revenues in 2004 from $248,423, or 7.9% of net revenues in 2003 and $296,152, or 10.5% of net revenues in 2002. Lower royalty expense in 2004 compared to 2003 is primarily due to the decreased sales of BEYBLADE products. The 2004 expense also includes a $7,200 charge related to future minimum guarantees not expected to be fully realized related to the Disney license agreement based on the Companys reduced expectations for the related product line. The decrease in royalty expense from 2002 to 2003 primarily relates to lower sales of STAR WARS related products, as there was no theatrical, video, or DVD release of a STAR WARS property in 2003. The decrease in royalty expense in 2003 as a result of STAR WARS was partially offset by increased royalty expense related to BEYBLADE products and the foreign exchange impact of the weaker U.S. dollar. The Company expects royalty expense to increase in 2005 compared to 2004, due to the release of STAR WARS EPISODE III: REVENGE OF THE SITH. Investment in research and product development costs is an important component to the Companys strategy to grow core brands and to create new and innovative toy and game products. The increase in expenditures for research and product development from $143,183, or 4.6% of net revenues in 2003 to $157,162, or 5.2% of net revenues in 2004 reflects such investment. Higher development costs associated with electronic toys such as VIDEONOW COLOR and electronic games such as MISSION PAINT BALL, plug and play, and DVD games contributed to this increased expense in 2004. The decrease in research and product development expenditures from $153,775, or 5.5% of net revenues in 2002 to 2003 levels was primarily due to the timing of expenses related to development of certain product lines. Advertising expense has increased in dollars and as a percentage of net revenues to $387,523, or 12.9% of net revenues in 2004 from $363,876, or 11.6% of net revenues in 2003, and from $296,549, or 10.5% of net revenues in 2002. This increase is consistent with the Companys strategy to continue to focus on advertising as a means to increase and sustain awareness of its core brands, as well as to introduce new products. Based on higher anticipated product revenues related to the theatrical release of STAR WARS EPISODE III: REVENGE OF THE SITH, the Company expects 2005 expense to decrease slightly as a percentage of revenues. 30  Selling, distribution and administration expenses decreased in dollars and as a percentage of net revenues to $614,401, or 20.5% of net revenues in 2004, from $674,544, or 21.5% of net revenues in 2003. The decrease from 2003 reflects lower expenses resulting from the Companys cost reduction and business efficiency initiatives, and lower levels of performance incentive bonus provisions relating to lower revenues and operating earnings compared to 2003. There was an increase in selling, distribution and administration expenses in dollars from $656,725 in 2002 to 2003, but a decrease as a percentage of net revenues from 23.3% of net revenues in 2002 to 21.5% of net revenues in 2003. The increase in dollars over 2002 partially reflects charges relating to the Companys closure of its remaining retail stores operated under the Wizards of the Coast and Game Keeper names. The increased expenses in 2003 were also the result of higher distribution expenses due to increased sales volume and increased management bonus provisions as the result of the Companys improved financial performance over 2002. In both 2003 and 2004, the impact to consolidated expenses of the Companys cost reduction efforts to improve business efficiency were negatively affected by higher international expenses in translated U.S. dollars resulting from the weaker U.S. dollar. The Company is continuing its focus on reducing selling, distribution and administration expenses, and anticipates that these costs as a percentage of net revenues will continue to decline in 2005. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased to $31,698 in 2004 from $52,462 in 2003, and $77,499 in 2002. This mainly reflects the Companys strategy to reduce its long term debt. Approximately 72% of the decrease in interest expense from 2003 to 2004 is attributable to lower levels of short term and long term debt in 2004 than in 2003. The Company repurchased and repaid approximately $55,700 in principal amount of long term debt during the year ended December 26, 2004. Approximately 52% of the decrease in 2003 as compared to 2002 is attributable to lower levels of short term and long term debt. This mainly reflects the repurchase and repayment of debt in the first quarter of 2003 when the Company repurchased or repaid $200,288, in principal amount, of 7.95% Notes, due in March 2003, using cash from operations. In the fourth quarter of 2003, as noted above, the Company repurchased $167,257 in principal amount of 8.50% Notes due 2006, in conjunction with a tender offer. The remaining 28% decrease in interest expense from 2003 to 2004 and 48% decrease from 2002 to 2003 is due to lower effective interest rates, primarily the result of interest rate swap agreements that reduce the amount of the Companys debt subject to fixed interest rates. It is the Companys intent to continue to assess the desirability of using available cash from operations to reduce its outstanding long term debt, as market conditions and the Companys committed revolving credit agreement and other sources of financing allow. Other Expense, Net Other expense, net of $1,226 for the year ended December 26, 2004 compares to other expense, net of $48,090 in 2003. Other expense, net in 2004 includes non cash income of $12,710 compared to a non cash charge to earnings of $13,630 in 2003, related to the change in the fair value of certain warrants required to be classified as a liability. These warrants are required to be adjusted to their fair value each quarter through earnings. The fair value of these warrants is primarily affected by the Companys stock price, but is also affected by the Companys stock price volatility and dividends, as well as risk free interest rates. Assuming the Companys stock volatility and dividend payments, as well as risk free interest rates remain constant, the fair value of the warrants would increase and the Company would recognize a charge to earnings as the price of the Companys stock increases. If the price of the Companys stock decreases and the Companys stock volatility, dividend payments, and the risk free interest rates remain constant, the fair value of 31 the warrants will decrease and the Company will recognize income. Based on a hypothetical increase in the Companys stock price to $20.00 per share at December 26, 2004 from its actual price of $19.19 a share on that date, the Company would have recognized non cash income of approximately $11,100 rather than actual non cash income recorded of $12,710 for the year ended December 26, 2004, to reflect the change in the fair value of the warrants from their fair value of $138,650 at December 28, 2003. Other expense, net in 2004 also includes a $8,988 write down of the value of the common stock of Infogrames, held by the Company as an available for sale investment. This write down resulted from an other than temporary decline in the fair value of this investment. At December 26, 2004 the carrying value of this investment is approximately $4,600. Other expense, net in 2003 includes a loss on extinguishment of debt of $20,342 relating to the 8.50% Notes due 2006, repurchased pursuant to a tender offer in the fourth quarter of 2003. Under the tender offer, the Company repurchased notes totaling $167,257 in aggregate principal amount. Nonoperating expense for 2002 includes a $42,902 write down of the value of the common stock of Infogrames. This charge was partially offset by interest income of $10,211 on a tax settlement received in the second quarter of 2002. Income Taxes Income tax expense was 24.6% of pretax earnings in 2004 compared with 28.3% of pretax earnings in 2003 and 27.9% in 2002. Absent the effect of the adjustment of certain warrants to their fair value, which has no tax effect, the 2004 and 2003 effective tax rates would have been 25.9% and 26.8%, respectively. The decrease in the adjusted rate, from 26.8% to 25.9%, is primarily due to the tax impact of higher operating profits in jurisdictions with lower statutory tax rates, and lower operating profits in jurisdictions with higher statutory tax rates. Absent the effect of the non deductible amounts paid to the OFT in 2002, the 2002 tax rate would have been 26.0%. Cumulative Effect of Accounting Changes On June 30, 2003, the first day of the third quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Liabilities and Equity" ("SFAS 150"). SFAS 150 required the Company to reclassify certain warrants recorded as equity to a liability, and adjust the warrants to their fair value through earnings as of that date. On the date of adoption, the Company reclassified $107,669 from equity, where the warrants had previously been recorded, to current liabilities. A cumulative effect of accounting change of $17,351 was recorded to adjust the amount of this liability to its fair value on the adoption date. There was no tax benefit associated with this charge. On December 31, 2001, the first day of fiscal 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS 142"). SFAS 142 required the Company, within six months of the date of adoption, to perform an assessment of whether there was an indication that goodwill was impaired as of the date of adoption. This initial assessment was completed during the second quarter of 2002. As part of this assessment, the Company allocated goodwill and other corporate assets and liabilities to its various reporting units. It then compared the carrying values of its reporting units to the fair values of those reporting units. The fair values of the reporting units were calculated using an income approach, which looks to the present value of expected future cash flows. These values were compared in total with the fair value of the business based on market capitalization at the date of testing. Based on the result of this assessment, the Company recorded a one time transitional charge of $245,732, net of related tax impact of $50,491, resulting from the impairment of goodwill relating to the U.S. Toys reporting unit primarily as the result of the change in goodwill impairment criteria from an 32 undiscounted to a discounted cash flow method. This transitional charge was recorded as a cumulative effect of an accounting change and, in accordance with the statement, recorded retroactively to the first quarter of 2002. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company has historically generated a significant amount of cash from operations. In 2004, the Company funded its operations and liquidity needs primarily through cash flows from operations, and, when needed, proceeds from its accounts receivable securitization program and borrowings under its secured and unsecured credit facilities. During 2005, the Company expects to continue to fund its working capital needs primarily through operations and, when needed, using proceeds from the accounts receivable securitization program and borrowings under its available lines of credit. The Company believes that the funds available to it, including cash expected to be generated from operations and funds available through its securitization program and other available lines of credit, are adequate to meet its needs for 2005. However, unforeseen circumstances in the toy or game industry, such as softness in the retail environment or unanticipated changes in consumer preferences, could result in a significant decline in revenues and operating results for the Company, which could result in the Company being in non compliance with its debt covenants and unable to use funding from its receivable securitization program. Non compliance with its debt covenants could result in the Company being unable to utilize borrowings under its revolving credit facility and other bank lines, a circumstance which potentially could occur when operating shortfalls would most require supplementary borrowings to enable the Company to continue to fund its operations. Also, non compliance with covenants under its accounts receivable securitization program could result in the Company being unable to utilize this program. In addition, a significant deterioration in the business of a major U.S. customer could result in a decrease in eligible accounts receivable that would prevent the Company from being able to fully utilize its receivable securitization program. During the last four fiscal years, as part of its strategy of reducing long term debt and its overall debt to capitalization ratio, the Company has been able to repurchase or repay approximately $547,000 in principal amount of long term debt, primarily using cash from operations. Remaining principal amounts of long term debt at December 26, 2004, including portions classified as current, were $622,198. The Company believes that the reduction in its debt to capitalization ratio has improved its liquidity situation by decreasing cash required to service outstanding debt, thereby increasing the ability of the Company to obtain additional financing should the need to do so arise. At December 26, 2004, cash and cash equivalents, net of short term borrowings, were $707,043 compared to $497,393 and $474,321 at December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002, respectively. Hasbro generated approximately $359,000, $454,000 and $473,000 of cash from its operating activities in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Although net earnings before cumulative effect of accounting change increased to $195,977 in 2004 from $175,015 in 2003, the decrease in cash from operations in 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily the result of changes in operating assets and liabilities, further discussed below. The decrease in cash flows, despite an increase in earnings before cumulative effect of an accounting change, in 2003 from 2002 was primarily the result of non cash expenditures in 2002, including utilization of prepaid expenses related to STAR WARS royalties, and increased amortization expense in 2002, primarily STAR WARS related. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2002 also included a $120,000 royalty advance payment, which was recorded as a long term asset. Cash flows from operations were favorably impacted by the Companys cost reduction initiatives in 2004, 2003, and 2002, resulting in a lower level of fixed operating expenses. Fourth quarter days sales outstanding remained consistent at 50 days in 2004 compared to 49 days in 2003 and 50 days in 2002. In 2003, the Company entered into a revolving securitization 33 facility whereby the Company is able to sell undivided interests in qualifying accounts receivable on an ongoing basis. At December 26, 2004 and December 28, 2003, there was $206,055 and $193,713, respectively, outstanding under this program. The securitization facility replaced other programs the Company routinely used to accelerate payment of trade receivables in prior years. The December 26, 2004 accounts receivable balance includes an increase of approximately $20,000 related to the currency impact of the weaker U.S. dollar. Inventories increased to $194,780 at December 26, 2004 from $168,979 at December 28, 2003. The increase in inventory reflects lower than normal inventory levels in 2003 and, to a lesser extent, the currency impact of the weaker U.S. dollar. The net decrease in inventory levels in 2003 compared to 2002 reflects the Companys continued focus on supply chain management and its continued aggressive management of cash flow requirements. Inventory levels at year end 2003 were at their lowest point since 1990. Inventory decreased to $168,979 at December 28, 2003 from $190,144 at December 29, 2002. Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased slightly to $219,735 from $211,981 at December 28, 2003. An increase in current prepaid royalties as a result of the 2005 release of STAR WARS EPISODE III: REVENGE OF THE SITH was partially offset by decreased deferred taxes. Generally, when the Company enters into a licensing agreement for entertainment based properties, an advance royalty payment is required at the inception of the agreement. This payment is then recognized in the consolidated statement of operations as the related sales are made. With respect to the STAR WARS license, the Company has prepaid royalties recorded in both current and non current assets. In periods prior to a major release, amounts will be reclassified from non current to current in anticipation of higher sales during the periods surrounding the release. The increase in prepaid expenses to $211,981 at December 28, 2003 from $190,964 at December 29, 2002 was primarily the result of increased deferred and other taxes as well as deposits, which were partially offset by lower prepaid royalties from 2002 related to the STAR WARS license. Accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased to $806,528 at December 26, 2004 from $905,368 at December 28, 2003. The decrease primarily relates to decreases in accrued bonuses and performance incentives as well as a decrease in accrued income taxes. To a lesser extent, this decrease was also due to a decrease in the value of certain warrants that the Company is required to record as liabilities under SFAS 150. As a result of SFAS 150, the Company classifies certain warrants containing a put option as a current liability and adjusts the amount of this liability to its fair value on a periodic basis. Additionally, the Company had decreased accruals in 2004 relating to the 2003 announced closure of the Companys retail locations. Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased to $905,368 at December 28, 2003 from $743,958 at December 29, 2002. Of the 2003 increase, $138,650 was due to the Companys adoption of SFAS 150. The remaining increase was due primarily to higher levels of accrued performance bonuses as the result of the Companys improved financial performance in 2003 as well as accrued expenses related to the cessation of manufacturing operations at the Companys facility in Spain and the disposition of its remaining Wizards of the Coast and Gamekeeper retail stores. These increases were partially offset by lower accrued royalties as a result of decreased sales of licensed products. Cash flows from investing activities were a net utilization of $84,967, $64,879, and $62,314 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. During 2004, the Company expended approximately $79,000 on additions to its property, plant and equipment while during 2003 and 2002 it expended approximately $63,000 and $59,000, respectively. Of these amounts, 58% in 2004, 66% in 2003, and 64% in 2002 were for purchases of tools, dies and molds related to the Companys products. The level of capital spending in 2004, 2003 and 2002 was below the level permitted under its outstanding credit facilities. In 2005, the Company expects capital expenditures to continue to be in the range of $70,000 to $90,000. During the three years ended December 26, 2004, depreciation 34 and amortization of plant and equipment was $75,618, $88,070, and $89,262, respectively. In 2004, the Company acquired the remaining unowned interest in its Latin America operations for total consideration of $9,824. This purchase resulted in an increase in goodwill in the amount of $9,390. The Company made no acquisitions of businesses in 2003 or 2002. In 2002, the Company made payments of $7,419 relating to the acquisition of Wizards of the Coast. The Company commits to inventory production, advertising and marketing expenditures prior to the peak third and fourth quarter retail selling season. Accounts receivable increase during the third and fourth quarter as customers increase their purchases to meet expected consumer demand in the holiday season. Due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling period, payments for these accounts receivable are generally not due until the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the subsequent year. This timing difference between expenses paid and revenues collected made it necessary for the Company to borrow varying amounts during the year. During 2004, the Company primarily utilized cash from operations and its trade accounts receivable securitization program. During 2003 and 2002, the Company primarily utilized cash from operations and borrowings under its secured amended and restated revolving credit agreement to meet its cash flow requirements. In December 2003, the Company entered into a three year receivable securitization program. Under this program, the Company sells on an ongoing basis, substantially all of its U.S. trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, Hasbro Receivables Funding, LLC ("HRF"). HRF is consolidated with the Company for financial reporting purposes. The securitization program then allows HRF to sell, on a revolving basis, an undivided interest of up to $250,000 in the eligible receivables it holds to certain bank conduits. The program provides the Company with a cost effective source of working capital and short term financing. Based on the amount of eligible accounts receivable as of December 26, 2004, the Company had availability under this program to sell $206,055, which was fully utilized. The Company has an amended and restated credit agreement, which provides it with an unsecured revolving credit facility of $350,000, maturing in March 2007. The credit facility reduces by $50,000 effective March 31, 2005, and by a further $50,000 effective November 30, 2005. If the Company fails to maintain certain financial ratios or if the credit rating of the Company drops below BB at Fitch Ratings or Standard & Poors, or Ba3 at Moodys, borrowings under the amended and restated facility would be secured by substantially all domestic inventory as well as certain intangible assets. At February 1, 2005, the Company was rated BBB by Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poors, and Baa3 by Moodys. The Company is not required to maintain compensating balances under the agreement. The amended and restated agreement contains certain restrictive covenants setting forth minimum cash flow and coverage requirements, and a number of other limitations, including with respect to capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividend payments. The Company was in compliance with all restrictive covenants as of and for the fiscal year ended December 26, 2004. The Company had no borrowings outstanding under its committed revolving credit facility at December 26, 2004. The Company also has other uncommitted lines from various banks, of which approximately $25,562 was utilized at December 26, 2004. Amounts available and unused under the committed line at December 26, 2004 were approximately $344,000. Net cash utilized by financing activities was $75,824 in 2004. This amount included repurchases in principal amount of long term debt totaling $55,658 in connection with the Companys strategy of reducing its overall debt and improving its debt to capitalization ratio. The Company received $25,836 from the exercise of stock options during the year. In December 2003, the Company increased its quarterly dividend to $0.06 per share from $0.03 per share. This increased cash paid for dividends to $37,088 from the 2003 amount of $20,851. 35 Net cash utilized by financing activities was $373,307 in 2003. This was primarily the result of the Companys use of cash flows from operations to repurchase or repay $200,288 in principal amount of 7.95% Notes in March 2003. In addition, the Company repurchased $167,257 in principal amount of 8.50% Notes due 2006 in the fourth quarter of 2003 at a total cost of $188,991. Also in 2003, as the result of the increase in the Companys stock price during the year, the Company received $39,892 in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options. The Company also paid $3,378 to repurchase shares issued upon the exercise of certain warrants as well as to terminate a warrant agreement. Net cash utilized by financing activities was $159,337 in 2002. This was primarily the result of the Companys use of cash flows from operations to repurchase $124,585 and $2,385 in principal amount of 7.95% Notes due in March 2003 and 5.60% Notes due in 2005, respectively. The Company has outstanding $250,000 in principal amount of senior convertible debentures due 2021. The senior convertible debentures bear interest at 2.75%, which could be subject to an upward adjustment in the rate, not to exceed 11%, commencing in December 2005 should the price of the Companys stock trade at or below $9.72 per share for 20 of 30 trading days preceding the fifth day prior to an interest payment date. This contingent interest feature represents a derivative instrument that is recorded on the balance sheet at its fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in the statement of operations. If the closing price of the Companys stock exceeds $23.76 for at least 20 trading days, within the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the calendar quarter, or upon other specified events, the debentures will be convertible at an initial conversion price of $21.60 in the next calendar quarter. This contingent conversion feature was not met in 2004. The holders of these debentures may put the notes back to Hasbro in December 2005, December 2011 and December 2016 at the original principal amount. At that time, the purchase price may be paid in cash, shares of common stock or a combination of the two, at the Companys discretion. While the Companys current intent is to settle in cash any puts exercised, there can be no guarantee that the Company will have the funds necessary to settle this obligation in cash. Due to this put option, these debentures are classified on the Companys balance sheet in the current portion of long term debt. Subsequent to December 1, 2005, any notes that the holders have not elected to put back to the Company will be reclassified to long term debt. The Company has remaining principal amounts of long term debt, including current portions, at December 26, 2004 of approximately $622,198. As detailed below in Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments, this debt is due at varying times from 2005 through 2028. Of the total principal amount, the Company has $71,970 of 5.60% Notes due in November 2005. In addition, the Company is committed to guaranteed royalty and other contractual payments of approximately $154,100. Also, as detailed in Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments, the Company has certain warrants, currently recorded in accrued liabilities, that may be settleable for, at the Companys option, $100,000 in cash or $110,000 in the Companys stock, such stock being valued at the time of the exercise of the option. The Company believes that cash from operations, including the securitization facility, and, if necessary, its line of credit, will allow the Company to meet these and other obligations listed. It is the Companys current strategy to reduce its long term debt through repurchases when it is considered economically beneficial and permitted under the Companys amended and restated revolving credit agreement. On December 6, 1999, the Board of Directors (the "Board") authorized a common stock repurchase program up to $500,000. At December 26, 2004, $204,500 remains available under the 1999 authorization. Shares acquired under the Board authorization are being used for corporate purposes including issuance upon the exercise of stock options and warrants. Under terms of the Companys amended and restated revolving credit agreement, payment of dividends cannot be in excess of $50,000 or 50% of prior year consolidated net income, which ever is greater. Also, 36 repurchases of debt prior to maturity, common stock repurchases, investments and acquisitions may be restricted under certain circumstances. Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As such, management is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented. The significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the Companys reported financial results include sales allowances, inventory valuation, recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets, recoverability of royalty advances and commitments and pensions. Sales allowances for customer promotions, discounts and returns are recorded as a reduction of revenue when the related revenue is recognized. Revenue from product sales is recognized upon passing of title to the customer, generally at the time of shipment. Revenue from product sales, less related sales allowances, is added to royalty revenue and reflected as net revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company routinely commits to promotional sales allowance programs with customers. These allowances primarily relate to fixed programs, which the customer earns based on purchases of Company products during the year. Discounts are recorded as a reduction of related revenue at the time of sale. While many of the allowances are based on fixed amounts, certain of the allowances, such as the returns allowance, are based on market data, historical trends and information from customers and are therefore subject to estimation. Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market. Based upon a consideration of quantities on hand, actual and projected sales volume, anticipated product selling prices and product lines planned to be discontinued, slow moving and obsolete inventory is written down to its net realizable value. Failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand could result in the Company under producing popular items or overproducing less popular items. Management estimates are monitored on a quarterly basis and a further adjustment to reduce inventory to its net realizable value is recorded, as an increase to cost of sales, when deemed necessary under the lower of cost or market standard. Goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually. If an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, the Company will perform an interim test at that time. The impairment test begins by allocating goodwill and intangible assets to applicable reporting units. Goodwill is then tested using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach, which looks to the present value of expected future cash flows. The first step is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an indication from the first step that one exists. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value which is also calculated using an income approach. The Companys annual impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter of 2004 and no impairment was indicated. The estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge. The estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate. The use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge. At December 26, 2004, the Company has goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives of $545,464 recorded on the balance sheet. 37  Intangible assets, other than those with indefinite lives, are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Recoverability of the value of these intangible assets is measured by a comparison of the assets carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets were considered to be impaired, the impairment would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value based on estimated future discounted cash flows. The estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge. The estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate. The use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge. Intangible assets covered under this policy were $558,019 at December 26, 2004. During 2004, there were no significant impairment charges related to these intangible assets. The recoverability of royalty advances and contractual obligations with respect to minimum guaranteed royalties is assessed by comparing the remaining minimum guaranty to the estimated future sales forecasts and related cash flow projections to be derived from the related product. If sales forecasts and related cash flows from the particular product do not support the recoverability of the remaining minimum guaranty or, if the Company decides to discontinue a product line with royalty advances or commitments, a charge to royalty expense to write off the remaining minimum guaranty is required. The preparation of revenue forecasts and related cash flows for these products requires judgments and estimates. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in the assessment of anticipated revenues and cash flows related to these products could result in a change to the assessment of recoverability of remaining minimum guaranteed royalties. At December 26, 2004, the Company had $167,355 of prepaid royalties, $80,167 of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $87,188 which are included in other assets. During 2004, royalty expense included a charge related to the Companys license agreement with Disney related to this accounting policy. The Company, except for certain international subsidiaries, has pension plans covering substantially all of its full time employees. Pension expense is based on actuarial computations of current and future benefits using estimates for expected return on assets, expected compensation increases, and applicable discount rates. The Company estimates expected return on assets using a weighted average rate based on historical market data for the investment classes of assets held by the plan, the allocation of plan assets among those investment classes, and the current economic environment. Based on this information, the Companys estimate of expected return on plan assets was 8.75% in 2004 and 2003, and 9.00% in 2002. A decrease in the estimate used for expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense, while an increase in this estimate would decrease pension expense. A decrease of 1% in the estimate of expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense by approximately $1,700. Expected compensation increases are estimated using a combination of historical compensation increases with expected compensation increases in the Companys long term business forecasts. Based on this analysis, the Companys estimate of expected long term compensation increases was 4.0% in 2004 and 2003, and 4.5% in 2002. Increases in estimated compensation increases would result in higher pension expense while decreases would lower pension expense. Discount rates are selected based upon rates of return on high quality fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits. The Company considers Moodys long term Aa Corporate Bond yield at the measurement date as an appropriate guide in setting this rate. Based on the Moodys long term Corporate Bond yield at September 30, 2004, the Companys measurement date for its pension assets and liabilities, the Company selected a discount rate of 38 6%. A decrease in the discount rate would result in greater pension expense while an increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense. A decrease of 1% in the Companys discount rate would increase pension expense and the projected benefit obligation by approximately $3,180 and $34,300, respectively. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions", actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and, if outside a certain corridor, amortized over future periods and, therefore generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. Assets in the plan are valued on the basis of their fair market value on the measurement date. In 2004 and 2003, the Company recorded a minimum pension liability of $43,196 and $42,445, respectively. This amount represents the amount by which the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the sum of the fair market value of plan assets and accrued amounts previously recorded. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments In the normal course of its business, the Company enters into contracts related to obtaining rights to produce product under license, which may require the payment of minimum guarantees, as well as contracts related to the leasing of facilities and equipment. In addition, the Company has $622,198 of long term debt outstanding at December 26, 2004, including current portions and excluding fair value adjustments. Future payments required under these and other obligations are as follows: Payments due by Fiscal Year Certain Contractual Obligations 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Total Long term debt, including current portions $ 73,481 34,362 1,686 136,851 1,833 373,985 622,198 Operating lease commitments 27,175 19,810 17,740 16,096 14,755 27,877 123,453 Future minimum guaranteed contractual payments 107,000 21,600 10,200 7,600 5,600 2,100 154,100 Purchase commitments 114,000 114,000 $ 321,656 75,772 29,626 160,547 22,188 403,962 1,013,751 Included in 2005 future minimum guaranteed contractual payments is $35,000 related to the Companys royalty contract with Lucas for STAR WARS licensing rights. The contract requires guaranteed royalties totaling $505,000 of which $470,000 has been paid in prior years. At December 26, 2004, the Company has prepaid royalties related to this license of approximately $143,200, of which the long term portion of $87,200 is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. The Company also has remaining product rights of approximately $114,400, which is included in other intangibles, net in the consolidated balance sheet. These amounts are expected to be recovered from anticipated revenues related to the STAR WARS brand in the years 2005 through 2018. Included in the thereafter column above is $250,000 in principal amount of senior convertible debt due 2021. The holders of these debentures may put the notes back to the Company in December 2005, December 2011, and December 2016 at the principal amount. At that time, the purchase price may be paid in cash, shares of common stock or a combination of the two. The Companys current intent is to settle in cash any puts exercised. Certain of the future minimum guaranteed contractual royalty payments are contingent upon the theatrical release of the related entertainment property. 39 In addition to the above, the Company has certain warrants outstanding at December 26, 2004 that contain a put option that would require the Company to repurchase the warrants for a price to be paid, at the Companys election, of either $100,000 in cash or $110,000 in shares of the Companys common stock, such stock being valued at the time of the exercise of the option. The Companys current intent is to settle this put option in cash if exercised. In accordance with SFAS 150, these warrants are recorded as an accrued liability at fair value at December 26, 2004. In addition, the Company expects to make contributions totaling approximately $13,000 to its pension plans in 2005. The Company also has letters of credit of approximately $13,300 at December 26, 2004. Financial Risk Management The Company is exposed to market risks attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as the result of sourcing products priced in U.S. dollars, Hong Kong dollars and Euros while marketing those products in more than twenty currencies. Results of operations may be affected primarily by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso and, to a lesser extent, currencies in Latin American and Asia Pacific countries. To manage this exposure, the Company has hedged a portion of its estimated foreign currency transactions using forward foreign exchange contracts, and purchased foreign currency options. The Company estimates that a hypothetical immediate 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies could result in an approximate $9,800 decrease in the fair value of these instruments. The Company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or short term borrowing positions in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company believes, however, that the on going risk on the net exposure should not be material to its financial condition. In addition, the Companys revenues and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency rates. From time to time, affiliates of the Company may make or receive intercompany loans in currencies other than their functional currency. The Company manages this exposure at the time the loan is made by using foreign exchange contracts. Other than as set forth above, the Company does not hedge foreign currency exposures. The Company reflects all derivatives at their fair value as an asset or liability on the balance sheet. The Company does not speculate in foreign currency exchange contracts. At December 26, 2004, the Company had fixed rate long term debt, including current portions and excluding fair value adjustments, of $622,198. At December 26, 2004, the Company had fixed for floating interest rate swaps with notional amounts of $150,000. The interest rate swaps are designed to adjust the amount of the Companys debt subject to a fixed interest rate. The interest rate swaps are matched with specific long term debt issues and are designated and effective as hedges of the change in the fair value of the associated debt. Changes in fair value of these contracts are wholly offset in earnings by changes in the fair value of long term debt. At December 26, 2004, these contracts had a fair value of $4,624, with $3,981 included in other assets, and the other $643 included in prepaid expenses and other current assets, with corresponding fair value adjustments to increase long term debt and current portions of long term debt, respectively. Changes in interest rates affect the fair value of fixed rate debt not hedged by interest rate swap agreements while affecting the earnings and cash flows of the long term debt hedged by the interest rate swaps. The Company estimates that a hypothetical one percentage point decrease or increase in interest rates would increase or decrease the fair value of this long term debt by approximately $56,900 or $37,300, respectively. A hypothetical one percentage point change in interest rates would increase or decrease 2005 pretax earnings and cash flows by $1,180 and $751, respectively. 40 The Economy and Inflation The Company continued to experience difficult economic environments in some parts of the world during 2004. The principal market for the Companys products is the retail sector. Revenues from the Companys top 5 customers, all retailers, accounted for approximately 50% of its consolidated net revenues in 2004, and 52% of its consolidated net revenues in 2003 and 2002. In the past two years certain customers in the retail sector have experienced economic difficulty. The Company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems appropriate. The Companys revenue pattern continues to show the second half of the year, and within that half, the fourth quarter, to be more significant to its overall business for the full year. The Company expects that this concentration will continue, particularly as more of its business shifts to larger customers with order patterns concentrated in the second half of the year. The concentration of sales in the second half of the year and, specifically, the fourth quarter increases the risk of (a) underproduction of popular items, (b) overproduction of less popular items, and (c) failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules. The business of the Company is characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences in the degree of consumer acceptance of a product line, product availability, marketing strategies, inventory levels, policies of retailers and differences in overall economic conditions. The trend of larger retailers has been to maintain lower inventories throughout the year and purchase a greater percentage of product within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer selling season, which includes Christmas. Quick response inventory management practices now being used result in more orders being placed for immediate delivery and fewer orders being placed well in advance of shipment. To the extent that retailers do not sell as much of their year end inventory purchases during this holiday selling season as they had anticipated, their demand for additional product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed, thus negatively impacting the Companys revenues. In addition, the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the Companys significant retailers could negatively impact the Companys future revenues. The effect of inflation on the Companys operations during 2004 was not significant and the Company will continue its policy of monitoring costs and adjusting prices, accordingly. Other Information Hasbro uses the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock options granted to employees. As required by the Companys existing stock plans, stock options are granted at, or above, the fair market value of the Companys stock, and, accordingly, no compensation expense is recognized for these grants in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company records compensation expense related to other stock based awards, such as restricted stock grants, over the period the award vests, typically three years. On December 16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share Based Payment" ("SFAS No. 123(R)"), which amends SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation" and SFAS 95 "Statement of Cash Flows". SFAS No. 123(R) requires companies to measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in its consolidated financial statements. In addition, the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) requires additional accounting and disclosure related to the income tax and cash flow effects resulting from share based payment arrangements. SFAS No. 123(R) is effective for the Company as of June 27, 2005, the first day of the 2005 fiscal third quarter. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that SFAS 123 (R) will have on its financial position and results of operations. 41 On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "Act") was signed into law. The Act creates a one time incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate undistributed earnings from their international subsidiaries by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain international earnings. The deduction is available to corporations during the tax year that includes October 22, 2004 or in the immediately subsequent tax year. The Company is in the process of evaluating whether it will repatriate international earnings under the provisions of the Act. The Company expects to complete its evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision within a reasonable period of time following the issuance of additional clarifying language or statutory technical corrections on key elements of the legislation. The range of possible amounts the Company is considering for repatriation under this provision is between zero and $500,000. The related potential range of income tax under the law as currently written is between zero and $70,000. The Company is not aware of any material amounts of potential exposure relating to environmental matters and does not believe its environmental compliance costs or liabilities to be material to its operating results or financial position.
