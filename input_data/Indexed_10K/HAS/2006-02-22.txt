Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company included elsewhere in this document. This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward looking statements concerning the Companys expectations and beliefs. See Item 1A Forward Looking Information and Risk Factors That May Affect Future Results for a discussion of other uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements. (Thousands of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share Data) Executive Summary The Company earns revenue and generates cash through the sale of a variety of toy and game products. The Company sells these products both within the United States and in a number of international markets. While many of the Companys products are based on brands the Company owns or controls, the Company also offers products which are licensed from outside inventors. The Company also licenses rights to produce products based on movie, television, music and other family entertainment properties, such as STAR WARS. For the past several years, the Company has focused on growing core owned and controlled brands, developing new and innovative products which respond to market insights, and optimizing efficiencies within the Company to reduce costs, increase operating profits and strengthen its balance sheet. While the Company has sought to achieve a more sustainable revenue base by developing and maintaining its core brands and avoiding reliance on licensed entertainment properties, the Company continues to opportunistically enter into or leverage existing strategic licenses which complement its brands and leverage its key strengths. The Companys core brands represent Company owned or Company controlled brands, such as G.I. JOE, TRANSFORMERS, MY LITTLE PONY, MONOPOLY, MAGIC: THE GATHERING, PLAYSKOOL and TONKA, which the Company views as presenting potential to be successful over the long term. The Company has a large portfolio of owned and controlled brands, which can be introduced in new formats and platforms over time. These brands may also be further extended by pairing a licensed concept with a core brand. By focusing on core brands, the Company is working to build a more consistent revenue stream and basis for future growth. However, the volatility of consumer preferences and the high level of competition in the toy and game industry make it challenging to maintain the long term success of existing product lines and to consistently introduce successful new products. In addition to its focus on core brands, the Companys strategy also involves trying to meet ever changing consumer preferences by identifying and offering innovative products based on market opportunities and insights. In 2005, the Companys position as a leader in developing innovative electronic products for children was reinforced with the introduction of products such as I DOG, VIDEONOW XP, ZOOMBOX and the reintroduction of an enhanced, interactive FURBY. The Company believes its strategy of focusing on the development of its core brands and continuing to identify innovative new products will help to prevent the Company from being dependent on the success of any one product line. With the theatrical release of Lucasfilms STAR WARS EPISODE III: REVENGE OF THE SITH in May 2005, and the subsequent holiday season DVD release, sales of product related to the Companys strategic STAR WARS license rose substantially in 2005. Aggregate net revenues from products associated with this license were approximately $494,000 in 2005 and accounted for 16% of consolidated net revenues. Pairing this key licensed property with the Companys ability to design and produce action figures, role playing toys, and games, as well as the ability to launch an integrated marketing campaign to promote the product globally, was the key to this lines success. While the Companys strategy has continued to focus on growing its core brands and developing innovative, new products, the Company will continue to evaluate and enter into arrangements to license properties when the Company believes it is economically attractive. In early 2006, the Company announced it entered into a license with Marvel Entertainment, Inc. and Marvel Characters, Inc. to produce toys and games based on Marvels portfolio of characters. While gross profits of theatrical entertainment based products are generally higher than many of the Companys other products, sales from 22 Table of Contents these products also incur royalty expenses payable to the licensor. Such royalties reduce the impact of these higher gross margins. In certain instances, such as with Lucasfilms STAR WARS, the Company may also incur amortization expense on property right based assets acquired from the licensor of such properties, further impacting profit made on these items. The Companys strategy in the last several years has also involved reducing fixed costs and increasing operating margins. The Company ended 2005 with a strong balance sheet. The Company has achieved its targeted debt to capitalization ratio and will continue making scheduled debt repayments. In 2005, utilizing cash from operations, the Company reacquired the digital gaming rights on several of its core brands which had previously been licensed to a third party, and purchased the assets of Wrebbit Inc., a maker of innovative puzzles, which complement the Companys current product portfolio. The Company will continue to evaluate acquisitions which may complement its current product offerings or allow it entry into an area which is adjacent to and complementary to the toy and game business. As part of its continuous effort to focus on consumer demands, better anticipate the needs of its retail customers, provide a more integrated toy and game marketing plan, place a greater company wide focus on its core brands and thereby improve its overall business, in January 2006 the Company announced that it has simplified and integrated its operating segment structure. The Companys North American toy and games business will be managed under common leadership beginning in 2006, providing a combined focus on developing, marketing, and selling products in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. The International segment will consist of the Companys European, Asia Pacific and Latin American marketing operations. The Companys world wide manufacturing and product sourcing operations will be managed through its Global Operations segment. The Hasbro Properties Group will continue to be responsible for the world wide outlicensing of the Companys intellectual properties and will work closely with the North American and International segments on the development and licensing of the Companys brands. The remainder of this Discussion and Analysis is presented according to the 2005 segment structure under which the Company operated. Summary The relationship between various components of the results of operations, stated as a percent of net revenues, is illustrated below for each of the three fiscal years ended December 25, 2005. 2005 2004 2003 Net revenues 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 41.7 41.8 41.0 Gross profit 58.3 58.2 59.0 Amortization 3.3 2.4 2.4 Royalties 8.0 7.4 7.9 Research and product development 4.9 5.2 4.6 Advertising 11.8 12.9 11.6 Selling, distribution and administration 20.2 20.5 21.5 Operating profit 10.1 9.8 11.0 Interest expense 1.0 1.1 1.7 Other (income) expense, net (1.0 ) 0.0 1.5 Earnings before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change 10.1 8.7 7.8 Income taxes 3.2 2.2 2.2 Net earnings before cumulative effect of accounting change 6.9 6.5 5.6 Cumulative effect of accounting change, net of tax (0.6 ) Net earnings 6.9 % 6.5 % 5.0 % 23 Table of Contents Results of Operations Net earnings for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2005 were $212,075, or $1.09 per diluted share. This compares to net earnings for fiscal 2004 and 2003 of $195,977 and $157,664, or $.96 and $.85 per diluted share, respectively. Net earnings and basic and diluted earnings per share for 2005 include income tax expense of approximately $25,800 related to the Companys repatriation of approximately $547,000 of foreign earnings in the fourth quarter of 2005 pursuant to the special incentive provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Net earnings and basic and diluted earnings per share for 2003 include a cumulative effect of accounting change, net of tax, of $(17,351), or $(.09) per diluted share, relating to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Liabilities and Equity (SFAS 150). Consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 25, 2005 were $3,087,627 compared to $2,997,510 in 2004 and $3,138,657 in 2003. Most of the Companys revenues and operating profits were derived from its three principal segments: U.S. Toys, Games and International, which are discussed in detail below. The following table presents net revenues and operating profit data for the Companys three principal segments for each of the three fiscal years ended December 25, 2005: % % 2005 Change 2004 Change 2003 Net Revenues U.S. Toys $ 1,074,540 13 % $ 952,923 (10 )% $ 1,057,984 Games 730,635 (8 )% 796,032 (1 )% 804,547 International 1,231,761 3 % 1,194,630 1 % 1,184,532 Operating Profit U.S. Toys $ 79,991 1013 % $ 7,185 (92 )% $ 91,996 Games 69,477 (50 )% 137,628 (21 )% 175,295 International 148,135 5 % 140,784 54 % 91,273 U.S. Toys U.S. Toys segment net revenues for the year ended December 25, 2005 increased 13% to $1,074,540 from $952,923 in 2004. This increase is predominantly due to increased revenues from STAR WARS related products as the result of the theatrical and DVD releases of STAR WARS EPISODE III: REVENGE OF THE SITH in 2005. In addition to the increase in STAR WARS related revenues, 2005 U.S. Toys revenues were also positively impacted by the successful reintroduction of LITTLEST PET SHOP and FURBY products as well as increased sales of NERF products. These increases were partially offset by decreased sales of VIDEONOW and FURREAL FRIENDS products as well as the continued decline in BEYBLADE products. In addition, other boys toys products such as G.I. JOE and TRANSFORMERS were negatively impacted by the success of STAR WARS products. U.S. Toys operating profit increased to $79,991 in 2005 from $7,185 in 2004. The increase was due primarily to the increase in revenue. U.S. Toys gross profit was also positively impacted by the change in product mix with increased sales of high margin lines such as STAR WARS and LITTLEST PET SHOP products and decreased sales of VIDEONOW products which carry a lower gross margin. The increase in gross profit was partially offset by increased royalty and amortization expense resulting from increased sales of STAR WARS products. U.S. Toys product development costs decreased as the result of efficiencies gained from its realignment in 2004. This realignment streamlined the U.S. Toys workforce and moved certain product development outside of the U.S. Advertising expense also decreased for U.S. Toys in 2005 primarily 24 Table of Contents due to the high percentage of sales from STAR WARS products, which do not require as much advertising and promotion to raise awareness as an internally developed product would. U.S. Toys segment net revenues for the year ended December 26, 2004 decreased 10% to $952,923 from 2003. The results reflect an overall softness in the boys toy business, as demonstrated primarily by decreased sales of BEYBLADE, and to a lesser extent, lower sales of TRANSFORMERS and G.I. JOE products. Decreased sales of PLAYSKOOL and ZOIDS products also contributed to the overall decrease in revenues. These decreases were partially offset by increased sales of VIDEONOW products, increased shipments of MY LITTLE PONY products, which were reintroduced in the third quarter of 2003, and revenues from the new product launch of LAZER TAG. Net revenues in 2004 were also positively impacted by increased shipments of STAR WARS products over 2003. The decrease in U.S. Toys operating profit to $7,185 in 2004 from 2003, primarily relates to decreased gross profit as a result of the lower net revenues as well as a change in product mix, including the decline in sales of BEYBLADE products which carry a higher gross margin and increased sales of VIDEONOW hardware, which carry a lower gross margin. Competitive price pressures and customer sales allowances related to VIDEONOW also contributed to lower gross margin. Increased advertising expense related to core brands and new product introductions also contributed to the decline in operating profit. U.S. Toys 2004 operating profit was also impacted by charges of $6,900 associated with organizational and staffing changes made in December 2004. The decrease in operating profit was partially offset by decreased royalties, driven by lower sales of BEYBLADE products, as well as lower selling, distribution, and administration expenses as a result of a combination of lower sales activity and the Companys cost reduction initiatives. Games Games segment net revenues for the year ended December 25, 2005 decreased 8% to $730,635 from 2004. The decrease in revenues primarily reflects decreased revenues from trading card games, primarily DUEL MASTERS and MAGIC: THE GATHERING. The decreased revenues also reflect a reduction in board game sales primarily due to lower revenues from TRIVIAL PURSUIT, which had higher revenues in 2004 as a result of the release of TRIVIAL PURSUIT 1990S EDITION. Revenues were positively impacted by STAR WARS revenues, primarily the plug and play LIGHT SABER BATTLE game, as well as increased sales of CANDY LAND products as a result of core brand extensions including CANDY LAND: DORA EDITION and the CANDY LAND DVD game. Games segment operating profit decreased 50% in 2005 to $69,477 from 2004. The decrease in operating profit is primarily due to decreased gross profit due to the decline in revenues and specifically, the decline in trading card games, which have a high gross margin. Games segment operating profit was also negatively impacted by a loss of approximately $23,000 in the electronic games category, which included charges associated with inventory obsolescence and customer allowances related to plug and play games. Games segment net revenues for the year ended December 26, 2004 decreased slightly by 1% to $796,032 from 2003. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to decreased sales of board games. Partially offsetting this decrease were increased revenues from products in the electronic and pre school categories including strong sales of ELEFUN and WHAC A MOLE. Revenues from trading card games increased slightly with sales of DUEL MASTERS, which was introduced in the fourth quarter of 2003 offsetting decreased revenues from other trading card games, including MAGIC: THE GATHERING, which had one less release in 2004 than in 2003. Games segment operating profit decreased 21% to $137,628 in 2004 from 2003. The decrease reflects lower gross margin as a result of a change in the mix of trading card game revenue, higher product development and royalty expenses associated with DVD games, and increased advertising expense. International International segment net revenues for the year ended December 25, 2005 increased by 3% to $1,231,761 from 2004. The increase in revenues was primarily the result of increased sales of STAR WARS products in 25 Table of Contents 2005 and, to a lesser extent, the successful reintroduction of LITTLEST PET SHOP and FURBY products and the introduction of B DAMAN products. These increases were partly offset by decreased sales of BEYBLADE and ACTION MAN products as well as decreased sales of FURREAL FRIENDS and VIDEONOW products. Revenues for board games grew internationally in 2005, while the Company experienced decreased revenues in its trading card games, primarily DUEL MASTERS and MAGIC: THE GATHERING. International net revenues were negatively impacted by currency translation of approximately $700 as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar. International operating profit increased 5% to $148,135 in 2005 from 2004. Increased gross profit as a result of increased revenues was partially offset by higher amortization and royalty expenses as a result of the higher sales of licensed products, primarily STAR WARS products, in 2005. International operating profit was negatively impacted by $2,913 due to the translation of foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar. International segment net revenues increased slightly by 1% to $1,194,630 in 2004 from 2003. International segment 2004 net revenues were positively impacted by currency translation of approximately $78,000 as the result of the weaker U.S. dollar. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign exchange, International net revenues decreased 6% in local currency for the year ended December 26, 2004. The decrease in local currency revenue was primarily the result of lower sales of BEYBLADE products, and, to a lesser extent, decreased sales of ACTION MAN. These decreases were partially offset by increased revenues from MY LITTLE PONY products, which were introduced in the third quarter of 2003, and higher sales of FURREAL FRIENDS, DUEL MASTERS, and VIDEONOW products. To a lesser extent, 2004 revenues were also positively impacted by increased sales of core brand products, including PLAYSKOOL and MONOPOLY products, as well as TRIVIAL PURSUIT products including TRIVIAL PURSUIT 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION. International segment operating profit increased significantly by 54% to $140,784 in 2004 from 2003. International gross profits and operating profits were positively impacted by the cessation of manufacturing at the Companys Valencia, Spain facility at the end of 2003. Operating profit in 2003 included cash charges of approximately $18,400 associated with severance related to this cost reduction initiative. The improvement in operating profit in 2004 over 2003 was also due to lower royalty expense primarily from decreased sales of BEYBLADE, which was partially offset by an increase in advertising expense as a result of the Companys ongoing initiative to raise awareness of its core brands. In 2004, there was a net favorable translation impact to International segment operating profit of approximately $4,800 for the year. Gross Profit The Companys gross profit margin increased slightly to 58.3% for the year ended December 25, 2005 from 58.2% in 2004. This increase was primarily due to increased sales of STAR WARS products, which generally carry a higher gross margin, which is offset by royalty and amortization expense. Gross profit margin in 2005 was also impacted by decreased sales of VIDEONOW products that have lower gross margins. These increases were largely offset by inventory obsolescence and customer allowances on plug and play games as well as lower sales of trading card games that carry a higher gross margin. The Companys gross profit margin decreased to 58.2% for the year ended December 26, 2004 from 59.0% in 2003. The decrease in 2004 from 2003 was due to changes in product mix, primarily decreased sales of BEYBLADE products, which carry a higher gross margin. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by increased sales of VIDEONOW hardware products, which carry a lower gross margin, and decreased margin on VIDEONOW products due to competition and customer sales allowances. 2003 gross profit includes charges incurred by the Company to cease manufacturing operations in Spain, comprised primarily of severance costs as well as non cash charges associated with fixed assets. The production activities previously performed in Spain were transferred to the Companys other manufacturing facilities or outsourced to third party suppliers. The Company aggressively monitors its levels of inventory, attempting to avoid unnecessary expenditures of cash and potential charges related to obsolescence. The Companys failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand could result in overproduction of less popular items, which could result in higher obsolescence costs, causing a reduction in gross profit. 26 Table of Contents Expenses The Companys operating expenses, stated as percentages of net revenues, are illustrated below for the three fiscal years ended December 25, 2005: 2005 2004 2003 Amortization 3.3 % 2.4 % 2.4 % Royalties 8.0 7.4 7.9 Research and product development 4.9 5.2 4.6 Advertising 11.8 12.9 11.6 Selling, distribution and administration 20.2 20.5 21.5 Amortization increased to $102,035 in 2005 from $70,562 in 2004 and $76,053 in 2003. The increase in amortization in 2005 relates to increased amortization of STAR WARS property rights due to the theatrical and DVD releases of STAR WARS EPISODE III: REVENGE OF THE SITH. Amortization of these rights is based on actual sales of products as a portion of total expected sales of related products related to this licensing right. The decrease in amortization expense in 2004 from 2003 primarily relates to 2003 charges related to certain unprofitable product lines. The Company expects amortization expense to decrease in 2006 from 2005 levels due to lower expected sales of STAR WARS products. Royalty expense increased to $247,283, or 8.0% of net revenues in 2005 from $223,193, or 7.4% of net revenues in 2004 and $248,423, or 7.9% of net revenues in 2003. Increased royalty expense in 2005 relates primarily to increased sales of STAR WARS related products. The increase from STAR WARS products was partially offset by lower sales of BEYBLADE, SHREK and DISNEY products. Lower royalty expense in 2004 compared to 2003 is primarily due to the decreased sales of BEYBLADE products partly offset by a $7,200 charge related to future minimum guarantees not expected to be fully realized related to the Disney license agreement. The Company expects royalty expense to decrease in both dollars and as a percentage of net revenues in 2006 compared to 2005, due to the lower expected revenues of STAR WARS related products. Research and product development decreased in 2005 to $150,586, or 4.9% of net revenues, from $157,162, or 5.2% of net revenues in 2004. The decrease reflects increased efficiencies in the U.S. Toys product development resulting from its realignment in 2004. This realignment streamlined the U.S. Toys workforce and moved certain product development outside of the U.S. While the Company strives to incur these costs in the most efficient manner possible, investment in research and product development costs is an important component to the Companys strategy to grow core brands and to create new and innovative toy and game products. The increase in expenditures for research and product development from $143,183, or 4.6% of net revenues in 2003 to $157,162, or 5.2% of net revenues in 2004 reflects higher development costs associated with electronic toys such as VIDEONOW COLOR and electronic games such as MISSION PAINT BALL plug and play, as well as DVD games. Advertising expense in 2005 decreased in dollars and as a percentage of net revenues to $366,371, or 11.8% of net revenues, in 2005 from $387,523, or 12.9% of net revenues in 2004. This decrease reflects higher sales of STAR WARS products, which do not require the same amount of advertising as the Companys non entertainment based products. The Company continues to focus on marketing to raise awareness of its core brands, as well as to introduce new products. Advertising expense increased in dollars and as a percentage of net revenues to $387,523, or 12.9% of net revenues in 2004 from $363,876, or 11.6% of net revenues in 2003. The Company expects advertising to increase as a percentage of revenues in 2006 from 2005 as an increased percentage of revenues will come from core brands and new products due to the lower expected sales of STAR WARS product. Selling, distribution and administration expenses increased in dollars but decreased as a percentage of net revenues to $624,560, or 20.2% of net revenues in 2005, from $614,401, or 20.5% of net revenues in 2004. The increase in administration costs in dollars primarily reflects increased performance incentive bonus provisions reflecting the Companys improved performance. Selling, distribution and administration expenses decreased in dollars and as a percentage of net revenues to $614,401, or 20.5% of net revenues in 2004, from 27 Table of Contents $674,544, or 21.5% of net revenues in 2003. The decrease in 2004 from 2003 reflects lower expenses resulting from the Companys cost reduction and business efficiency initiatives, and lower levels of performance incentive bonus provisions relating to lower revenues and operating earnings. Additionally, the 2003 amount included costs associated with the Companys closure of its retail stores operated under the Wizards of the Coast and Gamekeeper names. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased to $30,537 in 2005 from $31,698 in 2004 and $52,462 in 2003. Decreased interest expense, resulting from lower levels of debt, were largely offset by increased interest expense as a result of higher interest rates. The decrease in interest expense mainly reflects the Companys strategy to reduce its long term debt. The Company repurchased or repaid principal amounts of long term debt of $93,303 in 2005, $56,697 in 2004, and $368,937 in 2003. Approximately 72% of the decrease in interest expense from 2003 to 2004 was attributable to lower levels of short term and long term debt in 2004 than in 2003 with the remaining 28% decrease in interest expense due to lower effective interest rates, primarily the result of interest rate swap agreements that reduce the amount of the Companys debt subject to fixed interest rates. The Company will continue to review the amount of long term debt outstanding as part of its strategic capital structure objective of maintaining a debt to capitalization ratio between 25% and 30%. Other (Income) Expense, Net Other income, net of $30,929 for the year ended December 25, 2005 compares to other expense, net of $1,226 and $48,090 for the years ended December 26, 2004 and December 28, 2003. Other income, net in 2005 primarily consists of interest income of $24,157, which compares to $7,729 in 2004 and $4,377 in 2003. The increase in interest income primarily relates to increases in invested cash balances in 2005. Other income, net in 2005 also includes non cash income of $2,080 compared to $12,710 in 2004 and a non cash charge to earnings of $13,630 in 2003, related to the change in the fair value of certain warrants required to be classified as a liability. These warrants are required to be adjusted to their fair value each quarter through earnings. The fair value of these warrants is primarily affected by the Companys stock price, but is also affected by the Companys stock price volatility and dividends, as well as risk free interest rates. Assuming the Companys stock volatility and dividend payments, as well as risk free interest rates remain constant, the fair value of the warrants would increase and the Company would recognize a charge to earnings as the price of the Companys stock increases. If the price of the Companys stock decreases and the Companys stock volatility, dividend payments, and the risk free interest rates remain constant, the fair value of the warrants will decrease and the Company will recognize income. Based on a hypothetical increase in the Companys stock price to $22.00 per share at December 25, 2005 from its actual price of $20.36 a share on that date, the Company would have recognized a non cash charge of approximately $7,790 rather than actual non cash income recorded of $2,080 for the year ended December 25, 2005, to reflect the change in the fair value of the warrants from their fair value of $125,940 at December 26, 2004. Other expense, net in 2004 also includes a $8,988 write down of the value of the common stock of Infogrames, held by the Company as an available for sale investment. This write down resulted from an other than temporary decline in the fair value of this investment. Other expense, net in 2003 includes a loss on extinguishment of debt of $20,342 relating to the 8.50% Notes due 2006, repurchased pursuant to a tender offer in the fourth quarter of 2003. Under the tender offer, the Company repurchased notes totaling $167,257 in aggregate principal amount. Income Taxes Income tax expense was 31.8% of pretax earnings in 2005 compared with 24.6% of pretax earnings in 2004 and 28.3% of pretax earnings in 2003. Income tax expense for 2005 includes approximately $25,800 related to the repatriation in the fourth quarter of 2005 of $547,000 of foreign earnings pursuant to the special 28 Table of Contents incentive provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Income tax expense for 2005 was also reduced by approximately $4 million, due primarily to an Internal Revenue Service examination of tax years ending in December 2001. Absent these items and the effect of the adjustment of certain warrants to their fair value, which has no tax effect, the 2005 effective tax rate would have been 24.9%. Absent the effect of the adjustment of certain warrants to their fair value, which has no tax effect, the 2004 and 2003 effective tax rates would have been 25.9% and 26.8%, respectively. The 2004 and 2003 effective tax rates were negatively impacted by increases in the valuation allowance primarily attributable to decreases in the value of the Companys available for sale investment in Infogrames Entertainment SA. The decrease in the adjusted rate, to 24.9% in 2005 from 25.9% in 2004, is also due to the tax impact of higher operating profits in jurisdictions with lower statutory tax rates. Cumulative Effect of Accounting Changes On June 30, 2003, the first day of the third quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Liabilities and Equity (SFAS 150). SFAS 150 required the Company to reclassify certain warrants recorded as equity to a liability, and adjust the warrants to their fair value through earnings as of that date. On the date of adoption, the Company reclassified $107,669 from equity, where the warrants had previously been recorded, to current liabilities. A cumulative effect of accounting change of $17,351 was recorded to adjust the amount of this liability to its fair value on the adoption date. There was no tax benefit associated with this charge. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company has historically generated a significant amount of cash from operations. In 2005, the Company funded its operations and liquidity needs primarily through cash flows from operations, and, when needed, proceeds from its accounts receivable securitization program and borrowings under its unsecured credit facilities. During 2006, the Company expects to continue to fund its working capital needs primarily through operations and, when needed, using proceeds from the accounts receivable securitization program and borrowings under its available lines of credit. The Company believes that the funds available to it, including cash expected to be generated from operations and funds available through its securitization program and other available lines of credit, are adequate to meet its needs for 2006. However, unforeseen circumstances in the toy or game industry, such as softness in the retail environment or unanticipated changes in consumer preferences, could result in a significant decline in revenues and operating results for the Company, which could result in the Company being in non compliance with its debt covenants and unable to use funding from its accounts receivable securitization program. Non compliance with its debt covenants could result in the Company being unable to utilize borrowings under its revolving credit facility and other bank lines, a circumstance which potentially could occur when operating shortfalls would most require supplementary borrowings to enable the Company to continue to fund its operations. Also, non compliance with covenants under its accounts receivable securitization program could result in the Company being unable to utilize this program. In addition, a significant deterioration in the business of a major U.S. customer could result in a decrease in eligible accounts receivable that would prevent the Company from being able to fully utilize its accounts receivable securitization program. During the last four fiscal years, as part of its strategy of reducing long term debt and its overall debt to capitalization ratio, the Company has repurchased or repaid approximately $646,000 in principal amount of long term debt, primarily using cash from operations. Remaining principal amounts of long term debt at December 25, 2005, including portions classified as current, were $527,726. The Company believes that the reduction in its debt to capitalization ratio has improved its liquidity situation by decreasing cash required to service outstanding debt, thereby increasing the ability of the Company to obtain additional financing should the need to do so arise. At December 25, 2005, cash and cash equivalents, net of short term borrowings, were $927,592 compared to $707,043 and $497,393 at December 26, 2004 and December 28, 2003, respectively. Hasbro generated 29 Table of Contents approximately $497,000, $359,000, and $454,000 of cash from its operating activities in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in 2005 from 2004 is primarily due to the mix of products in 2005 net revenues. Net earnings in 2005 included increased non cash expenses primarily as a result of increased STAR WARS revenues. Increased royalty expense in 2005 related to revenues from STAR WARS products. A portion of these royalties had been paid in prior years and recorded as a prepaid expense. The Company paid an advance of $35,000 in 2005 related to STAR WARS royalties. In addition, the Company had increased amortization expense in 2005, which did not impact the cash flows from operations. Although net earnings before cumulative effect of accounting change increased to $195,977 in 2004 from $175,015 in 2003, the decrease in cash from operations in 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily the result of changes in operating assets and liabilities, further discussed below. Accounts receivable decreased to $523,232 at December 25, 2005 from $578,705 at December 26, 2004. Fourth quarter days sales outstanding decreased to 44 days in 2005 from 49 days in 2004 and 2003. The decrease in days sales outstanding from 2004 primarily reflects improved collections, increased utilization of the securitization facility in 2005 and decreases in international accounts receivable due to the stronger U.S. dollar in 2005. In 2003, the Company entered into a revolving accounts receivable securitization facility whereby the Company is able to sell undivided interests in qualifying accounts receivable on an ongoing basis. At December 25, 2005 and December 26, 2004, there was $250,000 and $206,055, respectively, sold under this program. The December 25, 2005 accounts receivable balance includes a decrease of approximately $23,884 related to the currency impact of the weaker U.S. dollar. Inventories decreased to $179,398 at December 25, 2005 from $194,780 at December 26, 2004. The decrease in inventory represents higher levels of inventory at December 26, 2004 due to lower levels of sales in the fourth quarter of 2004. In addition, inventories decreased approximately $5,900 due to the stronger U.S. dollar in 2005. The increase in inventory to $194,780 at December 26, 2004 from $168,979 at December 28, 2003 reflects lower than normal inventory levels in 2003 and, to a lesser extent, lower revenues in the fourth quarter of 2004. Inventory levels at year end 2003 were at their lowest point since 1990. Prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased to $185,297 at December 25, 2005 from $219,735 at December 26, 2004. This decrease is primarily related to decreased prepaid royalties as a result of the increased sales of STAR WARS products in 2005. Generally, when the Company enters into a licensing agreement for entertainment based properties, an advance royalty payment is required at the inception of the agreement. This payment is then recognized in the consolidated statement of operations as the related sales are recorded. The decrease related to prepaid royalties was partially offset by increased deferred taxes. Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased slightly to $219,735 at December 26, 2004 from $211,981 at December 28, 2003. An increase in current prepaid royalties as a result of the 2005 release of STAR WARS EPISODE III: REVENGE OF THE SITH was partially offset by decreased deferred taxes. With respect to the STAR WARS license, the Company has prepaid royalties recorded in both current and non current assets. Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased to $863,280 at December 25, 2005 from $806,528 at December 26, 2004. This primarily reflects an increase in accrued income taxes primarily as a result of improved earnings in 2005 and, to a lesser extent, taxes payable related to earnings repatriated under the American Jobs Creation Act (the Act). In December 2005, the Company repatriated approximately $547,000 under this Act. The increase from accrued income taxes was partially offset by lower accrued royalties at December 25, 2005 due to lower sales of BEYBLADE and SHREK products in the fourth quarter of 2005. These contracts did not require the Company to prepay royalties as these royalty amounts were paid in arrears. Accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased to $806,528 at December 26, 2004 from $905,368 at December 28, 2003. The decrease primarily relates to decreases in accrued bonuses and performance incentives as well as a decrease in accrued income taxes. To a lesser extent, this decrease was also due to a decrease in the value of certain warrants that the Company is required to record as liabilities under SFAS 150. As a result of SFAS 150, the Company classifies certain warrants containing a put option as a current liability and adjusts the amount of this liability to its fair value on a periodic basis. Cash flows from investing activities were a net utilization of $120,671, $84,967, and $64,879 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. During 2005, the Company expended $65,000 to reacquire the digital gaming rights for its owned or controlled properties from Infogrames Entertainment SA (Infogrames). These rights 30 Table of Contents were previously held by Infogrames on an exclusive basis as a result of a licensing agreement entered into during 2000. In addition, the Company expended $14,179 to purchase the assets of Wrebbit Inc., a Montreal based creator and manufacturer of innovative puzzles. In 2005, the Company also had proceeds from the sales of property, plant and equipment of $33,083. These proceeds came primarily from the sale of the Companys former manufacturing facility in Spain. During 2005, the Company expended approximately $71,000 on additions to its property, plant and equipment while during 2004 and 2003 it expended approximately $79,000 and $63,000, respectively. Of these amounts, 61% in 2005, 58% in 2004, and 66% in 2003 were for purchases of tools, dies and molds related to the Companys products. The level of capital spending in 2005, 2004, and 2003 was below the level permitted under its outstanding credit facilities. In 2006, the Company expects capital expenditures to continue to be in the range of $70,000 to $90,000. During the three years ended December 25, 2005, depreciation and amortization of plant and equipment was $78,097, $75,618, and $88,070, respectively. In 2004, the Company acquired the remaining unowned interest in its Latin America operations for total consideration of $9,824. This purchase resulted in an increase in goodwill in the amount of $9,390. The Company made no acquisitions of businesses in 2003. The Company commits to inventory production, advertising and marketing expenditures prior to the peak third and fourth quarter retail selling season. Accounts receivable increase during the third and fourth quarter as customers increase their purchases to meet expected consumer demand in the holiday season. Due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling period, payments for these accounts receivable are generally not due until the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the subsequent year. This timing difference between expenditures and cash collections on accounts receivable made it necessary for the Company to borrow varying amounts during the year. During 2005 and 2004, the Company primarily utilized cash from operations and its accounts receivable securitization program. During 2003, the Company primarily utilized cash from operations and borrowings under its secured amended and restated revolving credit agreement to meet its cash flow requirements. The Company is party to an accounts receivable securitization program whereby the Company sells, on an ongoing basis, substantially all of its U.S. trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, Hasbro Receivables Funding, LLC (HRF). HRF is consolidated with the Company for financial reporting purposes. The securitization program then allows HRF to sell, on a revolving basis, an undivided interest of up to $250,000 in the eligible receivables it holds to certain bank conduits. The program provides the Company with a cost effective source of working capital. Based on the amount of eligible accounts receivable as of December 25, 2005, the Company utilized $250,000, which was the maximum available to sell under this program. The Company has an amended and restated credit agreement, which provides it with an unsecured revolving credit facility of $350,000, maturing in March 2007. The Company is not required to maintain compensating balances under the agreement. The amended and restated agreement contains certain restrictive covenants setting forth minimum cash flow and coverage requirements, and a number of other limitations, including with respect to capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividend payments. The Company was in compliance with all restrictive covenants as of and for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2005. The Company had no borrowings outstanding under its committed revolving credit facility at December 25, 2005. The Company also has other uncommitted lines from various banks, of which approximately $44,552 was utilized at December 25, 2005. Amounts available and unused under the committed line at December 25, 2005 were approximately $346,000. Net cash utilized by financing activities was $158,641 in 2005. This amount included repayments in principal amount of long term debt totaling $93,303. These amounts primarily related to $71,970 of bonds that matured in November of 2005. The remaining amount relates to repayment of long term debt associated with the Companys former manufacturing facility in Spain. Dividends paid increased to $58,901 as a result of the increase of the quarterly dividend rate to $0.09 in the first quarter of 2005 from $0.06. In May 2005, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $350 million in common stock. In 2005, the Company repurchased 2,386 shares at an average price of $20.10. The total cost of these repurchases, including transaction costs, was $48,030. The Company received $45,278 in 2005 in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options. 31 Table of Contents Net cash utilized by financing activities was $75,824 in 2004. This amount included repurchases in principal amount of long term debt totaling $56,697 in connection with the Companys strategy of reducing its overall debt and improving its debt to capitalization ratio. The Company received $25,836 from the exercise of stock options during the year. In December 2003, the Company increased its quarterly dividend to $0.06 per share from $0.03 per share. This increased cash paid for dividends to $37,088 from the 2003 amount of $20,851. Net cash utilized by financing activities was $373,307 in 2003. This was primarily the result of the Companys use of cash flows from operations to repurchase or repay $200,288 in principal amount of 7.95% Notes in March 2003. In addition, the Company repurchased $167,257 in principal amount of 8.50% Notes due 2006 in the fourth quarter of 2003 at a total cost of $188,991. Also in 2003, as the result of the increase in the Companys stock price during the year, the Company received $39,892 in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options. The Company also paid $3,378 to repurchase shares issued upon the exercise of certain warrants as well as to terminate a warrant agreement. The Company has outstanding $249,996 in principal amount of senior convertible debentures due 2021. The senior convertible debentures bear interest at 2.75%, which could be subject to an upward adjustment in the rate, not to exceed 11%, should the price of the Companys stock trade at or below $9.72 per share for 20 of the 30 trading days preceding the fifth day prior to an interest payment date. This contingent interest feature represents a derivative instrument that is recorded on the balance sheet at its fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in the statement of operations. If the closing price of the Companys stock exceeds $23.76 for at least 20 trading days, within the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the calendar quarter, or upon other specified events, the debentures will be convertible at an initial conversion price of $21.60 in the next calendar quarter. This contingent conversion feature was not met in 2005. The holders of these debentures may put the notes back to Hasbro in December 2011 and December 2016 at the original principal amount. At that time, the purchase price may be paid in cash, shares of common stock or a combination of the two, at the Companys discretion. While the Companys current intent is to settle in cash any puts exercised, there can be no guarantee that the Company will have the funds necessary to settle this obligation in cash. On December 1, 2005, the holders of these debentures had the option to put these notes back to Hasbro. On that date, the Company redeemed $4 of these notes in cash. Due to this put option, these debentures were classified on the Companys balance sheet in the current portion of long term debt at December 26, 2004. Subsequent to December 1, 2005, the remaining $249,996 of principal amount of these notes were reclassified to long term debt. The Company has remaining principal amounts of long term debt, including current portions, at December 25, 2005 of approximately $527,726. As detailed below in Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments, this debt is due at varying times from 2006 through 2028. Of the total principal amount, the Company has $32,743 of 8.50% Notes due in March 2006. In addition, the Company is committed to guaranteed royalty and other contractual payments of approximately $128,220 in 2006, which includes $100,000 of royalty commitments on a contract signed in January 2006 with Marvel Entertainment, Inc. and Marvel Characters, Inc. Also, as detailed in Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments, the Company has certain warrants, currently recorded in accrued liabilities, that may be settleable for, at the Companys option, $100,000 in cash or $110,000 in the Companys stock, such stock being valued at the time of the exercise of the option. The Company believes that cash from operations, including the securitization facility, and, if necessary, its line of credit, will allow the Company to meet these and other obligations listed. The Company will continue to review the amount of long term debt outstanding as part of its strategic capital structure objective of maintaining a debt to capitalization ratio between 25% and 30%. On May 19, 2005, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $350 million in common stock. This authorization replaced a prior authorization, dated December 6, 1999 of $500 million, which had $204.5 million remaining. Purchases of the Companys common stock may be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The Company has no obligation to repurchase shares under the authorization, and the timing, actual number, and the value of the shares that are repurchased will depend on a number of factors, including the price of the Companys stock. The Company may suspend or discontinue the program at any time and there is no expiration date. In 2005, the Company repurchased 32 Table of Contents 2,386 shares at an average price of $20.10. The total cost of these repurchases, including transaction costs, was $48,030. Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As such, management is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented. The significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the Companys reported financial results include sales allowances, inventory valuation, recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets, recoverability of royalty advances and commitments and pensions. Sales allowances for customer promotions, discounts and returns are recorded as a reduction of revenue when the related revenue is recognized. Revenue from product sales is recognized upon passing of title to the customer, generally at the time of shipment. Revenue from product sales, less related sales allowances, is added to royalty revenue and reflected as net revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company routinely commits to promotional sales allowance programs with customers. These allowances primarily relate to fixed programs, which the customer earns based on purchases of Company products during the year. Discounts are recorded as a reduction of related revenue at the time of sale. While many of the allowances are based on fixed amounts, certain of the allowances, such as the returns allowance, are based on market data, historical trends and information from customers and are therefore subject to estimation. Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market. Based upon a consideration of quantities on hand, actual and projected sales volume, anticipated product selling prices and product lines planned to be discontinued, slow moving and obsolete inventory is written down to its net realizable value. Failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand could result in the Company under producing popular items or overproducing less popular items. Management estimates are monitored on a quarterly basis and a further adjustment to reduce inventory to its net realizable value is recorded, as an increase to cost of sales, when deemed necessary under the lower of cost or market standard. Goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually. If an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, the Company will perform an interim test at that time. The impairment test begins by allocating goodwill and intangible assets to applicable reporting units. Goodwill is then tested using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach, which looks to the present value of expected future cash flows. The first step is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an indication from the first step that one exists. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value which is also calculated using an income approach. The Companys annual impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter of 2005 and no impairment was indicated. The estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge. The estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate. The use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge. At December 25, 2005, the Company has goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives of $542,799 recorded on the balance sheet. Intangible assets, other than those with indefinite lives, are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Recoverability of the value of these intangible assets is measured by a comparison of the assets carrying value 33 Table of Contents to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets were considered to be impaired, the impairment would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value based on estimated future discounted cash flows. The estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge. The estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate. The use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge. Intangible assets covered under this policy were $533,940 at December 25, 2005. During 2005, there were no impairment charges related to these intangible assets. The recoverability of royalty advances and contractual obligations with respect to minimum guaranteed royalties is assessed by comparing the remaining minimum guaranty to the estimated future sales forecasts and related cash flow projections to be derived from the related product. If sales forecasts and related cash flows from the particular product do not support the recoverability of the remaining minimum guaranty or, if the Company decides to discontinue a product line with royalty advances or commitments, a charge to royalty expense to write off the remaining minimum guaranty is required. The preparation of revenue forecasts and related cash flows for these products requires judgments and estimates. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in the assessment of anticipated revenues and cash flows related to these products could result in a change to the assessment of recoverability of remaining minimum guaranteed royalties. At December 25, 2005, the Company had $126,515 of prepaid royalties, $37,107 of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $89,408 which are included in other assets. The Company, except for certain international subsidiaries, has pension plans covering substantially all of its full time employees. Pension expense is based on actuarial computations of current and future benefits using estimates for expected return on assets, expected compensation increases, and applicable discount rates. The Company estimates expected return on assets using a weighted average rate based on historical market data for the investment classes of assets held by the plan, the allocation of plan assets among those investment classes, and the current economic environment. Based on this information, the Companys estimate of expected return on domestic plan assets was 8.75% in 2005, 2004 and 2003. A decrease in the estimate used for expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense, while an increase in this estimate would decrease pension expense. A decrease of .25% in the estimate of expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense for U.S. plans by approximately $470. Expected compensation increases are estimated using a combination of historical compensation increases with expected compensation increases in the Companys long term business forecasts. Based on this analysis, the Companys estimate of expected long term compensation increases for its U.S. plans was 4.0% in 2005, 2004 and 2003. Increases in estimated compensation increases would result in higher pension expense while decreases would lower pension expense. Discount rates are selected based upon rates of return at the measurement date on high quality corporate bond investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits. Based on this long term corporate bond yield at September 30, 2005, the Companys measurement date for its pension assets and liabilities, the Company selected a discount rate for its domestic plans of 5.50%. A decrease in the discount rate would result in greater pension expense while an increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense. A decrease of .25% in the Companys discount rate would increase pension expense and the projected benefit obligation by approximately $995 and $11,110, respectively. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and, if outside a certain corridor, amortized over future periods and, therefore generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. Assets in the plan are valued on the basis of their fair market value on the measurement date. In 2005 and 2004, the Company recorded a minimum pension liability for its U.S. plans of $53,329 and $43,196, respectively. This amount represents the amount by which the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the sum of the fair market value of plan assets and accrued amounts previously recorded. 34 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments In the normal course of its business, the Company enters into contracts related to obtaining rights to produce product under license, which may require the payment of minimum guarantees, as well as contracts related to the leasing of facilities and equipment. In addition, the Company has $527,726 of long term debt outstanding at December 25, 2005, including current portions and excluding fair value adjustments. Future payments required under these and other obligations as of December 25, 2005 are as follows: Payments Due by Fiscal Year Certain Contractual Obligations 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total Long term debt, including current portions $ 32,743 135,092 359,891 527,726 Operating lease commitments 22,686 21,382 19,858 18,350 10,995 29,901 123,172 Future minimum guaranteed contractual payments 28,220 15,660 18,760 8,700 5,100 76,440 Purchase commitments 171,551 171,551 $ 255,200 37,042 173,710 27,050 16,095 389,792 898,889 In addition to the above commitments, in January 2006, the Company entered into a five year license arrangement with Marvel Entertainment, Inc., and its subsidiary Marvel Characters, Inc. (together Marvel) to develop products based on certain Marvel properties for retail sales beginning on January 1, 2007. The arrangement requires the Company to make guaranteed minimum payments in the amount of $205,000 with $100,000 paid in February 2006. Of the remaining payments, $70,000 is expected to be paid in 2007 upon the release of the motion picture SPIDERMAN 3 and the remainder to be paid upon the release of the motion picture SPIDERMAN 4, whose release date is yet to be determined. The agreement also requires the Company to make minimum expenditures on marketing and promotional activities, including the spending of at least $15,000 associated with the motion picture SPIDERMAN 3. Certain of the future minimum guaranteed contractual royalty payments are contingent upon the theatrical release of the related entertainment property. Included in the Thereafter column above is $249,996 in principal amount of senior convertible debt due 2021. The holders of these debentures may put the notes back to the Company in December 2011 and December 2016 at the principal amount. At that time, the purchase price may be paid in cash, shares of common stock or a combination of the two. In addition to the above, the Company has certain warrants outstanding at December 25, 2005 that contain a put option that would require the Company to repurchase the warrants for a price to be paid, at the Companys election, of either $100,000 in cash or $110,000 in shares of the Companys common stock, such stock being valued at the time of the exercise of the option. The Companys current intent is to settle this put option in cash if exercised. In accordance with SFAS 150, these warrants are recorded as an accrued liability at fair value at December 25, 2005. In addition, the Company expects to make contributions totaling approximately $21,000 to its pension plans in 2006. The Company also has letters of credit of approximately $33,600 at December 25, 2005. Financial Risk Management The Company is exposed to market risks attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as the result of sourcing products priced in U.S. dollars, Hong Kong dollars and Euros while marketing those products in more than twenty currencies. Results of operations may be affected primarily by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso and, to a lesser extent, currencies in Latin American and Asia Pacific countries. To manage this exposure, the Company has hedged a portion of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using forward foreign exchange contracts, and purchased foreign currency options. The Company estimates that a hypothetical immediate 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies could 35 Table of Contents result in an approximate $9,200 decrease in the fair value of these instruments. A decrease in the fair value of these instruments would be substantially offset by decreases in the related forecasted foreign currency transaction. The Company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or short term borrowing positions in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company believes, however, that the on going risk on the net exposure should not be material to its financial condition. In addition, the Companys revenues and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency rates. From time to time, affiliates of the Company may make or receive intercompany loans in currencies other than their functional currency. The Company manages this exposure at the time the loan is made by using foreign exchange contracts. Other than as set forth above, the Company does not hedge foreign currency exposures. The Company reflects all derivatives at their fair value as an asset or liability on the balance sheet. The Company does not speculate in foreign currency exchange contracts. At December 25, 2005, the Company had fixed rate long term debt, including current portions and excluding fair value adjustments, of $527,726. At December 25, 2005, the Company had fixed for floating interest rate swaps with notional amounts of $100,000. The interest rate swaps are designed to adjust the amount of the Companys debt subject to a fixed interest rate. The interest rate swaps are matched with specific long term debt issues and are designated and effective as hedges of the change in the fair value of the associated debt. Changes in fair value of these contracts are wholly offset in earnings by changes in the fair value of long term debt. At December 25, 2005, these contracts had a fair value of $663, with $636 included in other assets, and the remaining $27 included in prepaid expenses and other current assets, with corresponding fair value adjustments to increase long term debt and current portions of long term debt, respectively. Changes in interest rates affect the fair value of fixed rate debt not hedged by interest rate swap agreements while affecting the earnings and cash flows of the long term debt hedged by the interest rate swaps. The Company estimates that a hypothetical one percentage point decrease or increase in interest rates would increase or decrease the fair value of this long term debt by approximately $15,900 or $13,600, respectively. A hypothetical one percentage point change in interest rates would increase or decrease 2006 pretax earnings and cash flows by $729 and $375, respectively. The Economy and Inflation The Company continued to experience difficult economic environments in some parts of the world during 2005. The principal market for the Companys products is the retail sector. Revenues from the Companys top 5 customers, all retailers, accounted for approximately 53%, 50%, and 52% of its consolidated net revenues in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In the past two years certain customers in the retail sector have experienced economic difficulty. The Company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems appropriate. The Companys revenue pattern continues to show the second half of the year, and within that half, the fourth quarter, to be more significant to its overall business for the full year. The Company expects that this concentration will continue, particularly as more of its business shifts to larger customers with order patterns concentrated in the second half of the year. The concentration of sales in the second half of the year and, specifically, the fourth quarter increases the risk of (a) underproduction of popular items, (b) overproduction of less popular items, and (c) failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules. The business of the Company is characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences in the degree of consumer acceptance of a product line, product availability, marketing strategies, inventory levels, policies of retailers and differences in overall economic conditions. The trend of larger retailers has been to maintain lower inventories throughout the year and purchase a greater percentage of product within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer selling season, which includes Christmas. Quick response inventory management practices now being used result in more orders being placed for immediate delivery and fewer orders being placed well in advance of shipment. To the extent that retailers do not sell as much of their year end inventory purchases during this holiday selling season as they had anticipated, their demand for additional product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed, thus 36 Table of Contents negatively impacting the Companys revenues. In addition, the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the Companys significant retailers could negatively impact the Companys future revenues. The effect of inflation on the Companys operations during 2005 was not significant and the Company will continue its policy of monitoring costs and adjusting prices, accordingly. Other Information Hasbro uses the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock options granted to employees. As required by the Companys existing stock plans, stock options are granted at, or above, the fair market value of the Companys stock, and, accordingly, no compensation expense is recognized for these grants in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company records compensation expense related to other stock based awards, such as restricted stock grants, over the period the award vests, typically three years. On December 16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123(R)), which amends SFAS 123 and SFAS 95 Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS 123(R) requires companies to measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in its consolidated financial statements. In addition, the adoption of SFAS 123(R) requires additional accounting and disclosure related to the income tax and cash flow effects resulting from share based payment arrangements. SFAS 123(R) is effective for the Company as of December 26, 2005, the first day of the 2006 fiscal year. The Company will adopt SFAS 123(R) on the prospective basis as defined in the statement. Under this adoption method, the Company will record expense relating to employee stock based compensation awards in the periods subsequent to adoption. This expense will be based on all unvested options as of the adoption date as well as all future stock based compensation awards. Based on the current options outstanding, the Companys 2006 pretax expense for those options is expected to be between $16,000 and $17,000. This amount may increase to the extent that options are granted in 2006. On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act) was signed into law. The Act created a one time incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate undistributed earnings from their international subsidiaries by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain international earnings. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company repatriated approximately $547,000 of foreign earnings under the provisions of the Act which resulted in income tax of $25,844. The Company is not aware of any material amounts of potential exposure relating to environmental matters and does not believe its environmental compliance costs or liabilities to be material to its operating results or financial position.
