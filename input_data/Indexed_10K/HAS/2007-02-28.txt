Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company included in Part II Item 8 of this document. This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward looking statements concerning the Companys expectations and beliefs. See Item 1A Forward Looking Information and Risk Factors That May Affect Future Results for a discussion of other uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements. (Thousands of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share Data) Executive Summary The Company earns revenue and generates cash through the sale of a variety of toy and game products. The Company sells these products both within the United States and in a number of international markets. The Companys business is highly seasonal with a significant amount of revenues occurring in the second half of the year and within that half, the fourth quarter. In 2006, 68% of the Companys net revenues were generated in the second half of the year with 35% of annual net revenues generated in the fourth quarter. In both 2005 and 2004, percentages were comparable at 67% and 35% for the second half and fourth quarter. While many of the Companys products are based on brands the Company owns or controls, the Company also offers products which are licensed from outside inventors. In addition, the Company licenses rights to produce products based on movie, television, music and other entertainment properties, such as MARVEL and STAR WARS properties. In January 2006 the Company simplified its operating segment structure in order to better focus on consumer demands, better anticipate the needs of its retail customers, provide a more integrated toy and game marketing plan, place a greater company wide focus on its core brands and thereby improve its overall business. The Companys North American toy and games business is managed under common leadership, providing a combined focus on developing, marketing, and selling products in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. The International segment consists of the Companys European, Asia Pacific and Latin American marketing operations, excluding Mexico. The Companys world wide manufacturing and product sourcing operations are managed through its Global Operations segment. The Hasbro Products Group continues to be responsible for the world wide outlicensing of the Companys intellectual properties and works closely with the North American and International segments on the coordinated out licensing activities of the Companys brands. The Companys focus remains on growing core owned and controlled brands, developing new and innovative products which respond to market insights, and optimizing efficiencies within the Company to reduce costs, increase operating profits and strengthen its balance sheet. While the Company has sought to achieve a more sustainable revenue base by developing and maintaining its core brands and avoiding reliance on licensed entertainment properties, it continues to opportunistically enter into or leverage existing strategic licenses which complement its brands and key strengths. Given the strength of its core brands, the Company may also seek to drive product related revenues by increasing the visibility of its core brands through entertainment based theatrical venues. As an example of this, in July of 2007, the TRANSFORMERS motion picture is expected to be released and the Company has developed products based on the motion picture that will be marketed in 2007. The Companys core brands represent Company owned or Company controlled brands, such as G.I. JOE, TRANSFORMERS, MY LITTLE PONY, MONOPOLY, MAGIC: THE GATHERING, PLAYSKOOL and TONKA, which have been successful over the long term. The Company has a large portfolio of owned and controlled brands, which can be introduced in new formats and platforms over time. These brands may also be further extended by pairing a licensed concept with a core brand. By focusing on core brands, the Company is working to build a more consistent revenue stream and basis for future growth. In 2006, the Company had strong sales of core brand products, namely PLAYSKOOL, LITTLEST PET SHOP, MONOPOLY, NERF, and PLAY DOH. 21 Table of Contents In addition to its focus on core brands, the Companys strategy also involves trying to meet ever changing consumer preferences by identifying and offering innovative products based on market opportunities and insights. The Company believes its strategy of focusing on the development of its core brands and continuing to identify innovative new products will help to prevent the Company from being dependent on the success of any one product line. With the theatrical release of Lucasfilms STAR WARS EPISODE III: REVENGE OF THE SITH in May 2005, and the subsequent holiday season DVD release, sales of product related to the Companys strategic STAR WARS license were a significant contributor to 2005 revenues and have continued to be strong in 2006. Pairing this key licensed property with the Companys ability to design and produce action figures, role playing toys, and games, as well as its ability to launch an integrated marketing campaign to promote the product globally, was the key to this lines success. While sales of product related to this license performed well in 2006, they were lower than 2005. While the Companys strategy has continued to focus on growing its core brands and developing innovative, new products, it will continue to evaluate and enter into arrangements to license properties when the Company believes it is economically attractive. In 2006, the Company entered into a license with Marvel Entertainment, Inc. and Marvel Characters, Inc. (collectively Marvel) to produce toys and games based on Marvels portfolio of characters. The Company will also incur royalties on products based on the theatrical release of TRANSFORMERS in July 2007. While gross profits of theatrical entertainment based products are generally higher than many of the Companys other products, sales from these products also incur royalty expenses payable to the licensor. Such royalties reduce the impact of these higher gross margins. In certain instances, such as with Lucasfilms STAR WARS, the Company may also incur amortization expense on property right based assets acquired from the licensor of such properties, further impacting profit made on these products. The Company remains committed to reducing fixed costs and increasing operating margins. Over the last 5 years the Company has improved its operating margin from 7.8% in 2002 to 11.9% in 2006. In the fourth quarter of 2006, as part of its ongoing cost reduction efforts, the Company determined that it will reduce its manufacturing activity in Ireland and transition the manufacture of certain products to the Companys suppliers in China. The Company is also investing to grow its business in emerging international markets. With a strong balance sheet, and having achieved a debt to capitalization ratio of between 25 30%, the Company will also continue to evaluate strategic alliances and acquisitions which may complement its current product offerings or allow it entry into an area which is adjacent to and complementary to the toy and game business. The Company expects to leverage revenue to offset the impact of these investments and maintain 2007 operating margin levels near 2006. In recent years, the Company has been seeking to return excess cash to its shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. As part of this initiative, in July 2006, the Companys Board of Directors (the Board) authorized the repurchase of an additional $350,000 in common stock after a previous authorization of $350,000 was exhausted in July 2006. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, the Company has invested $456,744 in the repurchase of 22,767 shares of common stock in the open market. The Company intends to opportunistically repurchase shares in the future subject to market conditions. In addition, in February 2007, the Company announced an increase in its quarterly dividend to $.16 per share. This is the fourth consecutive year that the Board of Directors has increased the dividend rate. 22 Table of Contents Summary The relationship between various components of the results of operations, stated as a percent of net revenues, is illustrated below for each of the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2006. 2006 2005 2004 Net revenues 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 41.4 41.7 41.8 Gross profit 58.6 58.3 58.2 Amortization 2.5 3.3 2.4 Royalties 5.4 8.0 7.4 Research and product development 5.4 4.9 5.2 Advertising 11.7 11.8 12.9 Selling, distribution and administration 21.7 20.2 20.5 Operating profit 11.9 10.1 9.8 Interest expense 0.9 1.0 1.1 Interest income (0.9 ) (0.8 ) (0.3 ) Other (income) expense, net 1.1 (0.2 ) 0.3 Earnings before income taxes 10.8 10.1 8.7 Income taxes 3.5 3.2 2.2 Net earnings 7.3 % 6.9 % 6.5 % Results of Operations The fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 was a fifty three week year while the fiscal years ended December 25, 2005 and December 26, 2004 were fifty two week years. Net earnings for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 were $230,055, or $1.29 per diluted share. This compares to net earnings for fiscal 2005 and 2004 of $212,075 and $195,977, or $1.09 and $.96 per diluted share, respectively. On December 26, 2005, the first day of fiscal 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R), which required that the Company measure all stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in its financial statements. The Company adopted this statement using the modified prospective method. Under this adoption method, the Company is recording expense related to stock option awards that were unvested as of the date of adoption as well as all awards made after the date of adoption. The adoption of this statement resulted in total expense, net of tax, of $14,285 in 2006. Net earnings and basic and diluted earnings per share for 2005 include income tax expense of approximately $25,800 related to the Companys repatriation of approximately $547,000 of foreign earnings in the fourth quarter of 2005 pursuant to the special incentive provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $3,151,481 compared to $3,087,627 in 2005 and $2,997,510 in 2004. Most of the Companys revenues and operating profits were derived from its two principal segments: North America and International, which are discussed in detail below. Consolidated net revenues were positively impacted by foreign currency translation in the amount of $27,800 in 2006 and $1,029 in 2005 as the result of the overall weaker U.S. dollar in each of those years. The following table presents net revenues and operating profit data for the Companys two principal segments for 2006, 2005 and 2004. Both 2005 and 2004 results have been reclassified to conform to the Companys new operating segment structure. The operating profit for 2005 and 2004 for each of these segments have been adjusted to include the impact of expense related to stock options as disclosed under SFAS 123, consistent 23 Table of Contents with the Companys management reporting. See notes 1 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further details. % % 2006 Change 2005 Change 2004 Net Revenues North America $ 2,130,290 4 % $ 2,038,556 4 % $ 1,956,031 International $ 959,319 (3 )% $ 988,591 1 % $ 977,128 Operating Profit North America $ 275,959 67 % $ 165,676 1 % $ 163,786 International $ 90,893 (15 )% $ 106,435 13 % $ 94,487 North America North American segment net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased 4% to $2,130,290 from $2,038,556 in 2005. The impact of foreign currency translation on North American segment net revenues in 2006 was favorable and increased net revenues by approximately $3,200. Anticipated decreased revenues of STAR WARS products were more than offset primarily by increased sales of LITTLEST PET SHOP, PLAYSKOOL, NERF, I DOG and MONOPOLY products, as well as revenues from the successful reintroduction of BABY ALIVE. 2006 revenues were also positively impacted, to a lesser extent, by increased sales of PLAY DOH and TRANSFORMERS products. STAR WARS revenues were significant in 2005 due to the theatrical and DVD releases of STAR WARS EPISODE III: REVENGE OF THE SITH and remained strong in 2006. In 2007, the Company will introduce products related to two anticipated major motion picture releases, SPIDER MAN 3 in May of 2007 and TRANSFORMERS in July of 2007. North American operating profit increased to $275,959 in 2006 from $165,676 in 2005. The increase in operating profit is primarily due to increased gross profit as a result of the increased sales in 2006 as well as decreases in royalty and amortization expense principally due to the decrease in sales of STAR WARS products. Operating profit for the North American segment was negatively impacted by higher research and product development costs due to higher investments in the PLAYSKOOL line and costs related to MARVEL products expected to be introduced in 2007. North American operating profit was negatively impacted in 2005 by a loss of approximately $23,000 in the electronic games category, which included charges associated with inventory obsolescence and customer allowances related to plug and play games. North American segment net revenues for the year ended December 25, 2005 increased 4% to $2,038,556 from $1,956,031 in 2004. North American revenues were positively impacted in 2005 by currency translation by approximately $11,300 due to the stronger Mexican Peso and Canadian Dollar. The increase in volume was predominantly due to increased revenues from STAR WARS related products as the result of the theatrical and DVD release of STAR WARS EPISODE III: REVENGE OF THE SITH in 2005. In addition to the increase from STAR WARS related products, North American net revenues were also positively impacted by the reintroduction of LITTLEST PET SHOP products as well as increased sales of NERF products. These increases were partially offset by decreased games sales in 2005, primarily MAGIC: THE GATHERING and DUEL MASTERS trading card games. Net revenues in 2005 were also negatively impacted by decreased sales of VIDEONOW and FURREAL FRIENDS products as well as the continued decline in BEYBLADE products. North American segment operating profit increased slightly to $165,676 in 2005 from $163,786 in 2004. Increased gross profit primarily resulting from higher net revenues was partially offset by higher royalty and amortization expense associated with higher sales of STAR WARS products. 2005 operating profit was also positively impacted by decreased advertising expense due to the high percentage of net revenues that represented STAR WARS products, which do not require as much advertising and promotion to raise awareness as an internally developed product would. North American operating profit was negatively impacted in 2005 by a loss of approximately $23,000 in the electronic games category, which included charges associated with inventory obsolescence and customer allowances related to plug and play games. Currency 24 Table of Contents translation had a positive impact of approximately $1,900 on the operating profit of the North American segment in 2005. International International segment net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased by 3% to $959,319 from $988,591 in 2005. In 2006 net revenues were positively impacted by currency translation by approximately $24,300 as a result of a weaker U.S. dollar. The decrease in net revenues was primarily the result of decreased sales of STAR WARS products in 2006 as well as decreased sales of FURBY and DUEL MASTERS products. These decreases were partially offset by increased revenues from LITTLEST PET SHOP, PLAYSKOOL and MONOPOLY products. To a lesser extent, 2006 net revenues were also positively impacted by increased sales of MY LITTLE PONY, TRANSFORMERS, and PLAY DOH products as well as the reintroduction of the BABY ALIVE doll. International segment operating profit decreased 15% to $90,893 in 2006 from $106,435 in 2005. Operating profit in 2006 was positively impacted by approximately $4,900 due to the translation of foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar. The decrease in operating profit is the result of decreased gross profit primarily as the result of the decrease in net revenues, partially offset by decreases in royalties and amortization expense as a result of the decrease in sales of STAR WARS products. International segment net revenues for the year ended December 25, 2005 increased by 1% to $988,591 from $977,128 in 2004. In 2005, net revenues were negatively impacted by approximately $10,000 as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar. The increase in revenues was primarily the result of increased sales of STAR WARS products in 2005 and, to a lesser extent, the successful reintroduction of LITTLEST PET SHOP and FURBY products and the introduction of B DAMAN products. These increases were partly offset by decreased sales of BEYBLADE and ACTION MAN products as well as decreased sales of FURREAL FRIENDS and VIDEONOW products. Revenues for board games grew internationally in 2005, while the Company experienced decreased revenues in its trading card games, primarily DUEL MASTERS and MAGIC: THE GATHERING. International operating profit increased 13% to $106,435 in 2005 from $94,487 in 2004. Increased gross profit as a result of increased revenues was partially offset by higher amortization and royalty expenses as a result of the higher sales of licensed products, primarily STAR WARS products, in 2005. International operating profit was negatively impacted by approximately $4,500 due to the translation of foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar. Gross Profit The Companys gross profit margin increased to 58.6% for the year ended December 31, 2006 from 58.3% in 2005. This increase is due to increased revenues from certain core brand products that have higher gross margins, such as LITTLEST PET SHOP products and traditional board games, such as MONOPOLY. Gross profit in 2006 was negatively impacted by a charge of approximately $10,300 related to the Companys decision to transfer certain manufacturing activities from its Ireland manufacturing facility to its suppliers in China. Gross margin in 2005 was also negatively impacted by inventory obsolescence and customer allowances on plug and play games. The Companys gross profit margin increased slightly to 58.3% for the year ended December 25, 2005 from 58.2% in 2004. This increase was primarily due to increased sales of STAR WARS products. Gross profit margin in 2005 was also impacted by decreased sales of VIDEONOW products that have lower gross margins. These increases were largely offset by inventory obsolescence and customer allowances on plug and play games as well as lower sales of trading card games that carry a higher gross margin. The Company aggressively monitors its levels of inventory, attempting to avoid unnecessary expenditures of cash and potential charges related to obsolescence. The Companys failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand could result in overproduction of less popular items, which could result in higher obsolescence costs, causing a reduction in gross profit. 25 Table of Contents Expenses The Companys operating expenses, stated as percentages of net revenues, are illustrated below for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2006: 2006 2005 2004 Amortization 2.5 % 3.3 % 2.4 % Royalties 5.4 8.0 7.4 Research and product development 5.4 4.9 5.2 Advertising 11.7 11.8 12.9 Selling, distribution and administration 21.7 20.2 20.5 Amortization expense decreased to $78,934 in 2006 from $102,035 in 2005. This decrease was due to decreased amortization of STAR WARS property rights as a result of the decrease in sales of STAR WARS products in 2006. Amortization of these property rights is based on actual sales of products as a portion of total expected sales of related products related to this licensing right. Amortization is generally higher in years where theatrical or DVD releases occur, such as in 2005. Amortization expense increased to $102,035 in 2005 from $70,562 in 2004 as a result of increased amortization of STAR WARS property rights due to the theatrical and DVD releases of STAR WARS EPISODE III: REVENGE OF THE SITH. Royalty expense decreased to $169,731 or 5.4% of net revenues in 2006 compared to $247,283 or 8.0% of net revenues in 2005. This decrease primarily relates to the decrease in sales of STAR WARS products in 2006, as a higher percentage of net revenues were from the Companys core brands. Royalty expense in 2005 increased to $247,283 or 8.0% of net revenues in 2005 from $223,193 or 7.4% of net revenues in 2004. Increased royalty expense in 2005 related primarily to increased sales of STAR WARS related products. The increase from STAR WARS products was partially offset by lower sales of BEYBLADE, SHREK and DISNEY products. The Company expects royalty expense to increase in both dollars and as a percentage of net revenues in 2007 compared to 2006, due to significant anticipated revenues from MARVEL products in 2007 primarily due to the anticipated release of SPIDER MAN 3 in May. In addition, in 2007, the Company will incur additional royalty expense on certain sales of TRANSFORMERS products that are related to the major motion picture release anticipated in July of 2007. Research and product development expense increased in 2006 to $171,358 or 5.4% of net revenues from $150,586 or 4.9% of net revenues in 2005. This increase is the result of development expenses related to the MARVEL line of products as well as increased investment in the PLAYSKOOL line. Research and product development decreased in 2005 to $150,586 or 4.9% of net revenues from $157,162 or 5.2% of net revenues in 2004. The decrease reflected increased efficiencies in the product development of certain toy lines resulting from a realignment in 2004. This realignment streamlined the workforce of these toy lines and moved certain product development activity outside of the U.S. While the Company strives to incur these costs in the most efficient manner possible, investment in research and product development costs is an important component to the Companys strategy to grow core brands and to create new and innovative toy and game products. Advertising expense in 2006 was $368,996 or 11.7% of net revenues which was consistent with the 2005 expense of $366,371 or 11.8% of net revenues. Advertising expense in 2005 decreased in dollars and as a percentage of net revenues from $387,523 or 12.9% of net revenues in 2004. The Company continues to focus on marketing to raise awareness of its core brands, as well as to introduce new products. Selling, distribution and administration expenses were $682,214 or 21.7% of net revenues in 2006 compared to $624,560 or 20.2% in 2005. Approximately $20,000 of this increase relates to the Companys adoption of SFAS 123R in 2006 which required that the Company measure all stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in its financial statements. The remainder of the increase primarily relates to increased sales and marketing expense in 2006 associated with the higher level of sales and increased bonus and incentive provisions due to the strong performance of the Company in 2006. Selling, distribution and administration expenses increased in dollars but decreased as a percentage of net revenues to $624,560 or 20.2% of net revenues in 2005, from $614,401 or 20.5% of net revenues in 2004. The 26 Table of Contents increase in administration costs in dollars in 2005 over 2004 primarily reflected increased performance incentive bonus provisions reflecting the Companys improved performance. Interest Expense Interest expense continued to decrease in 2006 to $27,521 from $30,537 in 2005 and $31,698 in 2004. Decreases in interest expense resulting from lower levels of debt were partially offset by increases resulting from higher interest rates in 2006. The decrease in interest expense mainly reflects the reduction in the Companys long term debt. The Company repurchased or repaid principal amounts of long term debt of $32,743 in 2006, $93,303 in 2005, and $56,697 in 2004. The Company will continue to review the amount of long term debt outstanding as part of its strategic capital structure objective of maintaining a debt to capitalization ratio between 25% and 30%. Interest Income Interest income was $27,609 in 2006 compared to $24,157 in 2005 and $7,729 in 2004. Interest income includes $5,200 in 2006 related to a long term deposit that was refunded during 2006 and approximately $4,100 in 2005 related to an IRS settlement. The increase in interest income reflects the Companys strong financial position. During a portion of 2006, the Company invested excess cash in auction rate securities, which generated a higher rate of return and contributed to the increase in interest income in 2006. In recent years the Company has reduced its long term debt which has reduced cash required to service debt and allowed the Company to retain and invest excess cash. Other (Income) Expense, Net Other (income) expense, net of $34,977 in 2006 compares to $(6,772) in 2005 and $8,955 in 2004. The major component of other (income) expense is non cash (income) expense related to the change in fair value of certain warrants required to be classified as a liability. These warrants are required to be adjusted to their fair value each quarter through earnings. For 2006, 2005 and 2004, expense (income) related to the change in fair value of these warrants was $31,770, $(2,080) and $(12,710), respectively. The fair value of these warrants is primarily affected by the Companys stock price, but is also affected by the Companys stock price volatility and dividends, as well as risk free interest rates. Assuming the Companys stock volatility and dividend payments, as well as risk free interest rates remain constant, the fair value of the warrants would increase and the Company would recognize a charge to earnings as the price of the Companys stock increases. If the price of the Companys stock decreases and the Companys stock volatility, dividend payments, and the risk free interest rates remain constant, the fair value of the warrants will decrease and the Company will recognize income. Based on a hypothetical increase in the Companys stock price to $30.00 per share at December 31, 2006 from its actual price of $27.25 a share on that date, the Company would have recognized a non cash charge of approximately $52,190 rather than actual non cash charge recorded of $31,770 for the year ended December 31, 2006, to reflect the change in the fair value of the warrants from their fair value of $123,860 at December 25, 2005. In addition to the above, other (income) expense, net in 2006 and 2004 also include $2,629 and $8,988, respectively, representing write downs of the value of the common stock of Infogrames, held by the Company as an available for sale investment. This write down resulted from an other than temporary decline in the fair value of this investment. Income Taxes Income tax expense was 32.6% of pretax earnings in 2006 compared with 31.8% of pretax earnings in 2005 and 24.6% of pretax earnings in 2004. Income tax expense for 2006 includes approximately $7,800 of discrete tax events, primarily relating to the settlement of various tax exams in multiple jurisdictions. Income tax expense for 2005 includes approximately $25,800 related to the repatriation of $547,000 of foreign earnings pursuant to the special incentive provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Income tax expense for 2005 was also reduced by approximately $4,000, due primarily to the settlement of an Internal 27 Table of Contents Revenue Service examination of tax years ending in December 2001. Absent these items and the effect of the adjustment of certain warrants to their fair value, which has no tax effect, the 2006 effective tax rate would have been 27.6% compared with 24.9% in 2005 and 25.9% in 2004. The increase in the adjusted rate to 27.6% in 2006 from 24.9% in 2005 was the result of higher earnings in jurisdictions with higher statutory tax rates. The decrease in the adjusted rate, to 24.9% in 2005 from 25.9% in 2004, was due to the tax impact of higher operating profits in jurisdictions with lower statutory tax rates. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company has historically generated a significant amount of cash from operations. In 2006, the Company funded its operations and liquidity needs primarily through cash flows from operations, and, when needed, proceeds from its accounts receivable securitization program and borrowings under its unsecured credit facilities. During 2007, the Company expects to continue to fund its working capital needs primarily through operations and, when needed, using proceeds from the accounts receivable securitization program and borrowings under its available lines of credit. The Company believes that the funds available to it, including cash expected to be generated from operations and funds available through its securitization program and other available lines of credit, are adequate to meet its needs for 2007. During the last five fiscal years, as part of its strategy of reducing long term debt and its overall debt to capitalization ratio, the Company has repurchased or repaid approximately $679,000 in aggregate principal amount of long term debt, primarily using cash from operations. Remaining principal amounts of long term debt at December 31, 2006, were $494,983. The Company believes that the reduction in its debt to capitalization ratio has improved its liquidity situation by decreasing cash required to service outstanding debt and increasing the ability of the Company to obtain additional financing should the need to do so arise in the future. At December 31, 2006, cash and cash equivalents, net of short term borrowings, were $704,818 compared to $927,592 and $707,043 at December 25, 2005 and December 26, 2004, respectively. Hasbro generated $320,647, $496,624, and $358,506 of cash from its operating activities in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The higher cash flows from operations in 2005 compared to 2006 and 2004 is primarily due to the mix of products in 2005 net revenues. Net earnings in 2005 included increased non cash expenses primarily as a result of increased STAR WARS revenues. Increased royalty expense in 2005 related to revenues from STAR WARS products, most of which had been paid in prior years. In 2006 and 2005, operating cash flows were impacted by royalty advances paid of $105,000 and $35,000 related to MARVEL and STAR WARS agreements, respectively. In addition, the Company had increased amortization expense in 2005, which did not impact the cash flows from operations. Accounts receivable increased to $556,287 at December 31, 2006 from $523,232 at December 25, 2005. Fourth quarter days sales outstanding increased slightly to 45 days in 2006 from 44 days in 2005. Fourth quarter days sales outstanding in 2004 was 49. The increase in days sales outstanding from 2005 primarily reflects increases in international accounts receivable due to the weaker U.S. dollar in 2006. The December 31, 2006 accounts receivable balance includes an increase of approximately $18,800 related to the currency impact of the weaker U.S. dollar. The Company has a revolving accounts receivable securitization facility whereby the Company is able to sell undivided interests in qualifying accounts receivable on an ongoing basis. At December 31, 2006 and December 25, 2005, there was $250,000 sold at each period end under this program. Inventories increased to $203,337 at December 31, 2006 from $179,398 at December 25, 2005. The increase in inventory represents higher levels of inventory at December 31, 2006 primarily due to anticipated sales of MARVEL products in early 2007. In addition, inventories increased approximately $6,100 due to the weaker U.S. dollar in 2006. The decrease in inventory to $179,398 at December 25, 2005 from $194,780 at December 26, 2004 reflects higher levels of inventory at December 26, 2004 due to lower levels of sales in the fourth quarter of 2004 and, to a lesser extent, lower international inventories in U.S. dollars as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar in 2005. Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased to $243,291 at December 31, 2006 from $185,297 at December 25, 2005. This increase is primarily due to a royalty advance paid to MARVEL in 2006, of which 28 Table of Contents approximately $87,400 is recorded in prepaid assets and $12,930 is shown in long term assets at December 31, 2006. Prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased to $185,297 in 2005 from $219,735 in 2004. This decrease is primarily related to decreased prepaid royalties as a result of the increased sales of STAR WARS products in 2005. Generally, when the Company enters into a licensing agreement for entertainment based properties, an advance royalty payment is required at the inception of the agreement. This payment is then recognized in the consolidated statement of operations as the related sales are recorded. The decrease related to prepaid royalties was partially offset by increased deferred taxes. With respect to the MARVEL and STAR WARS licenses, the Company has prepaid royalties recorded in both current and non current assets. Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased to $895,311 at December 31, 2006 from $863,280 at December 25, 2005. $31,770 of this increase relates to the increase in fair value of the Lucas warrants that the Company is required to record as liabilities under SFAS 150. As a result of SFAS 150, the Company classifies these warrants containing a put option as a current liability and adjusts the amount of this liability to its fair value on a periodic basis. Increases from higher accrued bonus and incentive payments as a result of the Companys strong performance in 2006 were offset by decreases in other accrued amounts, principally accrued royalties. Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased to $863,280 at December 25, 2005 from $806,528 at December 26, 2004. This primarily reflected an increase in accrued income taxes primarily as a result of improved earnings in 2005 and, to a lesser extent, taxes payable related to earnings repatriated under the American Jobs Creation Act (the Act). In December 2005, the Company repatriated approximately $547,000 under this Act. The increase from accrued income taxes was partially offset by lower accrued royalties at December 25, 2005 due to lower sales of BEYBLADE and SHREK products in the fourth quarter of 2005. These contracts did not require the Company to prepay royalties and these amounts were paid in arrears. Cash flows from investing activities were a net utilization of $83,604, $120,671, and $84,967 in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. During 2005, the Company expended $65,000 to reacquire the digital gaming rights for its owned or controlled properties from Infogrames Entertainment SA (Infogrames). These rights were previously held by Infogrames on an exclusive basis as a result of a licensing agreement entered into during 2000. In addition, the Company expended $14,179 to purchase the assets of Wrebbit Inc., a Montreal based creator and manufacturer of innovative puzzles. In 2005, the Company also had proceeds from the sales of property, plant and equipment of $33,083. These proceeds came primarily from the sale of the Companys former manufacturing facility in Spain. During 2006, the Company expended approximately $82,000 on additions to its property, plant and equipment while during 2005 and 2004 it expended approximately $71,000 and $79,000, respectively. Of these amounts, 63% in 2006, 61% in 2005, and 58% in 2004 were for purchases of tools, dies and molds related to the Companys products. In 2007, the Company expects capital expenditures to increase and be in the range of $90,000 to $110,000, primarily as the result of increased tooling requirements for the MARVEL line. During the three years ended December 31, 2006, depreciation and amortization of plant and equipment was $67,773, $78,097, and $75,618, respectively. In 2004, the Company acquired the remaining unowned interest in its Latin America operations for total consideration of $9,824. This purchase resulted in an increase in goodwill in the amount of $9,390. The Company made no acquisitions of businesses in 2006. The Company commits to inventory production, advertising and marketing expenditures prior to the peak third and fourth quarter retail selling season. Accounts receivable increase during the third and fourth quarter as customers increase their purchases to meet expected consumer demand in the holiday season. Due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling period, payments for these accounts receivable are generally not due until the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the subsequent year. This timing difference between expenditures and cash collections on accounts receivable makes it necessary for the Company to borrow varying amounts during the year. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company primarily utilized cash from operations and its accounts receivable securitization program to fund its operations. The Company is party to an accounts receivable securitization program, which was amended in December 2006, whereby the Company sells, on an ongoing basis, substantially all of its U.S. trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, Hasbro Receivables Funding, LLC (HRF). HRF is consolidated with the Company for financial reporting purposes. The securitization program then allows HRF to sell, on a revolving basis, an undivided interest of up to $250,000 in the eligible receivables it holds to 29 Table of Contents certain bank conduits. During the period from the first day of the October fiscal month through the last day of the following January fiscal month, this limit is increased to $300,000. The program provides the Company with a cost effective source of working capital. Based on the amount of eligible accounts receivable as of December 31, 2006, the Company had $300,000 available to sell under this program of which $250,000 was utilized. In June 2006, the Company entered into a five year revolving credit agreement (the Agreement) which provides the Company with a $300,000 committed borrowing facility that replaced the prior credit facility. The Company has the ability to request increases in the committed facility in additional increments of at least $50,000, up to a total of committed facility of $500,000. The Company is not required to maintain compensating balances under the Agreement. The Agreement contains certain financial covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements, and certain other limitations typical of an investment grade facility, including with respect to liens, mergers and incurrence of indebtedness. The Company was in compliance with all covenants as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006. The Company had no borrowings outstanding under its committed revolving credit facility at December 31, 2006. The Company also has other uncommitted lines from various banks, of which approximately $37,755 was utilized at December 31, 2006. Amounts available and unused under the committed line at December 31, 2006 were approximately $297,131. Net cash utilized by financing activities was $467,279 in 2006. Of this amount, $456,744, which includes transaction costs, was used to repurchase shares of the Companys common stock. In July 2006, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $350,000 in common stock subsequent to the full utilization of the Board of Directors May 2005 authorization of $350,000. During 2006, the Company repurchased 22,767 shares at an average price of $20.03. In addition, $32,743 was used to repay long term debt. Dividends paid were $75,282 in 2006 reflecting the increase in the Companys quarterly dividend rate to $.12 per share in 2006 compared to $.09 per share in 2005. These uses of cash were partially offset by cash receipts of $86,257 from the exercise of employee stock options. Net cash utilized by financing activities was $158,641 in 2005. This amount included repayments in principal amount of long term debt totaling $93,303. These amounts primarily related to $71,970 of bonds that matured in November of 2005. The remaining amount related to repayment of long term debt associated with the Companys former manufacturing facility in Spain. Dividends paid increased to $58,901 as a result of the increase of the quarterly dividend rate to $0.09 in 2005 from $0.06. In 2005, the Company repurchased 2,386 shares at an average price of $20.10 under the Board of Directors May 2005 authorization. The total cost of these repurchases, including transaction costs, was $48,030. The Company received $45,278 in 2005 in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options. Net cash utilized by financing activities was $75,824 in 2004. This amount included repurchases in principal amount of long term debt totaling $56,697 in connection with the Companys strategy of reducing its overall debt and improving its debt to capitalization ratio. The Company received $25,836 from the exercise of stock options during the year. Cash paid for dividends in 2004 was $37,088. At December 31, 2006, the Company has outstanding $249,996 in principal amount of senior convertible debentures due 2021. The senior convertible debentures bear interest at 2.75%, which could be subject to an upward adjustment in the rate, not to exceed 11%, should the price of the Companys stock trade at or below $9.72 per share for 20 of the 30 trading days preceding the fifth day prior to an interest payment date. This contingent interest feature represents a derivative instrument that is recorded on the balance sheet at its fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in the statement of operations. If the closing price of the Companys stock exceeds $23.76 for at least 20 trading days, within the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the calendar quarter, or upon other specified events, the debentures will be convertible at an initial conversion price of $21.60 in the next calendar quarter. At December 31, 2006, this conversion feature was met and the bonds are convertible through March 31, 2007 at which time the conversion feature will be reassessed. In addition, if the closing price of the Companys stock exceeds $27.00 for at least 20 trading days in any 30 day period, the Company has the right to call the debentures by giving notice to the holders of the debentures. During a prescribed notice period, the holders of the debentures have the right to convert their debentures in accordance with the conversion terms described above. The holders of 30 Table of Contents these debentures may also put the notes back to Hasbro in December 2011 and December 2016 at the original principal amount. At that time, the purchase price may be paid in cash, shares of common stock or a combination of the two, at the Companys discretion. While the Companys current intent is to settle in cash any puts exercised, there can be no guarantee that the Company will have the funds necessary to settle this obligation in cash. On December 1, 2005, the holders of these debentures had the option to put these notes back to Hasbro. On that date, the Company redeemed $4 of these notes in cash. The Company has remaining principal amounts of long term debt at December 31, 2006 of approximately $494,983. As detailed below in Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments, this debt is due at varying times from 2008 through 2028. In addition, the Company is committed to guaranteed royalty and other contractual payments of approximately $91,890 in 2007, which includes $70,000 of royalty commitments related to a contract signed in January 2006 with Marvel Entertainment, Inc. and Marvel Characters, Inc. Also, as detailed in Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments, the Company has certain warrants, currently recorded in accrued liabilities, that may be settleable for, at the Companys option, $100,000 in cash or $110,000 in the Companys stock, such stock being valued at the time of the exercise of the option. The Company believes that cash from operations, including the securitization facility, and, if necessary, its line of credit, will allow the Company to meet these and other obligations listed. The Company will continue to review the amount of long term debt outstanding as part of its strategic capital structure objective of maintaining a debt to capitalization ratio between 25% and 30%. In July 2006, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $350,000 in common stock, replacing a fully utilized prior authorization of $350,000 dated May 2005. Purchases of the Companys common stock may be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The Company has no obligation to repurchase shares under the open authorization, and the timing, actual number, and the value of the shares that are repurchased will depend on a number of factors, including the price of the Companys stock. The Company may suspend or discontinue the program at any time and there is no expiration date. In 2006, the Company repurchased 22,767 shares at an average price of $20.03 under these authorizations. The total cost of these repurchases, including transaction costs, was $456,744. Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As such, management is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented. The significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the Companys reported financial results include sales allowances, inventory valuation, recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets, recoverability of royalty advances and commitments, pension costs and obligations, and stock based compensation. Sales Allowances Sales allowances for customer promotions, discounts and returns are recorded as a reduction of revenue when the related revenue is recognized. Revenue from product sales is recognized upon passing of title to the customer, generally at the time of shipment. Revenue from product sales, less related sales allowances, is added to royalty revenue and reflected as net revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company routinely commits to promotional sales allowance programs with customers. These allowances primarily relate to fixed programs, which the customer earns based on purchases of Company products during the year. Discounts are recorded as a reduction of related revenue at the time of sale. While many of the allowances are based on fixed amounts, certain of the allowances, such as the returns allowance, are based on market data, historical trends and information from customers and are therefore subject to estimation. For its allowance programs that are not fixed, such as returns, the Company estimates these amounts using a combination of historical experience and current market conditions. These estimates are reviewed periodically 31 Table of Contents against actual results and any adjustments are recorded at that time as an increase or decrease to net revenues. During 2006, there have been no material adjustments to the Companys estimates. Inventory Valuation Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market. Based upon a consideration of quantities on hand, actual and projected sales volume, anticipated product selling prices and product lines planned to be discontinued, slow moving and obsolete inventory is written down to its net realizable value. Failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand could result in the Company under producing popular items or overproducing less popular items. Management estimates are monitored on a quarterly basis and a further adjustment to reduce inventory to its net realizable value is recorded, as an increase to cost of sales, when deemed necessary under the lower of cost or market standard. During 2006, there have been no material adjustments to the Companys estimates. Recoverability of Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually. If an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, the Company will perform an interim test at that time. The impairment test begins by allocating goodwill and intangible assets to applicable reporting units. Goodwill is then tested using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach, which looks to the present value of expected future cash flows. The first step is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an indication from the first step that one exists. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value which is also calculated using an income approach. The Companys annual impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter of 2006 and no impairment was indicated. The estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge. The estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate. The use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge. At December 31, 2006, the Company has goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives of $545,676 recorded on the balance sheet. Intangible assets, other than those with indefinite lives, are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Recoverability of the value of these intangible assets is measured by a comparison of the assets carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets were considered to be impaired, the impairment would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value based on estimated future discounted cash flows. The estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge. The estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate. The use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge. Intangible assets covered under this policy were $456,519 at December 31, 2006. During 2006, there were no impairment charges related to these intangible assets. Recoverability of Royalty Advances and Commitments The recoverability of royalty advances and contractual obligations with respect to minimum guaranteed royalties is assessed by comparing the remaining minimum guaranty to the estimated future sales forecasts and 32 Table of Contents related cash flow projections to be derived from the related product. If sales forecasts and related cash flows from the particular product do not support the recoverability of the remaining minimum guaranty or, if the Company decides to discontinue a product line with royalty advances or commitments, a charge to royalty expense to write off the remaining minimum guaranty is required. The preparation of revenue forecasts and related cash flows for these products requires judgments and estimates. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in the assessment of anticipated revenues and cash flows related to these products could result in a change to the assessment of recoverability of remaining minimum guaranteed royalties. At December 31, 2006, the Company had $181,561 of prepaid royalties, $116,792 of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $64,769 which are included in other assets. Pension Costs and Obligations The Company, except for certain international subsidiaries, has pension plans covering substantially all of its full time employees. Pension expense is based on actuarial computations of current and future benefits using estimates for expected return on assets, expected compensation increases, and applicable discount rates. The estimates for the Companys domestic plans are established at the Companys measurement date of September 30 to measure the liabilities and assets of the plans as of that date and to establish the expense for the upcoming year. As a result of the Companys adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, (SFAS No. 158) in December 2006, the Company will be required to change the measurement date for its pension plans to match its year end date by 2008. The Company estimates expected return on assets using a weighted average rate based on historical market data for the investment classes of assets held by the plan, the allocation of plan assets among those investment classes, and the current economic environment. Based on this information, the Companys estimate of expected return on domestic plan assets was 8.75% in 2006, 2005 and 2004. A decrease in the estimate used for expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense, while an increase in this estimate would decrease pension expense. A decrease of .25% in the estimate of expected return on plan assets would have increased 2006 pension expense for U.S. plans by approximately $550. Expected compensation increases are estimated using a combination of historical and expected compensation increases. Based on this analysis, the Companys estimate of expected long term compensation increases for its U.S. plans was 4.0% in 2006, 2005 and 2004. Increases in estimated compensation increases would result in higher pension expense while decreases would lower pension expense. Discount rates are selected based upon rates of return at the measurement date on high quality corporate bond investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits. Based on this long term corporate bond yield at September 30, 2006, the Companys measurement date for its pension assets and liabilities, the Companys discount rate for its domestic plans used for the calculation of 2007 pension expense was 5.75% compared to a rate of 5.50% used in the calculation of 2006 pension expense and 5.75% used in the calculation of 2005 pension expense. A decrease in the discount rate would result in greater pension expense while an increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense. A decrease of .25% in the Companys discount rate would have increased 2006 pension expense and the 2006 projected benefit obligation by approximately $756 and $9,395, respectively. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and, if outside a certain corridor, amortized over future periods and, therefore generally affect recognized expense in future periods. In December 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 158, which required that the funded status of the plans be recognized on the Companys balance sheet and any unrecognized gains or losses be recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2006, the Company has unrecognized actuarial losses of $48,879 included in accumulated other comprehensive income related to its defined benefit pension plans. Assets in the plan are valued on the basis of their fair market value on the measurement date. 33 Table of Contents Stock Based Compensation The Company has a stock based compensation plan for employees and non employee members of the Companys Board of Directors. Under this plan, the Company grants stock options at or above the fair market value of the Companys stock. On December 26, 2005, the first day of fiscal 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 123R, which requires the Company to measure all stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in its consolidated financial statements. The Company uses the Black Scholes option pricing model to value the stock options that are granted under these plans. The Black Scholes method includes four significant assumptions: (1) expected term of the options, (2) risk free interest rate, (3) expected dividend yield, and (4) expected stock price volatility. For the Companys 2006 stock option grant, the weighted average expected term was approximately 5 years. This amount is based on a review of employees exercise history relating to stock options as well as the contractual term of the option. The weighted average risk free interest rate used for 2006 stock option grants was 4.98%. This estimate was based on the interest rate available on U.S. treasury securities with durations that approximate the expected term of the option. For 2006 stock option grants, the weighted average expected dividend yield used was 2.55% which is based on the Companys current annual dividend amount divided by the stock price on the date of the grant. The weighted average expected stock price volatility used for 2006 stock option grants was 24%. This amount was derived using a combination of historical price volatility over the most recent period approximating the expected term of the option and implied price volatility. Implied price volatility represents the volatility implied in publicly traded options on the Companys stock, which the Company believes represents the expected future volatility of the Companys stock price. The Company believes that since this is a market based estimate, it can provide a better estimate of expected future volatility. In July 2006, as part of its employee stock based compensation plan, the Company issued contingent stock performance awards, which provide the recipients with the ability to earn shares of the Companys common stock based on the Companys achievement of stated cumulative diluted earnings per share and cumulative net revenue targets over a ten quarter period beginning July 3, 2006 and ending December 28, 2008. Each award has a target number of shares of common stock associated with such award which may be earned by the recipient if the Company achieves the stated diluted earnings per share and net revenue targets. The measurement of the expense related to this award is based on the Companys current estimate of revenues and diluted earnings per share over the performance period. Changes in these estimates may impact the expense recognized related to these awards. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments In the normal course of its business, the Company enters into contracts related to obtaining rights to produce product under license, which may require the payment of minimum guarantees, as well as contracts related to the leasing of facilities and equipment. In addition, the Company has $494,983 in principal amount of long term debt outstanding at December 31, 2006, excluding fair value adjustments. Future payments required under these and other obligations as of December 31, 2006 are as follows: Payments Due by Fiscal Year Certain Contractual Obligations 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total Long term debt $ 135,092 359,891 494,983 Interest payments on long term debt 22,436 22,436 14,128 14,128 14,128 192,058 279,314 Operating lease commitments 28,149 25,529 21,733 10,979 10,487 22,914 119,791 Future minimum guaranteed contractual payments 91,890 12,380 13,900 41,810 4,800 164,780 Purchase commitments 249,554 249,554 $ 392,029 195,437 49,761 66,917 29,415 574,863 1,308,422 The Companys agreement with MARVEL also requires the Company to make minimum expenditures on marketing and promotional activities, including the spending of at least $15,000 associated with the motion 34 Table of Contents picture SPIDER MAN 3, which is included in purchase commitments above. Certain of the future minimum guaranteed contractual royalty payments are contingent upon the theatrical release of the related entertainment property. Included in the Thereafter column above is $249,996 in principal amount of senior convertible debt due 2021. The holders of these debentures may put the notes back to the Company in December 2011 and December 2016 at the principal amount. At that time, the purchase price may be paid in cash, shares of common stock or a combination of the two. In addition, at December 31, 2006, these debentures may be converted to shares at an initial conversion price of $21.60 per share through March 31, 2007, at which time the contingent conversion feature will be reassessed. If the Companys stock exceeds $23.76 for at least 20 trading days, within the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of a calendar quarter, or upon other specified events, the debentures will be convertible at the initial conversion price of $21.60. In addition to the above, the Company has certain warrants outstanding at December 31, 2006 that contain a put option that would require the Company to repurchase the warrants for a price to be paid, at the Companys election, of either $100,000 in cash or $110,000 in shares of the Companys common stock, such stock being valued at the time of the exercise of the option. The Companys current intent is to settle this put option in cash if exercised. In accordance with SFAS 150, these warrants are recorded as a current liability in the amount of $155,630, which represented the fair value of these warrants at December 31, 2006. In addition, the Company expects to make contributions totaling approximately $7,100 to its pension plans in 2007. The Company also has letters of credit and related instruments of approximately $71,000 at December 31, 2006. Financial Risk Management The Company is exposed to market risks attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as the result of sourcing products priced in U.S. dollars, Hong Kong dollars and Euros while marketing those products in more than twenty currencies. Results of operations may be affected primarily by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso and, to a lesser extent, currencies in Latin American and Asia Pacific countries. To manage this exposure, the Company has hedged a portion of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using forward foreign exchange contracts. The Company estimates that a hypothetical immediate 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies could result in an approximate $22,000 decrease in the fair value of these instruments. A decrease in the fair value of these instruments would be substantially offset by decreases in the related forecasted foreign currency transaction. The Company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or short term borrowing positions in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company believes, however, that the on going risk on the net exposure should not be material to its financial condition. In addition, the Companys revenues and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency rates. From time to time, affiliates of the Company may make or receive intercompany loans in currencies other than their functional currency. The Company manages this exposure at the time the loan is made by using foreign exchange contracts. Other than as set forth above, the Company does not hedge foreign currency exposures. The Company reflects all derivatives at their fair value as an asset or liability on the balance sheet. The Company does not speculate in foreign currency exchange contracts. At December 31, 2006, these contracts had unrealized losses of $2,574, which are recorded in accrued liabilities. Included in accumulated other comprehensive income at December 31, 2006 are deferred losses of $2,116, net of tax. At December 31, 2006, the Company had fixed rate long term debt, excluding fair value adjustments, of $494,983. At December 31, 2006, the Company had fixed for floating interest rate swaps with notional amounts of $75,000. The interest rate swaps are designed to adjust a portion of the Companys debt subject to a fixed interest rate. The interest rate swaps are matched with specific long term debt issues and are designated and effective as hedges of the change in the fair value of the associated debt. Changes in fair value of these contracts are wholly offset in earnings by changes in the fair value of the related long term debt. At 35 Table of Contents December 31, 2006, the fair value of these contracts were a liability of $66, which is included in long term liabilities, with a corresponding fair value adjustment to decrease long term debt. Changes in interest rates affect the fair value of fixed rate debt not hedged by interest rate swap agreements while affecting the earnings and cash flows of the long term debt hedged by the interest rate swaps. The Company estimates that a hypothetical one percentage point decrease or increase in interest rates would increase or decrease the fair value of this long term debt by approximately $15,600 or $12,800, respectively. A hypothetical one percentage point change in interest rates would increase or decrease 2007 pretax earnings and cash flows by $731 and $377, respectively. The Economy and Inflation The principal market for the Companys products is the retail sector. Revenues from the Companys top 5 customers, all retailers, accounted for approximately 53%, 53%, and 50% of its consolidated net revenues in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In the past three years certain customers in the retail sector have experienced economic difficulty. The Company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems appropriate. The Companys revenue pattern continues to show the second half of the year to be more significant to its overall business for the full year. In 2006, approximately 68% of the Companys full year net revenues were recognized in the second half of the year. Although the Company expects that this concentration will continue, particularly as more of its business shifts to larger customers with order patterns concentrated in the second half of the year, this concentration may be less in years where the Company has products related to a major motion picture release that occurs in the first half of the year. In 2007, the Company will have products related to two major motion picture releases, SPIDER MAN 3 in May of 2007 and TRANSFORMERS in July of 2007. The concentration of sales in the second half of the year increases the risk of (a) underproduction of popular items, (b) overproduction of less popular items, and (c) failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules. The business of the Company is characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences in the degree of consumer acceptance of a product line, product availability, marketing strategies, inventory levels, policies of retailers and differences in overall economic conditions. The trend of larger retailers has been to maintain lower inventories throughout the year and purchase a greater percentage of product within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer selling season, which includes Christmas. Quick response inventory management practices now being used result in more orders being placed for immediate delivery and fewer orders being placed well in advance of shipment. To the extent that retailers do not sell as much of their year end inventory purchases during this holiday selling season as they had anticipated, their demand for additional product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed, thus negatively impacting the Companys revenues. In addition, the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the Companys significant retailers could negatively impact the Companys future revenues. The effect of inflation on the Companys operations during 2006 was not significant and the Company will continue its policy of monitoring costs and adjusting prices, accordingly. Other Information In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), which applies to all tax positions accounted for under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a two step process for the measurement of uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is a determination of whether the tax position should be recognized in the financial statements. The second step determines the measurement of the tax position. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition of such tax positions, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and disclosure. FIN 48 was applicable to the Company as of January 1, 2007, the first day of fiscal 2007. The adoption of FIN 48 is expected to decrease the Companys current liabilities and increase the Companys long term liabilities. Overall, tax liabilities are not expected to change by a material amount. 36 Table of Contents In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, (SFAS No. 157) which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is applicable for the Company as of December 31, 2007, the first day of fiscal 2008. The Company is currently evaluating SFAS No. 157 and the potential effect it will have on its consolidated balance sheet and results of operations. In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS No. 159). SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 159 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2008. The Company has not yet determined the impact, if any, from the adoption of SFAS No. 159. The Company is not aware of any material amounts of potential exposure relating to environmental matters and does not believe its environmental compliance costs or liabilities to be material to its operating results or financial position.
