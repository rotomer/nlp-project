FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This report, including Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward looking statements about Huntington. These include descriptions of products or services, plans, or objectives of its management for future operations, and forecasts of its revenues, earnings, or other measures of economic performance. Forward looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. By their nature, forward looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks, and uncertainties. A number of factors, including but not limited to, those set forth under the heading "Business Risks" included in Item 1 of this report and other factors described from time to time in Huntingtons other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, could cause actual conditions, events, or results to differ significantly from those described in the forward looking statements. The management of Huntington encourages readers of this report to understand forward looking statements to be strategic objectives rather than absolute targets of future performance. Forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. Huntington does not update forward looking statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the forward looking statements are made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. The following discussion and analysis, the purpose of which is to provide investors and others with information that Huntingtons management believes to be necessary for an understanding of its financial condition, changes in financial condition, and results of operations, should be read in conjunction with the financial statements, notes, and other information contained in this document. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Note 1 to Huntingtons consolidated financial statements lists significant accounting policies used in the development and presentation of its financial statements. This discussion and analysis, the significant accounting policies, and other financial statement disclosures identify and address key variables and other qualitative and quantitative factors that are necessary for an understanding and evaluation of Huntington and its results of operations. STRATEGIC REFOCUSING AND OTHER RESTRUCTURING In July 2001, Huntington announced a strategic refocusing plan. This plan included the sale of Huntingtons Florida operations, the consolidation of numerous non Florida branch offices, credit related and other actions to strengthen Huntingtons balance sheet. These actions were designed to attain more positive revenue and earnings for shareholders and to improve capital efficiency. Huntington announced that it expected to record total restructuring and special charges of approximately $215.0 million pre tax ($140.0 million after tax) related to this refocusing plan. Through the end of 2001, these pre tax charges totaled $176.9 million ($115.0 million after tax, or $0.46 per share), and consisted of $71.7 million related to credit quality, $37.3 million for asset impairment, $16.2 million for the exit or curtailment of certain e commerce activities, $13.3 million related to owned or leased facilities that Huntington has or intends to vacate, and $38.4 million related to employee severance or retention, non recurring legal, accounting, consulting, reduction of ATMs, and other operational costs. See note 11 to Huntingtons consolidated financial statements for more information. In addition to the above, in the fourth quarter of 2001, Huntington recorded a $50.0 million pre tax charge to provision for loan losses to increase its loan loss reserve in light of the higher charge offs and non performing assets experienced in the second half of 2001. Huntington also issued $400.0 million in fixed and variable rate preferred 15 securities of its Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) subsidiary, of which $50.0 million was sold to the public and qualified for regulatory capital. This issuance gave rise to a tax benefit of $32.5 million. The combined charges related to the strategic refocusing plan and the items announced in the fourth quarter amounted to $226.9 million on a pre tax basis. Related income taxes were $111.9 million, resulting in after tax charges of $115.0 million. By the end of the first quarter of 2002, Huntington expects to complete its strategic refocusing plan. The final costs associated with the actions taken could be 5% to 7% higher than the original pre tax estimate of $215.0 million. The increase relates primarily to higher Florida and other employee severance and costs to exit certain e commerce activities. In 2000 and 1999, Huntington recorded special charges totaling $50.0 million ($32.5 million after tax, or $0.13 per share) and $96.8 million ($62.9 million after tax, or $0.25 per share), respectively. The entire charge in 2000 and $58.2 million of the 1999 special charges represent write downs of residual values related to Huntingtons vehicle lease portfolio. The 1999 special charges also included $38.6 million related to the companys "Huntington 2000+" program as well as other one time expenses, which included amounts paid for management consulting and other professional services, as well as a special cash award to employees for achievement of the program goals for 1999. "Huntington 2000+" was a collaborative effort among all employees to evaluate processes and procedures and the way Huntington conducts its business with a mission of maximizing efficiency through all aspects of the organization. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES (SPES), DERIVATIVES, AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Like other financial organizations, Huntington uses various commitments in its ordinary course of business that, under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), are not recorded in its financial statements. Huntington makes various commitments to extend credit to customers and to sell loans, and has obligations under operating type noncancelable leases for its facilities. More information related to these matters can be found in note 17 to Huntingtons consolidated financial statements. Huntington utilized two securitization trusts, or SPEs, in 2000 as funding sources. In the securitization transactions, loans that Huntington originated were sold to these trusts in exchange for funding collateralized by these loans. These trusts, under GAAP, are not consolidated in Huntingtons financial statements. As such, the loans originated by Huntington and the funding it obtained are not included on the balance sheet. Please refer to note 5 to Huntingtons consolidated financial statements for more information regarding loan securitizations. Huntington uses a variety of derivatives, principally interest rate swaps, in its asset and liability management activities to protect against the risk of adverse interest rate movements on either cash flows or market value of certain assets and liabilities. New accounting rules adopted by Huntington this year require on balance sheet recognition of the fair value of certain derivatives. This, along with other information regarding derivatives, are discussed under the "Interest Rate Risk and Liquidity Management" section of this report and also in note 14 to Huntingtons consolidated financial statements. Various directors and executive officers of Huntington are customers of The Huntington National Bank, Huntingtons bank subsidiary, and other affiliates and had transactions with these affiliates in the ordinary course of business. Directors and executive officers of Huntington may also be affiliated with entities that are customers of Huntington and its affiliates, which enter into transactions with these affiliates in the ordinary course of business. Transactions with directors, executive officers, and their affiliates have been on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral on loans, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with others and did not involve more than the normal risk of collectibility or present other unfavorable features. A summary of the indebtedness of management can be found in note 4 to Huntingtons consolidated financial statements and a discussion of Huntingtons transaction with The Huntington National Banks Money Market Fund can be found in the section entitled "Results of Operations". All other related party transactions, including those reported in Huntingtons Proxy Statement, were considered immaterial to its financial condition and results of operations. 16 OVERVIEW Huntington reported net income of $178.5 million, or $0.71 per common share, in 2001, compared with $328.4 million, or $1.32 per common share, in 2000, and $422.1 million, or $1.65 per common share, in 1999. Return on average common equity (ROE) and average assets (ROA) for 2001 were 7.50% and 0.63%, respectively, versus 14.41% and 1.14%, respectively, in 2000, and 19.66% and 1.47%, respectively, in 1999. "Operating earnings" for 2001 excluded the $176.9 million of pre tax restructuring and special charges related to the strategic refocusing plan discussed above, the $50.0 million pre tax charge to the provision for loan losses, and the $32.5 million tax benefit related to the sale of REIT preferred securities. Operating earnings for 2000 and 1999 excluded pre tax restructuring and special charges of $50.0 million and $96.8 million discussed above, and a $108.5 million pre tax gain ($70.6 million after tax, or $0.42 per share) in 1999 on the sale of Huntingtons credit card portfolio. Operating earnings were $293.5 million, or $1.17 per common share, in 2001, $360.9 million, or $1.45 per common share in 2000, and $414.4 million, or $1.62 per common share, in 1999. On this same basis, ROE totaled 12.32% for the recent twelve months, compared with 15.84% and 19.31% in the two preceding years. ROA was 1.04% in 2001, 1.26% in 2000, and 1.44% in 1999.

Cash basis ROE and ROA, which are computed using cash basis operating earnings as a percentage of average equity and average tangible assets, were 13.63% and 1.18%, in 2001, 17.08% and 1.39%, in 2000, and 20.53% and 1.57%, in 1999, respectively. Total assets were $28.5 billion at December 31, 2001, approximating asset levels at the end of last year. During 2001, Huntington sold $107 million in residential mortgages and $1.4 billion in available for sale investment securities in continuation of its efforts to sell low margin assets as part of its balance sheet repositioning. Managed average total loans, which include securitized loans (see note 5 to Huntingtons consolidated financial statements for further information regarding securitized loans), increased 7% over the prior year, after adjusting for portfolio sales and the Empire Banc Corporation purchase acquisition in 2000. Average commercial loans showed modest growth of 2% during the recent year, hindered by the weakening economy and continued slow down in automobile floor plan lending. Floor plan loans declined 20% versus last year due to reduced dealer inventories and very aggressive financing offered by captive auto finance companies. Excluding floor plan loans, commercial loans increased 4% for the year. Commercial real estate loans increased 7% from a year ago, largely reflecting the funding of previously existing commitments. Activity was primarily within Huntingtons footprint and with long time customers.

Average consumer loans increased 9% during the recent twelve month period, driven by strong double digit growth in home equity lines, an area of focus and a strong source of growth for Huntington. Strong cross selling success to first mortgage customers during the heavy refinancing period in 2001 contributed to this growth. First mortgage refinancing activity fueled by the falling interest rate environment led to an 8% increase in residential real estate loans and an increase in mortgage loans held for sale at year end. Indirect automobile loan and leases 18 increased 9%, although loan origination volumes slowed somewhat towards the latter portion of 2001 due to the zero percent financing offered by many captive finance companies. Core deposits, which are total deposits exclusive of negotiable certificates of deposits and Eurodollar deposits, were $19.8 billion and $19.1 billion at the end of 2001 and 2000, respectively. Average core deposits increased slightly during the year due primarily to Huntingtons sales management process aimed at attracting more retail deposits and, to a lesser extent, the uncertainties in the financial markets. When combined with other core funding sources, these provided 81% of Huntingtons funding needs. Short and medium term borrowings continued to decline as a result of efforts initiated last year in Huntingtons balance sheet repositioning program. Long term debt increased over last year primarily due to Huntingtons $50 million sale to the public of fixed rate preferred securities of its REIT subsidiary. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NET INTEREST INCOME One of Huntingtons primary sources of revenue is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets, primarily loans and securities, and interest expense on funding sources, including interest bearing deposits and borrowings. Net interest income is impacted by changes in the level of interest rates, earning assets, and interest bearing liabilities. Changes in net interest income are measured through interest spread and net interest margin. The difference between the yields on earning assets and the rates paid for interest bearing liabilities represents the interest spread. The net interest margin is the percentage of net interest income to average earning assets. Both the interest spread and net interest margin are presented on a tax equivalent basis, which means that tax free income and dividend income, generated primarily from Huntingtons investment security portfolio, are adjusted and expressed on the same basis as other taxable income. Because non interest bearing sources of funds, such as demand deposits and stockholders equity, also support earning assets, the net interest margin exceeds the interest spread.

The net interest margin was 4.02% during the recent year, compared with 3.73% and 4.11% for 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase in the recent year was due to the continued improvement in the earning asset mix, resulting from a reduction in lower margin investment securities and reduction in residential mortgage loans. Additionally, Huntington was slightly liability sensitive during the period and accordingly, benefited from the decline in short term rates during the year. The net interest margin in 2000 was unfavorably impacted by higher funding costs due to rising interest rates and changes in the mix of Huntingtons core deposit base. The mix of deposits shifted to higher rate accounts during that year following the introduction of new products designed to improve customer retention in the intensely competitive market for retail deposits. The reduction in net interest income and the margin in 2000 also reflect the impact of the 1999 credit card sale and the automobile loan securitizations. Average earning assets declined $509 million from $25.5 billion in 2000 to $25.0 billion while average interest bearing liabilities declined $667 million from $22.3 billion to $21.6 billion. Management expects the margin to continue to expand in 2002, especially in light of the favorable impact expected from the sale of the Florida operations, as discussed below. Huntingtons average balance sheets and net interest margin analysis can be found on pages 20 and 21. Huntington regularly enters into various types of derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps, to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates. The cash flows generated by derivative instruments used to manage risk associated with earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are recorded along with the interest from the hedged item and consequently impact the yields on those assets and liabilities. The impact of these derivatives lowered the net interest margin by two basis points in 2001 and five basis points in 2000, but increased the net interest margin by eight basis points in 1999. Huntingtons interest rate risk position as well as the implementation of a new accounting standard regarding derivatives is discussed further in the "Interest Rate Risk Management" section of this report. PROVISION AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES The provision for loan losses is the expense necessary to maintain the allowance for loan losses (ALL) at a level adequate to absorb managements estimate of inherent losses in the loan portfolio. On a reported basis, the provision expense was $308.8 million for 2001. On an operating basis, the provision for loan losses was $187.1 million, up from $90.5 million in 2000 and $88.4 million two years ago, representing significant increases in net charge offs and deteriorating economic conditions impacting credit quality. The operating basis results for 2001 exclude the impact of an additional fourth quarter provision for loan losses of $50 million to increase the ALL ratio to 1.90% of total loans, reflecting a deterioration in credit quality, and $71.7 million in the second quarter, which included $25.8 million for estimated increased losses resulting from Huntingtons decision to exit sub prime automobile and truck and equipment lending, $19.7 million to charge off delinquent consumer and small business loans more than 120 days past due, and $21.2 million to increase reserves for consumer bankruptcies. The ALL was $410.6 million at December 31, 2001, up from $297.9 million the end of 2000 and $299.3 million at year end 1999. This represents 1.90% of total 2001 loans compared with 1.45% of total loans at the end of the prior two years. The reserve ratio is expected to increase in 2002 after the sale of loans in the Florida operations. Non performing loans in 2001 were covered by the ALL 1.9 times versus 3.2 times at the end of last year. Additional information regarding the ALL and asset quality appears in the "Credit Risk" section. Huntington allocates the ALL to each loan category based on an expected loss ratio determined by continuous assessment of credit quality based on portfolio risk characteristics and other relevant factors such as historical performance, internal controls, and impacts from mergers and acquisitions. For the commercial and industrial and commercial real estate credits, expected loss factors are assigned by credit grade at the individual loan level. The aggregation of these factors represents managements estimate of the inherent loss. The portion of the allowance allocated to the more homogeneous consumer loan segments is determined by developing expected loss ratios based on the risk characteristics of the various segments and giving consideration to existing economic conditions and trends. Projected loss ratios incorporate factors such as trends in past due and non accrual amounts, recent loan loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics, and concentrations of various loan categories. Actual loss ratios experienced in the future, however, could vary from those projected as a loans performance is a function of not only economic factors but also other factors unique to each customer. The diversity in size of commercial and commercial real estate loans can be significant as well. The dollar exposure could significantly vary from estimated amounts due to diversity. Additionally, the impact from recent economic events, including the recession and events 22 of September 11, 2001, on individual customers may not yet be known. To ensure adequacy to a higher degree of confidence, a portion of the ALL is considered unallocated. For analytical purposes, the allocation of the ALL is provided below. While amounts are allocated to various portfolio segments, the total ALL, excluding impairment reserves prescribed under provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 114, is available to absorb losses from any segment of the portfolio.

Excluding 18 basis points of losses charged against reserves established in the second quarter 2001 for portfolios that Huntington exited, net charge offs were 0.72%. Net charge offs were 0.40% in both 2000 and 1999. Commercial charge offs, spread over a number of companies in the retail trade, manufacturing, services, and communications sectors, were 0.90% in the recent year versus 0.21% in 2000 and 0.18% in 1999. Consumer charge offs were 1.17% in 2001 compared with 0.63% in each of the two preceding years. Excluding losses related to the exited businesses, commercial and consumer net charge offs were 0.76% and 0.91%, respectively. Indirect auto loan net charge offs were 1.36% in 2001 compared with 1.08% in 2000 and vehicle lease net charge offs were 1.28% and 0.72% for the same periods. The following table reflects vintage performance for Huntingtons managed indirect auto loan and lease portfolios through December 31, 2001: LOAN AND LEASE ORIGINATION PERIOD 4Q 98 TO 4Q 99 TO 4Q 00 TO PRODUCT 3Q 99 3Q 00 4Q 01 Indirect auto loans % of portfolio at December 31, 2000 24% 42% 12% % of portfolio at December 31, 2001 12% 25% 55% cumulative loss ratios after 5 quarters 0.65% 1.35% 1.00% Indirect auto leases % of portfolio at December 31, 2000 33% 42% 9% % of portfolio at December 31, 2001 22% 31% 41% cumulative loss ratios after 5 quarters 0.38% 1.30% 1.00% For the fourth quarter of 1999 through the third quarter of 2000, in the table above, the cumulative loss ratio is greatest for both loans and leases originated by Huntington. The higher loss levels during this origination period were the result of less rigorous underwriting standards, which were subsequently improved. Although the relative portion of the portfolios is diminishing, these loans and leases contributed to the higher losses in the recent year, along with the economic slowdown, and an increase in the average loss per vehicle due to lower used car prices. Until general economic conditions begin to improve, Huntingtons management expects unfavorable trends in credit quality and net charge offs to continue at or above current levels in all portfolios, particularly in the first half of 2002. 23 The following table shows the activity in Huntingtons ALL, along with selected credit quality indicators.

(2) Income before taxes (excluding the impact of restructuring and special charges and the 1999 gain from sale of credit card portfolio) and the provision for loan losses to net loan losses. NON INTEREST INCOME Non interest income before gains from investment security and loan sales, was $508.8 million in 2001, compared with $456.5 million for the same period last year and $452.1 million in 1999. Service charges on deposit accounts increased 2.1% from a year ago, primarily due to higher corporate maintenance fees and, to a lesser extent, sales of cash management products. Brokerage and insurance revenue increased $17.2 million, or 27.7%, driven by strong growth in insurance and investment banking fees. Annuity sales reached record highs for Huntington in 2001 contributing to a 10% increase in brokerage income year over year despite a volatile equity market. Insurance related revenue was up 43% reflecting the full year impact of a new insurance agency acquired in 2000. Trust income rose 12.5% as a result of increased revenue from the sales to customers of Huntingtons proprietary mutual funds as five new funds were added during this year and certain price increases. Mortgage banking income for 2001 was up 55.6% over last year due to the refinancing activity resulting from the lower interest rate environment. Origination volume totaled $3.5 billion, up from $1.5 billion in the same period a year ago. Other service charges 24 and fees increased nearly 10% over the prior year due primarily to higher customer usage of Huntingtons check card product. New revenue from the sale of interest rate derivative products to corporate customers and loan securitization activity also helped to drive other non interest income up over last year. Investment security gains totaled $0.7 million for 2001, versus $37.1 million for 2000 and $13.0 million for 1999. Included in the 2001 net gains in the table below is a $5.3 million loss realized from the sale of $15 million of Pacific Gas & Electric commercial paper acquired from The Huntington National Banks Money Market Fund. Huntington sold certain equity investments that generated gross gains of $66.5 million in 2000 and $31.0 million in 1999. Substantially offsetting these gains in both prior years were losses from the sale of lower yielding, fixed income investment securities.

A discussion of Huntingtons restructuring and special charges can be found in the beginning of Managements Discussion and Analysis and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Higher personnel costs reflect increases in sales commissions related to mortgage banking, capital markets, and private financial services activities, offset by lower benefit expenses. Occupancy and equipment costs increased 2.5% in 2001 due to higher depreciation and building maintenance. Other factors contributing to the 10.5% increase in non interest expense, included in Other, was a $4.2 million impairment loss related to PG&E commercial paper, and $7.0 million of premium expense related to the purchase of automobile lease residual value insurance. The $4.2 million PG&E impairment loss reflected in non interest expense related to activities in The Huntington National Banks Money Market Mutual Fund (the Fund). The Fund owned $30 million of PG&E commercial paper at the end of last year. During the first quarter of 2001, $15 million of the paper was sold with a $4.2 million loss incurred. Although the Fund could have absorbed the loss and still maintained the net asset value at $1.00 per share, Huntington reimbursed the Fund for the $4.2 million loss. The remaining $15 million of commercial paper was held by Huntington until the economic and political ramifications of PG&Es April 2001 Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing became known. The remaining PG&E commercial paper was sold in the third quarter of 2001, as discussed above, at a loss of $5.3 million, which is included in restructuring and special charges. The combined losses amounted to $9.5 million. In late 2000, Huntington purchased residual value insurance coverage. Residual values are established at the origination of the lease and represent the estimated value of the automobiles at the end of the lease. The insurance covers the difference between the recorded residual value and the fair market value of the automobile at the end of the lease term as evidenced by Black Book valuations. The insurance provides first dollar loss coverage on the portfolio at October 1, 2000, and has a cap on insured losses of $120 million. Insured losses on new lease originations from October 2000 to March 31, 2002 have a cap of $50 million. The insurance coverage is subject to annual renewal. See note 1 to Huntingtons consolidated financial statements for accounting policy regarding residual values. 25 NON INTEREST EXPENSE (in thousands of dollars) 2001 2000 1999 Personnel costs $ 478,640 $ 421,750 $ 419,901 Equipment 80,560 78,069 66,666 Net occupancy 77,184 75,882 62,169 Outside data processing and other services 69,692 62,011 62,886 Amortization of intangible assets 41,225 39,207 37,297 Marketing 31,057 34,884 32,506 Telecommunications 27,984 26,225 28,519 Professional services 23,879 20,819 21,169 Printing and supplies 18,367 19,634 20,227 Franchise and other taxes 9,729 11,077 14,674 Other 65,313 46,059 49,314 TOTAL NON INTEREST EXPENSE BEFORE SPECIAL CHARGES 923,630 835,617 815,328 Special charges 99,957 50,000 96,791 TOTAL NON INTEREST EXPENSE $1,023,587 $ 885,617 $ 912,119 Amortization of intangible assets, which includes amortization of the excess of fair value of assets involved in purchase acquisitions over book value or "goodwill", increased to $41.2 million in 2001 from $39.2 million in 2000. This increase reflects the full year impact of the year 2000 purchase acquisitions of Empire Banc Corporation and the J. Rolfe Davis Insurance Agency, Inc. In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least annually. Huntington will apply the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of 2002. The majority of Huntingtons goodwill and other intangible assets relate to its operations located in Florida, which Huntington sold in February 2002. The application of the nonamortization provisions of the new standard to goodwill not impacted by the sale is expected to result in an increase in net income of $8.9 million, or $0.04 per common share per year. Huntingtons efficiency ratio, which expresses expense as a percentage of revenue on a tax equivalent basis, was 58.4% for 2001, compared with 56.2% and 51.8% in 2000 and 1999, respectively. This ratio is expected to improve in 2002 as a result of the sale of the Florida operations. INCOME TAXES Huntington recorded an income tax benefit of $5.2 million in 2001, compared with expense of $131.4 million, and $192.7 million in each of the previous two years. Huntingtons effective tax rate on operating earnings was 26.7% in 2001 versus 28.6% in 2000 and approximately 31.0% in 1999. The effective rate was lower in 2001 due to asset securitization and subsidiary capital activities. Based on information currently available, Huntington expects its 2002 effective tax rate to remain below 30%. See note 18 to Huntingtons consolidated financial statements regarding income taxes. INTEREST RATE RISK AND LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT Huntington seeks to achieve consistent growth in net interest income and net income while managing volatility arising from shifts in interest rates. The Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO) oversees financial risk management by establishing broad policies and specific operating limits that govern a variety of financial risks inherent in Huntingtons operations, including interest rate, liquidity, counterparty, settlement, and market risks. Market risk is the risk of loss arising from the adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates, exchange rates, and equity prices. Interest rate risk is Huntingtons primary market risk and results from the timing differences in the repricing of assets and liabilities, changes in relationships between rate indices and the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options. ALCO regularly monitors Huntingtons interest rate sensitivity position to ensure consistency with approved risk tolerances. 26 Interest rate risk management is a dynamic process, encompassing business flows onto the balance sheet, wholesale investment and funding, and the changing market and business environment. Effective management of interest rate risk begins with appropriately diversified investments and funding sources. To accomplish its overall balance sheet objectives, Huntington regularly accesses a variety of global markets money, bond, futures, and options as well as numerous trading exchanges. In addition, dealers in over the counter financial instruments provide availability of interest rate swaps as needed. Measurement and monitoring of interest rate risk is an ongoing process. Two key elements used in this process are Huntingtons income simulation model and its net present value model. The income simulation model estimates the amount that net interest income will change over a twelve to twenty four month period given adverse changes in interest rates. The net present value model, or Economic Value of Equity (EVE), is used to discern levels of risk in Huntingtons balance sheet that may not be determined in its income simulation model. These two models have limitations but complement each other and together these models portray the magnitude of exposure to interest rate risk. Assumptions used in these models are inherently uncertain, but management believes that these models provide a reasonably accurate estimate of Huntingtons interest rate risk exposure. Managements reporting of this information is regularly shared with the Board of Directors. The income simulation model used by Huntington incorporates a gradual change in the shape of the forward yield curve and captures all major assets, liabilities, and off balance sheet financial instruments, accounting for significant variables that are believed to be affected by interest rates. These include prepayment speeds on mortgages and consumer installment loans, cash flows of loans and deposits, principal amortization on revolving credit instruments, and balance sheet growth assumptions. The model also captures embedded options, e.g. interest rate caps/floors or call options, and accounts for changes in rate relationships, as various rate indices lead or lag changes in market rates. The forward yield curve at December 31, 2001, implied a 150 basis point increase in short term interest rates by the end of 2002. The results of Huntingtons recent sensitivity analysis indicated that net interest income would be 0.6% lower during the next twelve months than if interest rates were 100 basis points higher at the end of that period than implied by forward rates at December 31, 2001, or 250 basis points from rates at this same date. Net interest income was estimated to be 1.3% lower if rates were 200 basis points higher than the yield curve, or 350 basis points overall. Conversely, if rates were 100 and 200 basis points lower than the yield curve, net interest income would be 0.3% and 0.9% higher, respectively. These measures of the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates incorporate the effects of the sale of the Florida franchise. The sale of selected assets and liabilities in the Florida region increased the interest rate sensitivity of net interest income modestly, but repositioning of the balance sheet in anticipation of the sale ensured that the resulting level remained below the management limit of 2%. At the end of 2000, net interest income was estimated to be 2.5% higher during the subsequent twelve months if interest rates were 200 basis points lower than the level implied by forward rates in twelve months. The decline in sensitivity over the past year was primarily due to the previously mentioned sales of low margin fixed rate investment securities. These sales were part of managements effort to restructure the balance sheet and reduce sensitivity to interest rate changes in order to stabilize Huntingtons revenue base. The EVE simulation model used by Huntington measures the level of risk in the balance sheet that might not have been accounted for in the income simulation model due to that models limited time horizon. The EVE is defined as the discounted present value of asset cash flows and derivative cash flows, minus the discounted value of liability cash flows. The timing and variability of balance sheet cash flows are critical assumptions, along with assumptions regarding the speed of loan and security prepayments and the assumed behavior of zero maturity deposits. The sensitivity of the EVE to changes in interest rates is estimated by calculating the EVE under alternative interest rate scenarios. Unlike the analysis of net interest income at risk, which is based on assumed changes in interest rates over time, the EVE analysis is based on assumed immediate shifts in interest rates. In addition, the EVE analysis does not reflect assumed changes to the balance sheet that would arise from new business. At December 31, 2001, an immediate increase of 100 basis points was estimated to reduce the EVE by 1.1%. A 200 basis point increase was estimated to reduce the EVE by 2.9%. The EVE was estimated to increase by 0.5% in response to a 100 basis point decrease in rates and decrease by 0.1% in response to a 200 basis point decrease. These estimates reflect the characteristics of the balance sheet at December 31, 2001, which included selected assets and liabilities in Florida that were sold in 2002. Separate analysis indicates that the risk to the EVE after the sale of those 27 assets and liabilities from an immediate 200 basis point increase in rates was close to but less than one percentage point greater than the 2.9% risk for the organization including those assets and liabilities. The difference between the sensitivity to rate increases and decreases of the same amount is a measure of the convexity of the balance sheet. In the case of a 100 basis point shift, for example, the balance sheet is estimated to be negatively convex, because the EVE would decrease by more in response to an increase in rates than it would increase in response to a decrease in rates. The source of the negative convexity is primarily the asymmetric prepayment rates of mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities in increasing and decreasing interest rate environments and the greater latitude to raise than lower some deposit rates, given the already very low level of interest rates. Active interest rate risk management necessitates the use of various types of derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors, exchange traded futures and option contracts, and forward rate agreements. Risk that is created by different indices on products, by unequal terms to maturity of assets and liabilities, and by products that are appealing to customers but incompatible with current risk limits can be eliminated or decreased in a cost efficient manner by utilizing interest rate swaps. Often, the swap strategy has enabled Huntington to lower the overall cost of raising wholesale funds. Interest rate derivatives have characteristics similar to securities but possess the advantages of customization of the risks and rewards in the instrument, minimizing the balance sheet leverage and improving liquidity. On January 1, 2001, Huntington implemented a new accounting standard, SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 133, as amended, requires recognition of derivatives at their fair value as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet. The accounting for gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value depends on the intended use of the derivatives. For derivatives designated as hedges of changes in the fair value of recognized assets or liabilities, gains or losses on the derivatives are recognized in earnings together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items. This results in earnings only being impacted to the extent that the hedge is ineffective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value. For derivatives used to hedge changes in cash flows associated with forecasted transactions, gains or losses on the effective portion of the derivatives are deferred, and reported as accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), a component of shareholders equity, until the period in which the hedged transactions affect earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as hedges are recognized in current earnings. The after tax transition adjustment for the implementation of this new standard was immaterial to net income and reduced AOCI by $9.1 million. See note 14 to Huntingtons consolidated financial statements for more information regarding derivative financial instruments and note 16 regarding comprehensive income. SHORT TERM BORROWINGS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, (in thousands of dollars) 2001 2000 1999 FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS Balance at year end $1,913,607 $ 1,822,480 $2,065,192 Weighted average interest rate at year end 2.24% 5.91% 4.69% Maximum amount outstanding at month end during the year $3,094,647 $ 2,093,546 $3,033,277 Average amount outstanding during the year $2,258,860 $ 1,831,228 $2,417,032 Weighted average interest rate during the year 4.11% 5.68% 4.50% 28 LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT Effectively managing liquidity involves ensuring the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers, as well as meeting the operating cash needs of Huntington to fund corporate expansion and other activities. ALCO regularly monitors the overall liquidity position of the business and ensures that various alternative strategies exist to cover unanticipated events. At the end of the recent year, management believes sufficient liquidity was available to meet estimated short term and long term funding needs. Funding is available from a number of sources, including core deposits, the investment securities portfolio, the securitization and sale of loans, and the ability to acquire large deposits and the issuance of notes and common and preferred securities in the capital markets. One of Huntingtons chief sources of liquidity is derived from the large retail deposit base accessible by its network of banking offices. Certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more totaled nearly $1.4 billion at December 31, 2001, of which $377.9 million mature within three months, $119.2 million mature within three to six months, $175.9 million mature within six months to one year, and $689.7 million mature beyond one year. This funding is supplemented by Huntingtons demonstrated ability to raise funds in capital markets and to access funds nationwide. The bank subsidiarys $6 billion domestic bank note program as well as Huntingtons and its parent companys combined $2 billion Euronote program are significant sources of wholesale funding. Under these sources, unsecured senior and subordinated notes are issuable with maturities ranging from one month to thirty years. Huntington is also a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB), which provides funding through advances to its members that are collateralized with mortgage related assets that carry maturities from one month to twenty years. At the end of 2001, Huntington had $17.0 million of outstanding borrowings with the FHLB. Huntingtons parent company obtains its funding from dividends, subsidiary capital activities, and from the issuance of commercial paper through Huntington Bancshares Financial Corporation, a non bank subsidiary. The parent company accesses the capital markets through issuance of medium term notes via its $750 million note program. The proceeds from these sources are used from time to time to fund certain non banking activities, finance acquisitions, repurchase Huntingtons common stock, or for other general corporate purposes. An $85 million line of credit with a group of unaffiliated financial services companies serves as a backup liquidity facility to support commercial paper borrowings. No borrowings have occurred under this facility. Parent company liquidity significantly improved in early 2002 through the sale of Huntingtons Florida operations. At December 31, 2001, approximately $3 billion of funds were available under the combined note programs to fund Huntingtons future activities. Huntington also has $300 million of capital securities outstanding through its non bank subsidiaries, Huntington Capital I and II. In early 2002, Huntington increased its wholesale borrowings by $1.2 billion in connection with the sale of Florida loans and deposits. Huntington is also in the process of closing a new $6 billion domestic bank note program and expects to draw on this note program in 2002. The table below represents Huntingtons contractual cash obligations, excluding short term borrowings, at December 31, 2001: Payments Due by Period 2007 & (in millions of dollars) 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 After Total Medium term notes $782.2 $480.0 $255.0 $285.0 $ $ $ 1,802.2 Subordinated notes 150.0 250.0 450.0 850.0 Capital securities 300.0 300.0 Preferred securities 50.0 50.0 Federal Home Loan Bank advances 4.0 10.0 3.0 17.0 Operating leases 47.5 43.5 40.4 36.0 33.2 298.0 498.6 Total $983.7 $783.5 $298.4 $321.0 $33.2 $1,098.0 $ 3,517.8 29 While liability sources are many, significant liquidity is also available from Huntingtons securities available for sale and loan portfolios.

(1) Weighted average yields were calculated using amortized cost and on a fully tax equivalent basis assuming a 35% tax rate. Marketable equity securities are excluded. CREDIT RISK Huntingtons exposure to credit risk is managed through the use of consistent underwriting standards that emphasize "in market" lending while avoiding highly leveraged transactions as well as excessive industry and other concentrations. The credit administration function employs extensive risk management techniques, including forecasting, to ensure that loans adhere to corporate policy and problem loans are promptly identified. These procedures provide executive management with the information necessary to implement policy adjustments where necessary, and take corrective actions on a proactive basis. 30 Non performing assets (NPAs) consist of loans that are no longer accruing interest, loans that have been renegotiated based upon financial difficulties of the borrower, and real estate acquired through foreclosure. Commercial and real estate loans are placed on non accrual status and stop accruing interest when collection of principal or interest is in doubt or generally when the loan is 90 days past due. When interest accruals are suspended, accrued interest income is reversed with current year accruals charged to earnings and prior year amounts generally charged off as a credit loss. Consumer loans are not placed on non accrual status; rather they are charged off in accordance with regulatory statutes, which is generally no more than 120 days. Total NPAs were $227.5 million at December 31, 2001, compared with $105.4 million the end of 2000. As of the same dates, NPAs as a percent of total loans and other real estate were 1.05% and 0.51%. Certain industries have been identified as being particularly vulnerable to the weakening economic environment such as hotels, restaurants, amusements/recreation, insurance, and airlines. At December 31, 2001, these industries comprised 6.2% of the total commercial and commercial real estate portfolios. Given the weakened economic conditions, Huntington expects that NPAs may increase in 2002, particularly in the first half of the year. This increase may be offset by reduced NPAs associated with the Florida operations. However, the ratio of NPAs to total loans is expected to increase subsequent to the sale. Loans past due ninety days or more but continuing to accrue interest increased to $91.6 million at December 31, 2001, versus $80.3 million last year. This represented 0.42% and 0.39% of total loans, respectively.

Amounts actually collected and recorded as interest income for these loans totaled $4.9 million. 31 CAPITAL AND DIVIDENDS Capital is managed at each subsidiary based upon the respective risks and growth opportunities, as well as regulatory requirements. Huntington places significant emphasis on the maintenance of strong capital, which promotes investor confidence, provides access to the national markets under favorable terms, and enhances business growth and acquisition opportunities. Huntington also recognizes the importance of managing capital and continually strives to maintain an appropriate balance between capital adequacy and returns to shareholders. Shareholders equity at December 31, 2001, was flat year over year despite the reduced earnings due to the restructuring and special charges but was positively impacted by the reduced dividends and the appreciation in the unrealized fair value of the available for sale securities portfolio in 2001. Cash dividends declared were $0.72 a share in 2001, down from $0.76 a share in 2000. Beginning with the dividends declared in the third quarter of this year, Huntington reduced its cash dividend to shareholders by 20%. Average shareholders equity was $2.4 billion for 2001, compared with $2.3 billion and $2.1 billion for 2000 and 1999, respectively. Huntingtons ratio of average equity to average assets in the recent year was 8.47% versus 7.94% one year ago. The ratios were 8.48% and 8.27% on a period end basis. Tangible equity to assets, which excludes the unrealized losses on securities available for sale and intangible assets, was 6.04% and 5.87% at the two recent year ends. The sale of the Florida operations in early 2002 is expected to temporarily increase Huntingtons tangible equity to asset ratio to approximately 9%. This ratio is expected to decline as Huntington utilizes the excess capital to repurchase its common stock. Huntington intends to maintain a minimum ratio of 6.50%. Risk based capital guidelines established by the Federal Reserve Board set minimum capital requirements and require institutions to calculate risk based capital ratios by assigning risk weightings to assets, to notional values of certain financial instruments such as interest rate swaps, and to off balance sheet items such as loan commitments and securitizations. These guidelines further define "well capitalized" levels for financial institutions. Both Huntington and its bank subsidiary had regulatory capital ratios in excess of the levels established for well capitalized institutions. See note 22 in the notes to Huntingtons consolidated financial statements for more detailed information regarding regulatory matters. During 2000, Huntingtons Board of Directors authorized the purchase of an additional 11 million shares under Huntingtons common stock repurchase program, which brought the total shares available under this authorization to 24.1 million shares. Huntington repurchased approximately 8.8 million shares of its common stock through open market and privately negotiated transactions. Approximately 7.2 million of these shares were reissued in connection with the acquisitions of Empire Banc Corporation in June 2000 and the J. Rolfe Davis Insurance Agency, Inc. in August 2000. As of December 31, 2001, approximately 15.3 million shares remained available under this authorization. Huntington had not repurchased any shares since September 30, 2000. In February 2002, Huntingtons Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program for up to 22 million shares and cancelled the earlier authorization. Repurchased shares will be reserved for reissue in connection with Huntingtons dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans as well as for acquisitions and other corporate purposes. LINES OF BUSINESS Below is a brief description of each line of business and a discussion of the business segment results. The financial information by line of business for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999 can be found in Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements. Retail Banking, Corporate Banking, Dealer Sales, and the Private Financial Group are Huntingtons major business lines. A fifth segment includes the impact of Huntingtons Treasury function and other unallocated assets, liabilities, revenue, and expense. Line of business results are determined based upon Huntingtons business profitability reporting system which assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each of the business segments. This process is designed around Huntingtons organizational and management structure and, accordingly, the results are not necessarily comparable with similar information published by other financial institutions. Huntingtons management reviews financial results on an operating basis, which excludes the impact of restructuring and special charges and the 1999 gain on sale of its credit card portfolio. 32 Operating earnings (loss) for each year, by line of business, reconciled to net income for Huntington was as follows: (in thousands of dollars) 2001 2000 1999 Retail Banking $112,410 $160,526 $ 170,750 Corporate Banking 93,256 114,793 124,294 Dealer Sales 72,822 82,189 76,070 Private Financial Group 27,130 22,905 22,957 Treasury / Other (12,096) (19,467) 20,373 Consolidated operating earnings, net of tax 293,522 360,946 414,444 Gain on sale of credit card portfolio, net of tax 70,545 Restructuring and special charges, net of tax (115,001) (32,500) (62,915) Consolidated net income $178,521 $328,446 $ 422,074 RETAIL BANKING Retail Banking provides products and services to retail and business banking customers. This segments products include home equity loans, first mortgage loans, installment loans, business loans, personal and business deposit products, as well as investment and insurance services. These products and services are offered through Huntingtons traditional banking network, Direct Bank, and Web Bank. Retail Bankings operating earnings, net of tax, was $112.4 million in 2001. This compares with $160.5 million for 2000 and $170.8 million for 1999. Excluding revenue and expenses related to the sale of Huntingtons credit card portfolio in 1999, net income for that year was $155.4 million. The lower interest rate environment in 2001 coupled with high runoff of higher rate loans in the portfolio offset by strong deposit growth, especially in the second half of this year, pushed net interest income down nearly 8%. This trend in interest rates, however, positively impacted mortgage banking income by $21 million over last year, which helped drive total non interest income up 15%. The refinancing activity in residential mortgage loans helped provide cross selling opportunities for this segment that resulted in high growth in home equity loans and personal lines of credit. As noted above, credit quality continued to deteriorate and as a result, the Retail Banking segment experienced net charge offs for 2001 that were more than double that of a year ago, which also resulted in a significant increase in the provision for loan losses. Non interest expense increased $46.3 million due to higher commissions in relation to the increased mortgage and other fee income as well as increases in other personnel related costs. This segment contributed 38% of Huntingtons operating earnings for 2001 and comprised 30% of its total loan portfolio and 84% of its core deposits. CORPORATE BANKING Customers in this segment represent the middle market and large corporate banking relationships which use a variety of banking products and services including, but not limited to, commercial loans, international trade, and cash management. Huntingtons capital markets division also provides alternative financing solutions for larger business clients, including privately placed debt, syndicated commercial lending, and the sale of interest rate protection products. Operating earnings for Corporate Banking was $93.3 million for the recent twelve months, compared with $114.8 million for the same period last year and $124.3 million for 1999. Increased net loan charge offs of 54 basis points along with loan growth of 4% contributed to an increase in the provision for loan losses of $37.5 million over last year. The segment experienced strong growth in commercial loans in the first half of 2001 but significantly less in the second half, while construction and commercial real estate loans showed consistent growth all year long. This loan growth helped offset the negative impact of falling interest rates as net interest income increased 5% over the prior year. Non interest income for 2001 increased 2% from 2000, driven by a 22% increase in deposit account services charges, which resulted from higher demand deposit balances during the year. Also, investment banking fees were up $2.7 million and letter of credit fees increased $1.6 million. A portion of this fee revenue increase was offset by lower trust income as institutional fiduciary operations were reported in to the Private Financial Group during 2001. Non interest expense increased 8.6% compared with last year due to increases in outside services expense, equipment and occupancy expenses, marketing expense, and professional fees. 33 Corporate Banking contributed 32% of Huntingtons operating earnings for the recent year and comprised 35% of its total loan portfolio and 11% of its core deposits. DEALER SALES Dealer Sales product offerings pertain to the automobile lending sector and include indirect consumer loans and leases, as well as floor plan financing. The consumer loans and leases comprise the vast majority of the business and involves the financing of vehicles purchased or leased by individuals through dealerships. Operating earnings for this segment were $72.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2001, versus $82.2 million and $76.1 million in each of the prior two annual periods. Higher bankruptcies, a softer used car market and overall economic conditions, resulted in higher net charge offs in the auto lease and indirect lending portfolios. See Huntingtons discussion above of losses involved in certain origination vintages under Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses. Charge offs nearly doubled on a combined basis in 2001 versus 2000, increasing the provision for loan losses $28.6 million for 2001. However, net interest margins on these products widened year over year. Non interest income dropped 31% as income from securitization related activities declined versus the prior year. Non interest expense included premium expense relating to policies covering auto lease residual values. Dealer Sales contributed 25% of Huntingtons operating earnings for 2001 and comprised 31% of its outstanding loans. PRIVATE FINANCIAL GROUP Huntingtons Private Financial Group (PFG) provides an array of products and services designed to meet the needs of Huntingtons higher wealth customers. Revenue is derived through the sale of personal trust, asset management, investment advisory, brokerage, insurance, and deposit and loan products and services. Operating earnings for this segment for the year were $27.1 million, up from $22.9 million and $23.0 million reported for 2000 and 1999. Net interest income grew $6.2 million in 2001, primarily as a result of significant loan growth (23%) over 2000 combined with wider margins on loan balances. The loan growth was most notable in consumer loans personal credit lines and residential mortgage loans, as declining interest rates incented refinancing activity. Spreads improved as market rates declined more rapidly than effective rates. The increase in the provision for loan losses in 2001 was the result of this loan growth. The overall credit quality in this line of business improved during the year as charge offs actually declined from ten basis points in 2000 to nine basis points in 2001. Non interest income increased 56% in the most recent year due largely to higher insurance revenue and higher trust income primarily from Huntingtons proprietary mutual funds. Assets in five new funds that were introduced during the year grew to over $100 million by the end of this year. Growth in insurance revenue, along with the increase in non interest expense, was largely reflective of the full year contribution from the J. Rolfe Davis Agency acquisition that occurred in late August 2000. Included in non interest expense is the PG&E impairment loss related to activities in The Huntington National Banks Money Market Mutual Fund as discussed previously under Non Interest Expense above. This segment represented 9% of Huntingtons annual operating earnings and 4% of total loans. TREASURY / OTHER The Treasury/Other segment absorbs unassigned assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, and expense that cannot be directly assigned or allocated to one of Huntingtons lines of business. Furthermore, Huntington uses a match funded transfer pricing system to allocate interest income and interest expense to its business segments. This approach consolidates the interest rate risk management of Huntington into its Treasury Group. As part of its overall interest rate risk and liquidity management strategy, the Treasury Group administers an investment portfolio of approximately $2.8 billion. Revenue and expense associated with these activities remain within the Treasury Group. Additionally, amortization expense of intangible assets is also a significant component of Treasury/Other. This segment reflected a net operating loss of $12.1 million for the period. This segment showed an operating loss of $19.5 million in 2000, compared with operating income of $20.4 million for 1999. The effects from the balance sheet repositioning mentioned earlier offset the widening of spreads, which favorably affected net interest income for the recent twelve month period. Non interest income was significantly lower, particularly due to security gains in the two prior years related to the sale of a portion of Huntingtons equity investments. Income taxes included the reconciling items to the statutory tax rate of 35% in this segment. 34 SELECTED ANNUAL INCOME STATEMENT DATA (in thousands of dollars, YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, except per share amounts) 2001 2000 1999 1998 1997 1996 TOTAL INTEREST INCOME $ 1,939,519 $ 2,108,505 $ 2,026,002 $1,999,364 $1,981,473 $1,775,734 TOTAL INTEREST EXPENSE 943,337 1,166,073 984,240 978,271 954,243 880,648 NET INTEREST INCOME 996,182 942,432 1,041,762 1,021,093 1,027,230 895,086 Provision for loan losses 308,793 90,479 88,447 105,242 107,797 76,371 NET INTEREST INCOME AFTER PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES 687,389 851,953 953,315 915,851 919,433 818,715 Service charges on deposit accounts 164,052 160,727 156,315 126,403 117,852 107,669 Brokerage and insurance income 79,034 61,871 52,076 36,710 27,084 20,856 Trust services 60,298 53,613 52,030 50,754 48,102 42,237 Mortgage banking 59,148 38,025 56,890 60,006 55,715 43,942 Other service charges and fees 48,217 43,883 37,301 29,202 22,705 12,013 Bank Owned Life Insurance income 38,241 39,544 37,560 28,712 Other 59,767 58,795 59,901 67,090 63,403 69,726 TOTAL NON INTEREST INCOME BEFORE SECURITIES AND CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO SALE GAINS 508,757 456,458 452,073 398,877 334,861 296,443 Securities gains 723 37,101 12,972 29,793 7,978 17,620 Gains on sale of credit card portfolios 108,530 9,530 TOTAL NON INTEREST INCOME 509,480 493,559 573,575 438,200 342,839 314,063 Personnel costs 478,640 421,750 419,901 428,539 392,793 360,865 Equipment 80,560 78,069 66,666 62,040 57,867 50,887 Net occupancy 77,184 75,882 62,169 54,123 49,509 49,676 Outside data processing and other services 69,692 62,011 62,886 74,795 66,683 58,367 Amortization of intangible assets 41,225 39,207 37,297 25,689 13,019 10,220 Marketing 31,057 34,884 32,506 32,260 32,782 20,331 Telecommunications 27,984 26,225 28,519 29,429 21,527 16,567 Professional services 23,879 20,819 21,169 25,160 24,931 20,313 Printing and supplies 18,367 19,634 20,227 23,673 21,584 19,602 Franchise and other taxes 9,729 11,077 14,674 22,103 19,836 20,359 Other 65,313 46,059 49,314 46,118 51,414 48,323 TOTAL NON INTEREST EXPENSE BEFORE SPECIAL CHARGES 923,630 835,617 815,328 823,929 751,945 675,510 Special charges 99,957 50,000 96,791 90,000 51,163 TOTAL NON INTEREST EXPENSE 1,023,587 885,617 912,119 913,929 803,108 675,510 INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 173,282 459,895 614,771 440,122 459,164 457,268 Income taxes (5,239) 131,449 192,697 138,354 166,501 152,999 NET INCOME $ 178,521 $ 328,446 $ 422,074 $ 301,768 $ 292,663 $ 304,269 PER COMMON SHARE (1) Net income Basic $0.71 $1.32 $1.66 $1.18 $1.15 $1.19 Diluted $0.71 $1.32 $1.65 $1.17 $1.14 $1.18 Cash dividends declared $0.72 $0.76 $0.68 $0.62 $0.56 $0.51 FULLY TAX EQUIVALENT MARGIN: Net Interest Income $ 996,182 $ 942,432 $ 1,041,762 $1,021,093 $1,027,230 $ 895,086 Tax Equivalent Adjustment (2) 6,352 8,310 9,423 10,307 11,864 12,363 Tax Equivalent Net Interest Income $ 1,002,534 $ 950,742 $ 1,051,185 $1,031,400 $1,039,094 $ 907,449 (1) Adjusted for stock dividends and stock splits, as applicable.

Diluted earnings per share was $0.26 versus $0.30 for the same respective three month periods. The fourth quarter 2001 results include $9.8 million of after tax restructuring and special charges ($15.1 million pre tax) associated with the strategic refocusing plan discussed above, a $50.0 million pre tax addition to the allowance for loan losses, increasing the reserve ratio to 1.90% from 1.67% at September 30, and from 1.45% a year ago, and a $32.5 million reduction in income taxes resulting from the sale of preferred securities of its REIT subsidiary. Operating earnings, which excludes these charges and tax benefit, were $75.7 million, or $0.30 per share, compared with $76.2 million, or $0.30 per share, last year. On an operating basis, ROE and ROA were 12.68% and 1.07% for the recent quarter, compared with the 12.89% and 1.06% ratios reported for the fourth quarter a year ago. "Cash basis" earnings per share was $0.33 per share for both periods while ROE and ROA, also on a cash basis, was 13.99% and 1.21%, respectively, for the current period, versus 14.20% and 1.19% for last years three month period. Fully tax equivalent net interest income was up 9.1% from $235.1 million a year ago to $256.5 for the fourth quarter 2001 despite a 2% decline in earning assets. The net interest margin increased from 3.70% to 4.11% reflecting lower wholesale funding costs, tighter controls on branch and ATM cash and increased demand deposits, greater pricing discipline on both loans and deposits, and a slightly liability sensitive balance sheet in a period of declining interest rates. Loan loss provision expense in the fourth quarter 2001, excluding the $50.0 million addition discussed above, was $58.3 million, up $8.7 million from the third quarter 2001, and up $25.8 million over the fourth quarter last year. Provision expense covered net charge offs and provided for increases in loan balances. Net charge offs were $56.1 million in the fourth quarter 2001. This represented 1.04% of average loans, up from 0.74% in the third quarter 2001 and 0.50% in the fourth quarter last year. Excluding losses on businesses Huntington exited and for which reserves were established in the second quarter 2001, adjusted net charge offs were 0.98%, up from 0.61% in the third quarter 2001. Commercial net charge offs increased to 1.39% from 0.56% in the third quarter from losses over a number of companies in the retail trade, manufacturing, services, and communications sectors. Total consumer net charge offs were 1.05%, up from 0.85% in the third quarter. This increase was driven by net charge offs on indirect auto loans, which increased 34 basis points from 1.17% to 1.51% resulting from seasonality and adverse economic conditions. Average managed loans, adjusted for the impact of acquisitions, securitizations, and asset sales, increased 5%, with home equity and commercial real estate up 18% and 10%, respectively, and auto loans and leases up 5%, compared with the same quarter a year ago. Total consumer loans increased 6%. Non performing assets at December 31, 2001, were $227.5 million, up $17.4 million, or 8%, from September 30, and represented 1.05% of total loans and other real estate, up from 0.97%. This increase reflects the weakened economy spread across a number of credits with some concentration in the manufacturing and services sectors. Average core deposits increased 7% on an annualized basis from the third quarter 2001, following an 11% annualized increase in the third quarter. This was driven by increases in interest bearing and demand deposits, only partially offset by declines in savings and certificates of deposits. Average core deposits were up 3% from the fourth quarter a year ago, led by a 23% increase in interest bearing demand deposits. Non interest income, excluding securities gains, increased $3.3 million, or 2.5%, from the year ago period. Securitization related income was particularly strong in the fourth quarter last year. Excluding this income from both periods, non interest income was up 9%. Mortgage banking revenue led all fee categories with a 32% increase over the prior years fourth quarter as origination volume increased to $1.2 billion over volumes of $455 million a year ago and $737 million in the immediately preceding quarter. Brokerage and insurance fees were up 23%. Annuity sales reached $180 million during the fourth quarter, which was 27% higher than the third quarter and more than double that of last year. Service charges on deposit accounts and other service charges and fees were both up 9%. 36 SELECTED QUARTERLY INCOME STATEMENT DATA 2001 2000 (in thousands of dollars, except per share amounts) Fourth Third Second First Fourth Third Second First TOTAL INTEREST INCOME $ 443,751 $ 478,834 $ 498,959 $ 517,975 $ 537,661 $ 535,791 $ 519,496 $ 515,557 TOTAL INTEREST EXPENSE 188,513 229,047 250,926 274,851 304,595 299,922 286,690 274,866 NET INTEREST INCOME 255,238 249,787 248,033 243,124 233,066 235,869 232,806 240,691 Provision for loan losses 108,275 49,559 117,495 33,464 32,548 26,396 15,834 15,701 NET INTEREST INCOME AFTER PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES (1) 146,963 200,228 130,538 209,660 200,518 209,473 216,972 224,990 Service charges on deposit accounts 42,753 41,719 40,673 38,907 39,248 39,722 40,097 41,660 Brokerage and insurance income 20,966 19,912 19,388 18,768 17,078 15,564 13,945 15,284 Mortgage banking 15,768 14,616 18,733 10,031 11,976 9,412 8,122 8,515 Trust services 15,321 15,485 15,178 14,314 14,404 13,181 13,165 12,863 Other service charges and fees 12,552 12,350 12,217 11,098 11,546 11,238 11,250 9,849 Bank Owned Life Insurance income 9,560 9,560 9,561 9,560 11,086 9,786 9,486 9,186 Other 16,088 15,755 14,956 12,968 24,366 11,370 19,485 3,574 TOTAL NON INTEREST INCOME BEFORE SECURITIES GAINS (LOSSES) 133,008 129,397 130,706 115,646 129,704 110,273 115,550 100,931 Securities gains (losses) 89 1,059 (2,503) 2,078 845 11,379 114 24,763 TOTAL NON INTEREST INCOME 133,097 130,456 128,203 117,724 130,549 121,652 115,664 125,694 Personnel costs 118,143 120,767 122,068 117,662 105,810 109,463 104,133 102,344 Equipment 20,593 20,151 19,844 19,972 20,811 18,983 18,863 19,412 Net occupancy 19,950 19,266 18,188 19,780 18,614 19,520 18,613 19,135 Outside data processing and other services 17,992 17,375 17,671 16,654 16,142 15,531 15,336 15,002 Amortization of intangible assets 10,100 10,114 10,435 10,576 10,494 10,311 9,206 9,196 Telecommunications 6,793 6,859 7,207 7,125 6,524 6,480 6,472 6,749 Marketing 6,345 6,921 7,852 9,939 10,592 8,557 7,742 7,993 Professional services 6,235 5,912 6,763 4,969 6,785 4,719 4,815 4,500 Printing and supplies 4,293 4,450 4,565 5,059 5,212 4,849 4,956 4,617 Franchise and other taxes 2,893 2,470 2,246 2,120 3,163 2,841 2,635 2,438 Other 14,017 14,605 16,457 20,234 19,703 12,331 5,305 8,720 TOTAL NON INTEREST EXPENSE BEFORE SPECIAL CHARGES 227,354 228,890 233,296 234,090 223,850 213,585 198,076 200,106 Special charges 15,143 50,817 33,997 50,000 TOTAL NON INTEREST EXPENSE 242,497 279,707 267,293 234,090 223,850 263,585 198,076 200,106 INCOME (LOSS) BEFORE INCOME TAXES 37,563 50,977 (8,552) 93,294 107,217 67,540 134,560 150,578 Income taxes (28,086) 8,348 (10,929) 25,428 30,995 17,010 37,039 46,405 NET INCOME $ 65,649 $ 42,629 $ 2,377 $ 67,866 $ 76,222 $ 50,530 $ 97,521 $ 104,173 PER COMMON SHARE (2) Net income Diluted $ 0.26 $ 0.17 $ 0.01 $ 0.27 $ 0.30 $ 0.20 $ 0.40 $ 0.42 Cash Dividends Declared $ 0.16 $ 0.16 $ 0.20 $ 0.20 $ 0.20 $ 0.20 $ 0.18 $ 0.18 OPERATING RESULTS (3) Operating income $ 75,492 $ 75,660 $ 74,504 $ 67,866 $ 76,222 $ 83,030 $ 97,521 $ 104,173 Operating income per common share Diluted $ 0.30 $ 0.30 $ 0.30 $ 0.27 $ 0.30 $ 0.33 $ 0.40 $ 0.42 Diluted Cash Basis (4) $ 0.33 $ 0.33 $ 0.33 $ 0.30 $ 0.32 $ 0.35 $ 0.42 $ 0.44 (1) Includes $50.0 million charge in the fourth quarter 2001 to increase its loan loss reserve and $71.7 million charge in the second quarter 2001 included in Huntingtons restructuring and special charges associated with its strategic refocusing plan. See the discussion of these charges above. (2) Adjusted for stock splits and stock dividends, as applicable. (3) Excludes restructuring and special charges, net of related taxes, discussed above. (4) "Cash Basis" net income excludes amortization of goodwill. 37 RESULTS FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER CONTINUED Excluding restructuring and special charges discussed above, non interest expense increased $3.5 million, or 1.6%, over the same period last year, but declined $1.5 million from the third quarter 2001 following a $4.4 million decrease in that quarter. Sales commissions were up and consistent with the associated revenue generation in mortgage banking, private financial services, and capital markets. The efficiency ratio improved to 55.77%, down from 57.48% in the third quarter 2001 and 58.48% in the fourth quarter 2000. This was the third consecutive quarterly improvement from a peak of 62.0% in the first quarter 2001. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS SALE OF FLORIDA OPERATIONS On February 15, 2002, Huntington sold its Florida operations to SunTrust Banks, Inc. These operations included 143 banking offices and 456 ATMs with approximately $2.8 billion in loans and other tangible assets, and $4.8 billion in deposits and other liabilities. Huntington received a 15% premium on the deposits sold. This sale resulted in Huntington increasing its wholesale borrowings by $1.2 billion. The transaction slightly improves Huntingtons earnings sensitivity to rising interest rates.
