ITEM 7: MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INTRODUCTION Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (Huntington) is a multi state diversified financial services company organized under Maryland law in 1966 and headquartered in Columbus, Ohio. Through its subsidiaries, Huntington is engaged in providing full service commercial and consumer banking services, mortgage banking services, automobile financing, equipment leasing, investment management, trust services, and discount brokerage services, as well as underwriting credit life and disability insurance, and selling other insurance and financial products and services. Huntingtons banking offices are located in Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky, and West Virginia. Selected financial services are also conducted in other states including Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee. Huntington also has a foreign office in the Cayman Islands and a foreign office in Hong Kong. The Huntington National Bank (the Bank) is Huntingtons only bank subsidiary. The following discussion and analysis provides investors and others with information that management believes to be necessary for an understanding of Huntingtons financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements, notes, and other information contained in this document. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This report, including Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward looking statements about Huntington. These include descriptions of products or services, plans, or objectives of management for future operations, and forecasts of revenues, earnings, cash flows, or other measures of economic performance. Forward looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. By their nature, forward looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks, and uncertainties. A number of factors could cause actual conditions, events, or results to differ significantly from those described in the forward looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to, those set forth under the heading "Business Risks" included in Item 1 of this report and other factors described from time to time in other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Management encourages readers of this report to understand forward looking statements to be strategic objectives rather than absolute forecasts of future performance. Forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. Huntington does not update forward looking statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the forward looking statements were made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. RESTATEMENTS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION AMENDMENT NO. 1 Huntington restated its financial condition and results of operations in its Amendment No. 1 to its Form 10 K filed on May 20, 2003, to reclassify certain automobile leases from the direct financing lease method to the operating lease method of accounting. The appropriate classification of automobile leases as operating leases or direct financing leases under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (Statement) No. 13, Accounting for Leases, can be impacted by residual value insurance coverage. Since October 2000, Huntington has had residual value insurance coverage on its entire automobile lease portfolio to protect it from the risk of loss resulting from declines in used car prices. Such losses arise if the market value of the automobile at the end of the lease term is less than the residual value embedded in the original lease contract. Management believes these policies effectively protect Huntington from the risk of declining used car prices. In April 2003, management determined that, due to provisions in certain of its residual value insurance policies, the leases covered by these policies would not qualify as direct financing leases. For leases originated prior to May 2002, the residual value insurance policies contain aggregate loss caps. The residuals insured under these policies are not considered guaranteed, and, accordingly, the related leases fail to qualify as direct financing leases under Statement No. 13. As a result, leases originated prior to May 2002 have been reclassified as operating leases for all periods presented. As of December 31, 2002, $2.2 billion of such leases, net of accumulated depreciation, are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as operating lease assets. All leases originated since April 2002 are covered under a new residual value insurance policy (the "New Policy") which insures the full residual value of each vehicle and includes no aggregate loss cap. Leases with residual gains are netted with leases with residual losses when claims are settled. The netting provision of the New Policy precluded Huntington from determining the amount of the 18 guaranteed residual of any individual leased asset within the portfolio at lease inception. Thus, the related leases failed to qualify as direct financing leases. Huntington has amended the New Policy, retroactive to April 2002, by adding an endorsement that adds a level of insurance sufficient to meet the criteria as a residual value guarantee pursuant to Statement No. 13, on an individual lease by lease basis, with no netting provisions. In addition, Huntington continues to maintain insurance coverage that insures the full value of the leased residuals. Accordingly, and in reliance on guidance furnished by the Securities and Exchange Commission in its announcement at the Financial Accounting Standards Board Emerging Issues Task Force meeting on May 15, 2003, all leases covered under the New Policy, as amended, are now appropriately classified as direct financing leases in the accompanying financial statements. As of December 31, 2002, $0.9 billion of such leases were included in loans and leases in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. It is managements intention to insure the residuals associated with future originations under the New Policy, as amended, and to classify such new originations as direct financing leases. The impact of this restatement also affected the Consolidated Income Statements. Under the direct financing lease accounting method, interest income is recognized on leases on a "level yield" or interest method that ascribes a portion of each lease payment to interest income, resulting in a constant rate of interest over the life of the lease. The remaining portion of each payment amortizes the net investment in the lease such that at the end of the lease term, the net investment equals the residual value as determined at the inception of the lease. Under operating lease accounting, lease payments are recorded as rental income, a component of Operating lease income in the Non interest income section of the Consolidated Income Statements. Depreciation expense is recorded on a straight line basis over the term of the lease from the cost of the automobile at the inception of the lease to the estimated residual value at the end of the lease term. Depreciation expense is included in Operating lease expense in the Non interest expense section of the Consolidated Income Statement. Depreciation expense is adjusted prospectively at any time during the lease term when the estimated market value of the automobile at the end of the lease term changes. Upon disposition, a gain, reflected in Non interest income, or a loss, reflected in Non interest expense, is recorded for any difference between the net book value of the lease and the proceeds from the disposition of the automobile. Over the term of the lease, the cash flows, the timing of the cash flows, and total income recognized are identical under either accounting method. One significant difference between the two methodologies is the timing of income recognition. Under operating lease accounting, less income is recognized in the first half of the lease and more income is recognized in the second half than under direct financing lease accounting. Another significant difference between the direct financing lease method and the operating lease method of accounting is the recognition of credit loss expense. Credit losses occur when a lease is terminated early because the lessee fails to make the required lease payments. These credit generated terminations result in Huntington taking possession of the automobile earlier than expected. When this occurs, the market value of the automobile may be less than Huntingtons book value, resulting in a loss upon sale or write down to market value while the vehicle is pending sale. Under the direct financing lease accounting method, such losses are charged against an allowance for loan and lease losses that is established at the inception of the lease and is adjusted periodically as necessary through provision expense. Under operating lease accounting, the lease is not treated like a loan, but as a depreciable non interest earning asset. Therefore, no allowance for loan and lease losses is established. As such, early termination losses are recognized as a component of Operating lease expense in the Non interest expense section of the Consolidated Income Statements. The fact that part of the auto lease portfolio is accounted for as operating leases, with the remainder, including all future production, being accounted for as direct financing leases, will impact the comparability of Huntingtons financial statements between reporting periods. As leases originated before May 2002 accounted for as operating leases run off, and as new originations are accounted for as direct financing leases, the level of operating lease income and operating lease expense will decline over future reporting periods while the level of interest income associated with direct financing leases will increase. Additionally, management will increase the provision for loan and lease losses, as appropriate, to provide the necessary level of reserves for new direct financing lease originations. Balance sheet classifications will also be impacted as the run off of the operating leases originated before the New Policy, as amended, reduces non interest earning assets while the new direct financing lease originations covered under the New Policy, as amended, increase loans and leases. 19 AMENDMENT NO. 2 Huntington has voluntarily corrected and restated its earnings in this Amendment No. 2 to its Annual Report on Form 10 K/A (Amendment No. 2) to correct for timing errors in the recognition of certain revenues and expenses. Specifically, Amendment No. 2 includes the following corrections: o Huntington previously did not defer loan and lease origination fees and certain expenses, but rather recognized the net amount in the period of origination. This restatement applies, on a retroactive basis, deferral accounting for loan and lease origination fees and costs. The impact of the restatement decreased total loans and direct financing leases, operating lease assets, accrued expenses and other liabilities, retained earnings, net interest income, operating lease income, mortgage banking income, other non interest income, personnel costs, and other non interest expense. o Huntington previously amortized the loan referral fees paid to automobile dealers (dealer premium) on a straight line basis. As a result of this restatement, Huntington is now amortizing these fees to interest income using methods that closely approximate the results under the interest method. The impact of the restatement reduced the amount of dealer premium included in automobile loans and leases, reduced interest income on indirect loans and leases, and increased gains on sales and securitizations of loans. o Huntington previously deferred sales commissions paid to employees for the origination of deposits and amortized these payments to interest expense over the expected life of the deposit. In this restatement, Huntington is recognizing the expense on these sales commissions when the deposits were originated and commissions were earned. The impact of the restatement decreased the interest expense on deposits, increased service charges on deposit accounts, and increased personnel costs. o Huntington offers its customers the ability to forego the payment of origination fees at inception of a mortgage loan in exchange for a higher interest rate over the life of the loan. Huntington had previously recorded origination fees on such loans held for investment at inception. A loan premium was recognized and amortized as a reduction of interest income on mortgage loans held for investment. The impact of restatement reversed the loan premiums that were recognized as mortgage banking income and increased the interest income recognized on mortgage loans held for investment. o Prior to 2002, Huntington recognized, in the year incurred, the expenses or gains for pension settlements, which are actuarially determined expenses or gains related to lump sum benefit payments paid to individuals who voluntarily or involuntarily retire earlier than their expected retirement date or to individuals who voluntarily or involuntarily separate from Huntington. The expense for 2002 pension settlements was deferred to be recognized over a subsequent eight year period. As part of the restatement, Huntington recognized this expense consistent with years prior to 2002, which increased other liabilities and increased personnel costs in the fourth quarter of 2002. o Huntington previously recorded revenue from the sale of a contingent automobile debt cancellation product by allocating a fixed portion of the proceeds from each sale to revenue and reserves. The impact of the restatement increased the amount of the reserve to cover claim losses on the products purchased by customers, increased other liabilities, and increased other non interest expenses. o Huntington previously recorded tax consulting expenses as a component of income tax expense. The impact of the restatement reclassified those expenses to professional services and had no impact on net income. o In 1998, Huntington entered into a sale leaseback transaction. Huntington recognized gains in 1998 and in 1999 as a reduction in occupancy expense above the amounts that should have been recognized under a normal amortization schedule. The impact of the restatement increased accrued expenses and other liabilities and decreased retained earnings and occupancy expense. o In 1998, Huntington marked to market the ineffective portion of an interest rate swap associated with a fixed rate subordinated debt offering initiated in 1992. The swap was subsequently sold in 2000. The restatement marks to market the ineffective portion of the interest rate swap (i.e., the excess notional amount of the swap) for all periods prior to 1998 and then annually through 2000. The restatement increased income prior to 1998, reduced income in 1998 and 1999, and increased income in 2000, but had no cumulative impact on retained earnings. 20 o In 2001, Huntington negotiated a reduction in expenses on Bank Owned Life Insurance which resulted in an increase in the cash surrender value of the policies at year end 2001, but did not recognize the resulting income until 2002. The restatement corrects the timing error by increasing income in 2001 and reducing income in 2002 by the same amount. There was no cumulative effect impact on retained earnings. The following chart reflects the Amendment No. 2 impact on net income and earnings per share as well as the cumulative effect on retained earnings: Impact on Net Income Cumulative Effect on Twelve Months Ended December 31, Retained Earnings at 1997 & (in thousands) Dec. 31, 02 2002 2001 2000 1999 1998 Prior Deferral accounting for loan and lease origination fees and costs $ (54,423) $ (5,467) $ (9,389) $ (12,148) $ (14,659) $ (2,788) $ (9,972) Automobile loan referral fees (12,802) 1,300 1,760 (2,380) (4,493) (8,989) Commissions on deposit account originations (9,856) 1,726 (1,582) (1,571) (2,709) (5,720) Mortgage loan origination fees (4,084) (2,490) (458) 905 (2,041) Pension settlements (2,193) (2,193) Debt cancellation insurance reserves (7,700) (821) (2,506) (2,314) (963) (766) (330) Tax consulting expenses Deferred gain on Sale/leaseback (9,644) 1,494 479 446 (6,350) (5,713) Interest rate swap 2,644 (2,644) (2,224) 2,224 Bank Owned Life Insurance (2,882) 2,882 Total $(100,702) $ (9,333) $ (10,574) $ (10,278) $ (31,746) $ (21,704) $ (17,067) Impact on earnings per share: Basic $ (0.03) $ (0.04) $ (0.04) $ (0.13) $ (0.08) Diluted $ (0.03) $ (0.04) $ (0.04) $ (0.12) $ (0.08) Further information regarding the impact of these restatements to Huntingtons results of operations and financial condition can be found in Notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements. Amendment No. 2 also provides additional disclosures about the release of restructuring reserves established in 1998 and 2001 and about certain items of non interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2002. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report lists significant accounting policies used in the development and presentation of Huntingtons financial statements. This discussion and analysis, the significant accounting policies, and other financial statement disclosures identify and address key variables and other qualitative and quantitative factors that are necessary for an understanding and evaluation of the organization, its financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 21 USE OF ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) requires Huntingtons management to establish critical accounting policies and make accounting estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect amounts recorded and reported in its financial statements. An accounting estimate requires assumptions about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on the financial statements of Huntington if a different amount within a range of estimates were used or if estimates changed from period to period. Readers of this report should understand that estimates are made under facts and circumstances at a point in time and changes in those facts and circumstances could produce actual results that differ from when those estimates were made. Huntingtons management has identified the following as the most significant accounting estimates and their related application: o Estimated credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio for the establishment of the allowance for loan losses, including estimated future contractual cash flows of certain commercial and commercial real estate loans for evaluation of impairment of loans, o Estimated fair values of loan servicing rights and retained interests in securitizations, including estimates of amounts and timing of future cash flows of loans, cash flows for costs of servicing these loans, amounts and timing of credit losses and prepayments of principal, and appropriate discount rate, for the initial recognition of these assets, amount of amortization that is recognized, and the assessment of these assets periodically for impairment, o Estimated discount rate, the expected return on retirement plan assets, the rate of compensation expense increase, and the health care cost trend rates used in determining Huntingtons projected benefit obligations, the fair value of retirement and other plan assets, and the related benefit cost, o Estimated fair values of Huntingtons businesses that were used by management periodically to assess goodwill and other intangibles for impairment, and o Estimated fair value for all derivative financial instruments used to hedge fair values or cash flows. SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES (SPEs) Huntington established two securitization trusts, or SPEs, in 2000. These two trusts had total assets of approximately $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In the securitization transactions, indirect automobile loans that Huntington originated were sold to these trusts. Under current GAAP, these trusts are not required to be consolidated in Huntingtons financial statements. As such, the loans and the debt within the trusts are not included on Huntingtons balance sheets at December 31, 2002 and 2001. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding securitized loans. In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. This Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 (ARB 51), Consolidated Financial Statements, addresses consolidation by business enterprises where ownership interests in an entity may vary over time or, in many cases, special purpose entities (SPEs). To be consolidated for financial reporting, these entities must have certain characteristics. ARB 51 requires that an enterprises consolidated financial statements include subsidiaries in which the enterprise has a controlling financial interest. This Interpretation requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved. An enterprise that holds significant variable interests in such an entity, but is not the primary beneficiary, is required to disclose certain information regarding its interests in that entity. This Interpretation applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003, to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds an interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003. It also applies immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date. This Interpretation may be applied (1) prospectively with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date on which it is first applied, or (2) by restating previously issued financial statements for one or more years with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the beginning of the first year restated. Huntington is reviewing the implications of Interpretation No. 46 and is considering the adoption methods permitted. Management believes the only material impact of adoption will be the consolidation of one of the securitization trusts formed in 2000. The consolidation of that securitization trust will involve the recognition of the trusts net assets, which, at December 31, 2002, included $1,017 million of indirect automobile loans, $100 million of cash, and $1,000 million of secured debt obligations with an interest rate based on commercial paper rates. In addition to other adjustments and considerations, adoption will also eliminate the retained interest in that securitization trust and its servicing asset related to the loans in the trust, with carrying values at the end of 2002 of $152 million and $12 million, respectively. The impact to Huntingtons equity and results of operations will depend on the method of transition adopted under this new interpretation. Huntington will adopt this new standard effective with the beginning of the third quarter of 2003. 22 DERIVATIVES AND OTHER OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Huntington uses a variety of derivatives, principally interest rate swaps, in its asset and liability management activities to mitigate the risk of adverse interest rate movements on either cash flows or market value of certain assets and liabilities. Like other financial organizations, Huntington uses various commitments in the ordinary course of business that, under GAAP, are not recorded in the financial statements. Specifically, Huntington makes various commitments to extend credit to customers, to sell loans, and to maintain obligations under operating type noncancelable leases for its facilities. Derivatives are discussed under the "Interest Rate Risk Management" section of this report and in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements. Information regarding commitments can be found in Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Various directors and executive officers of Huntington, and entities affiliated with those directors and executive officers, are customers of Huntingtons subsidiaries. All such transactions with Huntingtons directors and executive officers and their affiliates are conducted in the ordinary course of business under normal credit terms, including interest rate and collateralization, and do not represent more than the normal risk of collection. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the total amount of their indebtedness to Huntington was $95.6 million and $133.8 million, respectively. A summary of the aggregate activity of this indebtedness can be found in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. All other related party transactions, including those reported in Huntingtons 2003 Proxy Statement and transactions subsequent to December 31, 2002, were considered immaterial to its financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. COMMON SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS In February 2002, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to 22 million shares and canceled the previously existing authorization. Under this authorization, a total of 19.2 million shares were repurchased at a cost of $370.0 million through the end of December 2002. An additional 0.2 million shares were repurchased in early January 2003, bringing total shares repurchased under this authorization to 19.4 million shares. In mid January 2003, the Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization for up to 8 million shares, canceling the 2.6 million shares remaining under the February 2002 authorization. Huntington expects to use this new authorization to complete the purchase of the 2.6 million shares remaining for repurchase under the prior authorization. Repurchases of shares will be made from time to time as deemed appropriate and will be reserved for reissue in connection with Huntingtons dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans, as well as for acquisitions and other corporate purposes. SIGNIFICANT CREDIT ACTIONS In the fourth quarter of 2002, Huntington initiated two credit actions associated with commercial and commercial real estate loans. The first was the sale of $47.2 million in non performing assets with $21.4 million of related charge offs. The second action was the full charge off of a $29.9 million credit exposure to a single health care finance company. This credit was identified as a non performing loan and subsequently charged off, all within the fourth quarter of 2002. These credit actions had no earnings impact, as existing loss reserve levels were sufficient to absorb the combined $51.3 million in charge offs. As a result, the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases at December 31, 2002, declined to 1.81% from 2.08% at September 30, 2002, and the non performing asset (NPA) coverage ratio (loan and lease loss reserve as a percent of NPAs) improved to 246% from 173% at the end of the third quarter. 23 SUMMARY DISCUSSION OF RESULTS Huntington reported net income of $323.7 million, or $1.33 per common share (diluted), in 2002, compared with $134.8 million, or $0.54 per common share, in 2001, and $322.4 million, or $1.29 per common share, in 2000. Return on average common equity (ROE) and average assets (ROA) for 2002 were 14.6% and 1.25%, respectively, compared with 5.8% and 0.48%, respectively, in 2001, and 14.3% and 1.12%, respectively, in 2000. See Table 1 entitled Selected Financial Data and Table 2 for Huntingtons annual income statements for the recent five years. 2002 VERSUS 2001 PERFORMANCE The $188.9 million increase in earnings ($427.2 million pre tax) related to a combination of items that benefited 2002 performance versus 2001. These items primarily related to the strategic restructuring announced in 2001 and included pre tax gains in 2002 of $182.5 million and $24.6 million associated with the sale of the Florida banking operations and restructuring of Merchant Services, respectively, $115.2 million pre tax in additional provision for loan losses in 2001, a $31.0 million pre tax reduction in restructuring charges, and a $16.4 million pre tax reduction in the net loss on results of operations from the sold Florida banking and insurance operations. Results for 2001 reflected a $32.5 million tax benefit related to the issuance of $400 million of REIT subsidiary preferred stock, of which $50 million was sold to the public. Excluding the impact of these items, as well as the net earnings impact from the sold Florida banking and insurance operations from both 2002 and 2001, net income in 2002 would have been $279.7 million, up $32.7 million, or 13%, from the prior year (See Table 25). Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased $33.1 million, or 5%, reflecting a $1.1 billion, or 5%, decline in average earning assets more than offset by a 33 basis point, or an effective 10%, increase in the net interest margin to 3.62% from 3.29%. The decline in average earning assets reflected a $0.7 billion, or 4%, decline in average loans and leases primarily due to the sale of the Florida banking operations, as well as the planned run off of lower margin investment securities and other earning assets. Excluding the impact of the sold Florida banking operations from 2002 and 2001, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased $105.7 million, or 17%, reflecting a $1.2 billion, or 6%, increase in average earning assets and a 33 basis point, or an effective 10%, increase in the net interest margin to 3.63% from 3.30%. The provision for loan and lease losses declined $62.9 million from 2001. Excluding the $115.2 million of additional provision expense in 2001, as well as the $9.9 million decline related to the sale of the Florida banking operations, the provision for loan and lease losses increased $62.2 million, reflecting loan and lease growth, as well as higher total commercial and commercial real estate net charge offs, as consumer net charge offs declined. The higher total commercial and commercial real estate net charge offs reflected the impact of the continued weak economy on some of Huntingtons commercial customers, as well as fourth quarter credit actions that accelerated the sale and disposition of non performing commercial loans. Non interest income was up $141.8 million, or 12%, reflecting a $182.5 million gain from the sale of the Florida banking operations and $24.6 million gain from the restructuring of Merchant Services. Excluding the impact of these gains and the reduction of non interest income due to the sold Florida banking and insurance operations, non interest income declined $6.9 million, or 1%. This decrease was driven by a $34.7 million, or 5%, decrease in operating lease income and a $19.1 million, or 37%, decline in mortgage banking income, which was partially offset by a $15.8 million, or 12%, increase in service charges on deposit accounts and smaller increases spread among the remaining fee income categories. Non interest expense was down $188.3 million, or 12%. Excluding the impact from the $142.7 million decline in non interest expense attributed to the sold Florida banking and insurance operations, as well as the $31.0 million reduction in restructuring charges, non interest expense was down $14.7 million, or 1%. This decrease largely reflected a $39.7 million, or 7%, decrease in operating lease expense and a $10.2 million decline in amortization of intangible assets expense as a result of the implementation of the new goodwill accounting rule, FASB Statement No. 142, at the beginning of the year. These decreases were partially offset by a $26.0 million, or 7%, increase in personnel costs, due to expansion of management and employee talent at all levels, increased incentive based pay, and higher pension and benefits costs. Huntingtons efficiency ratio was 70.2% for 2002, an improvement from its efficiency ratio for 2001 of 75.0%. Due to the accounting impact of its operating leases, Huntington has an efficiency ratio that is higher than its peers. As its operating lease assets run off, Huntingtons efficiency ratio should decline. 24 TABLE 2 SELECTED ANNUAL INCOME STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, (in thousands of dollars, except per share amounts) 2002 2001 2000 1999 1998 Total interest income $ 1,293,195 $ 1,654,789 $ 1,833,388 $ 1,795,214 $ 1,822,925 Total interest expense 543,621 939,501 1,163,278 982,370 990,146 NET INTEREST INCOME 749,574 715,288 670,110 812,844 832,779 Provision for loan and lease losses 194,426 257,326 61,464 70,335 81,926 NET INTEREST INCOME AFTER PROVISION FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES 555,148 457,962 608,646 742,509 750,853 Operating lease income 657,074 691,733 623,835 489,971 376,274 Service charges on deposit accounts 153,564 165,012 161,426 156,783 126,403 Brokerage and insurance 66,843 79,034 61,871 52,076 36,710 Trust services 62,051 60,298 53,613 52,030 50,754 Mortgage banking 32,033 54,518 32,772 52,960 57,875 Bank owned life insurance 43,123 41,123 39,544 37,560 28,712 Other service charges and fees 42,888 48,217 43,883 37,301 29,202 Gain on sale of Florida operations 182,470 Merchant Services gain 24,550 Gains on sale of credit card portfolio 108,530 9,530 Securities gains 4,902 723 37,101 12,972 29,793 Other 72,206 59,284 69,157 54,675 74,834 TOTAL NON INTEREST INCOME 1,341,704 1,199,942 1,123,202 1,054,858 820,087 Operating lease expense 518,970 558,626 494,800 346,027 273,287 Personnel costs 418,037 454,210 396,230 396,380 402,634 Equipment 68,323 80,560 78,069 66,666 62,040 Outside data processing and other services 67,368 69,692 62,011 62,886 74,795 Net occupancy 59,539 76,449 75,197 71,939 62,912 Marketing 27,911 31,057 34,884 32,506 32,260 Professional services 33,085 32,862 22,721 21,169 25,160 Telecommunications 22,661 27,984 26,225 28,519 29,429 Printing and supplies 15,198 18,367 19,634 20,227 23,673 Franchise and other taxes 9,456 9,729 11,077 14,674 22,103 Amortization of intangible assets 2,019 41,225 39,207 37,297 25,689 Restructuring charges 48,973 79,957 46,791 90,000 Other 82,607 81,709 23,076 49,698 46,522 TOTAL NON INTEREST EXPENSE 1,374,147 1,562,427 1,283,131 1,194,779 1,170,504 INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 522,705 95,477 448,717 602,588 400,436 Income taxes 198,974 (39,319)(1) 126,299 188,433 124,464 NET INCOME $ 323,731 $ 134,796 $ 322,418 $ 414,155 $ 275,972 PER COMMON SHARE Net Income Basic $ 1.34 $ 0.54 $ 1.30 $ 1.63 $ 1.08 Diluted 1.33 0.54 1.29 1.62 1.07 Cash dividends declared 0.64 0.72 0.76 0.68 0.62 NET INTEREST INCOME FULLY TAXABLE EQUIVALENT (FTE) Net Interest Income $ 749,574 $ 715,288 $ 670,110 $ 812,844 $ 832,779 Tax Equivalent Adjustment(2) 5,205 6,352 8,310 9,423 10,307 NET INTEREST INCOME FTE $ 754,779 $ 721,640 $ 678,420 $ 822,267 $ 843,086 (1) Reflects a $32.5 million reduction related to the issuance of $400 million of REIT subsidiary preferred stock, of which $50 million was sold to the public.

After excluding the impact of Huntingtons strategic restructuring plan, as well as the results associated with the sold Florida banking and insurance operations from both years, diluted earnings per share were $1.15 in 2002, up $0.17, or 17%, from 2001. This reflected a 13% increase in net income on this same basis, as well as the benefit of 3% fewer fully diluted shares outstanding. In February 2002, the Board of Directors authorized a 22 million share repurchase program. During the year, 19.2 million shares were repurchased under this program, which reduced average shares outstanding by 8.8 million for the year and contributed $0.04 to earnings per share. 2001 VERSUS 2000 PERFORMANCE The $187.6 million decrease in earnings ($353.2 million pre tax) related to a combination of items that negatively impacted 2001 performance. These items primarily related to the strategic restructuring announced in 2001 and included a $115.2 million pre tax increase in the provision for loan and lease losses, $80.0 million in restructuring charges, and a negative $22.1 million pre tax impact from the sold Florida banking and insurance operations, which went from a $3.4 million positive pre tax income impact in 2000 to a net loss of $18.7 million pre tax in 2001. Results for 2001 also reflected a $32.5 million tax benefit related to the issuance of $400 million of REIT subsidiary preferred stock, of which $50 million was sold to the public. Excluding the impact of these items from both 2001 and 2000, net income in 2001 was $246.6 million, down $73.4 million, or 23% (See Table 25). Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased $43.2 million, or 6%, reflecting a $0.7 billion, or 3%, decline in average earning assets which was more than offset by a 29 basis point, or an effective 10%, increase in the net interest margin to 3.29% from 3.00%. Average loans and leases increased slightly between years, led by growth in home equity, commercial, and commercial real estate loans and leases. However, this benefit was more than offset by a 28% decline in average investment securities. The provision for loan and lease losses increased $195.9 million reflecting $115.2 million of provision expense including $65.2 million associated with the strategic restructuring plan and a $50.0 million addition made in light of the higher charge offs and non performing assets experience in the second half of 2001 especially in the commercial and automobile loan portfolios. The increase in non performing assets, as well as higher commercial net charge offs reflected a weakening economy. The higher automobile loan charge offs, primarily reflected charge offs associated with loan production from the fourth quarter of 1999 through the fourth quarter of 2000, a period of time when Huntington targeted a broader credit quality spectrum of borrowers. Non interest income increased $76.7 million, or 7%, driven by a $67.9 million increase in operating lease income, a $21.7 million increase in mortgage banking income, a $17.2 million increase in brokerage and insurance income and $6.7 million increase in trust services income. Also contributing to the growth in non interest income, but to a lesser degree, were increases in service charges on deposits, and other service charges and fees, up $3.6 million and $4.3 million, respectively. The benefit of these increases was partially offset by a $36.4 million decrease in securities gains as 2000 results included significant gains related to the sales of marketable equity securities. Non interest expense increased $279.3 million, or 22%. This increase reflected $80.0 million of restructuring charges, as well as a $63.8 million, or 13%, increase in operating lease expense and a $58.0 million, or 15%, increase in personnel costs driven by higher incentive based pay. Other expense increased $58.6 million, with $28.4 million of the change reflecting premium expense associated with the purchase of automobile lease residual value insurance. Diluted earnings per common share were $0.54 per common share in 2001, down from $1.29 per share in 2000. After excluding the impact of Huntingtons strategic restructuring plan, as well as the results associated with the sold Florida banking and insurance operations from both years, diluted earnings per share were $0.98 in 2001, down $0.30 per share, or 23%, from 2000. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NET INTEREST INCOME Huntingtons primary source of revenue is net interest income, which is the difference between interest income on earning assets, primarily loans, direct financing leases, and securities, and interest expense on funding sources, including interest bearing deposits and borrowings. Net interest income is impacted by changes in the levels of interest rates, earning assets, and interest bearing liabilities. Changes in net interest income are measured through interest spread and net interest margin. The difference between the yields on earning assets and the rates paid for interest bearing liabilities represents the interest spread. The net interest margin is the calculated percentage of net interest income to average earning assets. Both the interest spread and net interest margin are presented on a fully taxable equivalent basis, which means that tax free interest income and dividend income, generated primarily from Huntingtons investment securities portfolio, are adjusted 28 and expressed on the same basis as other taxable income. Because non interest bearing sources of funds, such as demand deposits and stockholders equity, also support earning assets, the net interest margin exceeds the interest spread. Table 3 shows the average annual balance sheets and the net interest margin analysis for the recent five years (see Table 27 for this corresponding data on an operating basis; i.e. excluding the impact of Huntingtons strategic restructuring plan, as well as the impact of the Florida banking operations sold in the first quarter of 2002). Table 3 shows the average annual balances for total assets and liabilities, as well as shareholders equity, and their various components, most notably loans and leases, deposits, and borrowings. It also shows the corresponding interest income or interest expense associated with each earning asset and interest bearing liability category along with the average rate associated with each asset or liability category, the difference resulting in the net interest spread. The net interest spread plus the positive impact from non interest bearing funds represents the net interest margin. Table 4 shows changes in fully taxable equivalent interest income, interest expense, and net interest income due to volume and rate variances for major categories of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. The change in interest not solely due to changes in volume or rates has been allocated in proportion to the absolute dollar amounts of the change in volume and rate.

This reflected a 5% decrease in average earning assets, more than offset by a 33 basis point, or an effective 10%, increase in the net interest margin to 3.62% from 3.29%. The decrease in average earning assets reflected a $0.7 billion, or 4%, decline in average loans and leases primarily due to the sale of the Florida banking operations, as well as the planned run off of lower margin investment securities and other earning assets. Changes in the balance sheet are discussed in more detail below. The 33 basis point increase in the net interest margin was influenced by two factors. The first was the timing and magnitude of declining interest rates in 2001 and 2002, and the fact that rates reached such historically low levels during the second half of 2002. As interest rates declined in the second half of 2001, deposit and wholesale funding costs declined more rapidly than yields on earning assets, most notably loans and leases. As a result, the net interest margin widened in the second half of 2001. However, as rates continued to decline in 2002, especially in the second half, and given the absolute low levels attained, it became increasingly difficult to lower deposit funding costs commensurate with the decline in earning asset yields. As a result, yields on earning assets fell more rapidly than deposit costs, thus narrowing the net interest margin in the second half of 2002, particularly in the fourth quarter. The second factor was a decision early in 2001 to reduce the level of low return investment securities. This helped drive the increase in the net interest margin during the first three quarters of 2001. A change in the loan and lease mix to lower yield, but higher credit quality, loans and leases had the effect of mitigating the increase in the net interest margin. Since the 2001 fourth quarter, consumer loan and lease production shifted 29 to higher credit quality automobile loan and lease production. Also mitigating the net interest margin increase was the significant growth in lower yield residential mortgages. While this contributed to a reduced net interest spread on these assets, it improved the total risk adjusted return as lower net charge offs should be experienced in future periods. Reflecting these factors, during 2001 the net interest margin in the first quarter was 3.19% and increased steadily throughout the year, peaking at 3.46% in the fourth quarter. During 2002, the margin peaked at 3.94% in the second quarter and declined to 3.62% in the fourth quarter. 2001 VERSUS 2000 PERFORMANCE Fully taxable equivalent net interest income was $721.6 million in 2001, up $43.2 million, or 6%, from $678.4 million in 2000. This increase was driven by a 29 basis point, or an effective 10%, increase in the net interest margin to 3.29% from 3.00%, as average earning assets declined $0.7 billion, or 3%. The decline in average earning assets between the two years was driven by a $1.3 billion, or 28%, decrease in average investment securities as part of the planned reduction in lower margin earning assets. Average loans and leases increased $0.2 billion, or 1%, reflecting a 3% increase in commercial loans, with average commercial real estate loans up 6%. In contrast, average total consumer loans and leases decreased 2%, despite a 14% increase in home equity loans, as residential mortgages and automobile loans and leases declined 24% and 9%, respectively. The higher net interest margin reflected a decision to reduce the level of lower margin residential mortgages and investment securities. In addition, the balance sheet was slightly liability sensitive during the period and benefited from the decline in short term rates from 2000 to 2001. IMPACT FROM DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Huntington uses various types of derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps, to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates. The cash flows generated by derivative instruments are recorded along with the interest income or expense from the hedged asset or liability and consequently are included in the yields on those assets and liabilities. The impact of these derivatives increased the net interest margin by 23 basis points in 2002 but lowered it by 2 and 6 basis points in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Huntingtons interest rate risk position is discussed further in the "Interest Rate Risk Management" section of this report. BALANCE SHEET Table 5 shows total loans and leases were $18.6 billion at December 31, 2002, with 50% representing consumer loans and leases and 50% commercial and commercial real estate loans.

Excluding the impact of the Florida related loans sold from both 2002 and 2001, as shown on Table 27, average total loans and leases were $17.1 billion, up $1.5 billion, or 10%, from the prior year, driven by a $1.5 billion, or 23%, increase in consumer loans and leases. Since late 2001, a key focus in loan growth has been the generation of residential mortgages and home equity loans and lines of credit. This coincided with heavy demand for refinancing mortgage assets due to the declining interest rate environment. As a result, average residential mortgages increased $0.6 billion, or 74%, with home equity loans and lines up $0.3 billion, or 11%. Average automobile loans and leases increased $0.7 billion, or 29%. Also contributing to growth in average loans and leases, on this same basis, was a $0.4 billion, or 13%, increase in commercial real estate loans. In contrast, average commercial loans declined $0.3 billion, or 5%, reflecting a combination of low demand due to the weak economic environment and reduced shared national credit exposure. Average total loans and leases in 2001 were $18.1 billion, up $0.2 billion, or 1%, from the prior year. Average commercial loans increased 3% with commercial real estate loans up 6% from the prior year. Average total consumer loans were little changed between years. While home equity loans and lines increased 14%, this growth was offset by declines in automobile loans and leases and residential mortgages of 9% and 24%, respectively. Average operating lease assets were $2.6 billion in 2002, down 12% from the prior year, in contrast to the 8% growth experienced in 2001. This reflected the run off of operating leases, as new automobile lease originations since April 2002 are direct financing leases and reflected in automobile loans and leases. The $0.3 billion, or 10%, decline in average investment securities in 2002 reflected the continued run off of lower margin earning assets, mostly in the first half of 2001. The $1.3 billion, or 28%, decline to 2001 from 2000 in investment securities reflected a decision to sell a significant portion of lower margin securities. As shown in Table 13, deposits were $17.5 billion at December 31, 2002, with 87% representing core deposits, down from 93% at the end of the prior year, which included the Florida deposits subsequently sold. Average core deposits were $15.3 billion in 2002 as shown in Table 3. Excluding the impact from average Florida deposits sold, as shown on Table 27, of $0.6 billion in 2002 and $4.3 billion in 2001, average core deposits in 2002 were $14.7 billion, up $1.4 billion, or 10%, from the prior year and represented 89% of average total deposits. This growth was driven by a $1.3 billion, or 37%, increase in interest bearing demand deposits reflecting the combined benefits of enhanced sales efforts and consumers moving funds out of the equity markets. Average brokered time deposits and negotiable certificates of deposits increased $0.6 billion reflecting managements strategy to further diversify its funding sources. On this same basis, average core deposits in 2001 were $13.3 billion, up 2% from the prior year. This increase was driven by a 17% increase in average interest bearing demand deposits reflecting successful campaigns to generate deposit growth as well as fund inflows due to uncertainties in the equity markets. Average borrowings in 2002, comprised of short and medium term notes, advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank, and long term debt including capital securities, totaled $5.5 billion, little changed from the prior year. Average borrowings in 2001 totaled $5.5 billion, down 8% from the year earlier period. This reflected a combination of factors including increased funding made available from the planned balance sheet repositioning program which resulted in a decline in low margin earnings assets, particularly in the first half of the year, as well as deposit growth in the second half of the year. PROVISION FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES The provision for loan and lease losses is the expense necessary to maintain the allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL) at a level adequate to absorb managements estimate of inherent losses in the loan and lease portfolio. The provision expense was $194.4 million for 2002, down $62.9 million from $257.3 million in 2001. Excluding the $115.2 million of additional provisions in 2001, as well as the $9.9 million decline related to the sale of the Florida banking operations, the provision for loan and lease losses increased $62.2 million, reflecting loan and lease growth, as well as higher total commercial and commercial real estate net charge offs, as consumer net charge offs declined. Higher total commercial and commercial real estate net charge offs reflected the impact of the continued weak economy on some of Huntingtons commercial customers, as well as fourth quarter credit actions that accelerated the sale and disposition of non performing commercial loans. Specific credit actions in the fourth quarter 2002 included $21.4 million in charge offs associated with the sale of non performing assets and the charge off of a $29.9 million credit exposure to a single health care finance company. Existing loan and lease loss reserves were sufficient to absorb these charges and, accordingly, there was no impact on 2002 provision expense. For 2001, the provision for loan and lease losses was $257.3 million, up $195.9 million from $61.5 million in 2000. Of this increase, $65.2 million reflected a charge associated with Huntingtons strategic refocusing plan discussed 31 earlier. These charges included estimated losses related to the exit of sub prime automobile and truck and equipment lending, losses related to delinquent consumer and small business loans and leases more than 120 days past due, and increased reserves for consumer bankruptcies. In addition, there was a $50.0 million increase to the allowance for loan and lease losses made in light of the higher charge offs and non performing assets experience in the second half of 2001 especially in the commercial and automobile loan and lease portfolios. The increase in non performing assets, as well as higher commercial net charge offs, reflected a weakening economy. The higher automobile loan and lease charge offs primarily reflected charge offs associated with loan and lease production from the fourth quarter of 1999 through the fourth quarter of 2000, a period of time when Huntington targeted a broader credit quality spectrum of borrowers. See the "Credit Risk" section for discussion of the ALLL, net charge offs, and non performing assets. NON INTEREST INCOME Non interest income for the recent three years ended December 31 was as follows: TABLE 6 NON INTEREST INCOME (in thousands of dollars) 2002 2001 2000 Operating lease income $ 657,074 $ 691,733 $ 623,835 Service charges on deposit accounts 153,564 165,012 161,426 Brokerage and insurance 66,843 79,034 61,871 Trust services 62,051 60,298 53,613 Mortgage banking 32,033 54,518 32,772 Bank owned life insurance 43,123 41,123 39,544 Other services charges and fees 42,888 48,217 43,883 Gain on sale of Florida operations 182,470 Merchant Services gain 24,550 Securities gains 4,902 723 37,101 Other 72,206 59,284 69,157 TOTAL NON INTEREST INCOME $ 1,341,704 $ 1,199,942 $ 1,123,202 Non interest income was $1,341.7 million, up $141.8 million, or 12%, reflecting a $182.5 million gain from the sale of the Florida operations and a $24.6 million gain from the restructuring of Merchant Services. Adjusted to exclude the impact of these gains and the benefit of a $5.3 million reduction in securities losses, partially offset by the $63.6 million reduction in non interest income attributed to the sold Florida banking and insurance operations, non interest income was down $6.9 million, or 1%. (See Tables 25 and 26 for further details). The primary cause of this $6.9 million decrease was a $34.7 million, or 5%, decrease in operating lease income due to run off as new production since April 2002 is recorded as direct financing leases. Offsetting this decrease, deposit service charges increased $15.8 million, or 12%, reflecting higher personal and commercial service charges; brokerage and insurance income increased $5.5 million, or 10%, reflecting a 19% increase in combined mutual fund and annuity sales; trust services increased $4.1 million, or 7%, due to a 12% increase in mutual fund fees, as well as a 4% increase in personal trust income; and bank owned life insurance was up $2.0 million. Huntington owns and is the beneficiary on three Bank owned life insurance policies that were purchased in 1997 and 1998, insuring the lives of selected Huntington officers. Written consents were obtained from the officers prior to the purchase of the policies. The policies represented approximately 3% of total assets at December 31, 2002 and 2001. The insurance providers are rated A+ or higher. Additionally, the cash values of these policies are backed by assets that are maintained in a separate account to protect Huntington from possible insolvency of the insurance providers. Mortgage banking income excluding the impact of the sold Florida banking operations declined $19.1 million, or 37%, due, in part, to $14.1 million of mortgage servicing impairment in 2002 compared with $6.3 million of such impairment in 2001. These impairments reflected a significant increase in prepayments due to heavy mortgage refinancing activity, particularly in the second half of 2002. Total mortgage loans originated in 2002 were a record $4.1 billion, up from $3.5 billion in 2001 due to heavy refinancing activity as borrowers took advantage of very low interest rates. At December 31, 2002, the value of capitalized mortgage servicing rights was 0.78% of loans serviced for others, down from 0.97% at the end of the prior year. Other service charges excluding the impact of the sold Florida banking and insurance operations was up $4.4 million, or 12%, primarily driven by higher check card and on line bill payment fees. Other income on this same comparative basis was up $16.2 million, or 29%, reflecting increases spread over a number of miscellaneous fee and service income categories. 32 Non interest income was $1,199.9 million in 2001, up $76.7 million, or 7%. Contributing to this growth was a $67.9 million, or 11%, increase in operating lease income, reflecting growth in the automobile leases outstanding, and a $21.7 million, or 66%, increase in mortgage banking income due to higher mortgage origination activity. Total mortgage loan originations in 2001 were $3.5 billion, significantly higher than $1.5 billion in 2000. This reflected an increase in refinancing activity due to lower interest rates. Brokerage and insurance income increased $17.2 million, or 28%, driven by strong growth in insurance and investment banking fees. Also increasing were trust services, up 12%, other service charges and fees, up 10%, and service charges on deposits, up 2%. Securities gains in 2002 totaled $4.9 million, up $4.2 million from the prior year, which included a $5.3 million loss realized from the sale of $15 million of Pacific Gas & Electric commercial paper acquired from the Huntington Money Market Fund. Securities gains in 2001 were $0.7 million, down $36.4 million from 2000. Gains in 2000 included gross gains of $66.5 million from the sale of certain equity investments substantially offset by losses from the sale of lower yielding, fixed income investment securities. NON INTEREST EXPENSE Non interest expense for the recent three years ended December 31 was as follows: TABLE 7 NON INTEREST EXPENSE (in thousands of dollars) 2002 2001 2000 Operating lease expense $ 518,970 $ 558,626 $ 494,800 Personnel costs 418,037 454,210 396,230 Equipment 68,323 80,560 78,069 Outside data processing and other services 67,368 69,692 62,011 Net Occupancy 59,539 76,449 75,197 Marketing 27,911 31,057 34,884 Professional services 33,085 32,862 22,721 Telecommunications 22,661 27,984 26,225 Printing and supplies 15,198 18,367 19,634 Franchise and other taxes 9,456 9,729 11,077 Amortization of intangible assets 2,019 41,225 39,207 Restructuring charges 48,973 79,957 Other 82,607 81,709 23,076 TOTAL NON INTEREST EXPENSE $ 1,374,147 $ 1,562,427 $ 1,283,131 Non interest expense in 2002 was $1,374.1 million, down $188.3 million, or 12%. Excluding the impact from the $142.7 million decline in non interest expense attributed to the sold Florida banking and insurance operations, as well as the $31.0 million reduction in restructuring charges, non interest expense was down $14.7 million, or 1%, reflecting a decline in operating lease expense, as well as lower amortization of intangibles and other expenses. These were partially offset by higher personnel costs and outside data processing expenses. (See Tables 25 and 26 for further details). Operating lease expense declined $39.7 million, or 7%, reflecting the run off of operating leases as automobile lease originations since April 2002 are direct financing leases in the automobile loans and leases category. Personnel costs excluding the impact of the sold Florida banking and insurance operations increased $26.0 million, or 7%, in 2002 reflecting higher salaries, incentive based compensation, and pension and benefit costs. Higher salaries reflected the expansion of management and employee talent at all levels, including the credit workout group. In addition, and given a renewed focus on sales, incentive based compensation increased throughout Huntington, most notably in mortgage banking which had a record production year. Higher medical and pension costs were partially offset by gains related to stock received from the demutualization of certain insurance companies where Huntington owned related insurance policies. Outside data processing and other services increased $6.7 million, or 11%, reflecting volume driven costs, mostly mortgage banking related. Professional services expense increased $0.8 million, or 3%, due primarily to legal and other costs associated with the resolution of problem credits. Marketing expense was up $1.4 million, or 5%, reflecting expanded advertising activities. Expense categories that declined from 2001, excluding the impact of the sold Florida banking and insurance operations, included a $10.2 million decline in the amortization of intangible assets, mostly goodwill due to the implementation of FASB Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets at the beginning of 2002. Equipment 33 costs declined $3.7 million, or 5%, reflecting lower maintenance costs. Net occupancy expense was down $1.4 million, or 2%, on this same comparative basis due to a real estate tax credit in 2002. Restructuring charges totaled $49.0 million in 2002 compared with $80.0 million in 2001. The charges for 2002 and 2001 were related to the strategic restructuring announced in July 2001. Non interest expense in 2001 was $1,562.4 million, up $279.3 million, or 22%. Contributing to this increase was a $63.8 million, or 13%, increase in operating lease expense, a $58.0 million, or 15%, increase in personnel costs, a $58.6 million increase in the other expense category, and $80.0 million in restructuring charges. The increase in operating lease expense reflected a $63.3 million increase in depreciation expense. Depreciation on leased automobiles increased in 2001 when compared with 2000 due to higher levels of leases, as well as the acceleration of depreciation on vehicles where the expected proceeds at the end of the lease will be less than the expected residual value. The higher personnel costs reflected increased sales commissions related to mortgage banking, capital markets, and annuity and mutual fund sales, offset by lower benefit expense. The $58.6 million increase in other expense reflected the $28.4 million premium expense related to the purchase of automobile lease residual value insurance, of which there was none in 2000. See the "Credit Risk" section for more information regarding automobile lease residual insurance. INCOME TAXES Income taxes were $199.0 million in 2002 compared with an income tax benefit of $39.3 million in 2001 and income tax expense of $126.3 million in 2000. Tax expense in each of these years was significantly impacted by the effect of the strategic restructuring and related sale of the Florida banking and insurance operations, the nature of the restructuring charges, and other items. Huntingtons effective tax rate was 38.1%, 41.2%, and 28.1% in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. Excluding the effect of the strategic restructuring and related sale of the Florida banking and insurance operations, the nature of the restructuring charges and other items, Huntingtons effective tax rate was 23.8%, 21.6%, and 28.1% in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. Huntington previously recorded tax consulting expenses as a component of income tax expense. The impact of the restatement reclassified those expenses to professional services and had no impact on net income. Tax consulting expense was $7.3 million in 2002, $9.0 million in 2001, and $1.9 million in 2000. No tax consulting expenses were recorded as a component of income tax expense prior to 2000. Based on information currently available, Huntington expects its 2003 effective tax rate to range from 26% to 28%. Subsequent to year end 2002, the Internal Revenue Service completed the audit of Huntingtons consolidated federal income tax returns through the tax year 2001. The tax audit resulted in no material impact to Huntingtons financial statements. See Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding reported basis income taxes. CREDIT RISK Huntingtons exposure to credit risk is managed through the use of consistent underwriting standards that emphasize "in market" lending while avoiding highly leveraged transactions as well as excessive industry and other concentrations. The credit administration function employs risk management techniques to ensure that loans and leases adhere to corporate policy and problem loans and leases are promptly identified. These procedures provide executive management with the information necessary to implement policy adjustments where necessary, and to take corrective actions on a proactive basis. Beginning in 2002, management increased its emphasis on its commercial lending to customers with existing or potential relationships within Huntingtons primary markets. As a result, outstanding shared national credits declined to $979 million at December 31, 2002, from $1.1 billion at the same period end last year and a peak of $1.5 billion at June 30, 2001. ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES (ALLL) The ALLL was $336.6 million at December 31, 2002, down from $369.3 million at the end of 2001. This represented 1.81% of total loans and leases at year end 2002 compared with 2.00% for 2001. At the end of 2002, the ALLL represented 246% of non performing assets up significantly from 162% at the end of last year. Given all of the characteristics in Huntingtons loan and lease portfolio, management believes the ALLL is sufficient to absorb the credit losses inherent in the portfolio. 34 The following table shows the activity in Huntingtons ALLL, along with selected credit quality indicators.

For the commercial and commercial real estate credits, expected loss factors are assigned by credit grade at the individual loan and lease level at the time the loan or lease is originated. On a periodic basis, management reevaluates these credit grades. The aggregation of these factors represents managements estimate of the inherent loss in the portfolio. The portion of the allowance allocated to the more homogeneous consumer loan and lease segments is determined by expected loss ratios based on the risk characteristics of the various segments and giving consideration to existing economic conditions and trends. Expected loss ratios incorporate factors such as trends in past due and non accrual amounts, recent loan and lease loss experience, current economic conditions, and risk characteristics of various loan and lease categories. Actual loss ratios experienced in the future, could vary from those expected, as performance is a function of factors unique to each customer as well as general economic conditions. To ensure adequacy to a higher degree of confidence, a portion of the ALLL is considered unallocated. For analytical purposes, the allocation of the ALLL is provided in Table 9. While amounts are allocated to various portfolio segments, the total ALLL, excluding impairment reserves prescribed under provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 114, is available to absorb losses from any segment of the portfolio. 35 TABLE 9 ALLOCATION OF ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES (in thousands of dollars) 2002 2001 2000 1999 1998 Commercial loans $ 155,577 $ 174,713 $ 104,968 $ 94,978 $ 82,129 Real estate Construction 12,542 17,685 12,596 14,863 10,729 Commercial 35,853 38,177 33,909 32,073 35,206 Consumer Automobile loans and leases 51,621 38,799 28,877 40,043 40,792 Home equity 18,621 24,054 19,246 17,089 15,691 Residential mortgage 8,566 6,013 4,421 5,393 5,247 Other consumer loans 8,085 19,757 22,516 21,523 47,715 Total allocated 290,865 319,198 226,533 225,962 237,509 Total unallocated 45,783 50,134 38,396 47,969 35,616 TOTAL ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES $ 336,648 $ 369,332 $ 264,929 $ 273,931 $ 273,125 NET CHARGE OFFS Total net charge offs as a percent of average total loans and leases were 1.13% in 2002 compared to 0.81% in 2001. The increase was due largely to $51.3 million in commercial loan charge offs related to the special credit actions in the fourth quarter of 2002. In 2001, Huntington made the decision to exit the sub prime automobile and truck and equipment lending business, which had a combined balance of $69.7 million at December 31, 2002, down from $144.3 million at the end of 2001. Excluding net charge offs related to these exited businesses, total net charge offs in 2002 and 2001 were 1.08% and 0.73%, respectively. Commercial and commercial real estate net charge offs, spread over a number of companies in the retail trade, manufacturing, services, and communications sectors, were 1.46% in the current year versus 0.55% in 2001. Excluding the net charge offs related to the fourth quarter 2002 special credit actions, total net charge offs and total commercial and commercial real estate net charge offs for 2002 were 0.84% and 0.90%, respectively. Consumer charge offs were 0.65% in 2002 compared with 0.98% in 2001. Automobile loan and lease net charge offs were 1.06% in 2002 compared with 1.96% in 2001. Table 10 shows the amount of net charge offs by loan and lease type as a percentage of average loans and leases.

Management expects 2003 full year net charge offs to be in the 0.65% 0.75% range. NON PERFORMING ASSETS Non performing assets consist of loans and leases that are no longer accruing interest, loans and leases that have been renegotiated to below market rates based upon financial difficulties of the borrower, and real estate acquired through foreclosure. Commercial and commercial real estate loans are generally placed on non accrual status when collection of principal or interest is in doubt or when the loan is 90 days past due. When interest accruals are suspended, accrued interest income is reversed with current year accruals charged to earnings and prior year amounts generally charged off as a credit loss. Consumer loans and leases, excluding residential mortgages, are not placed on non accrual status but are charged off in accordance with regulatory statutes, which is generally no more than 120 days past due. Residential mortgages, while highly secured, are placed on non accrual status within 180 days past due as to principal and 210 days past due as to interest, regardless of security. A charge off on a residential mortgage loan is recorded when the loan has been foreclosed and the loan balance exceeds the fair value of the real estate. The fair value of the collateral is then recorded as real estate owned. When, in managements judgment, the borrowers ability to make periodic interest and principal payments resumes and collectibility is no longer in doubt, the loan is returned to accrual status. Total NPAs were $136.7 million at December 31, 2002, compared with $227.5 million at the end of 2001 and represented 0.74% and 1.23% of total loans and leases and other real estate. The decline in the level of NPAs from the prior year end reflected the sale of NPAs in the fourth quarter of 2002. While the economy has continued to be weak and the uncertainty about the future level of economic activity has increased, management continues to expect NPAs in 2003 to remain around current levels. 37 TABLE 11 NON PERFORMING ASSETS AND PAST DUE LOANS AND LEASES DECEMBER 31, (in thousands of dollars) 2002 2001 2000 1999 1998 Non accrual loans and leases Commercial loans $ 91,861 $ 159,637 $ 55,804 $ 42,958 $ 34,586 Real estate Construction 5,554 13,885 8,687 10,785 10,181 Commercial 21,211 34,475 18,015 16,131 13,243 Residential 9,443 11,836 10,174 11,866 14,419 Total non accrual loans and leases 128,069 219,833 92,680 81,740 72,429 Renegotiated loans 1,276 1,304 1,330 4,706 TOTAL NON PERFORMING LOANS AND LEASES 128,069 221,109 93,984 83,070 77,135 Other real estate, net 8,654 6,384 11,413 15,171 18,964 TOTAL NON PERFORMING ASSETS $ 136,723 $ 227,493 $ 105,397 $ 98,241 $ 96,099 ACCRUING LOANS AND LEASES PAST DUE 90 DAYS OR MORE $ 61,526 $ 76,013 $ 66,665 $ 54,567 $ 47,789 NON PERFORMING LOANS AND LEASES AS A % OF TOTAL LOANS AND LEASES 0.69% 1.20% 0.53% 0.46% 0.44% NON PERFORMING ASSETS AS A % OF TOTAL LOANS AND LEASES AND OTHER REAL ESTATE 0.74% 1.23% 0.60% 0.55% 0.55% ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES AS A % OF NON PERFORMING LOANS AND LEASES 263% 167% 282% 330% 354% ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES AS A% OF NON PERFORMING ASSETS 246% 162% 251% 279% 284% ACCRUING LOANS AND LEASES PAST DUE 90 DAYS OR MORE TO TOTAL LOANS AND LEASES 0.33% 0.41% 0.38% 0.30% 0.27% Note: For 2002, the amount of interest income which would have been recorded under the original terms for total loans and leases classified as non accrual or renegotiated was $12.6 million.

Loans and leases past due ninety days or more but continuing to accrue interest decreased to $61.5 million at December 31, 2002, down from $76.0 million a year earlier. This represented 0.33% and 0.41% of total loans and leases, respectively.

The Board of Directors and the Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO) oversee various risks by establishing broad policies and specific operating limits that govern a variety of risks inherent in operations, including liquidity, counterparty credit risk, settlement, and market risks. Market risk is the potential for declines in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates, exchange rates, and equity prices. Interest rate risk is Huntingtons primary market risk. It results from timing differences in the repricing and maturity of assets and liabilities and changes in relationships between market interest rates and the yields on assets and rates on liabilities, including the impact of embedded options. Interest rate risk management is a dynamic process that encompasses new business flows onto the balance sheet, wholesale investment and funding, and the changing market and business environment. Effective management of interest rate risk begins with appropriately diversified investments and funding sources. To accomplish overall balance sheet objectives, management regularly accesses money, bond, futures, and options markets, as well as trading exchanges. In addition, Huntington contracts with dealers in over the counter financial instruments for interest rate swaps. ALCO regularly monitors position concentrations and the level of interest rate sensitivity to ensure compliance with approved risk tolerances. Interest rate risk modeling is performed monthly. An income simulation model is used to measure the sensitivity of forecasted net interest income to changes in market rates over a one year horizon. Although Bank Owned Life Insurance and automobile operating lease assets are classified as non interest earning assets, Huntington includes these portfolios in its interest sensitivity analysis because both have attributes similar to fixed rate interest earning assets. Market value risk (referred to as Economic Value of Equity, or EVE) is measured using a static balance sheet. The models used for these measurements take into account prepayment speeds on mortgage loans, mortgage backed securities, and consumer installment loans, as well as cash flows of other loans and deposits. Balance sheet growth assumptions are also considered in the income simulation model. Moreover, the models incorporate the effects of embedded options, such as interest rate caps, floors, and call options, and account for changes in relationships among interest rates. The baseline scenario for the income simulation, with which all others are compared, is based on market interest rates implied by the prevailing yield curve. Alternative market rate scenarios are then employed to determine their impact on the baseline scenario. These alternative market rate scenarios include spot rates remaining unchanged for the entire measurement period, parallel rate shifts on both a gradual and immediate basis, as well as movements in rates that alter the shape of the yield curve. Scenarios are also developed to measure basis risk, such as the impact of LIBOR based rates rising or falling faster than the prime rate. When evaluating short term interest rate risk exposure, management uses, for its primary measurement, scenarios that model 200 basis point increasing and decreasing parallel shifts in the yield curve during the next twelve month period. At December 31, 2002, only the 200 basis point increasing parallel shift in the yield curve was modeled because a 200 basis point decrease in the interest rate curve was not feasible given the overall low level of interest rates. At the end of 2002, that scenario modeled net interest income to be approximately 0.7% lower than the internal forecast of net interest income over the same time period using the current level of forward rates. This compares with the Board of Directors policy limit of a 4.0% change in net interest income given a 200 basis point scenario. Management believes further declines in market rates would put modest downward pressure on net interest income, resulting from the implicit pricing floors in non maturity deposits. The net interest margin has been adversely impacted in recent months by: (1) fixed rate consumer loan repayments being reinvested at lower market rates; (2) high repayments of residential mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities; (3) the implicit floors in retail deposits as rates declined to historically low levels; (4) the rapid growth of lower yielding residential adjustable rate mortgage loans retained on the balance sheet; (5) the lower yield on the higher quality automobile loan originations; and (6) the flattening of the yield curve. Future net interest income could be adversely affected by these factors. The primary measurement for EVE risk assumes an immediate and parallel increase in rates of 200 basis points. At December 31, 2002, the model indicated that such an increase in rates would be expected to reduce the EVE by approximately 3.8% and compares with an estimated negative impact of approximately 2.9% at December 31, 2001. The model is a useful but simplified representation of Huntingtons underlying interest rate risk profile. Simulations reflect choices of statistical techniques, functional forms, model parameters, and numerous uncertain assumptions. Nonetheless, experience has demonstrated and management believes that these models provide reliable guidance for measuring and managing interest rate sensitivity. 39 LIQUIDITY Liquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost. The liquidity of the Bank is used to make loans and leases and to repay deposit liabilities as they become due or are demanded by customers. Huntingtons ALCO establishes guidelines and regularly monitors the overall liquidity position of the Bank and the parent company to ensure that various alternative strategies exist to cover unanticipated events that could affect liquidity. Management believes that sufficient liquidity exists at both the parent company and the Bank to meet their estimated needs. BANK LIQUIDITY The Bank manages both its external and internal liquidity. External liquidity includes maintaining funding sources for the Banks activities. These activities primarily consist of making loans and leases to customers, repaying the Banks obligations as they become due, and supporting the cost of operating the Bank. Selected information regarding the Banks short term borrowings is found in Table 14 and the maturity of obligations, including payments due under operating lease obligations, is reflected in Table 15. Deposits are the Banks primary source of funding, of which 87% were provided by the Regional Banking segment. Table 13 details the types and sources of deposits by business segment at December 31, 2002, and compares these balances by type and source to balances at December 31, 2001.

These time deposits mature as follows: $343 million within three months, $182 million within six but more than three months, $212 million within one year but more than six months, and $1,166 million maturing beyond one year. At December 31, 2002, Huntingtons loans and leases were 106% of total deposits. This compares with 91% of total deposits at December 31, 2001, or 102% excluding the loans and deposits sold with the Florida operations. 40 The Banks ALCO establishes policies and monitors guidelines to diversify the Banks wholesale funding sources to avoid concentrations in any one market source. Wholesale funding sources include Federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, non core deposits, and medium and long term debt. To enhance the availability of liquidity, the Bank has available a $6.0 billion domestic bank note program. This program was renewed in 2002. At December 31, 2002, a total of $5.7 billion in domestic bank notes remained available for future issuance under this program. In addition, the Bank shares a $2.0 billion Euronote program with the parent company. This program was renewed on February 6, 2003, and is subject to annual renewal. Approximately $1.3 billion was available under this program at December 31, 2002. Both programs enable the Bank to issue notes with maturities from one month to thirty years. During 2002, management added significantly to its wholesale borrowings, primarily due to the loss of deposit funding with the sale of Huntingtons Florida banking operations. In adding wholesale borrowings, management also lengthened the average maturity of these borrowings. At the end of 2002, the Bank had wholesale borrowings of $5.9 billion, which had a weighted average maturity of 1.7 years.

These advances carry maturities from one month to twenty years. At December 31, 2002, the Bank had $1.0 billion of advances from the FHLB, compared with only $17 million of advances at December 31, 2001. During 2002, the Bank significantly increased its borrowing capability with the FHLB as these advances provided a flexible source of funding. At December 31, 2002, a total of $2.7 billion of residential mortgage loans, commercial real estate loans, and home equity loans were pledged to secure borrowing under these advances.

Weighted average yields were calculated using amortized cost and on a fully taxable equivalent basis assuming a 35% tax rate, excluding marketable equity securities. 41 TABLE 16 SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE DECEMBER 31, (in thousands of dollars) 2002 2001 2000 U.S. Treasury and Federal Agencies $ 2,627,684 $ 2,322,079 $ 3,284,031 Other 775,685 527,500 806,494 TOTAL SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE $ 3,403,369 $ 2,849,579 $ 4,090,525 AMORTIZED FAIR COST VALUE YIELD U.S. Treasury 1 5 years $ 13,434 $ 14,066 3.51% 6 10 years 4,704 5,367 5.51% Over 10 years 412 479 6.07% Total U.S. Treasury 18,550 19,912 4.07% Federal Agencies Mortgage backed 1 5 years 48,618 50,428 5.54% 6 10 years 356,082 363,596 5.18% Over 10 years 1,350,737 1,385,233 5.68% Total Mortgage backed 1,755,437 1,799,257 5.58% Other agencies Under 1 year 34,923 35,966 4.91% 1 5 years 743,609 768,271 5.21% 6 10 years 3,755 4,278 5.91% Total Other 782,287 808,515 5.20% TOTAL U.S. TREASURY AND FEDERAL AGENCIES 2,556,274 2,627,684 5.44% Other Under 1 year 7,133 7,183 8.43% 1 5 years 62,939 63,886 6.53% 6 10 years 49,581 51,046 6.61% Over 10 years 451,108 449,958 5.71% Retained interest in securitizations 146,160 159,978 15.56% Marketable equity securities 42,846 43,634 TOTAL OTHER 759,767 775,685 7.88% TOTAL SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE $ 3,316,041 $ 3,403,369 5.98% Other significant factors impacting the Banks liquidity are the repayment of principal and the receipt of interest on the Banks loans and direct financing leases, rental income payments from operating lease assets, and proceeds from the sales of vehicles at the end of the applicable operating lease. The Banks consumer loan and lease portfolio contains a significant amount of loans and leases with relatively shorter weighted average lives to maturity. In addition, commercial loans and real estate construction portfolios have relatively short maturities with 44% of the combined principal maturing in one year or less, as reflected in Table 17.

These sources include the sale or securitization of loans, the ability to acquire additional national market, non core deposits, additional collateralized borrowings such as FHLB advances, the issuance of debt securities, and the issuance of preferred or common securities in public or private transactions. The Bank also can borrow through the Federal Reserves discount window. At December 31, 2002, a total of $1.5 billion of commercial loans had been pledged to secure potential future borrowings that could be obtained through this facility. PARENT COMPANY LIQUIDITY Parent company liquidity consists primarily of a program of regular dividends from its subsidiaries, predominantly the Bank, its medium term note program, and a commercial paper program issued through Huntington Bancshares Financial Corporation, a non bank subsidiary. The Bank could declare dividends to be paid to the parent company, without regulatory approval, of $29.8 million at December 31, 2002. The parent company uses this liquidity to pay dividends to its stockholders, repurchase shares of its common stock, meet its financial obligations, fund certain non bank activities, finance acquisitions, and for other general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2002, the parent company had $455 million issued under a $750 million medium term note program, leaving $295 million available for future funding needs. At December 31, 2002, the parent company had $140 million in medium term notes outstanding: $40 million will mature in 2003 and $100 million in 2004. As mentioned earlier, the parent company shares a $2.0 billion Euronote program with the Bank. Availability of funding through these two programs amounted to $1.6 billion at December 31, 2002. In 2002, the liquidity of the parent company was favorably affected by the sale of the Florida banking operations through a subsequent recapitalization of the Bank. This recapitalization returned $670 million of capital to the parent company. During 2002, subsequent to the recapitalization, the parent company repurchased 19.2 million shares of its common stock for $370 million. Details of this program are discussed further under the Capital section that follows. At December 31, 2002, the parent company had $546.9 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand. Management believes that the parent company has sufficient liquidity to meet its cash flow obligations in 2003, including payment of its current dividend, without relying upon the capital markets for financing. CAPITAL Capital is managed at each legal subsidiary based upon the respective risks and growth opportunities, as well as regulatory requirements. Management places significant emphasis on the maintenance of a strong capital position, which promotes investor confidence, provides access to the national markets under favorable terms, and enhances business growth and acquisition opportunities. The importance of managing capital is also recognized and management continually strives to maintain an appropriate balance between capital adequacy and returns to shareholders. Shareholders equity declined $152 million during 2002 compared with an increase of $7 million in the previous year. Increases to shareholders equity reflecting higher net earnings, equity issued for acquisitions, and the positive mark to market of securities available for sale and derivatives used to hedge cash flows for 2002, were more than offset by repurchases of common shares and dividends. Cash dividends declared were $0.64 per share in 2002, down from $0.72 per share in 2001 and $0.76 per share in 2000. Average shareholders equity in 2002 was $2.2 billion, down modestly from $2.3 billion in 2001. The ratio of average equity to average assets in 2002 was 8.55% versus 8.29% a year ago. Tangible period end equity to tangible period end assets was 7.24% at the end of 2002, up significantly from 5.87% a year earlier, reflecting the tangible capital generated from the sale of the Florida operations offset by the subsequent share repurchase program in 2002. Given the current asset mix and risk profile, management has a longer term targeted tangible equity to asset ratio of 7.00%. In February 2002, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to 22 million shares and canceled the previously existing authorization. Under this authorization, a total of 19.2 million shares were repurchased at a cost of $370.0 million through the end of December 2002. An additional 0.2 million shares were repurchased in early January 2003, bringing total shares repurchased under this authorization to 19.4 million shares. In mid January 2003, the Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization for up to 8 million shares, canceling the 2.6 million shares remaining under the February 2002 authorization. Huntington expects to use this new authorization to complete the purchase of the 2.6 million shares remaining for repurchase under the prior authorization. Repurchases of shares will be made from time to time as deemed appropriate and will be reserved for reissue in connection with Huntingtons dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans, as well as for acquisitions and other corporate purposes. 43 Risk based capital guidelines established by the Federal Reserve Board set minimum capital requirements and require institutions to calculate risk based capital ratios by assigning risk weightings to assets and off balance sheet items, such as interest rate swaps, loan commitments, and securitizations. Huntingtons Tier 1 risk based capital ratio, total risk based capital ratio, leverage ratio, and risk adjusted assets for the recent five years are shown in Table 18: TABLE 18 CAPITAL ADEQUACY "WELL AT DECEMBER 31, CAPITALIZED" (in millions of dollars) MINIMUMS 2002 2001 2000 1999 1998 Total Risk Adjusted Assets N/A $ 27,030 $ 27,736 $ 26,757 $ 25,187 $ 24,177 Ratios: Tier 1 Risk Based Capital 6.00% 8.34% 7.02% 7.13% 7.46% 7.05% Total Risk Based Capital 10.00% 11.25% 10.07% 10.29% 10.57% 10.62% Tier 1 Leverage 5.00% 8.51% 7.16% 6.85% 6.64% 6.31% Huntington is supervised and regulated by the Federal Reserve whereas the Bank is primarily supervised and regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which establishes similar regulatory capital guidelines for banks. The Bank had regulatory capital ratios in excess of regulatory minimums. During 2002, Huntington acquired Haberer Investment Advisor, Inc. (Haberer), a Cincinnati based registered investment advisory firm with approximately $500 million in assets under management. Huntington paid cash to Haberer shareholders and issued 202,695 shares of common stock from treasury. Also during 2002, Huntington acquired LeaseNet Group, Inc. (LeaseNet), a $90 million leasing company located in Dublin, Ohio. Huntington paid cash to LeaseNet shareholders and issued 835,035 shares of common stock from treasury. See Huntingtons Statement of Changes in Shareholders Equity on page 66 for a detail of activity. LINES OF BUSINESS DISCUSSION Below is a brief description of each line of business and a discussion of business segment results. Regional Banking, Dealer Sales, and the Private Financial Group are the major business lines. The fourth segment includes the impact of the Treasury function and other unallocated assets, liabilities, revenue, and expense. Financial information for each line of business, including a reconciliation to reported earnings, can also be found in Note 28 to the consolidated financial statements. The chief decision makers for Huntington rely on operating basis earnings for review of performance and for critical decision making purposes and, therefore, the information below is presented on an operating basis. During 2002, the previously reported segments, Retail Banking and Corporate Banking, were combined and renamed Regional Banking. In addition, changes were made in 2002 to the methodologies utilized for certain balance sheet and income statement allocations from Huntingtons management reporting system. The prior periods have not been restated for these methodology changes. The following tables within each segment show performance on this basis for the most recent three years. REGIONAL BANKING Regional Banking provides products and services to retail, business banking, and commercial customers. This segments products include home equity loans, first mortgage loans, direct installment loans, business loans, personal and business deposit products, as well as sales of investment and insurance services. These products and services are offered in six operating regions within the five states of Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, West Virginia, and Kentucky through Huntingtons traditional banking network, Direct Bank Huntingtons customer service center, and Web Bank at www.huntington.com. Regional Banking also represents middle market and large commercial banking relationships which use a variety of banking products and services including, but not limited to, commercial loans, international trade, and cash management. 44 TABLE 19 REGIONAL BANKING RESULTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, (in thousands of dollars) 2002 2001 2000 Net interest income $ 573,456 $ 596,884 $ 625,500 Provision for loan and lease losses 141,190 96,943 36,180 Non interest income 263,824 257,801 271,096 Non interest expense 525,162 490,943 537,331 Income before taxes 170,928 266,799 323,085 Income taxes 59,825 93,380 111,438 OPERATING EARNINGS $ 111,103 $ 173,419 $ 211,647 Regional Bankings operating earnings were $111.1 million in 2002 compared to $173.4 million for 2001 and $211.6 million for 2000. Net interest income decreased $23.4 million, or 4%, in 2002. Regional Banking provides net funds to Huntingtons other business segments since its deposits exceed its loans and leases and, therefore, receives an earnings credit for those excess deposits. The declining interest rate environment resulted in lower credit for this deposit excess and margin compression in 2002. The provision for loan and lease losses increased $44.2 million in 2002 over 2001 versus an increase of $60.8 million in 2001 over 2000. The increases in 2002 and 2001 were indicative of the deteriorating credit quality that began late in 2000. Provision expense reflects net charge offs (excluding the restructuring charges for 2001) and charges for loan and lease growth for the period. In 2002, net charge offs were 0.76% compared with 0.54% for 2001. Non interest income rose $6.0 million, or 2%, in 2002, following a $13.3 million, or 5%, decline in 2001. Service charges on deposit accounts increased 12% (personal 9% and corporate 14%) to $144.7 million. The growth in personal service charges was primarily attributable to a new pricing structure and deposit volume initiatives. The corporate increase was the result of customers choosing to pay fees in lieu of maintaining balances due to lower earnings credit paid to commercial checking customers. In addition, electronic banking fees increased 10%. These revenue increases were partially offset by a 12% decline in total mortgage banking income. Gross mortgage banking revenue increased commensurate with a 22% increase in closed loans, but significant impairment of mortgage servicing rights pushed total mortgage banking income down in 2002. The declining rate environment during the recent twelve months caused accelerated mortgage prepayment expectations and, therefore, recognition of asset impairment of capitalized mortgage servicing rights and increased amortization. Excluding mortgage banking income, non interest income increased 11% in 2002. Non interest expense was $525.2 million in 2002, up $34.2 million, or 7%, when compared to $490.9 million in 2001. Non interest expense for 2001 was down $46.4 million, or 9%, from 2000. Personnel costs were $206.8 million, up 8%, compared with $190.7 million in 2001. The increase reflected investment in strengthening Regional Bankings management, business banking sales, and credit administration teams. In addition, this segment experienced increases in performance based incentive compensation commensurate with production and revenue growth. Total Regional Banking average loans and leases for 2002 increased to $12.3 billion, or 6%, over 2001. Mortgage and home equity lending represented the majority of the growth in average earning assets. Average mortgage loans increased 46% from $815 million in 2001 to nearly $1.2 billion in 2002. Home equity loans and lines of credit increased 19% from $1.8 billion in 2001 to $2.2 billion in 2002. Commercial real estate loans for 2002 grew $213.6 million, or 7%, while average commercial loans were down $373.1 million, or 8%, from 2001. Total average deposits for 2002 increased $1.1 billion, or 8%, from 2001. An enhanced focus on relationship selling and the economic environment propelled growth in checking and money market deposits. While demand for retail CDs remained strong, Regional Banking protected interest margins by refraining from paying aggressive competitive rates resulting in a 2% decline in CD balances year over year. Average deposit growth excluding CDs was 15% in 2002. As noted in the PFG line of business review that follows, Regional Banking also experienced growth in its packaged investment product sales through the retail channel. Regional Banking contributed 40% of operating earnings in 2002 and comprised 68% of Huntingtons total loan and lease portfolio and 87% of total deposits at December 31, 2002. 45 DEALER SALES Dealer Sales serves automotive dealerships within Huntingtons primary banking markets, as well as in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee. This segment finances the purchase of automobiles by customers of the automotive dealerships, purchases automobiles from dealers and simultaneously leases the automobile under long term operating and direct financing leases, finances the dealerships inventory of automobiles, and provides other banking services to the automotive dealerships and their owners. TABLE 20 DEALER SALES RESULTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, (in thousands of dollars) 2002 2001 2000 Net interest income $ 6,782 $ (30,728) $ (49,821) Provision for loan and lease losses 44,573 29,655 17,098 Non interest income 687,061 712,444 656,262 Non interest expense 609,257 637,979 523,387 Income before taxes 40,013 14,082 65,956 Income taxes 14,001 4,928 22,965 OPERATING EARNINGS $ 26,012 $ 9,154 $ 42,991 Dealer Sales operating earnings were $26.0 million in 2002, compared to $9.2 million in 2001 and $43.0 million in 2000. Higher provision for loan and lease losses and losses on terminated operating leases, reflecting weakened economic conditions, higher bankruptcies, and a softer used car market, had an adverse impact on operating performance of this segment in 2002 and 2001. Since April 2002, Huntington began booking leases for automobiles as direct financing leases instead of operating leases. Net interest income was $6.8 million for 2002, compared with a negative $30.7 million for 2001. Net interest income was a negative $49.8 million for 2000. Net interest income was negative for 2001 and 2000 because the funding cost related to Dealer Sales operating lease assets, which are non interest earning assets, is included in interest expense, whereas the revenue is reported as a component of non interest income. The change in net interest income is primarily from recording automobile leases as direct financing leases rather than operating leases as had been Huntingtons practice prior to May 2002. Automobile loan balances increased $188.7 million to $3.0 billion during 2002 from $2.9 billion in 2001. Direct financing lease balances increased $767 million to $874 million in 2002, while operating lease inventory balances decreased $368 million to $2.6 billion. Total automobile loan and lease (direct financing and operating) originations were $3.5 billion in 2002 compared with $3.4 billion in 2001. The provision for loan and lease losses for 2002 increased $14.9 million from 2001 compared with an increase in 2001 of $12.6 million. The increase in provision expense is from the creation of additional allowance for losses on loans and leases as required by direct financing lease accounting. Non interest income decreased $25.4 million, or 4%, from 2001, reflecting lower operating lease rental income. Non interest expense decreased $28.7 million, reflecting lower depreciation expense on lower operating lease inventory balances. Dealer Sales contributed 10% and 37% of 2002 operating earnings and operating revenues, respectively. PRIVATE FINANCIAL GROUP (PFG) PFG provides products and services designed to meet the needs of Huntingtons higher wealth customers. Revenue is derived through the sale of personal trust, asset management, investment advisory, brokerage, insurance, and deposit and loan products and services. Income and related expenses from the sale of brokerage and insurance products is shared with the line of business that generated the sale or provided the customer referral. 46 TABLE 21 PRIVATE FINANCIAL GROUP RESULTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, (in thousands of dollars) 2002 2001 2000 Net interest income $ 35,403 $ 36,323 $ 30,502 Provision for loan and lease losses 3,477 408 1,279 Non interest income 108,817 91,986 57,442 Non interest expense 100,961 94,025 53,866 Income before taxes 39,782 33,876 32,799 Income taxes 13,924 11,857 11,343 OPERATING EARNINGS $ 25,858 $ 22,019 $ 21,456 PFGs operating earnings for 2002 were $25.9 million, up 17% from 2001, due primarily to growth in non interest income. For 2002, growth in non interest income was partially offset by reduced net interest income, increased provision for loan and lease losses, and increased non interest expense. Operating earnings were $21.5 million for 2000. Average loans and leases grew 36% to $895 million and average deposits grew 30% to $807 million from 2001 to 2002. Net interest income was down 3% driven by a shift in product mix and margin compression, particularly on consumer loans and leases reflective of lower consumer mortgage loan rates. Provision for loan and lease losses for 2002 increased by $3.1 million from 2001 largely reflecting higher net charge offs. Net charge offs were 0.20% of average loans and leases for 2002 versus 0.09% for 2001. Non interest income for 2002 was $108.8 million, up 18% from 2001, resulting primarily from increased brokerage revenue, increased trust revenue, and increased other income. Brokerage revenue increased by $7.3 million, or 23%, from 2001 due to increased sales of annuity products. Insurance revenue for 2002 decreased by $0.4 million, or 3%, from 2001 mostly due to decreased sales volume from the life agency business. In 2002, PFG restructured its sales/distribution force to eliminate the use of separate insurance sales personnel to sell insurance products through the retail branch offices and to utilize the more established brokerage sales force for retail insurance sales. Although sales volume decreased during this transition year as the new model was being implemented, significant expense savings resulted as well. Trust revenue for 2002 increased by $4.0 million, or 7%, from 2001 largely due to the acquisition of Haberer in April 2002. Increased revenue from investment advisory and other services provided to the Huntington Funds was also a major source of the increase in trust revenue. During 2001, PFG introduced five new equity funds. These funds grew to over $200 million in assets by the end of 2002. Other income for 2002 increased by $5.6 million from 2001 primarily because of the $4.2 million charge in 2001 for the impairment loss related to the Pacific Gas & Electric commercial paper held by the Huntington Money Market Fund. Non interest expense for 2002 increased $6.9 million, or 7%, from 2001 driven by the Haberer operating expenses combined with increased sales commissions and salary expense. Sales commissions increased $1.7 million as a result of the increase in non interest income. PFG contributed 9% of operating earnings in 2002 and 8% of total revenues in 2002. TREASURY / OTHER The Treasury / Other segment includes assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, and expense that are not directly assigned or allocated to one of the lines of business. Since a match funded transfer pricing system is used to allocate interest income and interest expense to other business segments, Treasury / Other results include the net impact of any over or under allocations arising from centralized management of interest rate risk including the net impact of derivatives used to hedge interest rate sensitivity. Furthermore, this segments results include the net impact of administering Huntingtons investment securities portfolio as part of overall liquidity management. Additionally, amortization expense of intangible assets and gains or losses not allocated to other business segments are also a component. 47 TABLE 22 TREASURY / OTHER RESULTS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, (in thousands of dollars) 2002 2001 2000 Net interest income $ 124,209 $ 30,536 $ (28,717) Provision for loan and lease losses Non interest income 61,639 65,969 91,660 Non interest expense 69,584 96,636 39,467 Income before taxes 116,264 (131) 23,476 Income taxes (472) (42,112) (20,441) OPERATING EARNINGS $ 116,736 $ 41,981 $ 43,917 Treasury / Other reported operating earnings of $116.7 million in 2002, up significantly from the two preceding years. This primarily reflected the reduction in transfer pricing credits allocated to Regional Banking for its deposits, the maturity in late 2001 of $2 billion of interest rate swaps that had significant negative spreads, and the benefit of lower short term interest rates, particularly with the steeper yield curve. Non interest income for 2002 was $61.6 million compared with $66.0 million for 2001 reflecting the higher gains from securities transactions in the current year, increased Bank owned life insurance income, and revenue from trading activities. Non interest expense for 2002 declined $27.1 million from 2001. This reflected a decline in the amortization of intangibles arising from the implementation of FASB Statement No. 142 and lower unallocated personnel costs offset by higher unallocated outside services and processing, equipment and occupancy, and telecommunication expenses. Income tax expense for each of the other business segments is calculated at a statutory 35% tax rate. However, Huntingtons overall effective tax rate is lower and, as a result, Treasury / Other reflects the reconciling items to the statutory tax rate in its Income taxes. RESULTS FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER Table 23 presents Huntingtons results of operations for the recent eight quarters and Table 24 presents selected stock, performance ratios, and capital data for the same periods. Fourth quarter 2002 earnings were $69.3 million, or $0.29 per common share. This compared with earnings of $55.0 million, or $0.22 per common share, in the year ago fourth quarter, or earnings of $69.0 million, or $0.27 per common share excluding the impact associated with Huntingtons strategic restructuring plan and the sold Florida banking and insurance operations. On this same comparative basis, 2002 fourth quarter earnings were down 6%, however, earnings per common share were flat, reflecting the benefit of the share repurchase program. Fully taxable equivalent net interest income for 2002 fourth quarter was up $11.7 million, or 6%, from the year ago quarter. Excluding the impact of the sold Florida banking operations, fully taxable equivalent net interest income for 2002 fourth quarter increased $31.4 million, or 19%, reflecting a combination of a 16% increase in average earning assets, and a 6 basis point, or an effective 2%, increase in the net interest margin to 3.62% from 3.56%. The 16% increase in average earning assets from a year ago reflected a 15% increase in average securities and a 16% increase in average loans and leases. The increase in loans and leases was driven by a 36% increase in average consumer loans, including a 15% increase in home equity loans and lines, a 105% increase in residential mortgages, and a 44% increase in automobile loans and leases. Since April 2002, automobile leases were recorded as direct financing leases, which averaged $759 million in the 2002 fourth quarter. Automobile loans were up 19% from the year ago fourth quarter. Total average commercial loans were down 3% and average commercial real estate loans increased 11% from the year ago quarter. Non interest income was $271.9 million, down $39.8 million, or 13%, from the year ago quarter. Excluding from the year ago quarter the impact of Huntingtons strategic restructuring plan, as well as the impact of the sold Florida banking and insurance operations, non interest income was down $21.1 million, or 7%, from a year earlier. Primarily contributing to this $21.1 million year over year decrease were a $29.3 million, or 16%, decrease in operating lease income and a $7.8 million, or 59%, decrease in mortgage banking income (primarily due to a mortgage servicing rights temporary impairment recorded in the fourth quarter of 2002). This was partially offset by a 17% increase in deposit service charges, a 48 9% increase in brokerage and insurance income, a 14% increase in other service charges, primarily electronic banking fees, and a 32% increase in other income. Non interest expense was $329.3 million in the 2002 fourth quarter, down $54.9 million from the year ago quarter, but up $7.4 million, or 2%, after excluding from that quarter $15.1 million in restructuring charges, as well as the expenses related to the sold Florida banking and insurance operations. This $7.4 million increase was primarily due to a $19.8 million, or 14%, decrease in operating lease expense, partially offset by a $17.0 million, or 18%, increase in personnel cost. Contributing to the increase in personnel costs were salary expense, incentive compensation, and benefit costs. The increased salary expense reflected higher staffing levels associated with the expansion of management and employee talent at all levels, including the credit workout area. Higher sales commissions were reflected across all lines of business. Higher fourth quarter benefit costs were somewhat offset by a credit of $1.5 million in gains related to stock received from the demutualization of certain insurance companies where Huntington owned related policies. Benefit costs were increased by year end accruals related to medical, long term disability, and pension expenses, which aggregated $9.1 million. Pension settlement losses for 2002 were $3.4 million and were recognized all in the fourth quarter. Outside data processing and other services was up $1.8 million, or 12%, and professional services decreased $3.0 million, or 25%. Net occupancy expense decreased $1.7 million, or 11%, due to a $1.5 million favorable settlement of a real estate tax appeal. Amortization of intangible expense declined $2.4 million due the implementation of FASB Statement No. 142 at the beginning of 2002. Other expense in the fourth quarter increased $15.2 million, due in part to impairment of an investment in an unconsolidated subsidiary that totaled $3.9 million. Non interest expense for the fourth quarter 2002 included accrual adjustments that reduced total non interest expense, in aggregate, by $0.7 million related to litigation, marketing, and charitable contributions. Huntington also recorded recoveries of previously recognized trust losses totaling $0.8 million, and the receipt of a legal settlement for $0.7 million related to a joint venture in which Huntington was a participant. Restructuring reserves of $7.2 million established in 1998 and 2001 were released in the 2002 fourth quarter based on managements assessment of future claims against these reserves. The release of reserves consisted of a $5.0 million legal settlement received by Huntington in December 2002 that related to the 1998 reserve and $2.2 million of reserves established in 2001. At December 31, 2002, Huntington had $4.1 million remaining in reserves established in 1998 for the exit of under performing business units and $14.4 million remaining in restructuring reserves established in 2001. Also, at December 31, 2002, Huntington had a contingency reserve of $1.8 million related to its August 2002 restructuring of its interest in Huntington Merchant Services, L.L.C. Net charge offs for the 2002 fourth quarter were $83.2 million, or an annualized 1.83%, including $51.3 million in charge offs associated with the fourth quarter special credit actions. Excluding these charge offs, net charge offs were $31.9 million, or 0.70%, of average loans and leases (annualized). Loan and lease loss provision expense in the fourth quarter was $51.2 million, up $4.2 million from the year ago quarter after excluding from that quarter an additional $50.0 million charge to the provision, as well as $4.0 million related to the sold Florida banking operations. ROE and ROA were 12.0% and 0.96%, respectively, for the 2002 fourth quarter, compared to 11.9% and 1.12%, respectively, for the year ago quarter, excluding the impact resulting from the strategic restructuring and sale of the Florida banking and insurance operations. 49 TABLE 23 SELECTED QUARTERLY INCOME STATEMENTS 2002 2001 (in thousands, except per share amounts) FOURTH THIRD SECOND FIRST Fourth Third Second First NET INTEREST INCOME $ 199,179 $ 191,265 $ 180,261 $ 178,869 $ 188,035 $ 179,078 $ 177,254 $ 170,921 Provision for loan and lease losses 51,236 54,304 49,876 39,010 101,075 34,053 99,444 22,754 NET INTEREST INCOME AFTER PROVISION FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES 147,943 136,961 130,385 139,859 86,960 145,025 77,810 148,167 Operating lease income 149,259 160,164 171,617 176,034 178,588 181,851 174,151 157,143 Service charges on deposit accounts 41,435 37,706 35,608 38,815 43,025 41,966 40,902 39,119 Brokerage and insurance 16,431 13,943 17,677 18,792 20,966 19,912 19,388 18,768 Trust services 15,306 14,997 16,247 15,501 15,321 15,485 15,178 14,314 Bank owned life insurance 10,722 10,723 10,722 10,956 11,001 11,001 9,561 9,560 Mortgage banking 5,530 2,594 7,835 16,074 14,082 13,308 18,168 8,960 Other service charges and fees 10,890 10,837 10,529 10,632 12,552 12,350 12,217 11,098 Gain on sale of Florida operations 182,470 Merchant Services gain 24,550 Securities gains (losses) 2,339 1,140 966 457 89 1,059 (2,503) 2,078 Other 19,943 21,948 17,513 12,802 16,005 15,533 14,619 13,127 TOTAL NON INTEREST INCOME 271,855 298,602 288,714 482,533 311,629 312,465 301,681 274,167 Operating lease expense 120,747 125,743 131,695 140,785 140,575 138,538 158,437 121,076 Personnel costs 110,231 100,662 99,115 108,029 111,306 115,335 116,048 111,521 Equipment 17,337 17,378 16,659 16,949 20,593 20,151 19,844 19,972 Outside data processing and other services 17,209 15,128 16,592 18,439 17,992 17,375 17,671 16,654 Net occupancy 13,370 14,676 14,504 16,989 19,766 19,082 18,004 19,597 Professional services 9,111 9,680 7,864 6,430 12,321 6,863 7,714 5,964 Marketing 6,186 7,491 7,231 7,003 6,345 6,921 7,852 9,939 Telecommunications 5,714 5,609 5,320 6,018 6,793 6,859 7,207 7,125 Printing and supplies 3,999 3,679 3,683 3,837 4,293 4,450 4,565 5,059 Franchise and other taxes 2,532 2,283 2,313 2,328 2,893 2,470 2,246 2,120 Amortization of intangible assets 204 204 235 1,376 10,100 10,114 10,435 10,576 Restructuring (releases) charges (7,211) 56,184 15,143 50,817 13,997 Other 29,880 16,963 18,535 17,229 16,083 25,648 6,887 33,091 TOTAL NON INTEREST EXPENSE 329,309 319,496 323,746 401,596 384,203 424,623 390,907 362,694 INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 90,489 116,067 95,353 220,796 14,386 32,867 (11,416) 59,640 Income taxes 21,226 28,052 24,375 125,321 (40,657)(1) 886 (12,548) 13,000 NET INCOME $ 69,263 $ 88,015 $ 70,978 $ 95,475 $ 55,043 $ 31,981 $ 1,132 $ 46,640 NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE DILUTED $ 0.29 $ 0.36 $ 0.29 $ 0.38 $ 0.22 $ 0.13 $ 0.00 $ 0.19 CASH DIVIDENDS DECLARED PER COMMON SHARE $ 0.16 $ 0.16 $ 0.16 $ 0.16 $ 0.16 $ 0.16 $ 0.20 $ 0.20 REVENUE FULLY TAXABLE EQUIVALENT (FTE) Net Interest Income $ 199,179 $ 191,265 $ 180,261 $ 178,869 $ 188,035 $ 179,078 $ 177,254 $ 170,921 Tax Equivalent Adjustment (2) 1,869 1,096 1,071 1,169 1,292 1,442 1,616 2,002 NET INTEREST INCOME FTE $ 201,048 $ 192,361 $ 181,332 $ 180,038 $ 189,327 $ 180,520 $ 178,870 $ 172,923 (1) Reflects a $32.5 million reduction related to the issuance of $400 million of REIT subsidiary preferred stock, of which $50 million was sold to the public.

These items are explained in the section entitled Restructuring and Other Items that follows. For analytical purposes in understanding performance trends and for decision making, management reviews and analyzes certain data, including Line of Business performance, on an "operating basis", which excludes the impact of these items and the operating results of the Florida operations sold as summarized and presented in Tables 25 through 28. The specific tables included in this section that reconcile reported, or GAAP, financial results to operating results include: o Table 25 Reconciliation of Reported Earnings to Operating Earnings (2002, 2001 and 2000), o Table 26 Annual Income Statements, Selected Balance Sheet and Financial Data (2002, 2001 and 2000), o Table 27 Consolidated Average Balance Sheets and Net Interest Margin Analysis (2002, 2001 and 2000), and o Table 28 Selected Quarterly Income Statements Reconciliation of Reported to Operating Basis (2002 and 2001). OPERATING BASIS SUMMARY REVIEW OF PERFORMANCE Earnings on an operating basis for 2002 were $279.7 million, or $1.15 per common share, compared with $246.6 million, or $0.98 per common share in 2001, and $320.0 million, or $1.28 per common share in 2000. On this same basis, ROE and ROA for 2002 were 12.6% and 1.10%, respectively, compared with 10.6% and 0.99%, respectively, for 2001, and 14.2% and 1.25%, respectively, in 2000. RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER ITEMS In July 2001, Huntington announced a strategic refocusing plan (the Plan). Key components of the Plan included the sale of banking and insurance operations in Florida, the consolidation of numerous non Florida branch offices, as well as credit related and other actions to strengthen its financial performance including the use of some of the excess capital to repurchase outstanding common shares. 2002 The sale of the Florida banking operations to SunTrust Banks, Inc., which closed February 15, 2002, included 143 banking offices and 456 ATMs, with approximately $2.8 billion in loans and other tangible assets, and $4.8 billion in deposits and other liabilities. Huntingtons Florida insurance operation, the Orlando based J. Rolfe Davis Insurance Agency, Inc. (JRD), was sold on July 2, 2002 to members of its management team. The JRD sale did not materially affect Huntingtons 2002 financial results and is not expected to materially affect Huntingtons future financial results. Huntington remains committed to growing its other insurance business in markets served by its retail and commercial banking operations. A pre tax gain of $182.5 million ($61.4 million after tax, or $0.25 per share) on the sale of the Florida banking operations was recorded in 2002 and was included in non interest income in Tables 25 and 26. Huntington recorded $49.0 million of pre tax restructuring charges ($31.8 million after tax, or $0.13 per share) in 2002, which included the release of $7.2 million of reserves in the fourth quarter 2002, as reflected in non interest expense. Combined with amounts recorded in 2001, pre tax restructuring charges related to the Plan totaled $199.4 million ($129.6 million after tax, or $0.52 per share). In August 2002, Huntington restructured its interest in Huntington Merchant Services, L.L.C. (HMS), Huntingtons merchant services business, in a transaction with First Data Merchant Services Corporation (First Data), a subsidiary of First Data Corporation. Under the agreement, Huntington extended its long term merchant services relationship with First Data. In addition, as part of the transaction, First Data obtained all of Huntingtons Florida related merchant services business and increased its equity interest in HMS. This transaction resulted in a $24.5 million pre tax gain ($16.0 million after tax, or $0.07 per share) in non interest income. Huntington remains a nominal equity owner in HMS. 2001 In 2001, the provision for loan and lease losses included credit quality charges related to the Plan of $65.2 million in addition to $50.0 million to increase Huntingtons allowance for loan and lease losses in light of the higher charge offs and non performing assets experienced in the second half of 2001. Included in the 2001 securities gains in Tables 25 and 26 was a $5.3 million loss realized from the sale of $15 million of Pacific Gas & Electric commercial paper acquired from the Huntington Money Market Fund. Restructuring charges related to the Plan totaled $80.0 million ($52.0 million after tax, or $0.21 per share) and consisted of $12.1 million for asset impairment, $16.2 million for the exit or curtailment of certain e commerce activities, $13.3 million related to owned or leased facilities that Huntington had vacated, and $38.4 million related to employee severance or retention, legal, accounting, consulting, reduction of ATMs, and other operational costs. 52 In addition, in the fourth quarter there was a reduction in income taxes resulting form the issuance of REIT subsidiary preferred securities, of which $50 million was sold to the public. Tables 25, 26, and 27 reconcile Huntingtons reported results with its operating earnings for each of the most recent three years. Table 28 reconciles reported quarterly results with its operating earnings for the two most recent years. The presentation of the Florida operations in Table 25 differs from the disclosure presented in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements because Note 6 reflects only the after tax restructuring charges for 2002 related to the Florida operations, which totaled $21.3 million ($32.7 million pre tax). Because the disclosure in Note 6 was intended only to show the pro forma impact without the Florida operations, non Florida related after tax restructuring charges of $15.2 million ($23.5 million pre tax) as well as the Merchant Services restructuring gain are included in the 2002 pro forma results (unaudited) presented in Note 6 but are excluded from operating earnings as presented in Table 26.
