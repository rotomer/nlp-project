EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 2010 Financial Performance Review In 2010, we reported net income of $312.3 million, or $0.19 per common share (see Table 1). The current year included a nonrecurring reduction of $0.08 per common share for the deemed dividend resulting from the repurchase of $1.4 billion in TARP Capital. This compared with a net loss of $3,094.2 million, or $6.14 per common share, for 2009. The 2009 loss primarily reflected two items: $2,606.9 million in noncash goodwill impairment charges and $2,074.7 million in provision for credit losses. Most of the $2,606.9 million in goodwill impairment charges related to the acquisitions of Sky Financial and Unizan. While this impairment charge reduced reported net income, equity, and total assets, it had no impact on key regulatory capital ratios. As a noncash charge, it had no affect on our liquidity. The provision for credit losses reflected higher net charge offs as we addressed issues in our loan portfolio. We also strengthened our allowance for credit losses because of higher levels of nonperforming assets. Fully taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.6 billion in 2010, up $0.2 billion, or 14%, from 2009. The increase primarily reflected the favorable impact of the increase in net interest margin to 3.44% from 3.11% and, to a lesser degree, a 3% increase in average total earning assets. A significant portion of the increase in the net interest margin reflected a shift in our deposit mix from higher cost time deposits to lower cost transaction based accounts. Additionally, we grew our average core deposits $3.1 billion, or 9%, from 2009. Although average total earning assets increased only slightly compared with 2009, this change reflected a $2.9 billion, or 45%, increase in average total investment securities, partially offset by a $1.4 billion, or 4%, decline in average total loans and leases. The change in average loan balances from the prior year reflected our strategy to reduce our CRE exposure as average CRE loans declined $1.9 billion, or 21%, from 2009. Average CI loans declined $0.7 billion, or 5%, for the full year. Average automobile loans and leases increased $1.3 billion, or 38%, from 2009, reflecting the consolidation of a $0.8 billion automobile loan securitization on January 1, 2010. These changes in loan and investment securities balances from the prior year reflected the execution of our balance sheet management strategy, and not a change in standards for making loans or for investing in securities. Noninterest income was $1.0 billion in 2010, a slight increase compared with 2009. The increase in noninterest income was primarily a result of an increase in mortgage banking income, reflecting an increase in origination and secondary marketing income as loan originations and loan sales were substantially higher, and MSR hedging. This was partially offset by a decline in service charges on deposit accounts, which was due to a decline in personal NSF / OD service charges. The decline reflected our implementation of changes to Regulation E and the introduction of our Fair Play banking philosophy. As part of this philosophy, we voluntarily reduced certain NSF / OD fees and implemented our 24 Hour Gracetm overdraft policy. The goal of our Fair Play banking philosophy is to introduce more customer friendly fee structures with the objective of accelerating the acquisition and retention of customers. Noninterest expense was $1.7 billion in 2010, a decrease of $2.4 billion, or 59%, compared with 2009. The decrease in noninterest expense was primarily due to goodwill impairment in the year ago period. The decline also reflected a decrease in OREO and foreclosure expense from lower OREO losses. Further, there was a decline in deposit and other insurance expense, primarily due to a $23.6 million FDIC insurance special assessment in 2009, partially offset by continued growth in total deposits and higher FDIC insurance costs in the current period as premium rates increased. The decline was partially offset by a 2009 benefit from a gain on the early extinguishment of debt, and 2010 increases in personnel costs, reflecting a combination of factors 25 Table of Contents including higher salaries due to a 10% increase in full time equivalent staff in support of strategic initiatives, higher sales commissions, and retirement fund and 401(k) plan expenses. Credit quality performance continued to show strong improvement as our NPAs and NCOs declined and reserve coverage increased. This improvement reflected the benefits of our focused actions taken in 2009 to address credit related issues. Compared with the prior year, NPAs declined 59%. NCOs were $874.5 million, or an annualized 2.35% of average total loans and leases, down from $1,476.6 million, or 3.82%, in 2009. While the ACL as a percentage of loans and leases was 3.39%, down from 4.16% at December 31, 2009, the ACL as a percentage of total NALs increased to 166% from 80%. In December 2010, we successfully completed multiple capital actions, particularly improving our then relatively low level of common equity. We sold $920.0 million of common stock in a public offering and issued $300.0 million of subordinated debt. On December 22, 2010, these proceeds, along with other available funds, were used to complete the repurchase of our $1.4 billion of TARP Capital we issued to the Treasury under its TARP CPP. Subsequently, on January 19, 2011, we exited our TARP related relationship with the Treasury by repurchasing the warrant we had issued to the Treasury as part of the TARP CPP for $49.1 million. The warrant had entitled the Treasury to purchase 23.6 million common shares of stock. At December 31, 2010, our regulatory Tier 1 and Total risk based capital were $2.4 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, above the Well capitalized regulatory thresholds. Our tangible common equity ratio improved 164 basis points to 7.56% and our Tier 1 common risk based capital ratio improved 253 basis points to 9.29% from December 31, 2009. Business Overview General Our general business objectives are: (1) grow revenue and profitability, (2) grow key fee businesses (existing and new), (3) improve credit quality, including lower NCOs and NPAs, (4) improve cross sell and share of wallet across all business segments, (5) reduce CRE noncore exposure, and (6) continue to improve our overall management of risk. As further described below, our main challenge to accomplishing our primary objectives results from an economy, that while more stable than a year ago, remains fragile. This impairs our ability to grow loans as customers continue to reduce their debt and / or remain cautious about increasing debt until they have a higher degree of confidence in a meaningful sustainable economic recovery. However, growth in our automobile loan portfolio continued with 2010 originations of $3.4 billion, an increase of $1.8 billion compared to 2009. Strong growth in originations reflected increases in all of our markets, as well as the recent expansion of our automobile lending business into Eastern Pennsylvania and five New England states. We expect our growth in the newly entered markets to become more evident over time as we further develop our dealership base. Although our residential real estate portfolio declined slightly from 2009, our mortgage originations increased $214 million, or 4%, from the prior year. Our CRE portfolio declined throughout the year as a result of our on going strategy to reduce our CRE exposure. The decline was primarily a result of continuing paydowns in the noncore CRE portfolio. We face strong competition from other banks and financial service firms in our markets. As such, we have placed strategic emphasis on, and continue to develop and expand resources devoted to, improving cross sell performance with our core customer base. One example of this emphasis was our recent agreement with Giant Eagle supermarkets to be its exclusive in store bank in Ohio. During the 2010 fourth quarter, we opened four such in store branches. When fully implemented, the partnership will give us an additional 100 branches, which in the aggregate will be nearly 500 branches in Ohio, providing us with the largest branch presence among Ohio banks, based on current data. In store branches have a strong record for checking account acquisition and are expected to increase the number of households served and drive revenue. Additionally, it will give customers the convenience of operating seven days per week and extended hours banking. 26 Table of Contents Economy The weak residential real estate market and U.S. economy has had a significant adverse impact on the financial services industry as a whole, and specifically on our financial results. In addition, the U.S. recession during 2008 and 2009 and continued high Midwest unemployment have hindered any significant economic recovery. However, some indications of recovery are beginning to take hold. Following is a discussion of certain economic trends in our market area, particularly Ohio and Michigan. The median home prices in the Midwest market have been directionally consistent with the nationwide averages. In the years preceding the economic crisis, home prices in Michigan and Ohio did not increase as rapidly as the national trend and became more in line with the national averages during the crisis. Therefore, when real estate prices began to decline in 2008, the impact in our Midwest markets was reduced because pre crisis originations were not based on values that were as inflated as in other parts of the country. Home prices in the Midwest are generally expected to follow the national growth rates over the next two years. Residential real estate sales in the Midwest have been consistent with national averages. Single family home building permits are expected to increase both nationally and in the Midwest through 2013. Year over year changes in median household income in the Midwest have been consistent with national averages and directionally similar with national trends. Both the U.S. and Midwest are expected to have slight, but positive, income growth over the next two years. Unemployment in the Midwest has been consistently higher than the national average for most of the past decade. However, the relative difference is expected to narrow over the next two years, with the Midwest unemployment rate converging to the U.S. average. The exception is Michigan, which has the second highest unemployment level in the country. From October 2009 through October 2010, Indianas employment growth of 1.1% was among the strongest in the country. Over this same time period, Ohios manufacturing employment grew 1.4%, which was significantly higher than the 0.8% national average. Clevelands overall employment growth of 1.0% exceeded the national growth rate of 0.6%. According to the FRB Cleveland Beige Book in December 2010, manufacturers in our footprint indicated that new orders and production were stable or rose slightly during the last two months of 2010. Inventory levels were balanced with incoming order demand and capacity utilization trending up for some manufacturers and steel producers. Overall, manufacturers were cautiously optimistic and expect at least modest growth during 2011. Partially resulting from these economic conditions in our footprint, we experienced higher than historical levels of loan delinquencies and NCOs during 2009 and 2010. The pronounced downturn in the residential real estate market that began in early 2007 resulted in lower residential real estate values and higher delinquencies and NCOs, not only in consumer mortgage loans but also in commercial loans to builders and developers of residential real estate. The value of our investment securities backed by residential and commercial real estate was also negatively impacted by a lack of liquidity in the financial markets and anticipated credit losses. Commercial real estate loans for retail businesses were also challenged by the difficult consumer economic conditions over this period. However, as further discussed in the Credit Risk section, we experienced significant improvement in credit performance during 2010. Legislative and Regulatory Legislative and regulatory reforms continue to be adopted which impose additional restrictions on current business practices. Recent actions affecting us included an amendment to Regulation E relating to certain overdraft fees for consumer deposit accounts and the passage of the Dodd Frank Act. Effective July 1, 2010, the Federal Reserve Board amended Regulation E to prohibit charging overdraft fees for ATM or point of sale debit card transactions that overdraw the customers account unless the customer opts in to the discretionary overdraft service. For us, such fees were approximately $90 million per year prior to the amendment. This change in Regulation E requires us to alert our consumer customers we can no longer allow an overdraft unless they opt in to our discretionary overdraft service. To date, the number of customers choosing to opt in has been higher than our expectations. Also, during the second half of 2010, we voluntarily 27 Table of Contents reduced certain overdraft fees and introduced 24 Hour Gracetm on overdrafts as part of our Fair Play banking philosophy designed to build on our foundation of service excellence. We expect our 24 Hour Gracetm service to accelerate acquisition of new checking customers, while improving retention of existing customers. The recently passed Dodd Frank Act is complex and we continue to assess how this legislation and subsequent rule making will affect us. As hundreds of regulations are promulgated, we will continue to evaluate impacts such as changes in regulatory costs and fees, modifications to consumer products or disclosures required by the CFPB, and the requirements of the enhanced supervision provisions, among others. Two areas where we are focusing on the financial impact are: interchange fees and the exclusion of trust preferred securities from our Tier I regulatory capital. Currently, interchange fees are approximately $90 million per year. In the future, the Dodd Frank Act gives the Federal Reserve, and no longer the banks or system owners, the ability to set the interchange rate charged to merchants for the use of debit cards. The ultimate impact to us will depend on rules yet to be issued by the Federal Reserve. Proposed rules were issued on December 28, 2010, and the Dodd Frank Act requires final interchange rules to be issued by April 21, 2011, and effective no later than July 21, 2011. Based on the Federal Reserves proposed rules, a maximum interchange rate of $0.07 would reduce our annual interchange fees by approximately 85%. A maximum interchange rate of $0.12 would reduce our annual interchange fees by approximately 75%. At December 31, 2010, we had $569.9 million of outstanding trust preferred securities that, if disallowed, would reduce our regulatory Tier 1 risk based capital ratio by approximately 130 basis points. Even with this reduction, our capital ratios would remain above Well capitalized levels. There is a three year phase in period beginning on January 1, 2013, that we believe will provide sufficient time to evaluate and address the impacts of this new legislation on our capital structure. Accordingly, we do not anticipate this potential change will have a significant impact to our business. During the 2010 third quarter, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision revised the Capital Accord (Basel III), which narrows the definition of capital and increases capital requirements for specific exposures. The new capital requirements will be phased in over six years beginning in 2013. If these revisions were adopted currently, we estimate they would have a negligible impact on our regulatory capital ratios based on our current understanding of the revisions to capital qualification. We await clarification from our banking regulators on their interpretation of Basel III and any additional requirements to the stated thresholds. The FDIC has approved issuance of an interagency proposed rulemaking to implement certain provisions of Section 171 of the Dodd Frank Act (Section 171). Section 171 provides that the capital requirements generally applicable to insured banks shall serve as a floor for other capital requirements the agencies establish. The FDIC noted that the advanced approaches of Basel III allow for reductions in risk based capital requirements below those generally applicable to insured banks and, accordingly, need to be modified to be consistent with Section 171. Recent Industry Developments Foreclosure Documentation We evaluated our foreclosure documentation procedures given the recent announcements made by other financial institutions regarding problems associated with their foreclosure activities. As a result of our review, we have determined that we do not have any significant issues relating to so called robo signing, foreclosure affidavits were completed and signed by employees with personal knowledge of the contents of the affidavits, and there is no reason to conclude that foreclosures were filed that should not have been filed. Additionally, we have identified and are implementing process and control enhancements to ensure that affidavits continue to be prepared in compliance with applicable state law. We are consulting with local foreclosure counsel as necessary with respect to additional requirements imposed by the courts in which foreclosure proceedings are pending, which could impact our foreclosure actions. Representation and Warranty Reserve We primarily conduct our loan sale and securitization activity with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In connection with these and other sale and securitization transactions, we make certain representations and warranties that the loans meet certain criteria, such as collateral type and underwriting standards. In the future, we may be required to repurchase individual loans and / or indemnify 28 Table of Contents these organizations against losses due to material breaches of these representations and warranties. At December 31, 2010, we have a reserve for such losses of $20.2 million, which is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities. 2011 Expectations Borrower and consumer confidence remains a major factor impacting growth opportunities for 2011. We continue to believe that the economy will remain relatively stable throughout 2011, with the potential for improvement in the latter half. Challenges to earnings growth include (1) revenue headwinds as a result of regulatory and legislative actions, (2) anticipated higher interest rates as we enter 2011, which is expected to reduce mortgage banking income, and (3) continued investments in growing our businesses. Reflecting these factors, pre tax, pre provision income levels are expected to remain in line with 2010 second half performance. Nevertheless, net income growth from the 2010 fourth quarter level is anticipated throughout the year. This will primarily reflect on going reductions in credit costs. We expect the absolute levels of NCOs, NPAs, and Criticized loans will continue to decline, resulting in lower levels of provision expense. Given the significant credit related improvements in 2010, coupled with our expectation for continued improvement, our return to more normalized levels of credit costs could occur earlier than previously expected. The net interest margin is expected to be flat or increase slightly from the 2010 fourth quarter. We anticipate continued benefit from lower deposit pricing. In addition, the absolute growth in loans compared with deposits is anticipated to be more comparable, thus reducing the absolute growth in lower yield investment securities. The automobile loan portfolio is expected to continue its strong growth, and we anticipate continued growth in CI loans. Home equity and residential mortgages are likely to show only modest growth. CRE loans are expected to continue to decline, but at a slower rate. Core deposits are expected to show continued growth. Further, we expect the shift toward lower cost demand deposit accounts will continue. Fee income, compared with the 2010 fourth quarter, will be negatively impacted by lower interchange fees due to regulatory fee change and a decline in mortgage banking revenues due to a higher interest rate environment as we enter 2011. With regard to interchange fees, if enacted as recently outlined, the Federal Reserves proposed interchange fee structure will significantly lower interchange revenue. Other fee categories are expected to grow, reflecting the impact of our cross sell initiatives throughout the Company, as well as the positive impact from strategic initiatives. Over time, we anticipate more than offsetting revenue challenges with revenue we expect to generate by accelerating customer growth and cross sell results. Expense levels early in the year should be up modestly from 2010 fourth quarter performance, with increases later in the year due to continued investments to grow the business. 29 Table of Contents Table 2 Selected Annual Income Statements (1) Year Ended December 31, Change from 2009 Change from 2008 2010 Amount Percent 2009 Amount Percent 2008 (Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share amounts) Interest income $ 2,145,392 $ (92,750 ) (4 )% $ 2,238,142 $ (560,180 ) (20 )% $ 2,798,322 Interest expense 526,587 (287,268 ) (35 ) 813,855 (452,776 ) (36 ) 1,266,631 Net interest income 1,618,805 194,518 14 1,424,287 (107,404 ) (7 ) 1,531,691 Provision for credit losses 634,547 (1,440,124 ) (69 ) 2,074,671 1,017,208 96 1,057,463 Net interest income after provision for credit losses 984,258 1,634,642 N.R.

DISCUSSION OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This section provides a review of financial performance from a consolidated perspective. It also includes a Significant Items section that summarizes key issues important for a complete understanding of performance trends. Key consolidated balance sheet and income statement trends are discussed. All earnings per share data is reported on a diluted basis. For additional insight on financial performance, please read this section in conjunction with the Item 7: Business Segment Discussion. Significant Items Definition of Significant Items From time to time, revenue, expenses, or taxes, are impacted by items judged by us to be outside of ordinary banking activities and / or by items that, while they may be associated with ordinary banking activities, are so unusually large that their outsized impact is believed by us at that time to be infrequent or short term in nature. We refer to such items as Significant Items. Most often, these Significant Items result from factors originating outside the Company; e.g., regulatory actions / assessments, windfall gains, changes in accounting principles, one time tax assessments / refunds, etc. In other cases they may result from our decisions associated with significant corporate actions out of the ordinary course of business; e.g., merger / restructuring charges, recapitalization actions, goodwill impairment, etc. Even though certain revenue and expense items are naturally subject to more volatility than others due to changes in market and economic environment conditions, as a general rule volatility alone does not define a Significant Item. For example, changes in the provision for credit losses, gains / losses from investment activities, asset valuation writedowns, etc., reflect ordinary banking activities and are, therefore, typically excluded from consideration as a Significant Item. We believe the disclosure of Significant Items in results provides a better understanding of our performance and trends to ascertain which of such items, if any, to include or exclude from an analysis of our performance; i.e., within the context of determining how that performance differed from expectations, as well as how, if at all, to adjust estimates of future performance accordingly. To this end, we adopted a practice of listing Significant Items in our external disclosure documents (e.g., earnings press releases, investor presentations, Forms 10 Q and 10 K). Significant Items for any particular period are not intended to be a complete list of items that may materially impact current or future period performance. Significant Items Influencing Financial Performance Comparisons Earnings comparisons among the three years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 were impacted by a number of significant items summarized below. 1. TARP Capital Purchase Program Repurchase. During the 2010 fourth quarter, we issued $920.0 million of our common stock and $300.0 million of subordinated debt. The net proceeds, along with other available funds, were used to repurchase all $1.4 billion of TARP Capital that we issued to the Treasury under its TARP Capital Purchase Program in 2008. As part of this transaction, there was a deemed dividend that did not impact net income, but resulted in a negative impact of $0.08 per common share for 2010. 31 Table of Contents 2. Goodwill Impairment. The impacts of goodwill impairment on our reported results were as follows: During the 2009 first quarter, bank stock prices, including ours, experienced a steep decline. Our stock price declined 78% from $7.66 per share at December 31, 2008, to $1.66 per share at March 31, 2009. Given this significant decline, we conducted an interim test for goodwill impairment. As a result, we recorded a noncash $2,602.7 million ($4.88 per common share) pretax charge. (See Goodwill discussion located within the Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Significant Estimates section for additional information.) During the 2009 second quarter, a pretax goodwill impairment of $4.2 million ($0.01 per common share) was recorded relating to the sale of a small payments related business in July 2009. 3. Franklin Relationship. Our relationship with Franklin was acquired in the Sky Financial acquisition in 2007. Significant events relating to this relationship, and the impacts of those events on our reported results, were as follows: On March 31, 2009, we restructured our relationship with Franklin. As a result of this restructuring, a nonrecurring net tax benefit of $159.9 million ($0.30 per common share) was recorded in the 2009 first quarter. Also, and although earnings were not significantly impacted, commercial NCOs increased $128.3 million as the previously established $130.0 million Franklin specific ALLL was utilized to writedown the acquired mortgages and OREO collateral to fair value. During the 2010 first quarter, a $38.2 million ($0.05 per common share) net tax benefit was recognized, primarily reflecting the increase in the net deferred tax asset relating to the assets acquired from the March 31, 2009 restructuring. During the 2010 second quarter, the portfolio of Franklin related loans ($333.0 million of residential mortgages and $64.7 million of home equity loans) was transferred to loans held for sale. At the time of the transfer, the loans were marked to the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell of $323.4 million, resulting in $75.5 million of charge offs, and the provision for credit losses commensurately increased $75.5 million ($0.07 per common share). During the 2010 third quarter, the remaining Franklin related residential mortgage and home equity loans were sold at essentially book value. 4. Early Extinguishment of Debt. The positive impacts relating to the early extinguishment of debt on our reported results were: $141.0 million ($0.18 per common share) in 2009 and $23.5 million ($0.04 per common share) in 2008. These amounts were recorded to noninterest expense. 5. Preferred Stock Conversion. During the 2009 first and second quarters, we converted 114,109 and 92,384 shares, respectively, of Series A 8.50% Non cumulative Perpetual Preferred (Series A Preferred Stock) stock into common stock. As part of these transactions, there was a deemed dividend that did not impact net income, but resulted in a negative impact of $0.11 per common share for 2009. (See Capital discussion located within the Risk Management and Capital section for additional information.) 6. Visa. Prior to the Visa IPO occurring in March 2008, Visa was owned by its member banks, which included the Bank. As a result of this ownership, we received Class B shares of Visa stock at the time of the Visa IPO. In the 2009 second quarter, we sold these Visa stock shares, resulting in a $31.4 million pretax gain ($.04 per common share). This amount was recorded in noninterest income. Table 3 Visa impacts 2010 2009 2008 Earnings EPS Earnings EPS Earnings EPS (Dollar amounts in millions, except per share amounts) Gain related to sale of Visa stock(1) $ $ $ 31.4 $ 0.04 $ 25.1 $ 0.04 Visa indemnification liability(2) 17.0 0.03 32 Table of Contents (1) Pretax. Recorded to noninterest income, and represented a gain on the sale of ownership interest in Visa. As part of the sale of our Visa stock in 2009, we released $8.2 million, as of June 30, 2009, of the remaining indemnification liability. Concurrently, we established a swap liability associated with the conversion protection provided to the purchasers of the Visa shares. (2) Pretax. Recorded to noninterest expense, and represented our pro rata portion of an indemnification liability provided to Visa by its member banks for various litigation filed against Visa. Subsequently, in 2008, an escrow account was established by Visa using a portion of the proceeds received from the IPO. This action resulted in a reversal of a portion of the liability as the escrow account reduced our potential exposure related to the indemnification. 7. Other Significant Items Influencing Earnings Performance Comparisons. In addition to the items discussed separately in this section, a number of other items impacted financial results. These included: 2009 $23.6 million ($0.03 per common share) negative impact due to a special FDIC insurance premium assessment. This amount was recorded to noninterest expense. $12.8 million ($0.02 per common share) benefit to provision for income taxes, representing a reduction to the previously established capital loss carry forward valuation allowance. 2008 $20.4 million ($0.06 per common share) benefit to provision for income taxes, representing a reduction to the previously established capital loss carry forward valuation allowance. $21.8 million ($.04 per common share) negative impact due to the merger with Sky Financial completed on July 1, 2007. The following table reflects the earnings impact of the above mentioned significant items for periods affected by this Results of Operations discussion: Table 4 Significant Items Influencing Earnings Performance Comparison (1) 2010 2009 2008 After tax EPS After tax EPS After tax EPS (Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share amounts) Net income (loss) GAAP $ 312,347 $ (3,094,179 ) $ (113,806 ) Earnings per share, after tax $ 0.19 $ (6.14 ) $ (0.44 ) Change from prior year $ 6.33 (5.70 ) (0.69 ) Change from prior year % N.R. % N.R % N.R. % N.R.

Pretax, Pre provision Income Trends One non GAAP performance measurement that we believe is useful in analyzing underlying performance trends, particularly in times of economic stress, is pretax, pre provision income. This is the level of earnings adjusted to exclude the impact of: (1) provision expense, which is excluded because its absolute level is elevated and volatile in times of economic stress, (2) investment securities gains/losses, which are excluded because securities market valuations may also become particularly volatile in times of economic stress, (3) amortization of intangibles expense, which is excluded because the return on tangible equity common equity is a key measurement that we use to gauge performance trends, and (4) certain other items identified by us (see Significant Items above) that we believe may distort our underlying performance trends. 34 Table of Contents The following table reflects pretax, pre provision income for the three years ended December 31, 2010: Table 5 Pretax, Pre provision Income (1) Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (Dollar amounts in thousands) Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes $ 352,311 $ (3,678,183 ) $ (296,008 ) Add: Provision for credit losses 634,547 2,074,671 1,057,463 Less: Securities gains (losses) (274 ) (10,249 ) (197,370 ) Add: Amortization of intangibles 60,478 68,307 76,894 Less: Significant Items Gain on early extinguishment of debt 141,024 23,542 Goodwill impairment (2,606,944 ) Gain related to Visa stock 31,362 25,087 Visa indemnification liability 16,995 FDIC special assessment (23,555 ) Merger/restructuring costs (21,830 ) Total pretax, pre provision income $ 1,047,610 $ 933,157 $ 991,925 Change in total pretax, pre provision income: Amount $ 114,453 $ (58,768 ) Percent 12 % (6 )% (1) Pretax, pre provision income is a non GAAP financial measure. Any ratio utilizing this financial measure is also non GAAP. This financial measure has been included as it is considered to be an important metric with which to analyze and evaluate our results of operations and financial strength. Other companies may calculate this financial measure differently. As discussed in more detail in the sections that follow, the increase from 2009 primarily reflected improved revenue, including higher net interest income, partially offset by higher noninterest expense, including personnel costs and marketing. Net Interest Income / Average Balance Sheet Our primary source of revenue is net interest income, which is the difference between interest income from earning assets (primarily loans, securities, and direct financing leases), and interest expense of funding sources (primarily interest bearing deposits and borrowings). Earning asset balances and related funding sources, as well as changes in the levels of interest rates, impact net interest income. The difference between the average yield on earning assets and the average rate paid for interest bearing liabilities is the net interest spread. Noninterest bearing sources of funds, such as demand deposits and shareholders equity, also support earning assets. The impact of the noninterest bearing sources of funds, often referred to as free funds, is captured in the net interest margin, which is calculated as net interest income divided by average earning assets. Both the net interest margin and net interest spread are presented on a fully taxable equivalent basis, which means that tax free interest income has been adjusted to a pretax equivalent income, assuming a 35% tax rate. 35 Table of Contents The following table shows changes in fully taxable equivalent interest income, interest expense, and net interest income due to volume and rate variances for major categories of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. Table 6 Change in Net Interest Income Due to Changes in Average Volume and Interest Rates (1) 2010 2009 Increase (Decrease) from Increase (Decrease) from Previous Year Due to Previous Year Due to Yield/ Yield/ Fully taxable equivalent basis(2) Volume Rate Total Volume Rate Total (Dollar amounts in millions) Loans and direct financing leases $ (71.3 ) $ (9.6 ) $ (80.9 ) $ (130.2 ) $ (371.3 ) $ (501.5 ) Investment securities 96.8 (103.2 ) (6.4 ) 84.4 (86.3 ) (1.9 ) Other earning assets (3.8 ) (2.2 ) (6.0 ) (42.1 ) (23.4 ) (65.5 ) Total interest income from earning assets 21.7 (115.0 ) (93.3 ) (87.9 ) (481.0 ) (568.9 ) Deposits 10.9 (246.0 ) (235.1 ) 16.5 (274.1 ) (257.6 ) Short term borrowings 1.1 (0.5 ) 0.6 (16.6 ) (23.3 ) (39.9 ) Federal Home Loan Bank advances (15.4 ) 5.6 (9.8 ) (45.3 ) (49.6 ) (94.9 ) Subordinated notes and other long term debt, including capital securities (14.3 ) (28.8 ) (43.1 ) 9.8 (70.1 ) (60.3 ) Total interest expense of interest bearing liabilities (17.7 ) (269.7 ) (287.4 ) (35.6 ) (417.1 ) (452.7 ) Net interest income $ 39.4 $ 154.7 $ 194.1 $ (52.3 ) $ (63.9 ) $ (116.2 ) (1) The change in interest rates due to both rate and volume has been allocated between the factors in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each. (2) Calculated assuming a 35% tax rate. 2010 versus 2009 Fully taxable equivalent net interest income for 2010 increased $194.1 million, or 14%, from 2009. This reflected the favorable impact of a $1.3 billion, or 3%, increase in average earning assets, due to a $2.9 billion, or 45%, increase in average total investment securities, which was partially offset by a $1.4 billion, or 4%, decrease in average total loans and leases. Also contributing to the increase in net interest income was a 33 basis point increase in the fully taxable net interest margin to 3.44% from 3.11% in 2009. 36 Table of Contents The following table details the change in our reported loans and deposits: Table 7 Average Loans/Leases and Deposits 2010 vs. 2009 Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change 2010 2009 Amount Percent (Dollar amounts in millions) Loans/Leases Commercial and industrial $ 12,431 $ 13,136 $ (705 ) (5 )% Commercial real estate 7,225 9,156 (1,931 ) (21 ) Total commercial 19,656 22,292 (2,636 ) (12 ) Automobile loans and leases 4,890 3,546 1,344 38 Home equity 7,590 7,590 Residential mortgage 4,476 4,542 (66 ) (1 ) Other consumer 661 722 (61 ) (8 ) Total consumer 17,617 16,400 1,217 7 Total loans and leases $ 37,273 $ 38,692 $ (1,419 ) (4 )% Deposits Demand deposits noninterest bearing $ 6,859 $ 6,057 $ 802 13 % Demand deposits interest bearing 5,579 4,816 763 16 Money market deposits 11,743 7,216 4,527 63 Savings and other domestic deposits 4,642 4,881 (239 ) (5 ) Core certificates of deposit 9,188 11,944 (2,756 ) (23 ) Total core deposits 38,011 34,914 3,097 9 Other deposits 2,727 4,475 (1,748 ) (39 ) Total deposits $ 40,738 $ 39,389 $ 1,349 3 % The $1.4 billion, or 4%, decrease in average total loans and leases primarily reflected: $2.6 billion, or 12%, decline in average total commercial loans. The decline in average CRE loans reflected our planned efforts to shrink this portfolio through payoffs and paydowns, as well as the impact of NCOs. The decline in average CI loans reflected a general decrease in borrowing as evidenced by a decline in line of credit utilization, NCO activity, and the reclassification in the 2010 first quarter of variable rate demand notes to municipal securities. Partially offset by: $1.2 billion, or 7%, increase in average total consumer loans. This growth reflected a $1.3 billion, or 38%, increase in average automobile loans and leases. On January 1, 2010, we adopted the new accounting standard ASC 810 Consolidation, resulting in the consolidation of an off balance sheet securitization and increasing our automobile loan portfolio by $0.5 billion at December 31, 2010. Underlying growth in automobile loans continued to be strong, reflecting a significant increase in loan originations in 2010 as compared to 2009 in all of our markets. Our recent expansion into Eastern Pennsylvania and the five New England states also began to have a positive impact on our volume. Total average investment securities increased $2.9 billion, or 45%, reflecting the deployment of the cash from core deposit growth and loan runoff over this period, as well as the proceeds from 2009 capital actions. 37 Table of Contents The $1.3 billion, or 3%, increase in average total deposits reflected: $3.1 billion, or 9%, growth in total core deposits. The primary driver of this growth was a 63% increase in average money market deposits. Partially offsetting this growth was a 23% decline in average core certificates of deposit. Partially offset by: $1.7 billion, or 39%, decline in average noncore deposits, reflecting a managed decline in public fund deposits as well as planned efforts to reduce our reliance on noncore funding sources. 2009 versus 2008 Fully taxable equivalent net interest income for 2009 decreased $116.2 million, or 7%, from 2008. This reflected the unfavorable impact of a $1.7 billion, or 4%, decrease in average earning assets, which included a $2.3 billion decrease in average loans and leases. Also contributing to the decline in net interest income was a 14 basis point decline in the fully taxable net interest margin to 3.11%, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of our stronger liquidity position and an increase in NALs. The following table details the change in our reported loans and deposits: Table 8 Average Loans/Leases and Deposits 2009 vs. 2008 Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change 2009 2008 Amount Percent (Dollar amounts in millions) Loans/Leases Commercial and industrial $ 13,136 $ 13,588 $ (452 ) (3 )% Commercial real estate 9,156 9,732 (576 ) (6 ) Total commercial 22,292 23,320 (1,028 ) (4 ) Automobile loans and leases 3,546 4,527 (981 ) (22 ) Home equity 7,590 7,404 186 3 Residential mortgage 4,542 5,018 (476 ) (9 ) Other consumer 722 691 31 4 Total consumer 16,400 17,640 (1,240 ) (7 ) Total loans and leases $ 38,692 $ 40,960 $ (2,268 ) (6 )% Deposits Demand deposits noninterest bearing $ 6,057 $ 5,095 $ 962 19 % Demand deposits interest bearing 4,816 4,003 813 20 Money market deposits 7,216 6,093 1,123 18 Savings and other domestic deposits 4,881 5,147 (266 ) (5 ) Core certificates of deposit 11,944 11,637 307 3 Total core deposits 34,914 31,975 2,939 9 Other deposits 4,475 5,861 (1,386 ) (24 ) Total deposits $ 39,389 $ 37,836 $ 1,553 4 % The $2.3 billion, or 6%, decrease in average total loans and leases primarily reflected: $1.0 billion, or 4%, decline in average total commercial loans. The decline in average CRE loans reflected our planned efforts to shrink this portfolio through payoffs and paydowns, as well as the impact of NCOs and the 2009 reclassifications of CRE loans to CI loans (see Commercial Credit section). The decline in average CI loans reflected paydowns, the Franklin restructuring, and a 38 Table of Contents reduction in the line of credit utilization in our automobile dealer floorplan exposure, partially offset by the 2009 reclassifications. $1.0 billion, or 22%, decline in average automobile loans and leases due to the 2009 securitization of $1.0 billion of automobile loans, as well as the continued runoff of the automobile lease portfolio. $0.5 billion, or 9%, decline in residential mortgages reflecting the impact of loan sales, as well as the continued refinance of portfolio loans. The majority of this refinance activity was fixed rate loans, which we typically sell in the secondary market. Partially offset by: $0.2 billion, or 3%, increase in average home equity loans reflecting higher utilization of existing lines resulting from higher quality borrowers taking advantage of the current relatively lower interest rate environment, as well as a slowdown in runoff. Total average investment securities increased $1.7 billion, or 38%, as the cash proceeds from core deposit growth and the capital actions initiated during 2009 were deployed. This increase was partially offset by a $0.9 billion, or 87%, decline in trading account securities due to the reduction in the use of these securities to hedge MSRs. The $1.6 billion, or 4%, increase in average total deposits reflected: $2.9 billion, or 9%, growth in total core deposits, primarily reflecting increased sales efforts and initiatives for deposit accounts. Partially offset by: $1.4 billion, or 24%, decline in average noncore deposits, reflecting a managed decline in public fund deposits as well as planned efforts to reduce our reliance on noncore funding sources. 39 Table of Contents Table 9 Consolidated Average Balance Sheet and Net Interest Margin Analysis Average Balances Change from 2009 Change from 2008 Fully taxable equivalent basis(1)

The provision for credit losses is the expense necessary to maintain the ALLL and the AULC at levels adequate to absorb our estimate of probable inherent credit losses in the loan and lease portfolio and the portfolio of unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. The provision for credit losses in 2010 was $634.5 million, down $1,440.1 million from 2009. The decrease from 2009 primarily reflected the improved credit quality in our loan portfolios including lower NCOs, NALs, and NPAs. The provision for credit losses in 2009 was $2,074.7 million, up $1,017.2 million from 2008, and exceeded NCOs by $598.1 million. The increase in 2009 from 2008 primarily reflected the continued economic weakness across all our regions and all our loan portfolios, although our commercial loan portfolios were the most affected. The following table details the Franklin related impact to the provision for credit losses for each of the past four years.

(2) At period end. 44 Table of Contents 2010 versus 2009 Noninterest income increased $36.2 million, or 4%, from the prior year, primarily reflecting: $63.5 million, or 57%, increase in mortgage banking income. Net MSR hedging related activities contributed a $45.4 million net increase. We use an independent outside third party to monitor our MSR asset valuation and assumptions. During 2010, interest rates were volatile and generally lower than 2009 rates resulting in higher prepayment speeds and lower MSR valuation, which was economically hedged and offset by hedging gains. However, the negative MSR valuation adjustment was partially offset by model assumption updates. Based on updated market data and trends, the prepayment assumptions were lowered, which increased the value of the MSR. The increase also reflected a $22.7 million increase in origination and secondary marketing income as loan sales and loan originations were substantially higher (see Table 12). (See MSR section located within Market Risk for additional information.) $10.1 million, or 10%, increase in electronic banking, reflecting increased debit card transaction volume. $10.0 million benefit from lower securities losses. $8.9 million, or 9%, increase in trust services income, with 50% of the increase due to increases in asset market values, and the remainder reflecting growth in new business. $6.2 million, or 11%, increase in insurance benefits associated with bank owned life insurance. $4.0 million, or 6%, increase in brokerage income, primarily reflecting an increase in title insurance income due to higher mortgage refinance activity, and to a lesser degree an increase in fixed income product sales, partially offset by lower annuity income. Partially offset by: $35.8 million, or 12%, decrease in service charges on deposit accounts. This decline represented a decrease in personal NSF / OD service charges and reflected a combination of factors. These included the implementation of changes to Regulation E and the introduction of our Fair Play banking philosophy during the 2010 third quarter, as well as the continued underlying decline in activity as customers better manage their account balances. As part of our Fair Play banking philosophy, we voluntary reduced certain NSF / OD fees and implemented our 24 Hour Gracetm overdraft policy. The goal of our Fair Play banking philosophy is to introduce more customer friendly fee structures with the objective of accelerating the acquisition and retention of customers. $27.9 million, or 18%, decline in other income. 2009 included a $31.4 million gain from the sale of Visa Class B stock. 2009 versus 2008 Noninterest income increased $298.5 million, or 42%, from 2008, primarily reflecting: $103.3 million increase in mortgage banking income, reflecting a $57.5 million increase in origination and secondary marketing income as loans sales and loan originations were substantially higher, and a $27.1 million improvement in MSR hedging (see Table 12). $187.1 million, or 95%, reduction in securities losses as 2008 included $197.1 million of OTTI adjustments compared with $10.2 million in 2009. $12.0 million, or 30%, increase in automobile operating lease income, reflecting a 21% increase in average operating lease balances as lease originations since the 2007 fourth quarter were recorded as operating leases. However, during the 2008 fourth quarter, we exited the automobile leasing business. 45 Table of Contents $13.4 million, or 10%, increase in other income, reflecting the net impact of a $22.4 million change in the fair value of derivatives that did not qualify for hedge accounting, partially offset by a $4.7 million decline in mezzanine lending income and a $4.1 million decline in customer derivatives income. $9.9 million, or 11%, increase in electronic banking, reflecting increased transaction volumes and additional third party processing fees. Partially offset by: $22.3 million, or 18%, decline in trust services income, reflecting the impact of reduced market values on asset management revenues, as well as lower yields on proprietary money market funds. Noninterest Expense (This section should be read in conjunction with Significant Items 2, 4, and 7.) The following table reflects noninterest expense for the three years ended December 31, 2010: Table 13 Noninterest Expense Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change from 2009 Change from 2008 2010 Amount Percent 2009 Amount Percent 2008 (Dollar amounts in thousands) Personnel costs $ 798,973 $ 98,491 14 % $ 700,482 $ (83,064 ) (11 )% $ 783,546 Outside data processing and other services 159,248 11,153 8 148,095 17,869 14 130,226 Net occupancy 107,862 2,589 2 105,273 (3,155 ) (3 ) 108,428 Deposit and other insurance expense 97,548 (16,282 ) (14 ) 113,830 91,393 407 22,437 Professional services 88,778 12,412 16 76,366 26,753 54 49,613 Equipment 85,920 2,803 3 83,117 (10,848 ) (12 ) 93,965 Marketing 65,924 32,875 99 33,049 385 1 32,664 Amortization of intangibles 60,478 (7,829 ) (11 ) 68,307 (8,587 ) (11 ) 76,894 OREO and foreclosure expense 39,049 (54,850 ) (58 ) 93,899 60,444 181 33,455 Automobile operating lease expense 37,034 (6,326 ) (15 ) 43,360 12,078 39 31,282 Goodwill impairment (2,606,944 ) (100 ) 2,606,944 2,606,944 Gain on early extinguishment of debt 147,442 (100 ) (147,442 ) (123,900 ) 526 (23,542 ) Other expense 132,991 24,828 23 108,163 (30,243 ) (22 ) 138,406 Total noninterest expense $ 1,673,805 $ (2,359,638 ) (59 )% $ 4,033,443 $ 2,556,069 173 % $ 1,477,374 2010 versus 2009 As shown in the above table, noninterest expense decreased $2,359.6 million from the year ago period. Excluding the 2009 goodwill impairment of $2,606.9 million, noninterest expense increased $247.3 million and primarily reflected: The absence of $147.4 million in gains on early extinguishment of debt in 2009. 46 Table of Contents $98.5 million, or 14%, increase in personnel costs, primarily reflecting a 10% increase in full time equivalent staff in support of strategic initiatives, as well as higher commissions and other incentive expenses, and the reinstatement of certain employee benefits such as 401(k) plan matching contribution, merit increases, and bonuses. $32.9 million, or 99%, increase in marketing expense, reflecting increases in branding and product advertising activities in support of strategic initiatives. $24.8 million, or 23%, increase in other expense, reflecting $13.1 million increase associated with the provision for repurchase losses related to representations and warranties made on mortgage loans sold, as well as increased travel and miscellaneous fees. Partially offset by: $54.9 million, or 58%, decline in OREO and foreclosure expense. $16.3 million, or 14%, decrease in deposit and other insurance expense. This decrease was comprised of two components: (1) $23.6 million FDIC special assessment during the 2009 second quarter, and (2) increased assessments due to higher levels of deposits. 2009 versus 2008 Noninterest expense increased $2,556.1 million from 2008, and primarily reflected: $2,606.9 million of goodwill impairment recorded in 2009. The majority of the goodwill impairment, $2,602.7 million, was recorded during the 2009 first quarter. The remaining $4.2 million of goodwill impairment was recorded in the 2009 second quarter, and was related to the sale of a small payments related business in July 2009. (See Goodwill discussion located within the Critical Account Policies and Use of Significant Estimates for additional information). $91.4 million increase in deposit and other insurance expense. This increase was comprised of two components: (1) $23.6 million FDIC special assessment during the 2009 second quarter, and (2) $67.8 million increase related to our 2008 FDIC assessments being significantly reduced by a nonrecurring deposit assessment credit provided by the FDIC that was depleted during the 2008 fourth quarter. This deposit insurance credit offset substantially all of our assessment in 2008. Higher levels of deposits also contributed to the increase. $60.4 million increase in OREO and foreclosure expense, reflecting higher levels of problem assets, as well as loss mitigation activities. $26.8 million, or 54%, increase in professional services, reflecting higher consulting and collection related expenses. $17.9 million, or 14%, increase in outside data processing and other services, primarily reflecting portfolio servicing fees paid to Franklin resulting from the 2009 first quarter restructuring of this relationship. $12.1 million, or 39%, increase in automobile operating lease expense, primarily reflecting a 21% increase in average operating leases. However, we exited the automobile leasing business during the 2008 fourth quarter. Partially offset by: $123.9 million positive impact related to gains on early extinguishment of debt. $83.1 million, or 11%, decline in personnel expense, reflecting a decline in salaries, and lower benefits and commission expense. Full time equivalent staff declined 6% from the comparable year ago period. $30.2 million, or 22%, decline in other noninterest expense primarily reflecting lower automobile lease residual value expense as used vehicle prices improved. 47 Table of Contents $10.8 million, or 12%, decline in equipment costs, reflecting lower depreciation costs, as well as lower repair and maintenance costs. Provision for Income Taxes (This section should be read in conjunction with Significant Items 3 and 7, and Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) 2010 versus 2009 The provision for income taxes was $40.0 million for 2010 compared with a benefit of $584.0 million in 2009. Both years included the benefits from tax exempt income, tax advantaged investments, and general business credits. In 2010, we entered into an asset monetization transaction that generated a tax benefit of $63.6 million. Also, in 2010, undistributed previously reported earnings of a foreign subsidiary of $142.3 million were distributed and an additional $49.8 million of tax expense was recorded. State tax reserves of $28.8 million ($18.7 million net of federal benefit) for 2010 were recorded. The Franklin restructuring in 2009 resulted in a $159.9 million net deferred tax asset equal to the amount of income and equity that was included in our operating results for 2009. During 2010, a $43.6 million net tax benefit was recognized, primarily reflecting the increase in the net deferred tax asset relating to the assets acquired from the March 31, 2009 Franklin restructuring. The IRS completed the audit of our consolidated federal income tax returns for tax years through 2007. In addition, various state and other jurisdictions remain open to examination, including Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, Michigan, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Illinois. Both the IRS and state tax officials, including Ohio and Kentucky, have proposed adjustments to our previously filed tax returns. We believe that our tax positions related to such proposed adjustments are correct and supported by applicable statutes, regulations, and judicial authority, and intend to vigorously defend them. It is possible that the ultimate resolution of the proposed adjustments, if unfavorable, may be material to the results of operations in the period it occurs. However, although no assurance can be given, we believe that the resolution of these examinations will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position. 2009 versus 2008 The provision for income taxes was a benefit of $584.0 million for 2009 compared with a benefit of $182.2 million in 2008. The tax benefit for both years included the benefits from tax exempt income, tax advantaged investments, and general business credits. The tax benefit in 2009 was impacted by the pretax loss combined with the favorable impacts of the Franklin restructuring in 2009 and the reduction of the capital loss valuation reserve, offset by the nondeductible portion of the 2009 goodwill impairment. RISK MANAGEMENT AND CAPITAL Risk awareness, identification, reporting, and active management are key elements in overall risk management. We manage risk to an aggregate moderate to low risk profile strategy through a control framework and by monitoring and responding to potential risks. Controls include, among others, effective segregation of duties, access, authorization and reconciliation procedures, as well as staff education and a disciplined assessment process. As a strategy, we have identified sources of risks and primary risks in coordination with each business unit. We utilize Risk and Control Self Assessments (RCSA) to identify exposure risks. Through this RCSA process, we continually assess the effectiveness of controls associated with the identified risks, regularly monitor risk profiles and material exposure to losses, and identify stress events and scenarios to which we may be exposed. Our chief risk officer is responsible for ensuring that appropriate systems of controls are in place for managing and monitoring risk across the Company. Potential risk concerns are shared with the Risk Management Committee and the board of directors, as appropriate. Our internal audit department performs on going independent reviews of the risk management process and ensures the adequacy of documentation. The results of these reviews are reported regularly to the audit committee of the board of directors. 48 Table of Contents We believe our primary risk exposures are credit, market, liquidity, operational, and compliance risk. Credit risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in our borrowers ability to meet their financial obligations under agreed upon terms. Market risk represents the risk of loss due to changes in the market value of assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates, exchange rates, and equity prices. Liquidity risk arises from the possibility that funds may not be available to satisfy current or future obligations resulting from external macro market issues, investor perception of financial strength, and events unrelated to us such as war, terrorism, or financial institution market specific issues. Operational risk arises from our inherent day to day operations that could result in losses due to human error, inadequate or failed internal systems and controls, and external events. Compliance risk exposes us to money penalties, enforcement actions or other sanctions as a result of nonconformance with laws, rules, and regulations that apply to the financial services industry. Some of the more significant processes used to manage and control credit, market, liquidity, operational, and compliance risks are described in the following paragraphs. Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a counterparty is not able to meet the agreed upon terms of the financial obligation. The majority of our credit risk is associated with lending activities, as the acceptance and management of credit risk is central to profitable lending. We also have significant credit risk associated with our investment securities portfolio (see Investment Securities Portfolio discussion). While there is credit risk associated with derivative activity, we believe this exposure is minimal. The significant change in the economic conditions and the resulting changes in borrower behavior over the past several years resulted in our focusing significant resources to the identification, monitoring, and managing of our credit risk. In addition to the traditional credit risk mitigation strategies of credit policies and processes, market risk management activities, and portfolio diversification, we added more quantitative measurement capabilities utilizing external data sources, enhanced use of modeling technology, and internal stress testing processes. The maximum level of credit exposure to individual credit borrowers is limited by policy guidelines based on the perceived risk of each borrower or related group of borrowers. All authority to grant commitments is delegated through the independent credit administration function and is closely monitored and regularly updated. Concentration risk is managed through limits on loan type, geography, industry, and loan quality factors. We continue to focus predominantly on extending credit to retail and commercial customers with existing or expandable relationships within our primary banking markets, although we will consider lending opportunities outside our primary markets if we believe the associated risks are acceptable and aligned with strategic initiatives. We continue to add new borrowers that meet our targeted risk and profitability profile. Although we offer a broad set of products, we continue to develop new lending products and opportunities. Each of these new products and opportunities goes through a rigorous development and approval process prior to implementation to ensure our overall objective of maintaining an aggregate moderate to low risk portfolio profile. The checks and balances in the credit process and the independence of the credit administration and risk management functions are designed to appropriately assess the level of credit risk being accepted, facilitate the early recognition of credit problems when they occur, and to provide for effective problem asset management and resolution. For example, we do not extend additional credit to delinquent borrowers except in certain circumstances that substantially improve our overall repayment or collateral coverage position. Asset quality metrics improved significantly in 2010, reflecting our proactive portfolio management initiatives as well as some stabilization in a still relatively weak economy. The improvements in the asset quality metrics, including lower levels of NPAs, Criticized and Classified assets, and delinquencies have all been achieved through these policies and commitments. Our portfolio management policies demonstrate our commitment to maintaining an aggregate moderate to low risk profile. To that end, we continue to expand resources in our risk management areas. The weak residential real estate market and U.S. economy continued to have significant impact on the financial services industry as a whole, and specifically on our financial results. A pronounced downturn in the residential real estate market that began in early 2007 has resulted in significantly lower residential real estate 49 Table of Contents values and higher delinquencies and NCOs, including loans to builders and developers of residential real estate. In addition, continued high unemployment, among other factors, throughout 2010, has slowed any significant recovery from the U.S. recession during 2008 and 2009. As a result, we experienced higher than historical levels of delinquencies and NCOs in our loan portfolios during 2009 and 2010. The value of our investment securities backed by residential and commercial real estate was also negatively impacted by a lack of liquidity in the financial markets and anticipated credit losses. Loan and Lease Credit Exposure Mix At December 31, 2010, our loans and leases totaled $38.1 billion, representing a 4% increase from December 31, 2009. The composition of the portfolio has changed significantly over the past 12 months. From December 31, 2009, to December 31, 2010, the consumer loan portfolio increased $2.2 billion, or 13%, primarily driven by the automobile loan portfolio. In 2010, our indirect automobile finance business generated significant levels of high credit quality loan originations, and we also adopted a new accounting standard resulting in the consolidation of a $0.8 billion automobile loan securitization. At December 31, 2010, these securitized loans had a remaining balance of $522.7 million. These increases were partially offset by a $0.9 billion, or 4%, decline in the commercial loan portfolio, primarily as a result of a planned strategy to reduce the concentration of our noncore CRE portfolio. At December 31, 2010, commercial loans totaled $19.7 billion, and represented 52% of our total credit exposure. Our commercial loan portfolio is diversified along product type, size, and geography within our footprint, and is comprised of the following (see Commercial Credit discussion): CI loans CI loans are made to commercial customers for use in normal business operations to finance working capital needs, equipment purchases, or other projects. The majority of these borrowers are customers doing business within our geographic regions. CI loans are generally underwritten individually and secured with the assets of the company and or the personal guarantee of the business owners. The financing of owner occupied facilities is considered a CI loan even though there is improved real estate as collateral. This treatment is a function of the credit decision process, which focuses on cash flow from operations of the business to repay the debt. The operation, sale, rental, or refinancing of the real estate is not considered the primary repayment source for these types of loans. As we look to expand CI loan growth, we have further developed our ABL capabilities by adding experienced ABL professionals to take advantage of market opportunities resulting in better leveraging of the manufacturing base in our primary markets. We have also added a national banking group with sufficient resources to ensure we appropriately recognize and manage the risks associated with this type of lending. CRE loans CRE loans consist of loans for income producing real estate properties, real estate investment trusts, and real estate developers. We mitigate our risk on these loans by requiring collateral values that exceed the loan amount and underwriting the loan with projected cash flow in excess of the debt service requirement. These loans are made to finance properties such as apartment buildings, office and industrial buildings, and retail shopping centers; and are repaid through cash flows related to the operation, sale, or refinance of the property. Construction CRE loans Construction CRE loans are loans to individuals, companies, or developers used for the construction of a commercial or residential property for which repayment will be generated by the sale or permanent financing of the property. Our construction CRE portfolio primarily consists of retail, residential (land, single family, and condominiums), office, and warehouse product types. Generally, these loans are for construction projects that have been presold, preleased, or have secured permanent financing, as well as loans to real estate companies with significant equity invested in each project. These loans are underwritten and managed by a specialized real estate lending group that actively monitors the construction phase and manages the loan disbursements according to the predetermined construction schedule. 50 Table of Contents Total consumer loans were $18.4 billion at December 31, 2010, and represented 48% of our total credit exposure. The consumer portfolio was diversified among home equity loans, residential mortgages, and automobile loans and leases (see Consumer Credit discussion). Automobile loans/leases Automobile loans/leases are primarily comprised of loans made through automotive dealerships and includes exposure in selected states outside of our primary banking markets. In 2009, we exited several states, including Florida, Arizona, and Nevada. In 2010, we expanded into eastern Pennsylvania and five New England states. The recent expansions included hiring experienced colleagues with existing dealer relationships in those markets. No state outside of our primary banking market represented more than 5% of our total automobile loan and lease portfolio at December 31, 2010. Our automobile lease portfolio represents an immaterial portion of the total portfolio as we exited the automobile leasing business during the 2008 fourth quarter. Home equity Home equity lending includes both home equity loans and lines of credit. This type of lending, which is secured by a first or second lien on the borrowers residence, allows customers to borrow against the equity in their home. Given the current low interest rate environment, many borrowers have utilized the line of credit home equity product as the primary source of financing their home. As a result, the proportion of first lien loans has increased significantly in our portfolio over the past 24 months. Real estate market values at the time of origination directly affect the amount of credit extended and, in the event of default, subsequent changes in these values may impact the severity of losses. We actively manage the amount of credit extended through debt to income policies and LTV policy limits. Residential mortgages Residential mortgage loans represent loans to consumers for the purchase or refinance of a residence. These loans are generally financed over a 15 to 30 year term, and in most cases, are extended to borrowers to finance their primary residence. Generally, our practice is to sell a significant portion of our fixed rate originations in the secondary market. As such, the majority of the loans in our portfolio are ARMs. These ARMs primarily consist of a fixed rate of interest for the first 3 to 5 years, and then adjust annually. These loans comprised approximately 57% of our total residential mortgage loan portfolio at December 31, 2010. Other consumer loans/leases Primarily consists of consumer loans not secured by real estate or automobiles, including personal unsecured loans. 51 Table of Contents Table 14 Loan and Lease Portfolio Composition At December 31, 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 (Dollar amounts in millions) Commercial:(1) Commercial and industrial $ 13,063 34 % $ 12,888 35 % $ 13,541 33 % $ 13,126 33 % $ 7,850 30 % Commercial real estate: Construction 650 2 1,469 4 2,080 5 1,962 5 1,229 5 Commercial 6,001 16 6,220 17 8,018 20 7,221 18 3,275 13 Total commercial real estate 6,651 18 7,689 21 10,098 25 9,183 23 4,504 18 Total commercial 19,714 52 20,577 56 23,639 58 22,309 56 12,354 48 Consumer: Automobile loans and leases(2) 5,614 15 3,390 9 4,464 11 4,294 11 3,895 15 Home equity 7,713 20 7,563 21 7,557 18 7,290 18 4,927 19 Residential mortgage 4,500 12 4,510 12 4,761 12 5,447 14 4,549 17 Other loans 566 1 751 2 671 1 715 1 428 1 Total consumer 18,393 48 16,214 44 17,453 42 17,746 44 13,799 52 Total loans and leases $ 38,107 100 % $ 36,791 100 % $ 41,092 100 % $ 40,055 100 % $ 26,153 100 % (1) There were no commercial loans outstanding that would be considered a concentration of lending to a particular industry or group of industries.

Commercial Credit The primary factors considered in commercial credit approvals are the financial strength of the borrower, assessment of the borrowers management capabilities, cash flows from operations, industry sector trends, type 52 Table of Contents and sufficiency of collateral, type of exposure, transaction structure, and the general economic outlook. While these are the primary factors considered, there are a number of other factors that may be considered in the decision process. For all loans exceeding $5.0 million, we utilize a centralized senior loan committee, led by our chief credit officer. For loans less than $5.0 million, with the exception of small business loans, credit officers who understand each local region and are experienced in the industries and loan structures of the requested credit exposure are involved in all loan decisions and have the primary credit authority. For small business loans less than $5.0 million, we utilize a centralized loan approval process for standard products and structures. In this centralized decision environment, certain individuals who understand each local region may make credit extension decisions to preserve our commitment to the communities we operate in. In addition to disciplined and consistent judgmental factors, a sophisticated credit scoring process is used as a primary evaluation tool in the determination of approving a loan within the centralized loan approval process. In commercial lending, on going credit management is dependent on the type and nature of the loan. We monitor all significant exposures on an on going basis. All commercial credit extensions are assigned internal risk ratings reflecting the borrowers probability of default and loss given default (severity of loss). This two dimensional rating methodology provides granularity in the portfolio management process. The probability of default is rated and applied at the borrower level. The loss given default is rated and applied based on the type of credit extension and the underlying collateral. The internal risk ratings are assessed and updated with each periodic monitoring event. There is also extensive macro portfolio management analysis on an on going basis. As an example, the retail properties class of the CRE portfolio has received more frequent evaluation at the individual loan level given the weak environment, portfolio concentration, and stressed performance trends (see Retail Properties discussion). We continually review and adjust our risk rating criteria based on actual experience, which provides us with the current risk level in the portfolio and is the basis for determining an appropriate ACL amount for this portfolio. In addition to the initial credit analysis initiated during the approval process, the Credit Review group performs testing to provide an independent review and assessment of the quality and / or risk of the new loan production. This group is part of our Risk Management area, and conducts portfolio reviews on a risk based cycle to evaluate individual loans, validate risk ratings, as well as test the consistency of credit processes. Similarly, to provide consistent oversight, a centralized portfolio management team monitors and reports on the performance of small business banking loans. The commercial loan ratings described above are categorized as follows: Pass: Commercial loans categorized as Pass are higher quality loans that do not fit any of the other categories described below. OLEM: Commercial loans categorized as OLEM are potentially weak. The credit risk may be relatively minor yet represents a risk given certain specific circumstances. If the potential weaknesses are not monitored or mitigated, the asset may weaken or inadequately protect our position in the future. Substandard: Commercial loans categorized as Substandard are inadequately protected by the borrowers ability to repay, equity, and or the collateral pledged to secure the loan. These loans have identified weaknesses that could hinder normal repayment or collection of the debt. It is likely that we will sustain some loss if any identified weaknesses are not mitigated. Doubtful: Commercial loans categorized as Doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those loans classified as Substandard, with the added elements that the full collection of the loan is improbable and the possibility of loss is high. Commercial loans rated as OLEM, Substandard, or Doubtful are considered Criticized. Commercial loans rated as Substandard or Doubtful are considered Classified. Commercial loans may be designated as Criticized when warranted by individual borrower performance or by industry and environmental factors. Commercial Criticized loans are subjected to additional monthly reviews to adequately assess the borrowers credit status and develop appropriate action plans. We re evaluate the risk rating of these Criticized commercial loans as conditions change, potentially resulting in a further rating adjustment. Changes in the rating can be impacted by borrower performance, external factors such as industry and economic changes, as well as structural 53 Table of Contents changes to the loan arrangements including, but not limited to, amortization, collateral, guarantees, and covenants. All Classified commercial loans are managed by our SAD. The SAD is a specialized credit group that handles the day to day management of workouts, commercial recoveries, and problem loan sales. Its responsibilities include developing action plans, assessing risk ratings, and determining the adequacy of the reserve, the accrual status, and the ultimate collectability of the Classified loan portfolio. Our commercial loan portfolio, including CRE loans, is diversified by customer size, as well as geographically throughout our footprint. During 2009, we engaged in a large number of enhanced portfolio management initiatives, including a review to ensure the appropriate classification of CRE loans. The results of this initiative included reclassifications in 2009 totaling $1.4 billion that increased CI loan balances, and correspondingly decreased CRE loan balances, primarily representing owner occupied properties. We believe the changes provide improved visibility and clarity to us and our investors. We have continued this active portfolio management process throughout 2010, primarily focusing on improving our ability to identify changing conditions at the borrower level, which in most cases, significantly improved the outcome. This process allows us to provide clarity regarding the credit trends in our portfolios. Certain segments of our commercial loan portfolio are discussed in further detail below: CI PORTFOLIO The CI portfolio is comprised of loans to businesses where the source of repayment is associated with the on going operations of the business. Generally, the loans are secured with the financing of the borrowers assets, such as equipment, accounts receivable, or inventory. In many cases, the loans are secured by real estate, although the operation, sale, or refinancing of the real estate is not a primary source of repayment for the loan. For loans secured by real estate, appropriate appraisals are obtained at origination and updated on an as needed basis in compliance with regulatory requirements. There were no outstanding commercial loans considered an industry or geographic concentration of lending. Currently, higher risk segments of the CI portfolio include loans to borrowers supporting the home building industry, contractors, and automotive suppliers. We manage the risks inherent in this portfolio through origination policies, concentration limits, on going loan level reviews, recourse requirements, and continuous portfolio risk management activities. Our origination policies for this portfolio include loan product type specific policies such as LTV and debt service coverage ratios, as applicable. CI borrowers have been challenged by the weak economy, and some borrowers may no longer have sufficient capital to withstand the extended stress. As a result, these borrowers may not be able to comply with the original terms of their credit agreements. We continue to focus attention on the portfolio management process to proactively identify borrowers that may be facing financial difficulty to assess all potential solutions. The impact of the economic environment is further evidenced by the level of line of credit activity, as borrowers continued to maintain relatively low utilization percentages over the past 12 months. As shown in the following table, CI loans totaled $13.1 billion at December 31, 2010: Table 16 Commercial and Industrial Loans and Leases by Class At December 31, 2010 Commitments Loans Outstanding Amount Percent Amount Percent (Dollar amounts in millions) Class: Owner occupied $ 4,320 23 % $ 3,823 29 % Other commercial and industrial 14,676 77 9,240 71 Total $ 18,996 100 % $ 13,063 100 % 54 Table of Contents The differences in the composition between the commitments and loans outstanding results from the owner occupied class consisting almost entirely of term loans, while the remainder of the CI portfolio contains a significant amount of working capital lines of credit. The funding percentage associated with the lines of credit has been a significant indicator of credit quality, as businesses have reduced their borrowings. Generally, borrowers that fully utilize their line of credit consistently, over time, have a higher risk profile. This represents one of many credit risk factors we utilize in assessing the credit risk portfolio of individual borrowers and the overall portfolio. CRE PORTFOLIO We manage the risks inherent in this portfolio the same as the CI portfolio, with the addition of preleasing requirements, as applicable. Generally, we: (1) limit our loans to 80% of the appraised value of the commercial real estate, (2) require net operating cash flows to be 125% of required interest and principal payments, and (3) if the commercial real estate is non owner occupied, require that at least 50% of the space of the project be pre leased. Dedicated real estate professionals originated the majority of the portfolio, with the remainder obtained from prior bank acquisitions. Appraisals are obtained from approved vendors, and are reviewed by an internal appraisal review group comprised of certified appraisers to ensure the quality of the valuation used in the underwriting process. The portfolio is diversified by project type and loan size, and this diversification represents a significant portion of the credit risk management strategies employed for this portfolio. Subsequent to the origination of the loan, the Credit Review group performs testing to provide an independent review and assessment of the quality of the underwriting and or risk of the new loan production. Appraisal values are obtained in conjunction with all originations and renewals, and on an as needed basis, in compliance with regulatory requirements. Given the stressed environment for some loan types, we perform on going portfolio level reviews of certain loan classes such as the retail properties class within the CRE portfolio (see Retail Properties discussion). These reviews generate action plans based on occupancy levels or sales volume associated with the projects being reviewed. The results of these reviews indicate that some additional stress is likely due to the continued weak economic conditions. Property values are updated using appraisals on a regular basis to ensure appropriate decisions regarding the on going management of the portfolio reflect the changing market conditions. This highly individualized process requires working closely with all of our borrowers, as well as an in depth knowledge of CRE project lending and the market environment. We actively monitor the concentrations and performance metrics of all CRE loan types, with a focus on higher risk classes. Macro level stress test scenarios based on retail sales and home price depreciation trends for the classes are embedded in our performance expectations, and lease up and absorption scenarios are assessed. Each CRE loan is classified as either core or noncore. We separated the CRE portfolio into these categories in order to provide more clarity around our portfolio management strategies and to provide additional clarity for us and our investors. We believe segregating the noncore CRE from core CRE improves our ability to understand the nature, performance prospects, and problem resolution opportunities of these segments, thus allowing us to continue to deal proactively with any emerging credit issues. A CRE loan is generally considered core when the borrower is an experienced, well capitalized developer in our Midwest footprint, and has either an established meaningful relationship with the borrower generating an acceptable return on capital or demonstrates the prospect of becoming one. The core CRE portfolio was $4.0 billion at December 31, 2010, representing 61% of total CRE loans. The performance of the core portfolio met our expectations based on the consistency of the asset quality metrics within the portfolio. Based on our extensive project level assessment process, including forward looking collateral valuations, we continue to believe the credit quality of the core portfolio is stable. A CRE loan is generally considered noncore based on the lack of a substantive relationship outside of the loan product, with no immediate prospects for meeting the core relationship criteria. The noncore CRE 55 Table of Contents portfolio declined from $3.7 billion at December 31, 2009, to $2.6 billion at December 31, 2010, and represented 39% of total CRE loans. Of the loans in the noncore portfolio at December 31, 2010, 49% were classified as Pass, 95% had guarantors, 99% were secured, and 93% were located within our geographic footprint. However, it is within the noncore portfolio where most of the credit quality challenges exist. For example, $0.3 billion, or 13%, of related outstanding balances, are classified as NALs. SAD administered $1.4 billion, or 54%, of total noncore CRE loans at December 31, 2010. We expect to exit the majority of noncore CRE relationships over time through normal repayments, possible sales should economically attractive opportunities arise, or the reclassification to a core CRE relationship if it expands to meet the core criteria. The table below provides a segregation of the CRE portfolio as of December 31, 2010: Table 17 Core Commercial Real Estate Loans by Property Type and Property Location At December 31, 2010 Ohio Michigan Pennsylvania Indiana Kentucky Florida West Virginia Other Total Amount % (Dollar amounts in millions) Core portfolio: Retail properties $ 458 $ 90 $ 72 $ 75 $ 8 $ 38 $ 30 $ 364 $ 1,135 17 % Office 347 151 83 22 12 1 39 53 708 11 Multi family 277 87 40 33 29 42 58 566 9 Industrial and warehouse 257 81 23 44 3 3 6 82 499 8 Other commercial real estate 715 138 35 45 8 21 54 118 1,134 17 Total core portfolio 2,054 547 253 219 60 63 171 675 4,042 61 Total noncore portfolio 1,424 412 168 226 36 110 64 169 2,609 39 Total $ 3,478 $ 959 $ 421 $ 445 $ 96 $ 173 $ 235 $ 844 $ 6,651 100 % Credit quality data regarding the ACL and NALs, segregated by core CRE loans and noncore CRE loans, is presented in the following table: Table 18 Commercial Real Estate Core vs. Noncore portfolios December 31, 2010 Ending Nonaccrual Balance Prior NCOs ACL $ ACL % Credit Mark(1) Loans (Dollar amounts in millions) Total core $ 4,042 $ 5 $ 160 3.96 % 4.08 % $ 15.7 Noncore SAD(2) 1,400 379 329 23.50 39.80 307.2 Noncore Other 1,209 5 105 8.68 9.06 40.8 Total noncore 2,609 384 434 16.63 27.33 348.0 Total commercial real estate $ 6,651 $ 389 $ 594 8.93 % 13.96 % $ 363.7 December 31, 2009 Ending Nonaccrual Balance Prior NCOs ACL $ ACL % Credit Mark(1) Loans Total core $ 4,038 $ $ 168 4.16 % 4.16 % $ 3.8 Noncore SAD(2) 1,809 511 410 22.66 39.70 861.0 Noncore Other 1,842 26 186 10.10 11.35 71.0 Total noncore 3,651 537 596 16.32 27.05 932.0 Total commercial real estate $ 7,689 $ 537 $ 764 9.94 % 15.82 % $ 935.8 (1) Calculated as (Prior NCOs + ACL $) / (Ending Balance + Prior NCOs) (2) Noncore loans managed by SAD, the area responsible for managing loans and relationships designated as Classified loans. 56 Table of Contents As shown in the above table, the ending balance of the CRE portfolio at December 31, 2010, declined $1.0 billion compared with December 31, 2009. This decline was entirely centered in the noncore segment of the portfolio and was a result of payoffs and NCOs as we actively focus on the noncore portfolio to reduce our overall CRE exposure. This reduction occurred in a very difficult market, and demonstrates our commitment to maintaining a moderate to low risk profile. We anticipate further noncore CRE declines in future periods based on our overall strategy to reduce our overall CRE exposure. Also as shown above, substantial reserves for the noncore portfolio have been established. At December 31, 2010, the ACL related to the noncore portfolio was 16.63%. The combination of the existing ACL and prior NCOs represents the total credit actions taken on each segment of the portfolio. From this data, we calculate a credit mark that provides a consistent measurement of the cumulative credit actions taken against a specific portfolio segment. We believe the combined credit activity is appropriate for each of the CRE segments. Within the CRE portfolio, the retail properties and single family home builder classes continue to be stressed as a result of the continued decline in the housing markets and general economic conditions and are discussed below. Retail Properties Our portfolio of CRE loans secured by retail properties totaled $1.8 billion, or approximately 5% of total loans and leases, at December 31, 2010. Loans within this portfolio segment declined $0.4 billion, or 17%, from $2.1 billion at December 31, 2009. Credit approval in this portfolio segment is generally dependent on preleasing requirements, and net operating income from the project must cover debt service by specified percentages when the loan is fully funded. The weakness of the economic environment in our geographic regions continued to impact the projects that secure the loans in this portfolio segment. Lower occupancy rates, reduced rental rates, and the expectation these levels will remain stressed for the foreseeable future may adversely affect some of our borrowers ability to repay these loans. We have increased the level of credit risk management activity on this portfolio segment, and we analyze our retail property loans in detail by combining property type, geographic location, and other data, to assess and manage our credit concentration risks. We review the majority of this portfolio segment on a monthly basis. Single Family Home Builders At December 31, 2010, we had $0.6 billion of CRE loans to single family home builders. Such loans represented 1% of total loans and leases. The $0.6 billion represented a $0.3 billion, or 35%, decrease compared with $0.9 billion at December 31, 2009. The decrease primarily reflected runoff activity as few new loans have been originated since 2008, property sale activity, and NCOs. Based on portfolio management processes over the past three years, including NCO activity, we believe we have substantially addressed the credit issues in this portfolio. We do not anticipate any future significant credit impact from this portfolio segment. FRANKLIN RELATIONSHIP In 2010, we sold our portfolio of Franklin related loans to unrelated third parties. Also, we recorded $87.0 million of Franklin related NCOs, of which $75.5 million related to the loan sales. The 2010 provision for credit losses included $87.0 million related to Franklin, with $75.5 million related to the loan sales. At December 31, 2010, the only Franklin related nonperforming assets remaining were $9.5 million of OREO properties, which were marked to the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell. Consumer Credit Consumer credit approvals are based on, among other factors, the financial strength and payment history of the borrower, type of exposure, and the transaction structure. Consumer credit decisions are generally made 57 Table of Contents in a centralized environment utilizing decision models. Importantly, certain individuals who understand each local region have the authority to make credit extension decisions to preserve our focus on the local communities we operate in. Each credit extension is assigned a specific probability of default and loss given default. The probability of default is generally based on the borrowers most recent credit bureau score (FICO), which we update quarterly, while the loss given default is related to the type of collateral and the LTV ratio associated with the credit extension. In consumer lending, credit risk is managed from a loan type and vintage performance analysis. All portfolio segments are continuously monitored for changes in delinquency trends and other asset quality indicators. We make extensive use of portfolio assessment models to continuously monitor the quality of the portfolio, which may result in changes to future origination strategies. The on going analysis and review process results in a determination of an appropriate ALLL amount for our consumer loan portfolio. The independent risk management group has a consumer process review component to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of the consumer credit processes. Collection action is initiated as needed through a centrally managed collection and recovery function. The collection group employs a series of collection methodologies designed to maintain a high level of effectiveness while maximizing efficiency. In addition to the consumer loan portfolio, the collection group is responsible for collection activity on all sold and securitized consumer loans and leases. AUTOMOBILE LOANS AND LEASES PORTFOLIO The performance of the automobile loan and lease portfolio improved in 2010, despite the continued economic conditions that have adversely affected the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios (discussed below). Our strategy in the automobile loan and lease portfolio continued to focus on high quality borrowers as measured by both FICO and internal custom scores, combined with appropriate LTVs, terms, and a reasonable level of profitability. This strategy resulted in a significant improvement in performance metrics in 2010 compared to 2009, and provides us with substantial confidence for future performance of this portfolio. In 2010, we continued to consistently execute our value proposition and took advantage of market opportunities that allowed us to grow our automobile loan portfolio. The significant growth in the portfolio was accomplished while maintaining high credit quality metrics. As we further execute our strategies and take advantage of these opportunities, we are developing alternative plans to address any growth in excess of our established portfolio concentration limits, including both securitizations and loan sales. The automobile sales market expanded in 2010 and by entering into eastern Pennsylvania and five New England states, we are positioned to take advantage of a continued expansion in 2011. Our strategy and operational capabilities allow us to appropriately manage the origination quality across the entire portfolio, including our newer markets. Although increased origination volume and the entering new markets can be associated with increased risk levels, we believe our strategy and operational capabilities significantly mitigate these risks. RESIDENTIAL SECURED PORTFOLIOS The residential mortgage and home equity portfolios are primarily located throughout our footprint. The continued slowdown in the housing market negatively impacted the performance of our residential mortgage and home equity portfolios. While the degree of price depreciation varied across our markets, all regions throughout our footprint were affected. 58 Table of Contents Table 19 Selected Home Equity and Residential Mortgage Portfolio Data December 31, 2010 Home Equity Secured Secured by by Residential first lien second lien Mortgages(3) (Dollar amounts in millions) Ending balance $ 3,055 $ 4,658 $ 4,500 Portfolio weighted average LTV ratio(1) 70 % 80 % 77 % Portfolio weighted average FICO score(2) 745 733 721 Year Ended December 31, 2010 Home Equity Secured Secured by by Residential first lien second lien Mortgages(3) Originations $ 1,310 $ 754 $ 1,607 Origination weighted average LTV ratio(1) 69 % 79 % 81 % Origination weighted average FICO score(2) 767 756 759 (1) The LTV ratios for home equity loans and home equity lines of credit are cumulative and reflect the balance of any senior loans. LTV ratios reflect collateral values at the time of loan origination. (2) Portfolio weighted average FICO scores reflect currently updated customer credit scores whereas origination weighted average FICO scores reflect the customer credit scores at the time of loan origination. (3) Represents only owned portfolio originations. Home Equity Portfolio Our home equity portfolio (loans and lines of credit) consists of both first and second mortgage loans with underwriting criteria based on minimum credit scores, debt to income ratios, and LTV ratios. We offer closed end home equity loans which are generally fixed rate with principal and interest payments, and variable rate interest only home equity lines of credit which do not require payment of principal during the 10 year revolving period of the line of credit. At December 31, 2010, approximately 40% of our home equity portfolio was secured by first mortgage liens. The credit risk profile is substantially reduced when we hold a first mortgage lien position. During 2010, more than 65% of our home equity portfolio originations were secured by a first mortgage lien. We focus on high quality borrowers primarily located within our footprint. The majority of our home equity line of credit borrowers consistently pay more than the required interest only amount. Additionally, since we focus on developing complete relationships with our customers, many of our home equity borrowers are utilizing other products and services. We believe we have underwritten credit conservatively within this portfolio. We have not originated stated income home equity loans or lines of credit that allow negative amortization. Also, we have not originated home equity loans or lines of credit with an LTV at origination greater than 100%, except for infrequent situations with high quality borrowers. However, continued declines in housing prices have likely decreased the value of the collateral for this portfolio and it is likely some loans with an original LTV ratio of less than 100% currently have an LTV ratio greater than 100%. For certain home equity loans and lines of credit, we may utilize an automated valuation model (AVM) or other model driven value estimate during the credit underwriting process. We utilize a series of credit parameters to determine the appropriate valuation methodology. While we believe an AVM estimate is an appropriate valuation source for a portion of our home equity lending activities, we continue to re evaluate all of our policies on an on going basis. Regardless of the estimate methodology, we supplement our underwriting with a third party fraud detection system to limit our exposure to flipping, and outright fraudulent 59 Table of Contents transactions. We update values as we believe appropriate, and in compliance with applicable regulations, for loans identified as higher risk. Loans are identified as higher risk based on performance indicators and the updated values are utilized to facilitate our portfolio management, as well as our workout and loss mitigation functions. We continue to make origination policy adjustments based on our assessment of an appropriate risk profile, as well as industry actions. In addition to origination policy adjustments, we take actions, as necessary, to manage the risk profile of this portfolio. Residential Mortgages Portfolio We focus on higher quality borrowers and underwrite all applications centrally, often through the use of an automated underwriting system. We do not originate residential mortgage loans that allow negative amortization or allow the borrower multiple payment options. All residential mortgage loans are originated based on a completed appraisal during the credit underwriting process. Additionally, we supplement our underwriting with a third party fraud detection system to limit our exposure to flipping and outright fraudulent transactions. We update values on a regular basis in compliance with applicable regulations to facilitate our portfolio management, as well as our workout and loss mitigation functions. Also, it is important to note the recent issuance of new regulatory guidelines regarding real estate valuations, the intent of which is to ensure there is complete independence in the requesting and review of real estate valuations associated with loan decisions. We have been committed to appropriate valuations for all of our real estate lending, and do not anticipate significant impacts to our loan decision process as a result of these new guidelines. Several government actions were enacted that impacted the residential mortgage portfolio, including various refinance programs which positively affected the availability of credit for the industry. We are utilizing these programs to enhance our existing strategies of working closely with our customers. Credit Quality We believe the most meaningful way to assess overall credit quality performance for 2010 is through an analysis of credit quality performance ratios. This approach forms the basis of most of the discussion in the sections immediately following: NPAs and NALs, TDRs, ACL, and NCOs. In addition, we utilize delinquency rates, risk distribution and migration patterns, and product segmentation in the analysis of our credit quality performance. Credit quality performance in 2010 improved significantly compared with 2009. While NCOs remain elevated compared with long term expectations, 2010 continued to show improvement across the portfolio, and delinquency trends improved as well. OREO also declined significantly in 2010. We do not believe there will be a meaningful improvement in property values in the near term, and believe it prudent to dispose of the OREO properties instead of incurring the on going expenses associated with maintaining the properties. As such, the decrease in the OREO balances resulted from an active selling strategy, as well as a lower level of inflows associated with residential properties due to our active loss mitigation and short sale strategies. The economic environment remained challenging. Yet, reflecting the benefit of our focused credit actions of 2009 and 2010, we experienced declines in total NPAs, new NPAs, and commercial Criticized loans. Our ACL declined $240.2 million to $1,291.1 million, or 3.39% of period end loans and leases from $1,531.4 million, or 4.16% at 2009. Importantly, our ACL as a percent of period end NALs increased to 166% from 80%, and coverage ratios associated with NPAs and Criticized assets also increased. These improved coverage ratios indicated a strengthening of our reserve position relative to troubled assets from the prior year end. These coverage ratios are a key component of our internal adequacy assessment process and provide an important consideration in the determination of the adequacy of the ACL. 60 Table of Contents NPAs, NALs, AND TDRs (This section should be read in conjunction with Significant Item 3.) NPAs AND NALs NPAs consist of (1) NALs, which represent loans and leases no longer accruing interest, (2) impaired loans held for sale, (3) OREO properties, and (4) other NPAs. A CI or CRE loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when collection of principal or interest is in doubt or when the loan is 90 days past due. Residential mortgage loans are placed on nonaccrual status at 180 days past due, and a charge off recorded if it is determined that insufficient equity exists in the collateral property to support the entire outstanding loan amount. A home equity loan is placed on nonaccrual status at 180 days past due, and a charge off recorded if it is determined there is not sufficient equity in the collateral property to cover our position. For loans secured by residential real estate, the collateral equity position is determined by a current property valuation based on an expected marketing time period consistent with the market. When interest accruals are suspended, accrued interest income is reversed with current year accruals charged to earnings and prior year amounts generally charged off as a credit loss. When, in our judgment, the borrowers ability to make required interest and principal payments has resumed and collectability is no longer in doubt, the loan or lease is returned to accrual status. Table 20 reflects period end NALs and NPAs detail for each of the last five years. Table 21 details the Franklin related impacts to NALs and NPAs for each of the last five years. There were no Franklin related NALs or NPAs at December 31, 2006.

The decrease of $1,139.0 million primarily reflected: $572.1 million decrease in CRE NALs, primarily reflecting both NCO activity and problem loan resolutions including borrower payments and pay offs. Payments and pay offs received were substantial and are a direct result of our commitment to the on going proactive management of these problem loans by our SAD. Also, inflow levels were significantly lower in 2010 compared to 2009. The level of inflows, or migration, is an important indicator of the future trend for this portfolio. $317.6 million decrease in residential mortgage NALs, primarily reflecting the Franklin related loan sales in 2010. $231.7 million decrease in CI NALs, primarily reflecting both NCO activity and problem loan resolutions, including pay offs. The decline was associated with loans throughout our footprint, with no specific geographic or industry concentration. $17.6 million decrease in home equity NALs, primarily reflecting the Franklin related loans sales in 2010. Also, of the $710.4 million of CRE and CI related NALs at December 31, 2010, $183.4 million, or 26%, represented loans that were less than 30 days past due, demonstrating our commitment to proactive credit risk management. NPAs, which include NALs, were $844.8 million at December 31, 2010, and represented 2.21% of related assets. This compared with $2,058.1 million, or 5.57%, at December 31, 2009. The $1,213.3 million decrease reflected: $1,139.0 million decrease to NALs, discussed above. $73.3 million decrease to OREO. This reflected a focused effort to reduce our level of OREO properties through active selling strategies during the year, as well as lower levels of new OREO properties resulting from an increase in loss mitigation activity and short sales prior to foreclosure. We do not believe there will be a meaningful improvement in property values in the near term, and believe it prudent to dispose of the property instead of incurring the on going expenses associated with maintaining the property. NPA activity for each of the past five years was as follows: Table 22 Nonperforming Asset Activity At December 31, (Dollar amounts in thousands) 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 Nonperforming assets, beginning of year $ 2,058,091 $ 1,636,646 $ 472,902 $ 193,620 $ 117,155 New nonperforming assets 925,699 2,767,295 1,082,063 468,056 222,043 Franklin related impact, net(1) (329,023 ) (311,726 ) 650,225 Acquired nonperforming assets 144,492 33,843 Returns to accruing status (370,798 ) (215,336 ) (42,161 ) (24,952 ) (43,999 ) Loan and lease losses (639,766 ) (1,148,135 ) (202,249 ) (120,959 ) (45,648 ) Other real estate owned losses (7,936 ) (62,665 ) (19,582 ) (5,795 ) (543 ) Payments (650,429 ) (497,076 ) (194,692 ) (86,093 ) (59,469 ) Sales (141,086 ) (110,912 ) (109,860 ) (95,467 ) (29,762 ) Nonperforming assets, end of year $ 844,752 $ 2,058,091 $ 1,636,646 $ 472,902 $ 193,620 (1) The activity above excludes the 2007 impact of the placement of the loans to Franklin on nonaccrual status and their return to accrual status upon the restructuring of these loans. At 2007 year end, the loans to 63 Table of Contents Franklin were not included in the nonperforming assets total. At 2008 year end, the loans to Franklin were reported as nonaccrual commercial and industrial loans. At 2009 year end, nonaccrual Franklin loans were reported as residential mortgage loans, home equity loans, and other real estate owned. The 2009 impact primarily reflects loan and lease losses, as well as payments. TDR Loans TDRs are modified loans in which a concession is provided to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. Loan modifications are considered TDRs when the concession provided is not available to the borrower through either normal channels or other sources. However, not all loan modifications are TDRs. Our standards relating to loan modifications consider, among other factors, minimum verified income requirements, cash flow analysis, and collateral valuations. However, each potential loan modification is reviewed individually and the terms of the loan are modified to meet a borrowers specific circumstances at a point in time. All loan modifications, including those classified as TDRs, are reviewed and approved. Our ALLL is largely driven by updated risk ratings to commercial loans, updated borrower credit scores on consumer loans, and borrower delinquency history in both the commercial and consumer loan portfolios. As such, the provision for credit losses is impacted primarily by changes in borrower payment performance rather than the TDR classification. TDRs can be classified as either accrual or nonaccrual loans. Nonaccrual TDRs are included in NALs whereas accruing TDRs are excluded because the borrower remains contractually current. The table below provides a summary of our TDRs (both accrual and nonaccrual) by loan type at December 31, 2010 and 2009: Table 23 Accruing and Nonaccruing Troubled Debt Restructured Loans December 31, 2010 2009 (Dollar amounts in thousands) Restructured loans and leases accruing: Mortgage loans $ 328,411 $ 229,470 Other consumer loans 76,586 52,871 Commercial loans 222,632 157,049 Total restructured loans and leases accruing 627,629 439,390 Restructured loans and leases nonaccruing: Mortgage loans 5,789 4,988 Other consumer loans Commercial loans 33,462 108,458 Total restructured loans and leases nonaccruing 39,251 113,446 Total restructured loans and leases $ 666,880 $ 552,836 In the workout of a problem loan, there are many factors considered when determining the most favorable resolution. For consumer loans, we evaluate the ability and willingness of the borrower to make contractual or reduced payments, the value of the underlying collateral, and the costs associated with the foreclosure or repossession, and remarketing of the collateral. For commercial loans, we consider similar criteria and also evaluate the borrowers business prospects. Residential Mortgage loan TDRs Residential mortgage TDRs represent loan modifications associated with traditional first lien mortgage loans in which a concession has been provided to the borrower. Residential mortgages identified as TDRs involve borrowers who are unable to refinance their mortgages through our normal mortgage origination channels or through other independent sources. Some, but not all, of the loans may be delinquent. Modifications can include adjustments to rates and or principal. Modified loans identified as TDRs are aggregated into pools for analysis. Cash flows and weighted average interest rates are used to calculate impairment at the pooled loan level. Once the loans are aggregated into the pool, they continue to be 64 Table of Contents classified as TDRs until contractually repaid or charged off. No consideration is given to removing individual loans from the pools. Residential mortgage loans not guaranteed by a U.S. government agency such as the FHA, VA, and the USDA, including restructured loans, are reported as accrual or nonaccrual based upon delinquency status. NALs are those that are greater than 180 days contractually past due. Loans guaranteed by U.S. government organizations continue to accrue interest upon delinquency. Residential mortgage loan TDR classifications resulted in an impairment adjustment of $6.6 million in 2010. Prior to the TDR classification, residential mortgage loans individually had minimal ALLL associated with them because the ALLL is calculated on a total portfolio pooled basis. Other Consumer loan TDRs Generally, these are TDRs associated with home equity borrowings and automobile loans. We make similar interest rate, term, and principal concessions as with residential mortgage loan TDRs. The TDR classification for these other consumer loans resulted in an impairment adjustment of $1.3 million in 2010. Commercial loan TDRs Commercial accruing TDRs represent loans in which a loan rated as Classified is current on contractual principal and interest but undergoes a loan modification. Accruing TDRs often result from loans rated as Classified receiving an extension on the maturity of their loan, for example, to allow additional time for the sale or lease of underlying CRE collateral. Often, it is prudent to extend the maturity rather than foreclose on a commercial loan, particularly for borrowers who are generating cash flows to support contractual interest payments. These borrowers cannot obtain the modified loan through other independent sources because of their current financial circumstances, therefore a concession is provided and the modification is classified as a TDR. The TDR remains in accruing status as long as the customer is current on payments and no loss is probable. Commercial nonaccrual TDRs result from either workouts where an existing commercial NAL is restructured into multiple new loans, or from an accruing commercial TDR being placed on nonaccrual status. At December 31, 2010, approximately $19.9 million of our commercial nonaccrual TDRs resulted from such workouts. The remaining $12.0 million represented the reclassifications of accruing TDRs to NALs. For certain loan workouts, we create two or more new notes. The senior note is underwritten based upon our normal underwriting standards at current market rates and is sized so projected cash flows are sufficient to repay contractual principal and interest. The terms on the subordinate note(s) vary by situation, but often defer interest payments until after the senior note is repaid. Creating two or more notes often allows the borrower to continue a project or weather a temporary economic downturn and allows us to right size a loan based upon the current expectations for a project performance. The senior note is considered for return to accrual status if the borrower has sustained sufficient cash flows for a six month period of time and we believe no loss is probable. This six month period could extend before or after the restructure date. Subordinated notes created in the workout are charged off immediately. Any interest or principal payments received on the subordinated notes are applied to the principal of the senior note first until the senior note is repaid. Further payments are recorded as recoveries on the subordinated note. As the loans are already considered Classified, an adequate ALLL has been recorded when appropriate. Consequently, a TDR classification on commercial loans does not usually result in significant additional reserves. We consider removing the TDR status on commercial loans if the loan is at a market rate of interest and after the loan has performed in accordance with the restructured terms for a sustained period of time, generally one year. 65 Table of Contents The following table reflects period end accruing TDRs and past due loans and leases detail for each of the last five years: Table 24 Accruing Past Due Loans and Leases and Accruing Troubled Debt Restructured Loans At December 31, 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 (Dollar amounts in thousands) Accruing loans and leases past due 90 days or more Commercial and industrial $ $ $ 10,889 $ 10,474 $ 170 Commercial real estate 59,425 25,064 1,711 Residential mortgage (excluding loans guaranteed by the U.S. government) 53,983 78,915 71,553 67,391 35,555 Home equity 23,497 53,343 29,039 24,086 13,423 Other loans and leases 10,177 13,400 18,039 13,962 6,650 Total, excl. loans guaranteed by the U.S. government 87,657 145,658 188,945 140,977 57,509 Add: loans guaranteed by the U.S. government 98,288 101,616 82,576 51,174 31,308 Total accruing loans and leases past due 90 days or more, including loans guaranteed by the U.S. government $ 185,945 $ 247,274 $ 271,521 $ 192,151 $ 88,817 Ratios:(1) Excluding loans guaranteed by the U.S. government, as a percent of total loans and leases 0.23 % 0.40 % 0.46 % 0.35 % 0.22 % Guaranteed by the U.S. government, as a percent of total loans and leases 0.26 0.28 0.20 0.13 0.12 Including loans guaranteed by the U.S. government, as a percent of total loans and leases 0.49 0.68 0.66 0.48 0.34 Accruing troubled debt restructured loans Commercial(2) $ 222,632 $ 157,049 $ 185,333 $ 1,187,368 $ Total residential mortgages 328,411 229,470 84,993 32,005 7,496 Other 76,586 52,871 41,094 Total accruing troubled debt restructured loans $ 627,629 $ 439,390 $ 311,420 $ 1,219,373 $ 7,496 (1) Percent of related loans and leases. (2) Franklin loans were reported as commercial accruing restructured loans at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2008, Franklin loans were reported as nonaccrual commercial and industrial loans. At December 31, 2009, nonaccrual Franklin loans were reported as residential mortgage loans, home equity loans, and other real estate owned. The over 90 day delinquency ratio for total loans not guaranteed by a U.S. government agency was 0.23% at December 31, 2010, representing a 17 basis point decline compared with December 31, 2009. This decrease primarily reflected continued improvement in our core performance, as well as the impact of the sale of certain underperforming loans in 2010. The increase in accruing TDRs primarily reflects our loss mitigation efforts to proactively work with borrowers having difficulty making their payments. 66 Table of Contents ACL (This section should be read in conjunction with Significant Item 3, and Notes 1 and 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) We maintain two reserves, both of which in our judgment are adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio: the ALLL and the AULC. Combined, these reserves comprise the total ACL. Our credit administration group is responsible for developing the methodology assumptions and estimates used in the calculation, as well as determining the adequacy of the ACL. The ALLL represents the estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the reported date. Additions to the ALLL result from recording provision expense for loan losses or increased risk levels resulting from loan risk rating downgrades, while reductions reflect charge offs, recoveries, decreased risk levels resulting from loan risk rating upgrades, or the sale of loans. The AULC is determined by applying the transaction reserve process to the unfunded portion of the loan exposures adjusted by an applicable funding expectation. A provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the ACL to the level we have determined to be adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio. The provision for credit losses in 2010 was $634.5 million, compared with $2,074.7 million in 2009, primarily reflecting significantly lower NCOs in 2010 compared with 2009, and improved credit quality metrics. While credit quality metrics have significantly improved during 2010, provision expense since 2007 has been higher than historical levels, reflecting the pronounced downturn in the U.S. economy, as well as significant deterioration in the residential real estate market that began in early 2007. Declining real estate valuations and higher levels of delinquencies and NCOs have negatively affected the quality of our loans secured by real estate. Portions of the residential portfolio, as well as the single family home builder and developer loans in the commercial portfolio, experienced the majority of the credit issues related to the residential real estate market. We regularly assess the adequacy of the ACL by performing on going evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio, including such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category, the financial condition of specific borrowers, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or other documented support. We evaluate the impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet their financial obligations when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the adequacy of our ACL at each reporting date. In addition to general economic conditions and the other factors described above, we also consider the impact of declining residential real estate values and the diversification of CRE loans, particularly loans secured by retail properties. Our ACL assessment process includes the on going assessment of credit quality metrics, and a comparison of certain ACL adequacy benchmarks to current performance. While the total ACL balance declined in 2010 compared with 2009, all of the relevant benchmarks improved as a result of the asset quality improvement. The coverage ratios of NALs, Criticized and Classified loans all showed significant improvement in 2010 despite the decline in the ACL level. Table 25 reflects activity in the ALLL and ACL for each of the last five years. Table 26 displays the Franklin related impacts to the ALLL and ACL for each of the last five years. There were not any Franklin related impacts to either the ALLL or ACL at December 31, 2010 or 2006. 67 Table of Contents Table 25 Summary of Allowance for Credit Losses and Related Statistics Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 (Dollar amounts in thousands) Allowance for loan and lease losses, beginning of year $ 1,482,479 $ 900,227 $ 578,442 $ 272,068 $ 268,347 Acquired allowance for loan and lease losses 188,128 23,785 Loan and lease charge offs Commercial: Commercial and industrial (316,771 ) (525,262 ) (538,434 ) (359,457 ) (33,244 ) Commercial real estate: Construction (116,428 ) (196,148 ) (6,631 ) (11,902 ) (4,156 ) Commercial (187,567 ) (500,534 ) (65,565 ) (29,152 ) (4,393 ) Commercial real estate (303,995 ) (696,682 ) (72,196 ) (41,054 ) (8,549 ) Total commercial (620,766 ) (1,221,944 ) (610,630 ) (400,511 ) (41,793 ) Consumer: Automobile loans and leases (46,308 ) (76,141 ) (72,108 ) (41,241 ) (33,789 ) Home equity (140,831 ) (110,400 ) (70,457 ) (37,221 ) (24,950 ) Residential mortgage (163,427 ) (111,899 ) (23,012 ) (12,196 ) (4,767 ) Other loans (32,575 ) (40,993 ) (30,123 ) (26,773 ) (14,393 ) Total consumer (383,141 ) (339,433 ) (195,700 ) (117,431 ) (77,899 ) Total charge offs (1,003,907 ) (1,561,378 ) (806,330 ) (517,942 ) (119,692 ) Recoveries of loan and lease charge offs Commercial: Commercial and industrial 61,839 37,656 12,269 13,617 12,376 Commercial real estate: Construction 7,420 3,442 5 48 602 Commercial 21,013 10,509 3,451 1,902 1,163 Total commercial real estate 28,433 13,951 3,456 1,950 1,765 Total commercial 90,272 51,607 15,725 15,567 14,141 Consumer: Automobile loans and leases 19,736 19,809 17,543 13,549 15,014 Home equity 1,458 4,224 2,901 2,795 3,096 Residential mortgage 10,532 1,697 1,765 825 262 Other loans 7,435 7,454 10,329 7,575 4,803 Total consumer 39,161 33,184 32,538 24,744 23,175 Total recoveries 129,433 84,791 48,263 40,311 37,316 Net loan and lease charge offs (874,474 ) (1,476,587 ) (758,067 ) (477,631 ) (82,376 ) Provision for loan and lease losses 641,299 2,069,931 1,067,789 628,802 62,312 Economic reserve transfer 12,063 Allowance for assets sold and securitized (296 ) (9,188 ) Allowance for loans transferred to held for sale (1,904 ) (32,925 ) Allowance for loan and lease losses, end of year 1,249,008 1,482,479 900,227 578,442 272,068 Allowance for unfunded loan commitments, beginning of year 48,879 44,139 66,528 40,161 36,957 Acquired allowance for unfunded loan commitments 11,541 325 (Reduction in) Provision for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit losses (6,752 ) 4,740 (10,326 ) 14,826 2,879 Economic reserve transfer (12,063 ) Allowance for unfunded loan commitments, end of year 42,127 48,879 44,139 66,528 40,161 Allowance for credit losses, end of year $ 1,291,135 $ 1,531,358 $ 944,366 $ 644,970 $ 312,229 ALLL as a % of total period end loans and leases 3.28 % 4.03 % 2.19 % 1.44 % 1.04 % AULC as a % of total period end loans and leases 0.11 0.13 0.11 0.17 0.15 ACL as a % of total period end loans and leases 3.39 % 4.16 % 2.30 % 1.61 % 1.19 % 68 Table of Contents Table 26 Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Allowance for Credit Losses Franklin Related Impact December 31, 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 (Dollar amounts in millions) Allowance for loan and lease losses Franklin $ $ $ 130.0 $ 115.3 $ Non Franklin 1,249.0 1,482.5 770.2 463.1 272.1 Total $ 1,249.0 $ 1,482.5 $ 900.2 $ 578.4 $ 272.1 Allowance for credit losses Franklin $ $ $ 130.0 $ 115.3 $ Non Franklin 1,291.1 1,531.4 814.4 529.7 312.2 Total $ 1,291.1 $ 1,531.4 $ 944.4 $ 645.0 $ 312.2 Total loans and leases Franklin $ $ 443.9 $ 650.2 $ 1,187.0 $ Non Franklin 38,106.5 36,346.8 40,441.8 38,868.0 26,153.4 Total $ 38,106.5 $ 36,790.7 $ 41,092.0 $ 40,055.0 $ 26,153.4 ALLL as % of total loans and leases Total 3.28 % 4.03 % 2.19 % 1.44 % 1.04 % Non Franklin 3.28 4.08 1.90 1.19 1.04 ACL as % of total loans and leases Total 3.39 % 4.16 % 2.30 % 1.61 % 1.19 % Non Franklin 3.39 4.21 2.01 1.36 1.19 Nonaccrual loans Franklin $ $ 314.7 $ 650.2 $ $ Non Franklin 777.9 1,602.3 851.9 319.8 144.1 Total $ 777.9 $ 1,917.0 $ 1,502.1 $ 319.8 $ 144.1 ALLL as % of NALs Total 161 % 77 % 60 % 181 % 189 % Non Franklin 161 93 90 145 189 ACL as % of NALs Total 166 % 80 % 63 % 202 % 217 % Non Franklin 166 96 96 166 217 The reduction in the ACL, compared with December 31, 2009, reflected a decline in the commercial portfolio ALLL as a result of NCOs on loans with specific reserves, and an overall reduction in the level of commercial Criticized loans. Commercial Criticized loans are commercial loans rated as OLEM, Substandard, Doubtful, or Loss (refer to the Commercial Credit section for additional information regarding loan risk ratings). As shown in the table below, commercial Criticized loans declined $1.9 billion, or 38%, from December 31, 2009, reflecting upgrade and payment activity. 69 Table of Contents Table 27 Criticized Commercial Loan Activity At December 31, 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 (Dollar amounts in thousands) Criticized commercial loans, beginning of period $ 4,971,637 $ 3,311,280 $ 2,736,166 $ 662,425 $ 646,925 New additions/increases 1,284,216 4,707,518 1,688,022 2,670,616 573,246 Advances 298,511 390,872 292,295 282,614 177,314 Upgrades to Pass (1,456,132 ) (522,150 ) (378,027 ) (271,394 ) (279,413 ) Payments (1,465,374 ) (1,843,535 ) (858,996 ) (531,255 ) (456,110 ) Loan losses (558,377 ) (1,072,348 ) (168,180 ) (76,840 ) 463 Criticized commercial loans, end of period $ 3,074,481 $ 4,971,637 $ 3,311,280 $ 2,736,166 $ 662,425 Compared with December 31, 2009, the AULC declined $6.8 million as a result of a substantive reduction in the level of unfunded loan commitments in the commercial portfolio. A concerted effort was made to reduce potential exposure associated with unfunded lines and to generate an appropriate level of return on those that remain in place. In addition, borrowers continued to reassess their borrowing needs and reduced their desired funding capacity. The ACL coverage ratio associated with NALs was 166% at December 31, 2010, representing a significant improvement compared with 80% at December 31, 2009. This improvement reflected substantial reductions in CI and CRE NALs. Although credit quality asset metrics and trends, including those mentioned above, improved during 2010, the economic environment in our markets remained weak and uncertain as reflected by continued stressed residential values, continued weakness in industrial employment in northern Ohio and southeast Michigan, and the significant subjectivity involved in commercial real estate valuations for properties located in areas with limited sale or refinance activities. Residential real estate values continued to be negatively impacted by high unemployment, increased foreclosure activity, and the elimination of home buyer tax credits. In the near term, we believe these factors will result in continued stress in our portfolios secured by residential real estate and an elevated level of NCOs compared to historic levels. During 2010, the inflows of both new commercial Criticized loans and new NPAs declined significantly compared with 2009 levels, however both have shown volatility during 2010. In the 2010 third quarter, inflows of both new commercial Criticized loans and NPAs increased compared to the prior quarter. Although both of these levels declined in the 2010 fourth quarter from the 2010 third quarter, we believe this volatility evidences a fragile economic environment. Further, concerns continue to exist regarding the economic conditions in both national and international markets, the state of financial and credit markets, the unemployment rate, the impact of the Federal Reserve monetary policy, and continued uncertainty regarding federal, state, and local government budget deficits. We do not anticipate any meaningful change in the overall economy in the near term. All of these factors are impacting consumer confidence, as well as business investments and acquisitions. Given the combination of these factors, we believe that our ACL coverage levels are appropriate. 70 Table of Contents The table below reflects the allocation of our ACL among our various loan categories during each of the past five years: Table 28 Allocation of Allowances for Credit Losses (1) At December 31, 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 (Dollar amounts in thousands) Commercial Commercial and industrial $ 340,614 34 % $ 492,205 35 % $ 412,201 33 % $ 295,555 33 % $ 117,481 30 % Commercial real estate 588,251 18 751,875 21 322,681 25 172,998 23 72,272 17 Total commercial 928,865 52 1,244,080 56 734,882 58 468,553 56 189,753 47 Consumer Automobile loans and leases 49,488 15 57,951 9 44,712 11 28,635 11 28,400 15 Home equity 150,630 20 102,039 21 63,538 18 45,957 18 32,572 19 Residential mortgage 93,289 12 55,903 12 44,463 12 20,746 14 13,349 17 Other loans 26,736 1 22,506 2 12,632 1 14,551 1 7,994 2 Total consumer 320,143 48 238,399 44 165,345 42 109,889 44 82,315 53 Total allowance for loan and lease losses 1,249,008 100 % 1,482,479 100 % 900,227 100 % 578,442 100 % 272,068 100 % Allowance for unfunded loan commitments 42,127 48,879 44,139 66,528 40,161 Total allowance for credit losses $ 1,291,135 $ 1,531,358 $ 944,366 $ 644,970 $ 312,229 (1) Percentages represent the percentage of each loan and lease category to total loans and leases.

These charge offs were reduced by the unamortized discount associated with the loans, and by other amounts received by Franklin totaling $88.5 million, resulting in net charge offs of $308.5 million. In assessing NCO trends, it is helpful to understand the process of how loans are treated as they deteriorate over time. Reserves for loans are established at origination consistent with the level of risk 73 Table of Contents associated with the original underwriting. If the quality of a loan subsequently deteriorates, it migrates to a lower quality risk rating through our on going portfolio management process, and a higher reserve amount is assigned. As a part of our on going portfolio management process for commercial loans, the loan is reviewed and reserves are increased or decreased as warranted. Charge offs, if necessary, are generally recognized in a period after the reserves were established. If the previously established reserves exceed that needed to satisfactorily resolve the problem loan, a reduction in the overall level of the reserve could be recognized. In summary, if loan quality deteriorates, the typical credit sequence is periods of reserve building, followed by periods of higher NCOs as previously established reserves are utilized. Additionally, increases in reserves either precede or are in conjunction with increases in NALs. When a loan is classified as NAL, it is evaluated for specific reserves or charge off. As a result, an increase in NALs may not necessarily result in an increase in reserves or an expectation of higher future NCOs. The significant $602.1 million decline in total NCOs reflected a combination of some economic stabilization, as well as the proactive credit management practices begun in 2009. These practices continued in 2010, and remain on going. The $113.1 million decrease in non Franklin related CI NCOs reflected improvement in the overall credit quality of the portfolio compared with 2009. The $407.2 million decrease in CRE NCOs primarily reflected our proactive credit management practices begun in 2009. These practices continued in 2010, and remain on going. The $29.8 million decline in automobile loans and leases reflected our consistent high quality of originations since the beginning of 2008. The focus on origination quality has been the primary driver for the improvement in this portfolio compared with the 2009. We believe the quality of the loans originated in 2010 will result in industry standard levels of NCOs going forward as well. Non Franklin related home equity NCOs increased $12.2 million reflecting the continuing stress to our borrowers associated with the fragile economy and the significant reduction of collateral equity since 2006. Delinquencies continued to be driven by lower income resulting from job loss or reduced revenues for borrowers that are self employed. Frequently, first lien loans can be refinanced, however, there are limited financing options for second lien loans, particularly in situations when the collateral equity has lost value. While we charge off loans in these situations, we generally do not forgive the debt, resulting in longer term opportunities for recoveries. Although 2010 NCOs were higher compared with 2009, early stage delinquency levels in the home equity line of credit portfolio declined, supporting our longer term positive view for the performance of the home equity portfolio. We have been successful in originating new loans to higher quality borrowers, as evidenced by our 2010 home equity line of credit originations were 100% current as of December 31, 2010. Non Franklin related residential mortgage NCOs declined $27.0 million. This decline reflected a $48.1 million sale of certain underperforming residential mortgage loans in 2010 that resulted in $16.4 million of NCOs, compared with a 2009 sale of $44.8 million of similar loans resulting in $17.6 million of NCOs. The remaining decrease in the non Franklin related residential mortgage NCOs compared with the prior year primarily reflected a combination of a general stabilization of home prices, as well as an increase in active loss mitigation activity. The 2010 loan sale resulted in the elimination of loans with potential future credit losses and foreclosure expenses. As we believe there will be no meaningful improvement in home prices in the foreseeable future, the selective reduction of underperforming loans is consistent with our moderate to low risk profile strategy. AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND OTHER SECURITIES PORTFOLIO (This section should be read in conjunction with the Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Significant Estimates discussion, and Notes 1 and 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) Our available for sale and other securities portfolio is evaluated under established asset/liability management objectives. Changing market conditions could affect the profitability of the portfolio, as well as the level of interest rate risk exposure. 74 Table of Contents Our available for sale and other securities portfolio is comprised of various financial instruments. At December 31, 2010, our available for sale and other securities portfolio totaled $9.9 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion from 2009. The duration of the portfolio increased by 0.6 years as a result of the purchase of additional structured mortgage, municipal and corporate debt securities. Municipal securities comprise 4.5% of the portfolio and consist primarily of general obligation and revenue bonds for essential services from 18 different states.

Declines in the fair value of available for sale and other securities are recorded as temporary impairment, noncredit OTTI, or credit OTTI adjustments. Temporary impairment adjustments are recorded when the fair value of a security declines below its historical cost. Temporary impairment adjustments are recorded in OCI, and reduce equity. Temporary impairment adjustments do not impact net income or risk based capital. A recovery of available for sale security prices also is recorded as an adjustment to OCI for securities that were previously temporarily impaired and results in an increase to equity. Because the available for sale and other securities portfolio is recorded at fair value, the determination that a securitys decline in value is other than temporary does not significantly impact equity, as the amount of any of temporary adjustment has already been reflected in OCI. A recovery in the value of an other than temporarily impaired security is recorded as additional interest income over the remaining life of the security. During 2010, we recorded $13.7 million of credit OTTI losses. This amount was comprised of $4.9 million related to pooled trust preferred securities, $7.1 million related to CMO securities, and $1.6 million related to Alt A securities. Given the continued disruption in the housing and financial markets, we may be required to recognize additional credit OTTI losses in future periods with respect to our available for sale and other securities portfolio. The amount and timing of any additional credit OTTI will depend on the decline in the 76 Table of Contents underlying cash flows of the securities. If our intent to hold temporarily impaired securities changes in future periods, we may be required to recognize noncredit OTTI through income, which will negatively impact earnings. Alt A, Pooled Trust Preferred, and Private Label CMO Securities Our three highest risk segments of our investment portfolio are the Alt A mortgage backed, pooled trust preferred, and private label CMO portfolios. The Alt A mortgage backed securities and pooled trust preferred securities are located within the asset backed securities portfolio. The performance of the underlying securities in each of these segments continued to reflect the stressed economic environment. Each of these securities in these three segments is subjected to a rigorous review of their projected cash flows. These reviews are supported with analysis from independent third parties. (See the Investment Securities section located within the Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Significant Estimates section for additional information). The following table presents the credit ratings for our Alt A, pooled trust preferred, and private label CMO securities as of December 31, 2010: Table 33 Credit Ratings of Selected Investment Securities (1) Amortized Average Credit Rating of Fair Value Amount Cost Fair Value AAA AA +/ A +/ BBB +/ BBB (Dollar amounts in millions) Private label CMO securities $ 134.5 $ 121.9 $ 25.4 $ 6.5 $ 5.0 $ 15.1 $ 69.9 Alt A mortgage backed securities 68.9 60.4 15.8 27.3 17.3 Pooled trust preferred securities 232.4 102.3 24.7 77.6 Total at December 31, 2010 $ 435.8 $ 284.6 $ 41.2 $ 33.8 $ 29.7 $ 15.1 $ 164.8 Total at December 31, 2009 $ 912.3 $ 700.3 $ 62.1 $ 72.9 $ 35.6 $ 121.3 $ 408.4 (1) Credit ratings reflect the lowest current rating assigned by a nationally recognized credit rating agency. Negative changes to the above credit ratings would generally result in an increase of our risk weighted assets, which could result in a reduction to our regulatory capital ratios. 77 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the relevant characteristics of our pooled trust preferred securities portfolio at December 31, 2010.

(3) Includes both banks and or insurance companies. (4) Excess subordination percentage represents the additional defaults in excess of both current and projected defaults that the CDO can absorb before the bond experiences credit impairment. Excess subordinated percentage is calculated by (a) determining what percentage of defaults a deal can experience before the bond has credit impairment, and (b) subtracting from this default breakage percentage both total current and expected future default percentages. Market Risk Market risk represents the risk of loss due to changes in market values of assets and liabilities. We incur market risk in the normal course of business through exposures to market interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, credit spreads, and expected lease residual values. We have identified two primary sources of market risk: interest rate risk and price risk. Interest Rate Risk OVERVIEW Interest rate risk is the risk to earnings and value arising from changes in market interest rates. Interest rate risk arises from timing differences in the repricings and maturities of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities (reprice risk), changes in the expected maturities of assets and liabilities arising from 78 Table of Contents embedded options, such as borrowers ability to prepay residential mortgage loans at any time and depositors ability to redeem certificates of deposit before maturity (option risk), changes in the shape of the yield curve where interest rates increase or decrease in a non parallel fashion (yield curve risk), and changes in spread relationships between different yield curves, such as U.S. Treasuries and LIBOR (basis risk). Our board of directors establishes broad policy limits with respect to interest rate risk. ALCO establishes specific operating guidelines within the parameters of the board of directors policies. In general, we seek to minimize the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income and the economic values of assets and liabilities. Our ALCO regularly monitors the level of interest rate risk sensitivity to ensure compliance with the board of directors approved risk limits. Interest rate risk management is an active process that encompasses monitoring loan and deposit flows complemented by investment and funding activities. Effective management of interest rate risk begins with understanding the dynamic characteristics of assets and liabilities and determining the appropriate interest rate risk posture given business segment forecasts, management objectives, market expectations, and policy constraints. An asset sensitive position refers to a balance sheet position in which an increase in short term interest rates is expected to generate higher net interest income, as rates earned on our interest earning assets would reprice upward more quickly than rates paid on our interest bearing liabilities, thus expanding our net interest margin. Conversely, a liability sensitive position refers to a balance sheet position in which an increase in short term interest rates is expected to generate lower net interest income, as rates paid on our interest bearing liabilities would reprice upward more quickly than rates earned on our interest earning assets, thus compressing our net interest margin. INCOME SIMULATION AND ECONOMIC VALUE ANALYSIS Interest rate risk measurement is performed monthly. Two broad approaches to modeling interest rate risk are employed: income simulation and economic value analysis. An income simulation analysis is used to measure the sensitivity of forecasted net interest income to changes in market rates over a one year time period. Although bank owned life insurance, automobile operating lease assets, and excess cash balances held at the Federal Reserve Bank are classified as noninterest earning assets, and the net revenue from these assets is recorded in noninterest income and noninterest expense, these portfolios are included in the interest sensitivity analysis because they have attributes similar to interest earning assets. EVE analysis is used to measure the sensitivity of the values of period end assets and liabilities to changes in market interest rates. EVE analysis serves as a complement to income simulation modeling as it provides risk exposure estimates for time periods beyond the one year simulation period. The models used for these measurements take into account prepayment speeds on mortgage loans, mortgage backed securities, and consumer installment loans, as well as cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Balance sheet growth assumptions are also considered in the income simulation model. The models include the effects of derivatives, such as interest rate swaps, caps, floors, and other types of interest rate options. The baseline scenario for income simulation analysis, with which all other scenarios are compared, is based on market interest rates implied by the prevailing yield curve as of the period end. Alternative interest rate scenarios are then compared with the baseline scenario. These alternative interest rate scenarios include parallel rate shifts on both a gradual and an immediate basis, movements in interest rates that alter the shape of the yield curve (e.g., flatter or steeper yield curve), and no changes in current interest rates remaining unchanged for the entire measurement period. Scenarios are also developed to measure short term repricing risks, such as the impact of LIBOR based interest rates rising or falling faster than the prime rate. The simulations for evaluating short term interest rate risk exposure are scenarios that model gradual +/ 100 and +/ 200 basis points parallel shifts in market interest rates over the next one year period beyond the interest rate change implied by the current yield curve. We assumed market interest rates would not fall below 0% over the next one year period for the scenarios that used the 100 and 200 basis points parallel shift in 79 Table of Contents market interest rates. The table below shows the results of the scenarios as of December 31, 2010, and December 31, 2009. All of the positions were within the board of directors policy limits. Table 35 Net Interest Income at Risk Net Interest Income at Risk (%) Basis point change scenario 200 100 +100 +200 Board policy limits 4.0 % 2.0 % 2.0 % 4.0 % December 31, 2010 3.2 1.8 0.3 0.0 December 31, 2009 0.3 0.2 0.1 0.4 The net interest income at risk reported as of December 31, 2010 for the +200 basis points scenario shows a change to a neutral near term interest rate risk position compared with December 31, 2009. The primary factors contributing to this change are the decline in market interest rates over the course of 2010 along with growth in deposits and net free funds, offset by increases in fixed rate loans and securities and updated model assumptions. The following table shows the income sensitivity of select portfolios to changes in market interest rates. A portfolio with 100% sensitivity would indicate that interest income and expense will change with the same magnitude and direction as interest rates. A portfolio with 0% sensitivity is insensitive to changes in interest rates. For the +200 basis points scenario, total interest sensitive income is 34.6% sensitive to changes in market interest rates, while total interest sensitive expense is 43.8% sensitive to changes in market interest rates. However, net interest income at risk for the +200 basis points scenario has a neutral near term interest rate risk position because of the larger base of total interest sensitive income relative to total interest sensitive expense.

The table below outlines the December 31, 2010, results compared with December 31, 2009. All of the positions were within the board of directors policy limits. 80 Table of Contents Table 37 Economic Value of Equity at Risk Economic Value of Equity at Risk (%) Basis point change scenario 200 100 +100 +200 Board policy limits 12.0 % 5.0 % 5.0 % 12.0 % December 31, 2010 0.5 1.3 4.0 8.9 December 31, 2009 0.8 2.7 3.7 9.1 The EVE at risk reported as of December 31, 2010 for the +200 basis points scenario shows a change to a slightly lower long term liability sensitive position compared with December 31, 2009. The primary factors contributing to the change are the decline in market interest rates over the course of 2010 along with growth in deposits and net free funds, offset by increases in fixed rate loans, securities, and interest rate swaps used for asset liability management purposes. The following table shows the economic value sensitivity of select portfolios to changes in market interest rates. The change in economic value for each portfolio is measured as the percent change from the base economic value for that portfolio. For the +200 basis points scenario, total net tangible assets decreased in value 3.4% to changes in market interest rates, while total net tangible liabilities increased in value 2.5% to changes in market interest rates. EVE at risk for the +200 basis points scenario is liability sensitive because of the decrease in economic value of total net tangible assets, which reduces the EVE, and the increase in economic value of total net tangible liabilities, which also reduces the EVE.

At December 31, 2010, we had a total of $196.2 million of capitalized MSRs representing the right to service $15.9 billion in mortgage loans. Of this $196.2 million, $125.7 million was recorded using the fair value method, and $70.5 million was recorded using the amortization method. If we actively engage in hedging, the MSR asset is carried at fair value. MSR fair values are very sensitive to movements in interest rates as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans, which can be greatly reduced by prepayments. Prepayments usually increase when mortgage interest rates decline and decrease when mortgage interest rates rise. We have employed strategies to reduce the risk of MSR fair value changes or 81 Table of Contents impairment. In addition, we engage a third party to provide valuation tools and assistance with our strategies with the objective to decrease the volatility from MSR fair value changes. However, volatile changes in interest rates can diminish the effectiveness of these hedges. We typically report MSR fair value adjustments net of hedge related trading activity in the mortgage banking income category of noninterest income. Changes in fair value between reporting dates are recorded as an increase or a decrease in mortgage banking income. MSRs recorded using the amortization method generally relate to loans originated with historically low interest rates, resulting in a lower probability of prepayments and, ultimately, impairment. MSR assets are included in other assets and presented in Table 12. Price Risk Price risk represents the risk of loss arising from adverse movements in the prices of financial instruments that are carried at fair value and subject to fair value accounting. We have price risk from trading securities, securities owned by our broker dealer subsidiaries, foreign exchange positions, equity investments, investments in mortgage backed securities, and marketable equity securities held by our insurance subsidiaries. We have established loss limits on the trading portfolio, the amount of foreign exchange exposure that can be maintained, and the amount of marketable equity securities that can be held by the insurance subsidiaries. Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk of loss due to the possibility that funds may not be available to satisfy current or future commitments resulting from external macro market issues, investor and customer perception of financial strength, and events unrelated to us, such as war, terrorism, or financial institution market specific issues. We manage liquidity risk at both the Bank and the parent company. The overall objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure that we can obtain cost effective funding to meet current and future obligations, and can maintain sufficient levels of on hand liquidity, under both normal business as usual and unanticipated stressed circumstances. The ALCO was appointed by our Board Risk Oversight Committee to oversee liquidity risk management and establish policies and limits based upon analyses of the ratio of loans to deposits, liquid asset coverage ratios, the percentage of assets funded with noncore or wholesale funding, net cash capital, liquid assets, and emergency borrowing capacity. In addition, operating guidelines are established to ensure that bank loans included in the business segments are funded with core deposits. These operating guidelines also ensure diversification of noncore funding by type, source, and maturity and provide sufficient liquidity to cover 100% of wholesale funds maturing within a six month period. A contingency funding plan is in place, which includes forecasted sources and uses of funds under various scenarios in order to prepare for unexpected liquidity shortages, including the implications of any credit rating changes and / or other trigger events related to financial ratios, deposit fluctuations, debt issuance capacity, stock performance, or negative news related to us or the banking industry. Liquidity risk is reviewed monthly for the Bank and the parent company, as well as its subsidiaries. In addition, liquidity working groups meet regularly to identify and monitor liquidity positions, provide policy guidance, review funding strategies, and oversee the adherence to, and maintenance of, the contingency funding plans. A Contingency Funding Working Group monitors daily cash flow trends, branch activity, unfunded commitments, significant transactions, and parent company subsidiary sources and uses of funds in order to identify areas of concern and establish specific funding strategies. This group works closely with the ALCO and our communication team in order to identify issues that may require a more proactive communication plan to shareholders, employees, and customers regarding specific events or issues that could have an impact on our liquidity position. In the normal course of business, in order to better manage liquidity risk, we perform stress tests to determine the effect that a potential downgrade in our credit ratings or other market disruptions could have on liquidity over various time periods. These credit ratings have a direct impact on our cost of funds and ability to raise funds under normal, as well as adverse, circumstances. The results of these stress tests indicate that at December 31, 2010, sufficient sources of funds were available to meet our financial obligations and fund our operations for 2011. The stress test scenarios include testing to determine the impact of an interruption to our access to the national markets for funding, a significant run off in core deposits and liquidity triggers inherent 82 Table of Contents in other financial agreements. To compensate for the effect of these assumed liquidity pressures, we consider alternative sources of liquidity over different time periods to project how funding needs would be managed. The specific alternatives for enhancing liquidity include generating client deposits, securitizing or selling loans, selling or maturing of securities, and extending the level or maturity of wholesale borrowings. Most credit markets in which we participate and rely upon as sources of funding were significantly disrupted in mid 2007 through 2009 with an improving trend during 2010. Throughout 2008 and 2009, we strengthened our liquidity position by significantly reducing noncore funds and wholesale borrowings, increasing liquid assets, and shifting from a net purchaser of overnight federal funds to holding an excess reserve position at the Federal Reserve Bank. The percentage of assets funded with noncore or wholesale funding declined to 16% by the end of 2010 from 25% at 2008 year end. During 2010, the economy continued to stabilize and financial credit spreads tightened, resulting in a more liquid secondary market for our debt. In addition, all three major rating agencies upgraded both the Banks and the parent companys credit ratings and /or outlook resulting in a significantly lower rate on the $300.0 million of subordinated debt issued in December of 2010. Bank Liquidity and Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of funding for the Bank are retail and commercial core deposits. As of December 31, 2010, these core deposits funded 73% of total assets. At December 31, 2010, total core deposits represented 93% of total deposits, an increase from 92% at the prior year end. Core deposits are comprised of interest bearing and noninterest bearing demand deposits, money market deposits, savings and other domestic deposits, consumer certificates of deposit both over and under $250,000, and nonconsumer certificates of deposit less than $250,000. Noncore deposits consist of brokered money market deposits and certificates of deposit, foreign time deposits, and other domestic deposits of $250,000 or more comprised primarily of public fund certificates of deposit more than $250,000. Core deposits may increase our need for liquidity as certificates of deposit mature or are withdrawn before maturity and as nonmaturity deposits, such as checking and savings account balances, are withdrawn. We voluntarily began participating in the FDICs TAGP in October of 2008. Under this program, all noninterest bearing and interest bearing transaction accounts with a rate of less than 0.50% were fully guaranteed by the FDIC for a customers entire account balance. In April of 2010, the FDIC adopted an interim rule extending the TAGP through December 31, 2010, for financial institutions that desired to continue participating in the TAGP. On April 30, 2010, we notified the FDIC of our decision to opt out of the TAGP extension effective July 1, 2010. Demand deposit overdrafts that have been reclassified as loan balances were $13.1 million and $40.4 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Other domestic time deposits of $250,000 or more and brokered deposits and negotiable CDs totaled $2.2 billion at the end of 2010 and $2.7 billion at the end of 2009. The contractual maturities of these deposits at December 31, 2010, were as follows: $0.8 billion in three months or less, $0.3 billion in three months through six months, $0.5 billion in six months through twelve months, and $0.6 billion after twelve months. 83 Table of Contents The following table reflects deposit composition detail for each of the past five years.

These sources include other domestic deposits of $250,000 or more, brokered deposits and negotiable CDs, deposits in foreign offices, short term borrowings, FHLB advances, other long term debt, and subordinated notes. At December 31, 2010, total wholesale funding was $8.4 billion, an increase from $7.8 billion at December 31, 2009. The $8.4 billion portfolio at December 31, 2010, had a weighted average maturity of 4.2 years. The Bank has access to the Federal Reserve Banks discount window. These borrowings are secured by commercial loans and home equity lines of credit. The Bank is also a member of the FHLB, and as such, has access to advances from this facility. These advances are generally secured by residential mortgages, other mortgage related loans, and available for sale securities. Information regarding amounts pledged, for the ability 84 Table of Contents to borrow if necessary, and unused borrowing capacity at both the Federal Reserve Bank and the FHLB is outlined in the following table: Table 40 Federal Reserve Bank and FHLB Cincinnati Borrowing Capacity December 31, 2010 2009 (Dollar amounts in billions) Loans and Securities Pledged: Federal Reserve Bank $ 9.7 $ 8.5 FHLB 7.8 8.0 Total loans and securities pledged $ 17.5 $ 16.5 Total unused borrowing capacity at Federal Reserve Bank and FHLB $ 8.8 $ 7.9 We can also obtain funding through other methods including: (1) purchasing federal funds, (2) selling securities under repurchase agreements, (3) selling or maturity of investment securities, (4) selling or securitization of loans, (5) selling of national market certificates of deposit, (6) the relatively shorter term structure of our commercial loans (see tables below) and automobile loans, and (7) issuing of common and preferred stock. At December 31, 2010, we believe the Bank had sufficient liquidity to meet its cash flow obligations for the foreseeable future.

The composition and maturity of these securities were presented in Table 32. Parent Company Liquidity The parent companys funding requirements consist primarily of dividends to shareholders, debt service, income taxes, operating expenses, funding of nonbank subsidiaries, repurchases of our stock, and acquisitions. The parent company obtains funding to meet obligations from dividends received from direct subsidiaries, net taxes collected from subsidiaries included in the federal consolidated tax return, fees for services provided to subsidiaries, and the issuance of debt securities. During the 2010 fourth quarter, we completed a public offering and sale of 146.0 million shares of common stock at a price of $6.30 per share, or $920.0 million in aggregate gross proceeds. Also during the 2010 fourth quarter, we completed the public offering and sale of $300.0 million aggregate principal amount 85 Table of Contents of 7.00% Subordinated Notes due 2020. We used the net proceeds from these transactions to repurchase our TARP Capital (see Capital section). On January 19, 2011, we repurchased the warrant the Company had issued to the Treasury at an agreed upon purchase price of $49.1 million. The warrant had entitled the Treasury to purchase 23.6 million shares of common stock. During 2010, the parent company contributed $0.4 billion of capital to the Bank, which increased the Banks regulatory capital levels above its already Well capitalized levels. At December 31, 2010, the parent company had $0.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents, compared with $1.4 billion at December 31, 2009. The decrease primarily reflected the net impact of the equity and debt public offerings, the repurchase of our TARP Capital, additional capital contributions made by the parent company to the Bank, and dividend payments on our common and preferred stock. Appropriate limits and guidelines are in place to ensure the parent company has sufficient cash to meet operating expenses and other commitments during 2011 without relying on subsidiaries or capital markets for funding. Based on the current dividend of $0.01 per common share, cash demands required for common stock dividends are estimated to be approximately $8.6 million per quarter. Based on the current dividend, cash demands required for Series A Preferred Stock are estimated to be approximately $7.7 million per quarter. Based on a regulatory dividend limitation, the Bank could not have declared and paid a dividend to the parent company at December 31, 2010, without regulatory approval. We do not anticipate that the Bank will request regulatory approval to pay dividends in the near future as we continue to build Bank regulatory capital above its already Well capitalized level. To help meet any additional liquidity needs, we have an open ended, automatic shelf registration statement filed and effective with the SEC, which permits us to issue an unspecified amount of debt or equity securities. With the exception of the common and preferred dividends previously discussed, the parent company does not have any significant cash demands. There are no maturities of parent company obligations until 2013, when a debt maturity of $50.0 million is payable. Considering the factors discussed above, and other analyses that we have performed, we believe the parent company has sufficient liquidity to meet its cash flow obligations for the foreseeable future. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, we enter into various off balance sheet arrangements. These arrangements include financial guarantees contained in standby letters of credit issued by the Bank and commitments by the Bank to sell mortgage loans. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. These guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing, and similar transactions. Most of these arrangements mature within two years and are expected to expire without being drawn upon. Standby letters of credit are included in the determination of the amount of risk based capital that the parent company and the Bank are required to hold. Through our credit process, we monitor the credit risks of outstanding standby letters of credit. When it is probable that a standby letter of credit will be drawn and not repaid in full, losses are recognized in the provision for credit losses. At December 31, 2010, we had $0.6 billion of standby letters of credit outstanding, of which 73% were collateralized. Included in this $0.6 billion total are letters of credit issued by the Bank that support securities that were issued by our customers and remarketed by the Huntington Investment Company, our broker dealer subsidiary. We enter into forward contracts relating to the mortgage banking business to hedge the exposures we have from commitments to extend new residential mortgage loans to our customers and from our mortgage loans held for sale. At December 31, 2010, and December 31, 2009, we had commitments to sell residential real estate loans of $998.7 million and $662.9 million, respectively. These contracts mature in less than one year. 86 Table of Contents Effective January 1, 2010, we consolidated an automobile loan securitization that previously had been accounted for as an off balance sheet transaction. We elected to account for the automobile loan receivables and the associated notes payable at fair value per accounting guidance supplied in ASC 810 Consolidation. (See Note 2 and Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) We do not believe that off balance sheet arrangements will have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources.

Operational Risk As with all companies, we are subject to operational risk. Operational risk is the risk of loss due to human error; inadequate or failed internal systems and controls; violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices, or ethical standards; and external influences such as market conditions, fraudulent activities, disasters, and security risks. We continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to ensure compliance with laws, rules, and regulations, and to improve the oversight of our operational risk. To mitigate operational risks, we have established a senior management Operational Risk Committee and a senior management Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance Committee. The responsibilities of these committees, among other duties, include establishing and maintaining management information systems to monitor material risks and to identify potential concerns, risks, or trends that may have a significant impact and ensuring that recommendations are developed to address the identified issues. Both of these committees report any significant findings and recommendations to the Risk Management Committee. Additionally, potential concerns may be escalated to our Board Risk Oversight Committee, as appropriate. The goal of this framework is to implement effective operational risk techniques and strategies, minimize operational and fraud losses, and enhance our overall performance. Representation and Warranty Reserve We primarily conduct our loan sale and securitization activity with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In connection with these and other securitization transactions, we make certain representations and warranties that the loans meet certain criteria, such as collateral type and underwriting standards. We may be required to repurchase individual loans and / or indemnify these organizations against losses due to a loan not meeting the established criteria. We have a reserve for such losses, which is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The reserves were estimated based on historical and expected repurchase activity, average loss rates, and current economic trends, including an increase in the amount of repurchase losses in recent quarters. 87 Table of Contents The table below reflects activity in the representations and warranties reserve for each of the last three years: Table 43 Summary of Reserve for Representations and Warranties on Mortgage Loans Serviced for Others Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (Dollar amounts in thousands) Reserve for representations and warranties, beginning of year $ 5,916 $ 5,270 $ 2,934 Acquired reserve for representations and warranties 7,000 Reserve charges (9,012 ) (2,516 ) (3,586 ) Provision for representations and warranties 16,267 3,162 5,922 Reserve for representations and warranties, end of year $ 20,171 $ 5,916 $ 5,270 Foreclosure Documentation In light of recent announcements regarding alleged irregularities in the mortgage loan foreclosure processes of certain high volume loan servicers, state law enforcement authorities, the United States Department of Justice, and other federal agencies have stated they are investigating mortgage servicers foreclosure practices, and private litigation over such practices has begun to appear in the courts. Those investigations, as well as any other governmental or regulatory scrutiny of foreclosure processes and private litigation, could result in fines, penalties, damages, or other equitable remedies and result in significant legal costs in responding to possible governmental investigations and litigation. Compared to the high volume servicers, we service a relatively low volume of residential mortgage foreclosures, with approximately 3,100 foreclosure cases as of December 31, 2010, in states that require foreclosures to proceed through the courts. In response to industry wide issues involving mortgage loan foreclosure irregularities, we conducted a review in October 2010 of our residential foreclosure process, focusing on the accuracy of completed foreclosure affidavits in pending foreclosure proceedings and the steps taken by us to ensure this documentation was properly reviewed and validated prior to filing the affidavit in the foreclosure proceeding. As a result of our review, we have determined that we do not have any significant issues relating to so called robo signing, and that foreclosure affidavits were completed and signed by employees with personal knowledge of the contents of the affidavits. There is no reason to conclude that foreclosures were filed that should not have been filed. Additionally, we have identified and are strengthening processes and controls to ensure that affidavits are prepared in compliance with applicable state law. We consult with local foreclosure counsel, as necessary, with respect to additional requirements imposed by the courts in which foreclosure proceedings are pending. Compliance Risk Financial institutions are subject to a myriad of laws, rules and regulations emanating at both the Federal and State levels. These mandates cover a broad scope, including but not limited to, expectations on anti money laundering, lending limits, client privacy, fair lending, community reinvestment and other important areas. Recently, the volume and complexity of regulatory changes adds to the overall compliance risk. At Huntington, we take these mandates seriously and have invested in people, processes and systems to help ensure we meet expectations. At the corporate level we have a team of compliance experts and lawyers dedicated to ensuring our conformance. We provide, and require, training for our colleagues on a number of broad based laws and regulations. For example, all of our employees are expected to take, and pass, courses on anti money laundering and customer privacy. Those who are engaged in lending activities must also take training related to flood disaster protection, equal credit opportunity, fair lending and / or a variety of other courses related to the extension of credit. We set a high standard of expectation for adherence to compliance management and seek to continuously enhance our performance in this regard. 88 Table of Contents Capital (This section should be read in conjunction with Significant Items 1 and 5, and Notes 12 and 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) Capital is managed both at the Bank and on a consolidated basis. Capital levels are maintained based on regulatory capital requirements and the economic capital required to support credit, market, liquidity, and operational risks inherent in our business, and to provide the flexibility needed for future growth and new business opportunities. Shareholders equity totaled $5.0 billion at December 31, 2010. This represented a $0.4 billion decrease compared with December 31, 2009, primarily reflecting the repurchase of all 1.4 million shares of TARP Capital held by the Treasury as part of our participation in the TARP CPP, offset by the $920.0 million common stock issuance and 2010 earnings. We believe our current level of capital is adequate. TARP Capital During 2008, we received $1.4 billion of equity capital by issuing to the Treasury: (1) 1.4 million shares of TARP Capital and, (2) a ten year warrant to purchase up to 23.6 million shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share, at an exercise price of $8.90 per share. Upon receipt of the TARP Capital in 2008, the proceeds were allocated to the preferred stock and additional paid in capital. During the period of time that we held the TARP Capital, the resulting discount was amortized which resulted in additional dilution to our earnings per share. The TARP Capital was not a component of Tier 1 common equity. In the 2010 fourth quarter, we issued $920.0 million of common stock and $300.0 million of 7.00% subordinated notes due in 2020. The net proceeds of these issuances, along with other funds, were used to repurchase all $1.4 billion of the TARP Capital. The accretion of the remaining issuance discount on the TARP Capital was accelerated, and a corresponding reduction to retained earnings of $56.3 million was recorded. Subsequently, on January 19, 2011, we exited our TARP related relationship by repurchasing the ten year warrant we had issued to the Treasury as part of the TARP CPP for $49.1 million. 89 Table of Contents Capital Adequacy The following table presents risk weighted assets and other financial data necessary to calculate certain financial ratios, including the Tier 1 common equity ratio, which we use to measure capital adequacy: Table 44 Capital Adequacy December 31, 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 (Dollar amounts in millions) Consolidated capital calculations: Common shareholders equity $ 4,618 $ 3,648 $ 5,351 $ 5,951 $ 3,016 Preferred shareholders equity 363 1,688 1,878 Total shareholders equity 4,981 5,336 7,229 5,951 3,016 Goodwill (444 ) (444 ) (3,055 ) (3,059 ) (571 ) Intangible assets (229 ) (289 ) (357 ) (428 ) (59 ) Intangible asset deferred tax liability(1) 80 101 125 150 21 Total tangible equity(2) 4,388 4,704 3,942 2,614 2,407 Preferred shareholders equity (363 ) (1,688 ) (1,878 ) Total tangible common equity(2) $ 4,025 $ 3,016 $ 2,064 $ 2,614 $ 2,407 Total assets $ 53,820 $ 51,555 $ 54,353 $ 54,697 $ 35,329 Goodwill (444 ) (444 ) (3,055 ) (3,059 ) (571 ) Other intangible assets (229 ) (289 ) (357 ) (428 ) (59 ) Intangible asset deferred tax liability(1) 80 101 125 150 21 Total tangible assets(2) $ 53,227 $ 50,923 $ 51,066 $ 51,360 $ 34,720 Tier 1 equity $ 5,022 $ 5,201 $ 5,036 $ 3,460 $ 2,784 Preferred shareholders equity (363 ) (1,688 ) (1,878 ) Trust preferred securities (570 ) (570 ) (736 ) (785 ) (320 ) REIT preferred stock (50 ) (50 ) (50 ) (50 ) (50 ) Tier 1 common equity(2) $ 4,039 $ 2,893 $ 2,372 $ 2,625 $ 2,414 Risk weighted assets (RWA) $ 43,471 $ 43,248 $ 46,994 $ 46,044 $ 31,155 Tier 1 common equity / RWA ratio(2) 9.29 % 6.69 % 5.05 % 5.70 % 7.75 % Tangible equity / tangible asset ratio(2) 8.24 9.24 7.72 5.09 6.93 Tangible common equity / tangible asset ratio(2) 7.56 5.92 4.04 5.09 6.93 Tangible common equity / RWA ratio(2) 9.26 6.97 4.39 5.68 7.73 (1) Intangible assets are net of deferred tax liability and calculated assuming a 35% tax rate. (2) Tangible equity, Tier 1 common equity, tangible common equity, and tangible assets are non GAAP financial measures. Additionally, any ratios utilizing these financial measures are also non GAAP. These financial measures have been included as they are considered to be critical metrics with which to analyze and evaluate financial condition and capital strength. Other companies may calculate these financial measures differently. Our consolidated TCE ratio was 7.56% at December 31, 2010, an increase from 5.92% at December 31, 2009. The significant increase from December 31, 2009, primarily reflected the increased capital resulting from our $920.0 million common stock issuance during the 2010 fourth quarter, and to a lesser extent, 2010 earnings. 90 Table of Contents Regulatory Capital Regulatory capital ratios are the primary metrics used by regulators in assessing the safety and soundness of banks. We intend to maintain both our and the Banks risk based capital ratios at levels at which both would be considered Well capitalized by regulators. The Bank is primarily supervised and regulated by the OCC, which establishes regulatory capital guidelines for banks similar to those established for bank holding companies by the Federal Reserve Board. Regulatory capital primarily consists of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital. The sum of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital equals our total risk based capital. The following table reflects changes and activity to the various components utilized in the calculation of our consolidated Tier 1, Tier 2, and total risk based capital amounts during 2010.

The primary drivers of the decline in Tier 1 Capital were the $1.4 billion repurchase of TARP Capital, offset by the $0.9 billion common stock issuance and $0.3 billion of earnings in 2010. Our total risk based capital ratio was little changed as the decline in Tier 1 capital was offset by an increase in Tier 2 capital. The change in Tier 2 capital primarily reflected our $0.3 billion subordinated debt issuance. The Banks Tier 1 risk based capital ratios improved, reflecting an increase in Tier 1 capital, primarily due to an increase in retained earnings (see Parent Company Liquidity discussion). The repurchase of the TARP Capital did not affect the Banks capital ratios. At December 31, 2010, our Tier 1 and total risk based capital in excess of the minimum level required to be considered Well capitalized were $2.4 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. The Bank had Tier 1 and Total risk based capital in excess of the minimum level required to be considered Well capitalized of $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2010. Other Capital Matters In 2010, shareholders passed a proposal to amend our charter resulting in an increase of authorized common stock to 1.5 billion shares from 1.0 billion shares. No shares were repurchased during 2010. BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSION Overview For detail on each segments objectives, strategies, and priorities, please read this section in conjunction with the Item 1: Business section. This section reviews financial performance from a business segment perspective and should be read in conjunction with the Discussion of Results of Operations, Note 25 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, and other sections for a full understanding of our consolidated financial performance. During the 2010 fourth quarter, we reorganized our business segments to better align certain business unit reporting with segment executives in order to accelerate cross sell results and provide greater focus on the execution of strategic plans. We have four major business segments: Retail and Business Banking; Commercial Banking; Automobile Finance and Commercial Real Estate; and Wealth Advisors, Government Finance, and Home Lending. A Treasury / Other function includes our insurance business, and other unallocated assets, liabilities, revenue, and expense. All periods presented have been reclassified to conform to the current period classification. 92 Table of Contents Business segment results are determined based upon our management reporting system, which assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each of the business segments. The process is designed around our organizational and management structure and, accordingly, the results derived are not necessarily comparable with similar information published by other financial institutions. Funds Transfer Pricing We use an active and centralized FTP methodology to attribute appropriate net interest income to the business segments. The intent of the FTP methodology is to eliminate all interest rate risk from the business segments by providing matched duration funding of assets and liabilities. The result is to centralize the financial impact, management, and reporting of interest rate and liquidity risk in the Treasury / Other function where it can be centrally monitored and managed. The Treasury / Other function charges (credits) an internal cost of funds for assets held in (or pays for funding provided by) each business segment. The FTP rate is based on prevailing market interest rates for comparable duration assets (or liabilities), and includes an estimate for the cost of liquidity (liquidity premium). Deposits of an indeterminate maturity receive an FTP credit based on a combination of vintage based average lives and replicating portfolio pool rates. Other assets, liabilities, and capital are charged (credited) with a four year moving average FTP rate. The denominator in the net interest margin calculation has been modified to add the amount of net funds provided by each business segment for all periods presented. Revenue Sharing Revenue is recorded in the business segment responsible for the related product or service. Fee sharing is recorded to allocate portions of such revenue to other business segments involved in selling to, or providing service to, customers. The most significant revenues for which fee sharing is allocated relate to customer derivatives and brokerage services, which are recorded by WGH and shared primarily with Retail and Business Banking and Commercial Banking. Results of operations for the business segments reflect these fee sharing allocations. Expense Allocation The management accounting process that develops the business segment reporting utilizes various estimates and allocation methodologies to measure the performance of the business segments. Expenses are allocated to business segments using a two phase approach. The first phase consists of measuring and assigning unit costs (activity based costs) to activities related to product origination and servicing. These activity based costs are then extended, based on volumes, with the resulting amount allocated to business segments that own the related products. The second phase consists of the allocation of overhead costs to all four business segments from Treasury / Other. We utilize a full allocation methodology, where all Treasury / Other expenses, except those related to our insurance business, servicing Franklin related assets, reported Significant Items (except for the goodwill impairment), and a small amount of other residual unallocated expenses, are allocated to the four business segments. Treasury / Other The Treasury / Other function includes revenue and expense related to our insurance business, and assets, liabilities, and equity not directly assigned or allocated to one of the four business segments. Assets include investment securities, bank owned life insurance, and the loans and OREO properties acquired through the 2009 first quarter Franklin restructuring. The financial impact associated with our FTP methodology, as described above, is also included. Net interest income includes the impact of administering our investment securities portfolios and the net impact of derivatives used to hedge interest rate sensitivity. Noninterest income includes insurance income, miscellaneous fee income not allocated to other business segments, such as bank owned life insurance income and any investment security and trading asset gains or losses. Noninterest expense includes any insurance related expenses, as well as certain corporate administrative, merger, and other miscellaneous expenses not 93 Table of Contents allocated to other business segments. The provision for income taxes for the business segments is calculated at a statutory 35% tax rate, though our overall effective tax rate is lower. As a result, Treasury / Other reflects a credit for income taxes representing the difference between the lower actual effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate used to allocate income taxes to the business segments. Net Income by Business Segment The segregation of net income by business segment for the past three years is presented in the following table: Table 47 Net Income (Loss) by Business Segment Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (Dollar amounts in thousands) Retail and Business Banking $ 131,036 $ (26,479 ) $ 257,844 Commercial Banking 38,462 (158,736 ) 80,313 AFCRE 46,492 (588,154 ) (14,158 ) WGH 34,801 1,743 42,994 Treasury / Other 61,556 251,265 (480,799 ) Unallocated goodwill impairment(1) (2,573,818 ) Total net income (loss) $ 312,347 $ (3,094,179 ) $ (113,806 ) (1) Represents the 2009 first quarter impairment charge, net of tax, associated with the former Regional Banking business segment.

As discussed further below, the $157.5 million increase included a $312.2 million, or 66%, decline in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by a $105.5 million, or 13%, increase in noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $56.4 million, or 7%, primarily reflecting a $1.2 billion increase in average total deposits, a 19 basis point improvement in our deposit spread, and a 7% increase in the number of DDA households. These increases were the result of increased marketing initiatives in 2010 and sales efforts throughout 2009 and 2010, particularly in our checking and money market deposit products. The $0.6 billion, or 5%, decline in total average loans and leases primarily reflected small business and consumer loan sales. Provision for credit losses declined $312.2 million, or 66%, reflecting lower NCOs, a $0.6 billion decrease in related average loans and leases, and an improvement in delinquencies. NCOs declined $37.9 million, or 12%, and reflected a $102.5 million decline in total small business NCOs partially offset by 96 Table of Contents a $64.6 million, or 40%, increase in total consumer NCOs. The decrease in NCOs reflected a lower level of large dollar NCOs, an improvement in delinquencies, and an improved credit environment. Noninterest income decreased $20.8 million, or 5%, reflecting a $35.7 million decline in deposit service charges resulting from the amendment to Reg E, the voluntary reduction or elimination of NSF / OD fees, a decline in the number of customers overdrafting their accounts, and our new 24 Hour Gracetm feature, reflecting our Fair Play banking philosophy. The decrease was partially offset by: (1) $9.9 million increase in electronic banking income, primarily reflecting an increased number of deposit accounts and transaction volumes, (2) $3.2 million increase in mortgage banking income, and (3) $2.0 million increase in brokerage and insurance income. Noninterest expense increased $105.5 million, or 13%. This increase reflected: (1) $37.2 million of higher allocated expenses, (2) $31.4 million increase in marketing expense related to brand and product advertising, direct mail, and branch refurbishments, (3) $29.9 million increase in personnel expense, reflecting a 12% increase in full time equivalent employees associated with strategic initiatives, the re instatement of certain employee benefits such as a 401(k) plan matching contribution, merit increases, and bonus compensation, and (4) $18.8 million increase in deposit and other insurance expense reflecting increased premiums due to higher assessment rates and higher deposit balances. These increases were partially offset by a $9.8 million improvement in OREO losses. 2009 versus 2008 Retail and Business Banking reported a net loss of $26.5 million in 2009, compared with net income of $257.8 million in 2008. The $284.3 million decline reflected a $273.9 million increase to the provision for credit losses. This increase reflected a $191.1 million increase in NCOs due to the impact of the overall weakened economy across all of our regions. Also contributing to the decline in net income was: (1) $48.8 million reduction in net interest income, primarily reflecting a 39 basis point decline in net interest margin, and (2) $121.0 million increase in noninterest expense primarily resulting from an increase in deposit and other insurance expense, as well as OREO and foreclosure expense.

Not relevant, as denominator of calculation is a loss in prior period compared with income in current period. 97 Table of Contents 2010 versus 2009 Commercial Banking reported net income of $38.5 million in 2010, compared with a net loss of $158.7 million in 2009. This $197.2 million improvement reflected a $289.3 million decline in provision for credit losses. The increased earnings also reflected significant improvement in our net interest income and noninterest income due to the successful execution of our strategic initiatives. This investment is reflected in higher noninterest expense and an increased number of employees within the segment. Net interest income increased $20.6 million, or 11%, primarily reflecting a 43 basis point increase in the net interest margin, partially offset by a $0.7 billion, or 9%, decline in average total loans. This increase in the net interest margin was almost entirely reflective of the 35 basis point improvement in our commercial loan spread as a result of strategic pricing decisions. Average total loans declined $0.7 billion, or 9%, primarily reflecting paydowns, lower line of credit utilization. We have experienced higher runoff in our commercial loan portfolio as many customers have actively reduced their leverage position. Although this has resulted in a decline in our average total loans for the year, originations increased in the 2010 fourth quarter. The increased originations have been the result of our investments in new markets and in new vertical strategies (i.e. New England market and equipment finance verticals). Total average deposits increased $0.1 billion, or 5%, reflecting a $0.6 billion increase in core deposits, offset by a $0.5 billion decline in noncore deposits. The increase in core deposits primarily reflected (1) $0.2 billion increase in commercial demand deposits, and (2) $0.3 billion increase in commercial savings and money market deposits. These increases were primarily a result of strategic efforts to improve our sales and servicing functions, as well as initiatives designed to deepen customer relationships. The decrease in noncore deposits primarily reflected a $0.3 billion reduction in brokered and negotiable deposits due to continued planned portfolio runoff. Provision for credit losses declined $289.3 million, or 73%, reflecting the lower level of related loan balances, as well as a $196.6 million decline in NCOs. Expressed as a percentage of related average balances, NCOs decreased to 0.89% from 3.24%. The decline in NCOs was primarily driven by $158.3 million lower CI NCOs and $38.6 million lower CRE NCOs. The overall decline in NCOs was the result of aggressive treatment of the portfolio over the past 18 months, an improved credit environment, and an increase in recoveries. Noninterest income increased $15.5 million, or 16%, and primarily reflected: (1) $5.8 million in trading and derivative revenue, (2) $4.8 million in foreign exchange income resulting from strategic investments over the past year in foreign exchange products and services, (3) $4.7 million increase in loan commitment fee income primarily due to our higher originations and execution of key strategic initiatives, and (4) $2.9 million increase of loan related fees relating to the improved collection of such fees from customers. These increases were partially offset by a $4.0 million decline in equipment operating lease income as lease originations were structured as direct finance leases beginning in the 2009 second quarter. Noninterest expense increased $22.0 million, or 16%, and reflected: (1) $20.7 million increase in personnel expense reflecting a 15% increase in full time equivalent employees, due to investments in strategically focused growth markets, vertical strategies, and product capabilities, (2) $1.4 million of higher allocated expenses, and (3) $1.9 million increase in deposit and other insurance expense reflecting increased premiums due to higher assessment rates and higher deposit balances. These increases were partially offset by a $3.2 million decrease in equipment operating lease expense reflecting the change in structuring of lease obligations effective with the 2009 second quarter. 2009 versus 2008 Commercial Banking reported a net loss of $158.7 million in 2009, compared with net income of $80.3 million in 2008. The decline reflected a $291.4 million increase to the provision for credit losses. This increase to the provision for credit losses reflected: (1) the continued economic weaknesses in our markets, (2) an increase of commercial reserves resulting from credit actions taken during 2009, and (3) $187.2 million 98 Table of Contents increase in NCOs. Also contributing to the decline in net income was a $88.1 million reduction in net interest income, primarily reflecting a 105 basis point decline in the net interest margin.

Not relevant, as denominator of calculation is a loss in prior period compared with income in current period. 2010 vs. 2009 AFCRE reported net income of $46.5 million in 2010, compared with a net loss of $588.2 million in 2009. Net income for the automobile finance business was $76.9 million in 2010 compared to $10.7 million in 2009 while the commercial real estate business incurred a net loss of $30.4 million in 2010 compared to a net loss of $598.9 million in 2009. The $634.6 million increase in net income reflected a $911.3 million decline in the provision for credit losses, primarily due to a reduction in reserves as the underlying credit quality of the loan portfolios continues to improve and / or stabilize. The comparable year ago period included higher provisions for credit losses to increase reserves due to economic and commercial real estate and automobile industry related weaknesses in our markets. Total NCOs declined $320.5 million, or 48%, including a $323.1 million decline in CRE loan NCOs and a $29.5 million decline in automobile loan and lease related NCOs. This was partially offset by an increase in CI NCOs of $33.5 million. 99 Table of Contents Net interest income increased $60.9 million, or 22%, reflecting a 47 basis point increase in the net interest margin. Average total loans were essentially unchanged. The net interest margin increase primarily reflected the implementation of a risk based pricing strategy in CRE portfolio lending that began in early 2009. Average total loans reflected a $1.6 billion increase in average consumer automobile loans that resulted from record loan origination levels, as well as the consolidation of previously unconsolidated automobile loan trust (see below). These increases were partially offset by a $1.2 billion decline in average CRE loans resulting from the aggressive management of this portfolio and our on going commitment to reducing our noncore CRE portfolio. On January 1, 2010, we adopted a new accounting standard to consolidate a previously off balance sheet automobile loan securitization transaction. At the end of the 2009 first quarter, we transferred $1.0 billion of automobile loans to a trust in a securitization transaction that was part of a funding strategy. At the time of the consolidation, the trust was holding $0.8 billion of loans and we elected to account for these loans, as well as the underlying debt, at fair value. At December 31, 2010, these loans had a remaining balance of $0.5 billion. Average total deposits increased $0.1 billion, or 21%, reflecting our commitment to strengthening relationships with core customers and prospects, as well as new commercial automobile dealer relationships developed in 2010. Noninterest income, excluding operating lease income, increased $15.9 million. Results for 2009 included a $5.9 million nonrecurring loss from the securitization transaction and a $0.7 million nonrecurring gain from the sale of related securities. In addition, results for 2010 included a $4.0 million net gain resulting from valuation adjustments of the loans and associated notes payable held by the consolidated trust discussed above, a $5.7 million improvement in fee income from derivative trading activities, and a $3.1 million increase in CRE loan fees. Partially offsetting these increases was a $3.9 million decrease in servicing income also attributed to the automobile securitization trust consolidation. Noninterest expense, excluding operating lease expense, increased $12.1 million. This increase reflected a $6.6 million increase in personnel expense, much of which related to increased loan origination activities, including the rebuilding of the commercial real estate team, and a $1.4 million increase in allocated costs primarily related to higher production and other activity levels. Also, commercial real estate credit related expenses (e.g. appraisals, loan collections, taxes, and OREO expenses) increased $6.2 million. These increases were partially offset by a $4.7 million decrease in losses associated with sales of vehicles returned at the end of their lease terms, as used vehicle values throughout 2010 have been at higher relative levels and the number of vehicles being returned has declined compared to the year ago period. Net automobile operating lease income increased $0.5 million, reflecting lower depreciation expense attributed to improvement in estimated vehicle residual values. Net automobile operating lease income is expected to decline in future periods as a result of the discontinuation of all lease origination activities in 2008 and the resulting continued runoff of the automobile operating lease portfolio. 2009 vs. 2008 AFCRE reported a net loss of $588.2 million in 2009, compared with a net loss of $14.2 million in 2008. The provision for credit losses increased $811.3 million reflecting: (1) economic weaknesses in our markets, (2) an increase in commercial reserves resulting from credit actions taken during 2009, and (3) a $566.4 million increase in NCOs, also reflecting the impact of economic conditions on our borrowers. Net interest income declined $74.9 million reflecting both a decline in average loan balances and a 47 basis point decrease in the net interest margin. The decrease in the net interest margin resulted from changes in funding cost allocation methodologies as well as the impact of increased NALs. The decline in loan balances was primarily due to the 2009 securitization transaction. Noninterest income (excluding operating lease income of $51.8 million during 2009 and $39.8 million in 2008) decreased $12.2 million reflecting a $5.9 million nonrecurring loss from the 2009 securitization transaction as well as declines in various other fee generating activities, much of which was attributed to adverse market conditions. Noninterest expense (excluding operating lease expense of $43.4 million in 2009 100 Table of Contents and $31.3 million in 2008) decreased $15.4 million primarily reflecting a $22.4 million reduction in losses associated with the sale of vehicles returned at the end of their lease terms. Also, personnel and various other expenses declined as a result of expense reduction initiatives. These declines were offset in part by an increase in allocated corporate and other overhead expenses due to changes in allocation methodologies.

The $33.1 million improvement reflected a $50.9 million increase in pretax income, partially offset by a $17.8 million increase in income taxes. The primary reason for the increase in pretax income was a $33.0 million lower provision for credit losses in 2010 driven mostly by $22.6 million lower NCOs. Mortgage banking income increased by $57.8 million due to both an improved market for mortgage loan originations and sales in 2010, and to favorable results from WGHs MSR hedging activities. Trust services and brokerage income increased by $9.4 million and $5.5 million reflecting higher levels of sales. Increased noninterest income of $70.9 million was partially offset by $57.9 million higher noninterest expenses due to investments in strategic initiatives and a higher level of FDIC deposit insurance premiums due to higher assessment rates and higher deposit balances. Average total deposits increased $1.1 billion, or 19%. A substantial portion of the deposit growth resulted from the introduction of three deposit products during 2009 and a fourth during 2010 designed as alternative options for lower yielding money market mutual funds. The new deposit products were: (1) the Huntington 101 Table of Contents Conservative Deposit Account, (2) the Huntington Protected Deposit Account, (3) the Collateral Backed Deposit Account, and (4) the Bank Deposit Sweep Product. These four deposit products had balances in excess of $1.2 billion at December 31, 2010. 2009 vs. 2008 WGH reported net income of $1.7 million in 2009, a $41.3 million decline compared with 2008. The provision for credit losses increased by $92.6 million, reflecting an $81.4 million increase in NCOs, including a $58.3 million increase in residential mortgage NCOs. Credit quality was stressed during 2009 consistent with economic conditions in the Companys markets. Mortgage banking income increased $100.5 million due to more favorable lending conditions in the first half of 2009. Partially offsetting that increase, trust services declined $21.4 million, net interest income was $24.9 million lower, and noninterest expense was $27.0 million higher. Average total loans decreased $0.5 billion, or 9%, primarily reflecting residential mortgage sales during 2009. RESULTS FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER Earnings Discussion In the 2010 fourth quarter, we reported net income of $122.9 million, or $0.05 per common share, compared with a net loss of $369.7 million, or $0.56 per common share, in the year ago quarter. Significant items impacting 2010 fourth quarter performance included (see table below): Table 53 Significant Items Influencing Earnings Performance Comparison Impact(1) After tax EPS(2) (Dollar amounts in millions, except per share amounts) Three Months Ended: December 31, 2010 GAAP income $ 122.9 $ 0.05 Preferred stock conversion deemed dividend (0.07 ) December 31, 2009 GAAP loss $ (369.7 ) $ (0.56 ) Gain on the early extinguishment of debt 73.6 0.07 Deferred tax valuation allowance benefit 11.3 (2) 0.02 (1) Favorable (unfavorable) impact on GAAP earnings; pretax unless otherwise noted. (2) After tax. EPS is reflected on a fully diluted basis. Net Interest Income / Average Balance Sheet FTE net interest income increased $42.4 million, or 11%, from the year ago quarter. This reflected the favorable impact of the significant increase in the net interest margin to 3.37% from 3.19%. This also reflected the benefit of a $2.4 billion, or 5%, increase in average total earning assets due to a $1.4 billion, or 15%, increase in average total investment securities, and a $0.7 billion, or 2%, increase in average total loans and leases. 102 Table of Contents The following table presents the $0.7 billion, or 2%, increase in average loans and leases. Table 54 Average Loans/Leases 2010 Fourth Quarter vs. 2009 Fourth Quarter Fourth Quarter Change 2010 2009 Amount Percent (Dollar amounts in millions) Average Loans/Leases Commercial and industrial $ 12,767 $ 12,570 $ 197 2 % Commercial real estate 6,798 8,458 (1,660 ) (20 ) Total commercial 19,565 21,028 (1,463 ) (7 ) Automobile loans and leases 5,520 3,326 2,194 66 Home equity 7,709 7,561 148 2 Residential mortgage 4,430 4,417 13 Other consumer 576 757 (181 ) (24 ) Total consumer 18,235 16,061 2,174 14 Total loans/leases $ 37,800 $ 37,089 $ 711 2 % The increase in average total loans and leases reflected: $2.2 billion, or 66%, increase in average automobile loans and leases. In early 2009, we transferred automobile loans to a trust in a securitization transaction. With the adoption of ASC 810 Consolidation, that trust was consolidated as of January 1, 2010. At December 31, 2010, these securitized loans had a remaining balance of $0.5 billion. Underlying growth in automobile loans continued to be strong, reflecting a significant increase in loan originations compared to the year ago period. The growth has come while maintaining our commitment to excellent credit quality and an appropriate return. $0.1 billion, or 2%, increase in average home equity loans, reflecting slightly higher line of credit utilization and slower runoff experience, partially offset by lower origination volume. $0.2 billion, or 2%, increase in average CI loans, reflecting our efforts to expand our portfolio within our primary markets, and to a lesser degree the benefit of the 2009 reclassifications of certain CRE loans, primarily owner occupied properties, to CI loans. These benefits were partially offset by the reclassification in the 2010 first quarter of variable rate demand notes to municipal securities. We continue to believe there are opportunities for CI growth in the coming quarters. Partially offset by: $1.7 billion, or 20%, decrease in average CRE loans reflecting the impact of 2009 reclassifications of certain CRE loans, primarily representing owner occupied properties, to CI loans, as well as our on going commitment to lower our overall CRE exposure. We continue to effectively execute our plan to reduce the noncore CRE exposure while maintaining a commitment to our core CRE borrowers. The decrease in average balances is associated with the noncore portfolio, as we have maintained relatively consistent balances with good performance in the core portfolio. The $1.4 billion, or 15%, increase in average total investment securities reflected the redeployment of cash generated from deposit growth. 103 Table of Contents The following table details the $1.5 billion, or 4%, increase in average total deposits. Table 55 Average Deposits 2010 Fourth Quarter vs. 2009 Fourth Quarter Fourth Quarter Change 2010 2009 Amount Percent (Dollar amounts in millions) Average Deposits Demand deposits: noninterest bearing $ 7,188 $ 6,466 $ 722 11 % Demand deposits: interest bearing 5,317 5,482 (165 ) (3 ) Money market deposits 13,158 9,271 3,887 42 Savings and other domestic deposits 4,640 4,686 (46 ) (1 ) Core certificates of deposit 8,646 10,867 (2,221 ) (20 ) Total core deposits 38,949 36,772 2,177 6 Other deposits 2,755 3,442 (687 ) (20 ) Total deposits $ 41,704 $ 40,214 $ 1,490 4 % The increase in average total deposits from the year ago quarter reflected: $2.2 billion, or 6%, growth in average total core deposits. The drivers of this change were a $3.9 billion, or 42%, growth in average money market deposits, and a $0.7 billion, or 11%, growth in average noninterest bearing demand deposits. These increases were partially offset by a $2.2 billion, or 20%, decline in average core certificates of deposit and a $0.2 billion, or 3%, decrease in average interest bearing demand deposits. $0.8 billion, or 33%, decline in brokered deposits and negotiable CDs, primarily reflecting a reduction of noncore funding sources. Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses in the 2010 fourth quarter was $87.0 million, down $807.0 million, or 90%, from the year ago quarter. The 2010 fourth quarter provision for credit losses was $85.3 million less than total NCOs, reflecting the resolution of problem loans for which reserves had been previously established. Noninterest Income Noninterest income increased $19.7 million from the year ago quarter. 104 Table of Contents Table 56 Noninterest Income 2010 Fourth Quarter vs. 2009 Fourth Quarter Fourth Quarter Change 2010 2009 Amount Percent (Dollar amounts in thousands) Service charges on deposit accounts $ 55,810 $ 76,757 $ (20,947 ) (27 )% Mortgage banking income 53,170 24,618 28,552 116 Trust services 29,394 27,275 2,119 8 Electronic banking 28,900 25,173 3,727 15 Insurance income 19,678 16,128 3,550 22 Brokerage income 16,953 16,045 908 6 Bank owned life insurance income 16,113 14,055 2,058 15 Automobile operating lease income 10,463 12,671 (2,208 ) (17 ) Securities losses (103 ) (2,602 ) 2,499 (96 ) Other income 33,842 34,426 (584 ) (2 ) Total noninterest income $ 264,220 $ 244,546 $ 19,674 8 % The $19.7 million increase reflected: $28.6 million, or 116%, increase in mortgage banking income. This reflected a $31.8 million increase in origination and secondary marketing income, as originations increased 62% from the year ago quarter, partially offset by a $3.2 million increase in amortization of capitalized servicing expense. $3.7 million, or 15%, increase in electronic banking income, reflecting an increase in debit card transaction volume. $3.6 million, or 22%, increase in insurance income, primarily reflecting an increase in title insurance income due to higher mortgage refinance activity. $2.5 million benefit from lower securities losses in the 2010 fourth quarter compared with the year ago quarter. $2.1 million, or 15%, increase in bank owned life insurance income. $2.1 million, or 8%, increase in trust services income, with 50% of the increase due to increases in asset market values and the remainder reflecting growth in new business. Partially offset by: $20.9 million, or 27%, decline in service charges on deposit accounts, reflecting lower personal service charges due to a combination of factors including the implementation of the amendment to Reg E, our Fair Play banking philosophy, and lower underlying activity levels. $2.2 million, or 17%, decline in automobile operating lease income reflecting the impact of a declining portfolio, having exited that business in 2008. Noninterest Expense (This section should be read in conjunction with Significant Item 4.) Noninterest expense increased $112.0 million, or 35%, from the year ago quarter. 105 Table of Contents Table 57 Noninterest Expense 2010 Fourth Quarter vs. 2009 Fourth Quarter Fourth Quarter Change 2010 2009 Amount Percent (Dollar amounts in thousands) Personnel costs $ 212,184 $ 180,663 $ 31,521 17 % Outside data processing and other services 40,943 36,812 4,131 11 Net occupancy 26,670 26,273 397 2 Deposit and other insurance expense 23,320 24,420 (1,100 ) (5 ) Professional services 21,021 25,146 (4,125 ) (16 ) Equipment 22,060 20,454 1,606 8 Marketing 16,168 9,074 7,094 78 Amortization of intangibles 15,046 17,060 (2,014 ) (12 ) OREO and foreclosure expense 10,502 18,520 (8,018 ) (43 ) Automobile operating lease expense 8,142 10,440 (2,298 ) (22 ) Gain on early extinguishment of debt (73,615 ) 73,615 (100 ) Other expense 38,537 27,349 11,188 41 Total noninterest expense $ 434,593 $ 322,596 $ 111,997 35 % Full time equivalent employees, at period end 11,341 10,272 1,069 10 % The $112.0 million increase reflected: $73.6 million gain on early extinguishment of debt that reduced expenses in the year ago quarter. $31.5 million, or 17%, increase in personnel costs, primarily reflecting a 10% increase in full time equivalent staff in support of strategic initiatives, as well as higher commissions and other incentive expenses, and the re instatement of our 401(k) plan matching contribution in 2010. $11.2 million, or 41%, increase in other expense, reflecting $5.9 million associated with increases in repurchase reserves related to representations and warranties made on mortgage loans sold, as well as increased travel and miscellaneous fees. $7.1 million, or 78%, increase in marketing expense, reflecting increases in branding and product advertising activities in support of strategic initiatives. $4.1 million, or 11%, increase in outside data processing and other services, reflecting higher outside programming and other costs associated with the implementation of strategic initiatives, partially offset by lower Franklin related servicing costs. Partially offset by: $8.0 million, or 43%, decline in OREO and foreclosure expense. $4.1 million, or 16%, decrease in professional services, reflecting lower legal expenses. $2.3 million, or 22%, decline in automobile operating lease expense as that portfolio continued to runoff. $2.0 million, or 12%, decrease in the amortization of intangibles expense. Income Taxes The provision for income taxes in the 2010 fourth quarter was $35.0 million and a benefit of $228.3 million in the fourth quarter 2009. The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter 2010 was 22.2% compared to a tax benefit of 38.2% in the fourth quarter 2009. At December 31, 2010 and 2009 we had a deferred tax asset of $538.3 million and $480.5 million, respectively. Based on both positive and negative 106 Table of Contents evidence and our level of forecasted future taxable income, there was no impairment of the deferred tax asset at December 31, 2010 and 2009. The total disallowed deferred tax asset for regulatory capital purposes decreased to $161.3 million at December 31, 2010, from $260.1 million at December 31, 2009. Credit Quality Credit quality performance in the 2010 fourth quarter continued to show improvement. Total NCOs declined $272.5 million, or 61%, compared with the year ago quarter. The decline was largely centered in the CRE portfolio as CRE NCOs declined $213.2 million. This decline in the CRE portfolio was partially offset by an increase in residential mortgage NCOs, partially reflecting NCOs associated with loans sold during the current quarter. Other key credit quality measurements also showed improvement, including significant declines in NPAs and in the level of Criticized commercial loans. These declines reflected the positive impact of significant levels of loan restructures, upgrades, and payment activity. Notably, the level of new additions during the 2010 fourth quarter was more comparable to that in the first half of 2010 rather than the elevated 2010 third quarter level. The economic environment remains challenging. Yet, reflecting the benefit of our focused credit actions, we continue to expect declines in total NPAs and Criticized loans going forward. Delinquency trends across the entire loan and lease portfolio continued to improve, with a significant opportunity for further improvement in the residential and home equity portfolios. Automobile loan delinquency rates continued to decline. Given the significant increase in new automobile origination volume, we use a lagged delinquency measure to ensure that the underlying portfolio performance is consistent with our expectations. Based on the lagged analysis and the origination quality, we remain comfortable with the on going performance of our automobile loan portfolio. The current quarters NCOs were primarily related to reserves established in prior periods. Our ACL declined $240.2 million to $1,291.1 million, or 3.39% of period end total loans and leases at December 31, 2010, from $1,531.4 million, or 4.16%, at December 31, 2009. Importantly, our ACL as a percent of period end NALs increased to 166% from 80%, along with improved coverage ratios associated with NPAs and Criticized assets. These improved coverage ratios indicate a strengthening of our reserves relative to troubled assets from the end of the prior year ago quarter. NCOs (This section should be read in conjunction with Significant Item 3.) Total NCOs for the 2010 fourth quarter were $172.3 million, or an annualized 1.82% of average total loans and leases. NCOs in the year ago quarter were $444.7 million, or an annualized 4.80%. Total CI NCOs for the 2010 fourth quarter were $59.1 million, or an annualized 1.85%, down from $109.8 million, or an annualized 3.49% of related loans, in the year ago quarter. The decline reflected improvement in the overall credit quality of the portfolio. Current quarter CRE NCOs were $44.9 million, or an annualized 2.64%, down from $258.1 million, or an annualized 12.21% in the year ago quarter. The decline was consistent with the improving asset quality metrics. NALs and Criticized loans at December 31, 2010, were at their lowest levels since 2008, and early stage delinquency continued to improve. The 2010 fourth quarter CRE NCOs continued to be centered in retail projects. The retail property portfolio remains the most susceptible to a continued decline in market conditions, but we believe that the combination of prior NCOs and existing reserves positions us well to make effective credit decisions in the future. While the office portfolio has experienced stress, we remain comfortable with this exposure. Total consumer NCOs in the current quarter were $68.3 million, or an annualized 1.50%, down from $76.8 million, or an annualized 1.91% of average total consumer loans in the year ago quarter. The 2010 fourth quarter results represented a continuation of our loss mitigation programs and active loss recognition processes. This included accounts in all stages of performance, including bankruptcy. 107 Table of Contents Residential mortgage NCOs were $26.8 million, or an annualized 2.42% of related average balances, an increase compared with $17.8 million, or an annualized 1.61% in the year ago quarter. During the current quarter, we continued to see positive trends in early stage delinquencies, indicating that even with the economic stress on our customers, losses are expected to remain manageable. Home equity NCOs in the 2010 fourth quarter were $29.2 million, or an annualized 1.51%. This was down from $35.8 million, or an annualized 1.89%, in the year ago quarter. We continued to manage the default rate through focused delinquency monitoring as virtually all defaults for second lien home equity loans incur substantial losses given the reduced collateral equity. Our strategies focus on loss mitigation activity through early intervention and restructuring loan terms. Automobile loan and lease NCOs were $7.0 million, or an annualized 0.51%, down from $12.9 million, or an annualized 1.55%, in the year ago quarter. Performance of this portfolio on both an absolute and relative basis continued to be consistent with our views regarding the underlying quality of the portfolio. During the 2010 fourth quarter, we originated $795.6 million of loans with an average FICO score of 764 with a continued emphasis on lower LTV ratios. NPAs and NALs Total NALs were $777.9 million at December 31, 2010, and represented 2.04% of total loans and leases. This was down $1,139.0 million, or 59%, from $1,917.0 million, or 5.21% ,of total loans and leases at the end of the year ago period. This decrease primarily reflected problem loan resolution activity and NCOs. This substantial decline is a direct result of our commitment to the on going proactive management of these loans by our SAD. Also key to this improvement was the lower level of inflows. The level of inflows, or migration, is an important indicator of the future trend for the portfolio. NPAs, which include NALs, were $844.8 million at December 31, 2010, and represented 2.21% of total loans and leases. This was significantly lower than $2,058.1 million, or 5.57% of related assets at the end of the year ago period. The $1,213.3 million decrease in NPAs from the end of the year ago period reflected a $1,139.0 million decrease in NALs. The over 90 day delinquent, but still accruing, ratio for total loans not guaranteed by a U.S. government agency, was 0.23% at December 31, 2010, representing a 17 basis point decline compared with December 31, 2009. This decrease primarily reflected continued improvement in our core performance, as well as the impact of the sale of certain underperforming loans in the 2010 fourth quarter. ACL (This section should be in read in conjunction with Note 1 and Note 6 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). At December 31, 2010, the ALLL was $1,249.0 million, down $233.5 million, or 16%, from $1,482.5 million at December 31, 2009. Expressed as a percent of period end loans and leases, the ALLL ratio at December 31, 2010, was 3.28%, a decline from 4.03% at December 31, 2009. The ALLL as a percent of NALs was 161% at December 31, 2010, a substantial improvement from 77% at 2009. At December 31, 2010, the AULC was $42.1 million, down $6.8 million, or 14%, compared with December 31, 2009. On a combined basis, the ACL as a percent of total loans and leases at December 31, 2010, was 3.39%, down from 4.16% at December 31, 2009. This reduction was centered in the CRE portfolio as a result of the reduction in the level of problem loans. The ACL as a percent of NALs was 166% at December 31, 2010, up from 80% at December 31, 2009, indicating additional strength in the reserve level relative to the level of problem loans. 108 Table of Contents Table 58 Selected Quarterly Income Statement Data(1) 2010 Fourth Third Second First (Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share amounts) Interest income $ 528,291 $ 534,669 $ 535,653 $ 546,779 Interest expense 112,997 124,707 135,997 152,886 Net interest income 415,294 409,962 399,656 393,893 Provision for credit losses 86,973 119,160 193,406 235,008 Net interest income after provision for credit losses 328,321 290,802 206,250 158,885 Total noninterest income 264,220 267,143 269,643 240,852 Total noninterest expense 434,593 427,309 413,810 398,093 Income before income taxes 157,948 130,636 62,083 1,644 Provision (benefit) for income taxes 35,048 29,690 13,319 (38,093 ) Net income $ 122,900 $ 100,946 $ 48,764 $ 39,737 Dividends on preferred shares 83,754 29,495 29,426 29,357 Net income applicable to common shares $ 39,146 $ 71,451 $ 19,338 $ 10,380 Common shares outstanding Average basic 757,924 716,911 716,580 716,320 Average diluted(2) 760,582 719,567 719,387 718,593 Ending 863,319 717,132 716,623 716,557 Book value per common share $ 5.35 $ 5.39 $ 5.22 $ 5.13 Tangible book value per common share(3) 4.66 4.55 4.37 4.26 Per common share Net income basic $ 0.05 $ 0.10 $ 0.03 $ 0.01 Net income diluted 0.05 0.10 0.03 0.01 Cash dividends declared 0.0100 0.0100 0.0100 0.0100 Common stock price, per share High(4) $ 7.00 $ 6.45 $ 7.40 $ 5.81 Low(4) 5.43 5.04 5.26 3.65 Close 6.87 5.69 5.54 5.39 Average closing price 6.05 5.79 6.13 4.84 Return on average total assets 0.90 % 0.76 % 0.38 % 0.31 % Return on average common shareholders equity 3.8 7.4 2.1 1.1 Return on average tangible common shareholders equity(5) 5.6 10.0 3.8 2.7 Efficiency ratio(6) 61.4 60.6 59.4 60.1 Effective tax rate (benefit) 22.2 22.7 21.5 N.R.

ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES Forward Looking Statements This report, including MDA, contains certain forward looking statements, including certain plans, expectations, goals, projections, and statements, which are subject to numerous assumptions, risks, and uncertainties. Statements that do not describe historical or current facts, including statements about beliefs and expectations, are forward looking statements. The forward looking statements are intended to be subject to the safe harbor provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results could differ materially from those contained or implied by such statements for a variety of factors including: (1) worsening of credit quality performance due to a number of factors such as the underlying value of the collateral could prove less valuable than otherwise assumed and assumed cash flows may be worse than expected; (2) changes in economic conditions; (3) movements in interest rates; (4) competitive pressures on product pricing and services; (5) success, impact, and timing of our business strategies, including market acceptance of any new products or services introduced to implement our Fair Play banking philosophy; (6) changes in accounting policies and principles and the accuracy of our assumptions and estimates used to prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements; (7) extended disruption of vital 112 Table of Contents infrastructure; and (8) the nature, extent, and timing of governmental actions and reforms, including the Dodd Frank Act, as well as future regulations which will be adopted by the relevant regulatory agencies, including the newly created CFPB, to implement the Dodd Frank Acts provisions. All forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and are based on information available at that time. We assume no obligation to update forward looking statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the forward looking statements were made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events except as required by federal securities laws. As forward looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, caution should be exercised against placing undue reliance on such statements. Risk Factors More information on risk is set forth under the heading Risk Factors included in Item 1A and incorporated by reference into this MDA. Additional information regarding risk factors can also be found in the Risk Management and Capital discussion. Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Significant Estimates Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated by reference into this MDA, describes the significant accounting policies we use in our Consolidated Financial Statements. An accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimates are made under facts and circumstances at a point in time, and changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates. The most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed below. Total Allowance for Credit Losses Our ACL of $1.3 billion at December 31, 2010, represents our estimate of probable losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio and our unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. We periodically review our ACL for adequacy. In doing so, we consider economic conditions and trends, collateral values, and credit quality indicators, such as past NCO experience, levels of past due loans, and NPAs. There is no certainty that our ACL will be adequate over time to cover losses in the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy, market conditions, or events adversely affecting specific customers, industries, or markets. If the credit quality of our customer base materially deteriorates, the risk profile of a market, industry, or group of customers changes materially, or if the ACL is not adequate, our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected which, in turn, could have a material negative adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, bank regulators periodically review our ACL and may require us to increase our provision for loan and lease losses or loan charge offs. Any increase in our ACL or loan charge offs as required by these regulatory authorities could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations. Fair Value Measurements (This section should be read in conjunction with Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) The fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. We estimate the fair value of a financial instrument using a variety of valuation methods. Where financial instruments are actively traded and have quoted market prices, quoted market prices are used for fair value. We characterize active markets as those where transaction volumes are sufficient to provide objective pricing 113 Table of Contents information, with reasonably narrow bid / ask spreads, and where received quoted prices do not vary widely. When the financial instruments are not actively traded, other observable market inputs, such as quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, may be used, if available, to determine fair value. Inactive markets are characterized by low transaction volumes, price quotations that vary substantially among market participants, or in which minimal information is released publicly. When observable market prices do not exist, we estimate fair value primarily by using cash flow and other financial modeling methods. Our valuation methods consider factors such as liquidity and concentration concerns and, for the derivatives portfolio, counterparty credit risk. Other factors such as model assumptions, market dislocations, and unexpected correlations can affect estimates of fair value. Changes in these underlying factors, assumptions, or estimates in any of these areas could materially impact the amount of revenue or loss recorded. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility. Assets measured at fair value include mortgage loans held for sale, available for sale and other certain securities, certain securitized automobile loans, derivatives, certain MSRs, trading account securities, and certain securitization trust notes payable. At December 31, 2010, approximately $11.5 billion of our assets and $0.6 billion of our liabilities were recorded at fair value. In addition to the above mentioned on going fair value measurements, fair value is also the unit of measure for recording business combinations. FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements, establishes a framework for measuring the fair value of financial instruments that considers the attributes specific to particular assets or liabilities and establishes a three level hierarchy for determining fair value based on the transparency of inputs to each valuation as of the fair value measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows: Level 1 quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices of identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3 inputs that are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. Financial instruments are considered Level 3 when values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable. At the end of each quarter, we assess the valuation hierarchy for each asset or liability measured. As necessary, assets or liabilities may be transferred within hierarchy levels due to changes in availability of observable market inputs to measure fair value at the measurement date. 114 Table of Contents The table below provides a description and the valuation methodologies used for financial instruments measured at fair value, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy. The fair values measured at each level of the fair value hierarchy, as well as additional discussion regarding fair value measurements, can be found in Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Financial Instrument(1) Hierarchy Valuation methodology Mortgage loans held for sale Level 2 Huntington elected to apply the fair value option for mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell which are included in loans held for sale. Mortgage loans held for sale are estimated using security prices for similar product types. At December 31, 2010, mortgage loans held for sale had an aggregate fair value of $754.1 million and an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $750.0 million. Interest income on these loans is recorded in interest and fee income loans and leases. Included in mortgage banking income were net gains resulting from origination and sale of these loans, including net realized gains of $109.2 million, $90.6 million, and $32.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Of such gains, the change in fair value while held as loans were $(5.6) million, $(6.3) million and $6.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Available for sale Securities Trading Account Securities(2) Level 1 Consist primarily of U.S. Treasury and money market mutual funds, which generally have quoted prices. Level 2 Consist of U.S. Government and agency mortgage backed and other federal agency securities, municipal securities, and other securities for which an active market is not available. Third party pricing services provide a fair value estimate based upon trades of similar financial instruments. Level 3 Consist of certain asset backed securities, pooled trust preferred securities, private label CMOs, and municipal securities for which fair value is estimated. Assumptions used to determine the fair value of these securities have greater subjectivity due to the lack of observable market transactions. Generally, there are only limited trades of similar instruments and a discounted cash flow approach is used to determine fair value. Automobile loans(3) Level 3 Consists of automobile loan receivables measured at fair value. The key assumptions used to determine the fair value of the automobile loan receivables included projections of expected losses and prepayment of the underlying loans in the portfolio and a market assumption of interest rate spreads. The net gains and losses, before tax, from fair value changes reflected in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2010 was a net loss of $2.3 million which is net of a $3.4 million net gain associated with instrument specific credit risk. Instrument specific credit risk was determined based on estimated credit losses inherent in the January 1, 2010 fair value calculation as compared to actual credit losses incurred in 2010 plus estimated credit losses inherent in the December 31, 2010 fair value calculation. 115 Table of Contents Financial Instrument(1) Hierarchy Valuation methodology MSRs(3) Level 3 MSRs do not trade in an active, open market with readily observable prices. Although sales of MSRs do occur, the precise terms and conditions typically are not readily available. Fair value is determined on an income approach model based upon month end interest rate curve and prepayment assumptions. Derivatives(4) Level 1 Consist of exchange traded options and forward commitments to deliver mortgage backed securities which are valued using quoted prices. Level 2 Consist of basic asset and liability conversion swaps and options, and interest rate caps. These derivative positions are valued using a discounted cash flow method that incorporates current market interest rates. Level 3 Consist primarily of interest rate lock agreements related to mortgage loan commitments. The determination of fair value includes assumptions related to the likelihood that a commitment will ultimately result in a closed loan, which is a significant unobservable assumption. Securitization trust notes payable(4) Level 2 Consists of certain securitization trust notes payable related to the automobile loans measured at fair value. The notes payable are valued based on interest rates for similar financial instruments. The change in fair value for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $9.6 million.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES (This section should be read in conjunction with the Investment Securities Portfolio discussion and Note 1 and Note 4 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) Level 3 Analysis on Certain Securities Portfolios Our Alt A, private label CMO, and pooled trust preferred securities portfolios are classified as Level 3, and as such, the significant estimates used to determine the fair value of these securities have greater subjectivity. The Alt A and private label CMO securities portfolios are subjected to a monthly review of the projected cash flows, while the cash flows of our pooled trust preferred securities portfolio are reviewed quarterly. These reviews are supported with analysis from independent third parties, and are used as a basis for impairment analysis. These three portfolios, and the results of our impairment analysis for each portfolio, are discussed in further detail below: Alt A mortgage backed / Private label collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO) securities represent securities collateralized by first lien residential mortgage loans. As the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of these securities in its entirety was a Level 3 input, we classified all securities within these portfolios as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The securities were priced with the assistance of an outside third party specialist using a discounted cash flow approach and the independent third partys proprietary pricing model. The model used inputs such as estimated prepayment speeds, losses, recoveries, and default rates that were implied by the underlying performance of collateral in the structure or similar structures, discount rates that were implied by market prices for similar securities, collateral structure types, and housing price depreciation / appreciation rates that were based upon macroeconomic forecasts. 116 Table of Contents We analyzed both our Alt A mortgage backed and private label CMO securities portfolios to determine if the securities in these portfolios were other than temporarily impaired. We used the analysis to determine whether we believed it was probable that all contractual cash flows would not be collected. All securities in these portfolios remained current with respect to interest and principal, except for one security which experienced a minor interest shortfall at December 31, 2010. Our analysis indicated that, as of December 31, 2010, one Alt A mortgage backed security and seven private label CMO securities could experience a loss of principal in the future. The future expected losses of principal on these other than temporarily impaired securities ranged from 4.2% to 38.5% of their par value. These losses were projected to occur anywhere from eight months to as many as 25 years in the future. We measured the amount of credit impairment on these securities using the cash flows discounted at each securitys effective rate. In 2010, a total of $1.6 million of credit OTTI was recorded in our Alt A mortgage backed securities portfolio, and $7.1 million of credit OTTI was recorded in our private label CMO securities portfolio. These OTTI adjustments negatively impacted our earnings. Pooled trust preferred securities represent CDOs backed by a pool of debt securities issued by financial institutions. As the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of these securities in its entirety was a Level 3 input, we classified all securities within this portfolio as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The collateral generally consisted of trust preferred securities and subordinated debt securities issued by banks, bank holding companies, and insurance companies. A full cash flow analysis was used to estimate fair values and assess impairment for each security within this portfolio. Impairment was calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the amount of cash flows discounted at each securitys effective rate. We engaged a third party specialist with direct industry experience in pooled trust preferred securities valuations to provide assistance in estimating the fair value and expected cash flows for each security in this portfolio. Relying on cash flows was necessary because there was a lack of observable transactions in the market and many of the original sponsors or dealers for these securities were no longer able to provide a fair value. The analysis was completed by evaluating the relevant credit and structural aspects of each pooled trust preferred security in the portfolio, including collateral performance projections for each piece of collateral in each security and terms of each securitys structure. The credit review included analysis of profitability, credit quality, operating efficiency, leverage, and liquidity using the most recently available financial and regulatory information for each underlying collateral issuer. We also reviewed historical industry default data and current / near term operating conditions. Using the results of our analysis, we estimated appropriate default and recovery probabilities for each piece of collateral and then estimated the expected cash flows for each security. No recoveries were assumed on issuers who are in default. The recovery assumptions on issuers who were deferring interest ranged from 10% to 55% with a cure assumed after the maximum deferral period. As a result of this testing, we believe we will likely experience a loss of principal or interest on nine securities and, as such, recorded credit OTTI of $1.5 million for one newly impaired and eight previously impaired pooled trust preferred securities in the 2010 fourth quarter. In 2010, $4.9 million of total OTTI was recorded for impairment of the pooled trust preferred securities. These OTTI adjustments negatively impacted our earnings. Please refer to the Securities discussion and Note 1 and Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding OTTI. Certain other assets and liabilities which are not financial instruments also involve fair value measurements. A description of these assets and liabilities, and the methodologies utilized to determine fair value are discussed below: GOODWILL Goodwill is an intangible asset representing the difference between the purchase price of an asset and its fair market value and is created when a company pays a premium to acquire the assets of another company. We test goodwill for impairment annually, as of October 1, using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of a reporting unit. Goodwill impairment exists when a reporting units carrying 117 Table of Contents value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. Goodwill is also tested for impairment on an interim basis, using the same two step process as the annual testing, if an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. In 2010, we performed interim evaluations of our goodwill balances at March 31 and June 30, as well as our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of October 1. The annual assessment was based on our reporting units at that time. No impairment was recorded in 2010. The 2010 interim and annual assessments were performed in a manner consistent with the 2009 process as described in the next section. All assumptions were updated to reflect correct market conditions. Due to the current economic environment and other uncertainties, it is possible that our estimates and assumptions may adversely change in the future. If our market capitalization decreases or the liquidity discount on our loan portfolio improves significantly without a concurrent increase in market capitalization, we may be required to record goodwill impairment losses in future periods, whether in connection with our next annual impairment testing or prior to that time, if any changes constitute a triggering event. Significant judgment is applied when goodwill is assessed for impairment. This judgment includes developing cash flow projections, selecting appropriate discount rates, identifying relevant market comparables, incorporating general economic and market conditions, and selecting an appropriate control premium. The selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a higher or lower fair value. Judgment is applied in determining the weightings that are most representative of fair value. 2009 First Quarter Impairment Testing During the 2009 first quarter, our stock price declined 78%, from $7.66 per common share at December 31, 2008, to $1.66 per common share at March 31, 2009. Many peer banks also experienced similar significant declines in market capitalization during this same period. This decline primarily reflected the continuing economic slowdown and increased market concern surrounding financial institutions credit risks and capital positions, as well as uncertainty related to increased regulatory supervision and intervention. We determined that these changes would more likely than not reduce the fair value of certain reporting units below their carrying amounts. Therefore, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test during the 2009 first quarter. An independent third party was engaged to assist with the impairment assessment. The first step (Step 1) of impairment testing required a comparison of each reporting units fair value to carrying value to identify potential impairment. For our impairment testing conducted during the 2009 first quarter, we identified four reporting units: Regional Banking, Private Financial Group (PFG), Insurance, and Automobile Finance and Dealer Services (AFDS). Although Insurance was included within PFG for business segment reporting at that time, it was evaluated as a separate reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing because it had its own separately allocated goodwill resulting from prior acquisitions. The fair value of PFG (determined using the market approach as described below), excluding Insurance, exceeded its carrying value, and goodwill was determined to not be impaired for this reporting unit. There was no goodwill associated with AFDS and, therefore, it was not subject to impairment testing. For Regional Banking, we utilized both the income and market approaches to determine fair value. The income approach was based on discounted cash flows derived from assumptions of balance sheet and income statement activity. An internal forecast was developed by considering several long term key business drivers such as anticipated loan and deposit growth. The long term growth rate used in determining the terminal value was estimated at 2.5%. The discount rate of 14% was estimated based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which considered the risk free interest rate (20 year Treasury Bonds), market risk premium, equity risk premium, and a company specific risk factor. The company specific risk factor was used to address the uncertainty of growth estimates and earnings projections of Management. For the market approach, revenue, earnings and market capitalization multiples of comparable public companies were selected and applied to the Regional Banking units applicable metrics such as book and tangible book values. A 20% control premium was used in the market approach. The results of the income and market approaches were weighted 75% and 118 Table of Contents 25%, respectively, to arrive at the final calculation of fair value. As market capitalization declined across the banking industry, we believed that a heavier weighting on the income approach was more representative of a market participants view. For the Insurance reporting unit, Management utilized a market approach to determine fair value. The aggregate fair market values were compared with market capitalization as an assessment of the appropriateness of the fair value measurements. As our stock price fluctuated greatly during the valuation period, we used our average stock price for the 30 days preceding the valuation date to determine market capitalization. The aggregate fair market values of the reporting units compared with market capitalization indicated an implied premium of 27%. A control premium analysis indicated that the implied premium was within range of overall premiums observed in the market place. Neither the Regional Banking nor Insurance reporting units passed Step 1. The second step (Step 2) of impairment testing is necessary only if the reporting unit does not pass Step 1. Step 2 compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill for the reporting unit. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as goodwill that is recognized in a business combination. Significant judgment and estimates are involved in estimating the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. To determine the implied fair value of goodwill, the fair value of Regional Banking and Insurance (as determined in Step 1) was allocated to all assets and liabilities of the reporting units including any recognized or unrecognized intangible assets. The allocation was done as if the reporting unit was acquired in a business combination, and the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit. This allocation process is only performed for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment. The carrying values of recognized assets or liabilities (other than goodwill, as appropriate) were not adjusted nor were any new intangible assets recorded. Key valuations were the assessment of core deposit intangibles, the mark to fair value of outstanding debt and deposits, and mark to fair value on the loan portfolio. Core deposits were valued using a 15% discount rate. The marks on our outstanding debt and deposits were based upon observable trades or modeled prices using then current yield curves and market spreads. The valuation of the loan portfolio indicated discounts in the ranges of 9% 24%, depending upon the loan type. The estimated fair value of these loan portfolios was based on an exit price, and the assumptions used were intended to approximate those that a market participant would have used in valuing the loans in an orderly transaction, including a market liquidity discount. The significant market risk premium that is a consequence of the current distressed market conditions was a significant contributor to the valuation discounts associated with these loans. We believed these discounts were consistent with transactions currently occurring in the marketplace. Upon completion of Step 2, we determined that the Regional Banking and Insurance reporting units goodwill carrying values exceeded their implied fair values of goodwill by $2,573.8 million and $28.9 million, respectively. As a result, we recorded a noncash pretax impairment charge of $2,602.7 million in the 2009 first quarter. 2009 Other Interim and Annual Impairment Testing We recorded an impairment charge of $4.2 million in the 2009 second quarter related to the sale of a small payments related business completed in July 2009. No other goodwill impairment was required during the remainder of 2009. FRANKLIN LOANS RESTRUCTURING TRANSACTION (This section should be read in conjunction with Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Franklin is a specialty consumer finance company primarily engaged in servicing performing, reperforming, and nonperforming residential mortgage loans. Prior to March 31, 2009, Franklin owned a portfolio of loans secured by first lien and second lien loans secured by residential properties. These loans generally fell outside the underwriting standards of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, and involved elevated credit risk as a result of the nature or absence of income documentation, limited credit histories, higher levels of consumer debt, and / or past credit difficulties (nonprime loans). At December 31, 2008, our total commercial loans outstanding to Franklin were $650.2 million, all of which were placed on nonaccrual status. Additionally, the 119 Table of Contents specific allowance for loan and lease losses for the Franklin portfolio was $130.0 million, resulting in net exposure to Franklin at December 31, 2008, of $520.2 million. On March 31, 2009, we entered into a transaction with Franklin whereby a Huntington wholly owned REIT subsidiary (REIT) indirectly acquired an 83% ownership right in a trust which held all the underlying consumer loans and OREO properties that were formerly collateral for the Franklin commercial loans. The equity interests provided to Franklin by the REIT were pledged by Franklin as collateral for the Franklin commercial loans. As a result of the restructuring, on a consolidated basis, the $650.2 million nonaccrual commercial loan to Franklin at December 31, 2008, was no longer reported. Instead, the loans were reported as secured by first lien and second lien mortgages on residential properties and OREO properties both of which had previously been assets of Franklin or its subsidiaries and were pledged to secure our loan to Franklin. At the time of the restructuring, these loans had a fair value of $493.6 million and the OREO properties had a fair value of $79.6 million. As a result of the restructuring, we reported $338.5 million mortgage related NALs outstanding related to Franklin, representing first lien and second lien mortgages that were nonaccruing at December 31, 2009. Also, our specific allowance for loan and lease losses for the Franklin portfolio of $130.0 million was eliminated. However, no initial increase to the ALLL relating to the acquired mortgages was recorded as these assets were recorded at fair value. In accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, we recorded a net deferred tax asset of $159.9 million related to the difference between the tax basis and the book basis of the acquired assets. Because the acquisition price, represented by the equity interests in our wholly owned subsidiary, was equal to the fair value of the acquired 83% ownership right, no goodwill was created from the transaction. The recording of the net deferred tax asset was a bargain purchase under ASC 805, and was recorded as a tax benefit in the 2009 first quarter. During the 2010 second quarter, $397.7 million of Franklin related loans ($333.0 million of residential mortgages and $64.7 million of home equity loans) at a value of $323.4 million were transferred to loans held for sale. At the time of the transfer to loans held for sale, the loans were marked to the lower of cost or fair value less anticipated selling costs. During the 2010 third quarter, the Franklin related residential mortgages and home equity loans were sold at essentially book value. At December 31, 2010, the only Franklin related assets remaining were $9.5 million of OREO properties, which have been marked to the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell. Additionally, the equity interests in the REIT held by Franklin remain outstanding and pledged as collateral for the Franklin commercial loans at December 31, 2010. PENSION Pension plan assets consist of mutual funds and our common stock. Investments are accounted for at cost on the trade date and are reported at fair value. Mutual funds are valued at quoted Net Asset Value. Our common stock is traded on a national securities exchange and is valued at the last reported sales price. The discount rate and expected return on plan assets used to determine the benefit obligation and pension expense are both assumptions. Actual results may be materially different. (See Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). OTHER REAL ESTATE OWNED OREO property obtained in satisfaction of a loan is recorded at its estimated fair value less anticipated selling costs based upon the propertys appraised value at the date of transfer, with any difference between the fair value of the property and the carrying value of the loan charged to the ALLL. Subsequent declines in value are reported as adjustments to the carrying amount and are charged to noninterest expense. Gains or losses resulting from the sale of OREO are recognized in noninterest expense on the date of sale. At December 31, 2010, OREO totaled $66.8 million, representing a 52% decrease compared with $140.1 million at December 31, 2009. 120 Table of Contents Income Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets INCOME TAXES The calculation of our provision for income taxes is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments. We have two accruals for income taxes: (1) our income tax payable represents the estimated net amount currently due to the federal, state, and local taxing jurisdictions, net of any reserve for potential audit issues, and is reported as a component of accrued expenses and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet; (2) our deferred federal income tax asset, reported as a component of accrued income and other assets, represents the estimated impact of temporary differences between how we recognize our assets and liabilities under GAAP, and how such assets and liabilities are recognized under the federal tax code. In the ordinary course of business, we operate in various taxing jurisdictions and are subject to income and nonincome taxes. The effective tax rate is based in part on our interpretation of the relevant current tax laws. We believe the aggregate liabilities related to taxes are appropriately reflected in the consolidated financial statements. We review the appropriate tax treatment of all transactions taking into consideration statutory, judicial, and regulatory guidance in the context of our tax positions. In addition, we rely on various tax opinions, recent tax audits, and historical experience. From time to time, we engage in business transactions that may affect our tax liabilities. Where appropriate, we have obtained opinions of outside experts and have assessed the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of business transactions taking into account statutory, judicial, and regulatory guidance in the context of the tax position. However, changes to our estimates of accrued taxes can occur due to changes in tax rates, implementation of new business strategies, resolution of issues with taxing authorities regarding previously taken tax positions, and newly enacted statutory, judicial, and regulatory guidance. Such changes could affect the amount of our accrued taxes and could be material to our financial position and / or results of operations. (See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) DEFERRED TAX ASSETS At December 31, 2010, we had a net federal deferred tax asset of $537.5 million and a net state deferred tax asset of $0.8 million. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. All available evidence, both positive and negative, was considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, impairment should be recognized. Our forecast process includes judgmental and quantitative elements that may be subject to significant change. If our forecast of taxable income within the carryforward periods available under applicable law is not sufficient to cover the amount of net deferred tax assets, such assets may be impaired. Based on our analysis of both positive and negative evidence and our ability to offset the net deferred tax assets against our forecasted future taxable income, there was no impairment of the deferred tax assets at December 31, 2010. Recent Accounting Pronouncements and Developments Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements discusses new accounting pronouncements adopted during 2010 and the expected impact of accounting pronouncements recently issued but not yet required to be adopted. To the extent the adoption of new accounting standards materially affect financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity, the impacts are discussed in the applicable section of this MDA and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
