Key consolidated average balance sheet and income statement trends are also discussed in this section. Risk Management and Capital Discusses credit, market, liquidity, and operational risks, including how these are managed, as well as performance trends. It also includes a discussion of liquidity policies, how we obtain funding, and related performance. In addition, there is a discussion of guarantees and / or commitments made for items such as standby letters of credit and commitments to sell loans, and a discussion that reviews the adequacy of capital, including regulatory capital requirements. Business Segment Discussion Provides an overview of financial performance for each of our major business segments and provides additional discussion of trends underlying consolidated financial performance. Results for the Fourth Quarter Provides a discussion of results for the 2011 fourth quarter compared with the 2010 fourth quarter. Additional Disclosures Provides comments on important matters including forward looking statements, critical accounting policies and use of significant estimates, recent accounting pronouncements and developments, and acquisitions. A reading of each section is important to understand fully the nature of our financial performance and prospects. 24 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 2011 Financial Performance Review In 2011, we reported net income of $542.6 million, or $0.59 per common share, up $230.3 million from 2010 (see Table 2). The primary driver of the increase was improved credit quality during 2011, which resulted in a decline in provision for credit losses by $460.5 million, or 73%, when compared to 2010. This benefit to net income was offset somewhat by a decline in noninterest income of 6% and an increase in noninterest expense of 3%. Despite the challenging economic and extended low interest rate environment coupled with impacts of government mandated reductions in fee income during 2011, and a slower mortgage market, we were able to produce a return on average total assets of 1.01%, up from 0.59% in 2010. We also saw continuing results from our strategic business investments and Optimal Customer Relationship (OCR) sales approach. (Also, see Significant Items Influencing Financial Performance Comparisons within the Discussion of Results of Operations.) Fully taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.6 billion in 2011, up slightly from 2010. Average earning assets increased $1.2 billion, or 2%, including a $1.6 billion, or 4% increase in total loans and leases. This reflected benefits from our strategic C&I initiatives focusing on large corporate, asset based lending, and equipment finance. It also reflected growth in the automobile portfolio. These increases were partially offset by a decline in our CRE portfolio, reflecting the continued execution of our plan to reduce total CRE exposure, primarily in the noncore portfolio. Average core deposits grew $1.9 billion, or 5%, reflecting our consumer household and commercial relationship growth. This growth continued even as we continued to focus on fundamentally changing our deposit mix and driving down the overall cost of funds. The net interest margin declined 6 basis points to 3.38% from 3.44%. The decline reflected lower loan and securities yields due to the extended low interest rate environment, partially offset by the positive impacts of growth in low cost deposits and lower deposit pricing. Noninterest income was $1.0 billion in 2011, a 6% decrease compared with 2010. We experienced growth in certain fee businesses during the year including capital markets fees and brokerage income. We also had a gain on sale of loans from our 2011 third quarter automobile securitization. These increases were offset by declines in mortgage banking income, as originations decreased 28% from the prior year. Additionally, we experienced declines in service charges on deposit accounts, reflecting our implementation of changes to Regulation E and our Fair Play banking philosophy which were somewhat offset by activity growth due to a 10% increase in consumer households during 2011. Noninterest expense was $1.7 billion in 2011, a 3% increase compared with 2010. This reflected increases in personnel costs, expenses associated with the conversion to a new debit card processor, and the costs related to implementation of strategic initiatives. These increases were partially offset by declines in OREO and foreclosure expenses, as credit quality continued to improve, as well as lower professional services costs. Credit quality performance continued to show strong improvement as our NALs and NCOs declined and reserve coverage increased. Compared with the prior year, NALs declined 30%. NCOs were $437.1 million, or an annualized 1.12% of average total loans and leases, down from $874.5 million, or an annualized 2.35% in 2010. While the ACL as a percentage of loans and leases was 2.60%, down from 3.39% at December 31, 2010, it is near peer averages and our ACL as a percentage of total NALs increased to 187% from 166%. The level of Criticized commercial loans also declined $0.9 billion, or 30%, from last year. The provision for credit losses declined $460.5 million, or 73%, from 2010. At December 31, 2011, our regulatory Tier 1 and Total risk based capital were $2.8 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, above the well capitalized regulatory thresholds. Our tangible common equity ratio improved 74 basis points to 8.30% and our Tier 1 common risk based capital ratio improved 71 basis points to 10.00% from December 31, 2010. During the 2011 fourth quarter, we replaced a portion of our trust preferred securities with preferred stock, which we believe will qualify as additional Tier 1 risk based capital under regulations arising from the Dodd Frank Act. 25 Table of Contents Business Overview General Our general business objectives are: (1) grow net interest income and fee income, (2) increase cross sell and share of wallet across all business segments, (3) improve efficiency ratio, and (4) continue to strengthen risk management, including sustained improvement in credit metrics. The main challenges to accomplishing our primary objectives in 2011 resulted from: (1) an economy that, while more stable than a year earlier, remained fragile, (2) a prolonged low interest rate environment, which put pressure on our net interest margin, (3) lost fee income due to new regulations, and (4) more overhead and expenses related to increased risk management as a consequence of the Dodd Frank Act. As is the nature of a mature industry with arguably overcapacity, we faced strong competition from other banks and financial service firms in our markets. This is expected to continue. To address these challenges, beginning in the second half of 2009 and continuing today, we place strategic emphasis on developing and expanding resources to improve cross sell performance within our consumer and business customer bases. In this regard, our OCR methodology continued to deliver strong success in 2011. On the consumer side, consumer checking account households grew 10.3%, which was more than 50% higher than in 2010, and nearly four times the rate of growth in 2009. Our cross sell performance also continued to improve. At the end of the year, 73.5% of our consumer checking account households utilized over four products. This compared with 69.4% a year earlier. Growth in commercial relationships was 8.4% in 2011. At the end of the year, 31.4% of our commercial relationships used over four products or services, up from 24.2% a year earlier. Our Fair Play philosophy, coupled with an increasingly effective OCR focus, while positively impacting 2011 results, also positions us for better long term performance. Economy During 2011, there continued to be a high level of uncertainty and volatility surrounding the economy, though late in the year we saw more encouraging signs. Unemployment rates as of December 2011 for Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia were below the national unemployment average. Indiana, Michigan, and Kentucky were slightly above the national average, but they also declined, and the rate in Michigan was the lowest since September 2008. Midwest housing prices generally did not rise as much during the housing boom years, and have therefore not gone down as much during the housing crisis. Midwest housing markets are expected to continue to reflect the general state of the labor markets, which are expected to continue to improve. Manufacturing exports are a regional strength. Michigan and Ohio are two of the top 10 states for manufacturing exports, and Indiana is number 11. For Michigan in particular, the future success of export growth will likely hold a key to long term economic growth. Both office and industrial vacancy rates have been easing downward, but have remained generally high relative to the national average. Therefore, stresses in these loan classes will likely persist. However, vacancy rates should continue to ease downward assuming an economic recovery and expansionary phase in 2012. However, issues may exist in markets with especially high vacancy rates. Legislative and Regulatory Regulatory reforms continued to be adopted which impose additional restrictions on business practices. Recent actions affecting us included the Federal Reserves capital plan review and maturity extension program, and other rules and regulations that have been issued pursuant to the Dodd Frank Act. Capital Plan Review We are participating in the Federal Reserves Capital Plan Review (CapPR) stress test process and made our capital plan submission in January 2012. The Federal Reserve will evaluate our capital plan based on our risk profile and the strength of our internal capital assessment process under regulatory capital standards currently applicable and in accordance with our plans to address proposed revisions to the regulatory capital framework as set forth in Basel III and relevant provisions of the Dodd Frank Act. The Federal Reserves evaluation will take into consideration any capital distribution plans, such as plans to increase common stock 26 Table of Contents dividends or to reinstate common stock repurchase programs. We expect to receive the results of their evaluation by the end of the 2012 first quarter. While we can give no assurances as to the outcome or specific interactions with the regulators, we believe we have a strong capital position. Federal Reserve Maturity Extension Program Under the maturity extension program (Operation Twist) announced on September 21, 2011, the Federal Reserve noted its intention to sell $400 billion of shorter term Treasury securities by the end of 2012 and use the proceeds to buy longer term securities. This will extend the average maturity of the securities in the Federal Reserves portfolio. By reducing the supply of longer term securities in the market, it is the FOMCs intention to put downward pressure on longer term interest rates, including rates on financial assets that investors consider to be close substitutes for longer term Treasury securities. Further, it is their objective that the reduction in longer term interest rates, in turn, will contribute to a broad easing in financial market conditions that will provide additional stimulus to support the economic recovery. We do not anticipate that this program will have a material impact on our current securities portfolio or future investment strategy. However, it could cause our net interest margin to decline modestly. For further discussion, see the Market Risk section of our MD&A. Durbin Amendment The Durbin Amendment to the Dodd Frank Act instructed the Federal Reserve to review and establish the rate merchants pay banks for electronic clearing of debit card transactions (i.e., the interchange rate). As part of its review, the Federal Reserves objective was to establish standards for assessing debit card interchange fees receivable by debit card issuers that are reasonable and proportional to the costs incurred by the issuers for electronic debit transactions. During 2011, the Federal Reserve issued its final rule establishing standards for debit card interchange fees and prohibiting network exclusivity arrangements and routing restrictions. Under the final rule, the maximum permissible interchange fee that an issuer may receive for an electronic debit transaction is the sum of 21 cents per transaction, a 1 cent fraud prevention adjustment, and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction. This provision regarding debit card interchange fees became effective on October 1, 2011. As a result of implementing this lower debit card interchange fee structure, our 2011 fourth quarter electronic banking income declined $17.3 million from the 2011 third quarter. Resolution Plan The Federal Reserve and FDIC issued final regulations as required by section 165 of the Dodd Frank Act regarding resolution plans, also referred to as living wills. Insured depository institutions with $50 billion or more in total assets must submit to the FDIC a plan whereby the institution can be resolved by the FDIC, in the event of failure, in a manner that ensures depositors will receive access to insured funds within the required timeframes and generally ensures an orderly liquidation of the institution. Additionally, bank holding companies with assets of $50 billion or more are required to submit to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a plan that, in the event of material financial distress or failure, establishes the rapid and orderly liquidation of the company under the bankruptcy code and in a way that would not pose systemic risk to the financial system of the United States. The regulations allow for a tiered approach for complying with the requirements based on materiality of the institution. Currently, we are required to submit resolution plans as prescribed by December 31, 2013. Recent Industry Developments Recent industry events and related supervisory guidance brought about by the continued weak housing market have caused us to evaluate certain aspects of our mortgage operations, including a review of our MSR valuation. Mortgage Servicing Rights MSR fair values are estimated based on residential mortgage servicing revenue in excess of estimated market costs to service the underlying loans. Historically, the estimated market cost to service has been stable. Due to changes in the regulatory environment related to loan servicing and foreclosure activities since 2008 in reaction to the housing crises, costs to service mortgages are likely to increase, though the potential impact on the market costs to service remains uncertain. Certain large residential mortgage loan servicers entered into consent orders with banking regulators in April 2011, which require the 27 Table of Contents servicers to remedy deficiencies and unsafe or unsound practices and to enhance residential mortgage servicing and foreclosure processes. It is unclear what impact this may ultimately have on market costs to service. 2012 Expectations As we have done since early 2010, we will continue to execute our core strategy, making selective investments in initiatives to grow long term profitability. We will remain disciplined in our growth and pricing of loans and deposits and are encouraged by the net interest margin expansion during the 2011 fourth quarter. We continue to expect credit quality to improve. We will stay focused on increasing customer cross sell, and work to improve operating efficiency. While there continues to be a high level of uncertainty and volatility surrounding the economy, late in the year we saw more encouraging signs. Over the course of 2012, net interest income is expected to show modest improvement from the 2011 fourth quarter level. The momentum we are seeing in total loan and low cost deposit growth is expected to continue. Earlier in 2012, those benefits are expected to be mostly offset by downward pressure on the net interest margin due to the anticipated continued mix shift to lower rate, higher quality loans and lower securities reinvestment rates given the low absolute level of interest rates and shape of the yield curve. Our C&I portfolio is expected to continue to show meaningful growth with much of this reflecting the positive impact from strategic initiatives to expand our commercial lending expertise into areas like specialty banking, asset based lending, and equipment financing, in addition to our long standing continued support of middle market and small business lending. For automobile loans, we will continue to evaluate the use of automobile loan securitizations to limit total on balance sheet exposure as we expect to see continued strong levels of originations. On December 31, 2011, we transferred $1.3 billion of automobile loans to loans held for sale, as we plan to complete another securitization during the first half of 2012. Residential mortgages and home equity loans are expected to show modest growth, with CRE likely to experience slowing declines. We anticipate the increase in total loans to modestly outpace growth in total deposits, reflecting a heightened focus on our overall cost of funding and the continued shift towards low and no cost demand deposits and money market deposit accounts. Noninterest income is expected to show a modest increase throughout 2012 from 2011 fourth quarter levels. This is primarily due to anticipated growth in new customers and increased contribution from key fee income activities including capital markets, treasury management services, and brokerage, reflecting the impact of our cross sell and product penetration initiatives throughout the company. We anticipate making progress on improving our operating efficiency ratio; though this will likely reflect the benefit of revenue growth as we expect expenses could increase. While we will continue our focus on improving operating efficiencies, improvement could be offset by additional regulatory costs and expenses associated with strategic actions, such as in store branch partnerships and the consolidation of certain traditional branches. Nonaccrual loans and net charge offs are expected to continue to decline. The level of provision for credit losses is currently in line with our long term expectations. However, there could be some quarterly volatility given the absolute low level and the uncertain and uneven nature of the economic recovery. We anticipate the effective 2012 tax rate to approximate 35% of income before income taxes, less approximately $65 $75 million of permanent tax differences primarily related to tax exempt income, tax advantaged investments, and general business credits. 28 Table of Contents Table 2 Selected Annual Income Statements (1) Year Ended December 31, Change from 2010 Change from 2009 2011 Amount Percent 2010 Amount Percent 2009 (dollar amounts in thousands, except pershare amounts) Interest income $ 1,970,226 $ (175,166 ) (8 )% $ 2,145,392 $ (92,750 ) (4 )% $ 2,238,142 Interest expense 341,056 (185,531 ) (35 ) 526,587 (287,268 ) (35 ) 813,855 Net interest income 1,629,170 10,365 1 1,618,805 194,518 14 1,424,287 Provision for credit losses 174,059 (460,488 ) (73 ) 634,547 (1,440,124 ) (69 ) 2,074,671 Net interest income after provision for credit losses 1,455,111 470,853 48 984,258 1,634,642 N.R.

It also includes a Significant Items section that summarizes key issues important for a complete understanding of performance trends. Key consolidated balance sheet and income statement trends are discussed. All earnings per share data is reported on a diluted basis. For additional insight on financial performance, please read this section in conjunction with the Item 7: Business Segment Discussion. Significant Items Definition of Significant Items From time to time, revenue, expenses, or taxes, are impacted by items judged by us to be outside of ordinary banking activities and / or by items that, while they may be associated with ordinary banking activities, are so unusually large that their outsized impact is believed by us at that time to be infrequent or short term in nature. We refer to such items as Significant Items. Most often, these Significant Items result from factors originating outside the Company; e.g., regulatory actions / assessments, windfall gains, changes in accounting principles, one time tax assessments / refunds, litigation actions, etc. In other cases they may result from our decisions associated with significant corporate actions out of the ordinary course of business; e.g., merger / restructuring charges, recapitalization actions, goodwill impairment, etc. Even though certain revenue and expense items are naturally subject to more volatility than others due to changes in market and economic environment conditions, as a general rule volatility alone does not define a Significant Item. For example, changes in the provision for credit losses, gains / losses from investment activities, asset valuation writedowns, etc., reflect ordinary banking activities and are, therefore, typically excluded from consideration as a Significant Item. Management believes the disclosure of Significant Items in current and prior period results aids analysts/investors in better understanding corporate performance and trends so that they can ascertain which of such items, if any, they may wish to include/exclude from their analysis of the companys performance i.e., within the context of determining how that performance differed from their expectations, as well as how, if at all, to adjust their estimates of future performance accordingly. To this end, Management has adopted a practice of listing Significant Items in its external disclosure documents (e.g., earnings press releases, quarterly performance discussions, investor presentations, Forms 10 Q and 10 K). Significant Items for any particular period are not intended to be a complete list of items that may materially impact current or future period performance. Significant Items Influencing Financial Performance Comparisons Earnings comparisons among the three years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 were impacted by a number of significant items summarized below. 1. Early Extinguishment of Debt. The positive impacts relating to the early extinguishment of debt on our reported results were: $9.7 million ($0.01 per common share) in 2011 and $141.0 million ($0.18 per common share) in 2009. These amounts were recorded as reductions to noninterest expense. 2. Visa&reg;. Prior to the Visa&reg; IPO occurring in March 2008, Visa&reg; was owned by its member banks, which included the Bank. As a result of this ownership, we received Class B shares of Visa&reg; stock at the time of the Visa&reg; IPO. In the 2009 second quarter, we sold these Visa&reg; stock shares, resulting in a $31.4 million pretax gain ($.04 per common share). This amount was recorded to noninterest income. In 2011, a $6.4 million derivative loss due to an increase in the liability associated with the sale of these shares was recorded to noninterest income. 31 Table of Contents 3. Litigation Reserve. During the 2011 first quarter, $17.0 million of additions to litigation reserves were recorded as other noninterest expense. This resulted in a negative impact of $0.01 per common share. 4. TARP Capital Purchase Program Repurchase. During the 2010 fourth quarter, we issued $920.0 million of our common stock and $300.0 million of subordinated debt. The net proceeds, along with other available funds, were used to repurchase all $1.4 billion of TARP Capital that we issued to the Treasury under its TARP Capital Purchase Program in 2008. As part of this transaction, there was a deemed dividend that did not impact net income, but resulted in a negative impact of $0.08 per common share for 2010. 5. Goodwill Impairment. The impacts of goodwill impairment on our reported results were as follows: During the 2009 first quarter, bank stock prices, including ours, experienced a steep decline. Our stock price declined 78% from $7.66 per share at December 31, 2008, to $1.66 per share at March 31, 2009. Given this significant decline, we conducted an interim test for goodwill impairment. As a result, we recorded a noncash $2,602.7 million ($4.88 per common share) pretax charge. (See Goodwill discussion located within the Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Significant Estimates section for additional information.) During the 2009 second quarter, a pretax goodwill impairment of $4.2 million ($0.01 per common share) was recorded relating to the sale of a small payments related business in July 2009. 6. Franklin Relationship. Our relationship with Franklin was acquired in the 2007 Sky Financial acquisition. Significant events relating to this relationship, and the impacts of those events on our reported results, were as follows: On March 31, 2009, we restructured our relationship with Franklin. As a result of this restructuring, a nonrecurring net tax benefit of $159.9 million ($0.30 per common share) was recorded in the 2009 first quarter. Also, and although earnings were not significantly impacted, commercial NCOs increased $128.3 million as the previously established $130.0 million Franklin specific ALLL was utilized to writedown the acquired mortgages and OREO collateral to fair value. During the 2010 first quarter, a $38.2 million ($0.05 per common share) net tax benefit was recognized, primarily reflecting the increase in the net deferred tax asset relating to the assets acquired from the March 31, 2009 restructuring. During the 2010 second quarter, the portfolio of Franklin related loans ($333.0 million of residential mortgages and $64.7 million of home equity loans) was transferred to loans held for sale. At the time of the transfer, the loans were marked to the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell of $323.4 million, resulting in $75.5 million of charge offs, and the provision for credit losses commensurately increased $75.5 million ($0.07 per common share). During the 2010 third quarter, the remaining Franklin related residential mortgage and home equity loans were sold at essentially book value. 7. Preferred Stock Conversion. During the 2009 first and second quarters, we converted 114,109 and 92,384 shares, respectively, of Series A 8.50% Non cumulative Perpetual Preferred (Series A Preferred Stock) stock into common stock. As part of these transactions, there was a deemed dividend that did not impact net income, but resulted in a negative impact of $0.11 per common share for 2009. (See Capital discussion located within the Risk Management and Capital section for additional information.) 8. Other Significant Items Influencing Earnings Performance Comparisons. In addition to the items discussed separately in this section, a number of other items impacted 2009 financial results. These included: $23.6 million ($0.03 per common share) negative impact due to a special FDIC insurance premium assessment. This amount was recorded to noninterest expense. $12.8 million ($0.02 per common share) benefit to provision for income taxes, representing a reduction to the previously established capital loss carry forward valuation allowance. 32 Table of Contents The following table reflects the earnings impact of the above mentioned significant items for periods affected by this Results of Operations discussion: Table 3 Significant Items Influencing Earnings Performance Comparison (1) 2011 2010 2009 After tax EPS After tax EPS After tax EPS (dollar amounts in thousands, except per shareamounts) Net income (loss) GAAP $ 542,613 $ 312,347 $ (3,094,179 ) Earnings per share, after tax $ 0.59 $ 0.19 $ (6.14 ) Change from prior year $ 0.40 6.33 (5.70 ) Change from prior year % 211 % N.R. % N.R % Significant items favorable (unfavorable) impact: Earnings(2) EPS(3) Earnings(2) EPS(3) Earnings(2) EPS(3) Litigation reserves addition $ (17,028 ) $ (0.01 ) $ $ $ $ Visa&reg; related derivative loss (6,385 ) Net tax benefit recognized(4) 38,222 0.05 Franklin related loans transferred to held for sale (75,500 ) (0.07 ) Franklin relationship restructuring(4) 159,895 0.30 Gain related to sale of Visa&reg; stock 31,362 0.04 Deferred tax valuation allowance benefit(4) 12,847 0.02 Goodwill impairment (2,606,944 ) (4.89 ) FDIC special assessment (23,555 ) (0.03 ) Gain on early extinguishment of debt 9,697 0.01 141,024 0.18 Preferred stock conversion deemed dividend (0.08 ) (0.11 ) N.R.

Pretax, Pre provision Income Trends One non GAAP performance measurement that we believe is useful in analyzing underlying performance trends, particularly in times of economic stress, is pretax, pre provision income. This is the level of earnings adjusted to exclude the impact of: (a) provision expense, which is excluded because its absolute level is elevated and volatile in times of economic stress, (b) investment securities gains/losses, which are excluded because securities market valuations may also become particularly volatile in times of economic stress, (c) amortization of intangibles expense, which is excluded because the return on tangible equity common equity is a key measurement that we use to gauge performance trends, and (d) certain other items identified by us (see Significant Items above) that we believe may distort our underlying performance trends. With our credit costs now returning to more normal levels, going forward we do not intend to report a PTPP metric. 33 Table of Contents The following table reflects pretax, pre provision income for the past three years: Table 4 Pretax, Pre provision Income (1) Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (dollar amounts in thousands) Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes $ 707,234 $ 352,311 $ (3,678,183 ) Add: Provision for credit losses 174,059 634,547 2,074,671 Less: Securities gains (losses) (3,681 ) (274 ) (10,249 ) Add: Amortization of intangibles 53,318 60,478 68,307 Less: Significant Items Litigation reserves addition (17,028 ) Visa&reg; related derivative loss (6,385 ) Gain related to Visa&reg; stock 31,362 Goodwill impairment (2,606,944 ) FDIC special assessment (23,555 ) Gain on early extinguishment of debt 9,697 141,024 Total pretax, pre provision income $ 952,008 $ 1,047,610 $ 933,157 Change in total pretax, pre provision income: Amount $ (95,602 ) $ 114,453 $ (58,768 ) Percent (9 )% 12 % (6 )% (1) See Additional Disclosures section. Pretax, pre provision income was $952.0 million in 2011, down $95.6 million, or 9%, from the prior year. As discussed in the sections that follow, the decrease primarily reflected the negative impact from lower noninterest income and higher noninterest expense as compared to the prior year. Net Interest Income / Average Balance Sheet Our primary source of revenue is net interest income, which is the difference between interest income from earning assets (primarily loans, securities, and direct financing leases), and interest expense of funding sources (primarily interest bearing deposits and borrowings). Earning asset balances and related funding sources, as well as changes in the levels of interest rates, impact net interest income. The difference between the average yield on earning assets and the average rate paid for interest bearing liabilities is the net interest spread. Noninterest bearing sources of funds, such as demand deposits and shareholders equity, also support earning assets. The impact of the noninterest bearing sources of funds, often referred to as free funds, is captured in the net interest margin, which is calculated as net interest income divided by average earning assets. Both the net interest margin and net interest spread are presented on a fully taxable equivalent basis, which means that tax free interest income has been adjusted to a pretax equivalent income, assuming a 35% tax rate. 34 Table of Contents The following table shows changes in fully taxable equivalent interest income, interest expense, and net interest income due to volume and rate variances for major categories of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities.

(3) For purposes of this analysis, nonaccrual loans are reflected in the average balances of loans. 37 Table of Contents 2011 vs. 2010 Fully taxable equivalent net interest income for 2011 increased $14.2 million, or 1%, from 2010. This reflected the favorable impact of a $1.2 billion, or 2%, increase in average earning assets, partially offset by a 6 basis point decline in the net interest margin. The increase in average earning assets reflected: $1.6 billion, or 4%, increase in average total loans and leases. Partially offset by: $0.4 billion, or 4%, decrease average total available for sale and other securities. The 6 basis point decline in the net interest margin reflected lower loan and securities yields partially offset by the positive impacts of growth in low cost deposits and lower deposit pricing. The $1.6 billion, or 4%, increase in average total loans and leases from the prior year primarily reflected: $1.2 billion, or 9%, increase in the average C&I portfolio due to a combination of factors. This included benefits from our strategic initiatives focusing on large corporate, asset based lending, and equipment finance. In addition, we continued to see growth in more traditional middle market, business banking, and automobile floorplan loans. This growth was evident despite utilization rates that remained well below historical norms. $1.0 billion, or 20%, increase in the average automobile portfolio. Automobile lending is a core competency and continues to be an area of targeted growth. The growth from the prior year exhibited further penetration within our historical geographic footprint, as well as the positive impacts of our expansion into Eastern Pennsylvania and five New England states. Origination quality remains high as measured by all of our internal quality metrics. $0.4 billion, or 5%, increase in average home equity loans. Partially offset by: $1.0 billion, or 14%, decrease in the average CRE portfolio reflecting the continued execution of our plan to reduce the total CRE exposure, primarily in the noncore CRE portfolio. This reduction is expected to continue, reflecting the combined impact of amortization, pay downs, refinancing, and restructures. The $1.5 billion, or 4%, increase in average total deposits from the prior year reflected: $1.9 billion, or 5%, increase in average total core deposits. The drivers of this change were a $1.8 billion, or 26%, increase in average noninterest bearing demand deposits and a $1.6 billion, or 13%, increase in average money market deposits, partially offset by a $1.5 billion, or 16%, decline in average core certificates of deposits. Partially offset by: $0.2 billion, or 33%, decline in average other domestic deposits of $250,000 or more, which reflected a strategy of reducing such noncore funding. 2010 vs. 2009 Fully taxable equivalent net interest income for 2010 increased $194.1 million, or 14%, from 2009. This reflected the favorable impact of a $1.3 billion, or 3%, increase in average earning assets, due to a $2.9 billion, or 45%, increase in average total investment securities, which was partially offset by a $1.4 billion, or 4%, decrease in average total loans and leases. Also contributing to the increase in net interest income was a 33 basis point increase in the fully taxable net interest margin to 3.44% in 2010 from 3.11% in 2009. The $1.4 billion, or 4%, decrease in average total loans and leases primarily reflected: $2.6 billion, or 12%, decline in average total commercial loans. The decline in average CRE loans reflected our planned efforts to shrink this portfolio through payoffs and paydowns, as well as the impact 38 Table of Contents of NCOs. The decline in average C&I loans reflected a general decrease in borrowing as evidenced by a decline in line of credit utilization, NCO activity, and the reclassification in the 2010 first quarter of variable rate demand notes to municipal securities. Partially offset by: $1.2 billion, or 7%, increase in average total consumer loans. This growth reflected a $1.3 billion, or 38%, increase in average automobile loans and leases. On January 1, 2010, we adopted the new accounting standard ASC 810 Consolidation, resulting in the consolidation of an off balance sheet securitization, which increased our automobile loan portfolio by $0.5 billion at December 31, 2010. Underlying growth in automobile loans continued to be strong, reflecting a significant increase in loan originations in 2010 as compared to 2009. The expansion into Eastern Pennsylvania and the five New England states also had a positive impact on our volume. Total average investment securities increased $2.9 billion, or 45%, reflecting the deployment of the cash from core deposit growth and loan runoff over this period, as well as the proceeds from 2009 capital actions. The $1.3 billion, or 3%, increase in average total deposits reflected: $3.1 billion, or 9%, growth in total core deposits. The primary driver of this growth was a 63% increase in average money market deposits. Partially offsetting this growth was a 23% decline in average core certificates of deposit. Partially offset by: $1.7 billion, or 39%, decline in average noncore deposits, reflecting a managed decline in public fund deposits as well as planned efforts to reduce our reliance on noncore funding sources. Provision for Credit Losses (This section should be read in conjunction with Significant Item 6 and the Credit Risk section.) The provision for credit losses is the expense necessary to maintain the ALLL and the AULC at levels appropriate to absorb our estimate of probable inherent credit losses in the loan and lease portfolio and the portfolio of unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. The provision for credit losses in 2011 was $174.1 million, down $460.5 million, or 73%, from 2010, primarily reflecting the combination of lower NCOs, NPAs, and commercial Criticized loans as a result of improvement in the underlying quality of the loan portfolio. The provision for credit losses in 2011 was $263.0 less than total NCOs (see Credit Quality discussion). Noninterest Income (This section should be read in conjunction with Significant Item 2.) 39 Table of Contents The following table reflects noninterest income for the past three years: Table 8 Noninterest Income Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change from 2010 Change from 2009 2011 Amount Percent 2010 Amount Percent 2009 (dollar amounts in thousands) Service charges on deposit accounts $ 243,507 $ (23,508 ) (9 )% $ 267,015 $ (35,784 ) (12 )% $ 302,799 Trust services 119,382 6,827 6 112,555 8,916 9 103,639 Electronic banking 111,697 1,463 1 110,234 10,083 10 100,151 Mortgage banking income 83,408 (92,374 ) (53 ) 175,782 63,484 57 112,298 Brokerage income 80,367 11,512 17 68,855 4,012 6 64,843 Insurance income 69,470 (6,943 ) (9 ) 76,413 3,087 4 73,326 Bank owned life insurance income 62,336 1,270 2 61,066 6,194 11 54,872 Capital markets fees 36,540 12,654 53 23,886 13,035 120 10,851 Gain (loss) on sale of loans 31,944 25,669 409 6,275 13,851 N.R.

Not relevant, as denominator of calculation is a loss in prior period compared with income in current period. 2011 vs. 2010 Noninterest income decreased $61.2 million, or 6%, from the prior year, primarily reflecting: $92.4 million, or 53%, decrease in mortgage banking income. This primarily reflected a $52.8 million decrease in net MSR activity and a $49.2 million, or 42%, decrease in origination and secondary marketing income, as originations decreased 28% from the prior year. $23.5 million, or 9%, decrease in service charges on deposit accounts, reflecting lower personal service charges due to the implementation of the amendment to Reg E and our Fair Play consumer banking initiatives. $19.2 million, or 42%, decrease in automobile operating lease income reflecting the impact of a declining portfolio as a result of having exited that business in 2008. Partially offset by: $25.7 million, or 409%, increase in gain on sale of loans primarily due to a $15.5 million automobile loan securitization gain on sale in the 2011 third quarter and SBA related loan fees and gain on loan sales increased by $10.2 million in 2011. $24.8 million, or 26%, increase in other income, of which $12.1 million was associated with the sale of interest rate protection products and mezzanine gains and a $6.7 million reimbursement from the conversion to a new debit card processor, offset by a $6.4 million Visa&reg; related derivative loss. $12.7 million, or 53%, increase in capital markets fees primarily due to increases in trading derivative income. $11.5 million, or 17%, increase in brokerage income, primarily reflecting increased sales of investment products. 40 Table of Contents 2010 vs. 2009 Noninterest income increased $36.2 million, or 4%, from 2009, primarily reflecting: $63.5 million, or 57%, increase in mortgage banking income. This primarily reflected a $45.4 million increase in net MSR activity and a $22.7 million, or 24%, increase in origination and secondary marketing income, as originations increased 4% from the prior year. $10.1 million, or 10%, increase in electronic banking, reflecting increased debit card transaction volume. $10.0 million benefit from lower securities losses. $8.9 million, or 9%, increase in trust services income, with 50% of the increase due to increases in asset market values, and the remainder reflecting growth in new business. $6.2 million, or 11%, increase in insurance benefits associated with bank owned life insurance. $4.0 million, or 6%, increase in brokerage income, primarily reflecting an increase in fixed income product sales, partially offset by lower annuity income. Partially offset by: $35.8 million, or 12%, decline in service charges on deposit accounts reflecting lower personal service charges due to the implementation of the amendment to Reg E and our Fair Play consumer banking initiatives. $54.8 million, or 37%, decline in other income. 2009 included a $31.4 million gain from the sale of Visa&reg; Class B stock. Noninterest Expense (This section should be read in conjunction with Significant Items 1, 3, 5, and 8.) 41 Table of Contents The following table reflects noninterest expense for the past three years: Table 9 Noninterest Expense Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change from 2010 Change from 2009 2011 Amount Percent 2010 Amount Percent 2009 (dollar amounts in thousands) Personnel costs $ 892,534 $ 93,561 12 % $ 798,973 $ 98,491 14 % $ 700,482 Outside data processing and other services 187,195 27,947 18 159,248 11,153 8 148,095 Net occupancy 109,129 1,267 1 107,862 2,589 2 105,273 Equipment 92,544 6,624 8 85,920 2,803 3 83,117 Deposit and other insurance expense 77,692 (19,856 ) (20 ) 97,548 (16,282 ) (14 ) 113,830 Marketing 75,627 9,703 15 65,924 32,875 99 33,049 Professional services 70,595 (18,183 ) (20 ) 88,778 12,412 16 76,366 Amortization of intangibles 53,318 (7,160 ) (12 ) 60,478 (7,829 ) (11 ) 68,307 Automobile operating lease expense 20,018 (17,016 ) (46 ) 37,034 (6,326 ) (15 ) 43,360 OREO and foreclosure expense 18,006 (21,043 ) (54 ) 39,049 (54,850 ) (58 ) 93,899 Goodwill impairment (2,606,944 ) (100 ) 2,606,944 Gain on early extinguishment of debt (9,697 ) (9,697 ) 147,442 (100 ) (147,442 ) Other expense 141,539 8,548 6 132,991 24,828 23 108,163 Total noninterest expense $ 1,728,500 $ 54,695 3 % $ 1,673,805 $ (2,359,638 ) (59 )% $ 4,033,443 Number of employees (full time equivalent), at period end 11,245 (96 ) (1 )% 11,341 1,069 10 % 10,272 2011 vs. 2010 Noninterest expense increased $54.7 million, or 3%, from 2010, and primarily reflected: $93.6 million, or 12%, increase in personnel costs, primarily reflecting an increase in salary and benefit related expenses. $27.9 million, or 18%, increase in outside data processing and other services, reflecting the costs associated with the conversion to a new debit card processor and the implementation of strategic initiatives. $9.7 million, or 15%, increase in marketing expense, reflecting higher advertising costs. $8.5 million, or 6%, increase in other expense primarily reflecting the 2011 first quarter $17.0 million addition to litigation reserves (see Significant items), partially offset by a $6.1 million decrease in representation and warranty expenses. Partially offset by: $21.0 million, or 54%, decrease in OREO and foreclosure expenses as OREO balances declined 42% in 2011. 42 Table of Contents $19.9 million, or 20%, decrease in deposit and other insurance expenses. $18.2 million, or 20%, decrease in professional services, reflecting lower legal costs as collection activities declined and consulting expenses. $17.0 million, or 46%, decrease in automobile operating lease expense as that portfolio continued to run off having exited that business in 2008. $9.7 gain on the early extinguishment of debt related to the exchange of certain trust preferred securities. 2010 vs. 2009 Noninterest expense decreased $2,359.6 million from 2009. Excluding the 2009 goodwill impairment of $2,606.9 million, noninterest expense increased $247.3 million and primarily reflected: The absence of $147.4 million in gains on early extinguishment of debt in 2009. $98.5 million, or 14%, increase in personnel costs, primarily reflecting a 10% increase in full time equivalent staff in support of strategic initiatives, as well as higher commissions and other incentive expenses, and the reinstatement of certain employee benefits such as 401(k) plan matching contribution, merit increases, and bonuses. $32.9 million, or 99%, increase in marketing expense, reflecting increases in branding and product advertising activities in support of strategic initiatives. $24.8 million, or 23%, increase in other expense, reflecting $13.1 million increase associated with the provision for repurchase losses related to representations and warranties made on mortgage loans sold, as well as increased travel and miscellaneous fees. Partially offset by: $54.9 million, or 58%, decline in OREO and foreclosure expense. $16.3 million, or 14%, decrease in deposit and other insurance expense. This decrease was comprised of two components: (1) $23.6 million FDIC special assessment during the 2009 second quarter, and (2) increased assessments due to higher levels of deposits. Provision for Income Taxes (This section should be read in conjunction with Significant Items 6 and 8, and Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) 2011 versus 2010 The provision for income taxes was $164.6 million for 2011 compared with a provision of $40.0 million in 2010. Both years included the benefits from tax exempt income, tax advantaged investments, and general business credits. At December 31, 2011, we had a net deferred tax asset of $364.8 million. Based on both positive and negative evidence and our level of forecasted future taxable income, there was no impairment to the deferred tax asset at December 31, 2011. The total disallowed deferred tax asset for regulatory capital purposes decreased to $39.1 million at December 31, 2011 compared to the total disallowed deferred tax asset of $161.3 million at December 31, 2010. We file income tax returns with the IRS and various state, city, and foreign jurisdictions. Federal income tax audits have been completed for tax years through 2007. We have appealed certain proposed adjustments resulting from the IRS examination of our 2006 and 2007 tax returns. We believe our positions related to such proposed adjustments are correct and supported by applicable statutes, regulations, and judicial authority, and intend to vigorously defend them. During 2011, we entered into discussions with the Appeals Division of the IRS. It is possible the ultimate resolution of the proposed adjustments, if unfavorable, may be material to the results of 43 Table of Contents operations in the period it occurs. Nevertheless, although no assurances can be given, we believe that the resolution of these examinations will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position. In the third quarter 2011, the IRS began its examination of our 2008 and 2009 consolidated federal income tax returns. Various state and other jurisdictions remain open to examination, including Kentucky, Indiana, Michigan, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Illinois. 2010 versus 2009 The provision for income taxes was $40.0 million for 2010 compared with a benefit of $584.0 million in 2009. Both years included the benefits from tax exempt income, tax advantaged investments, and general business credits. In 2010, we entered into an asset monetization transaction that generated a tax benefit of $63.6 million. Also, in 2010, undistributed previously reported earnings of a foreign subsidiary of $142.3 million were distributed and an additional $49.8 million of tax expense was recorded. The tax benefit in 2009 was impacted by the pretax loss combined with the favorable impacts of the Franklin restructuring in 2009 and the reduction of the capital loss valuation reserve, offset by the nondeductible portion of the 2009 goodwill impairment. The Franklin restructuring in 2009 resulted in a $159.9 million net deferred tax asset equal to the amount of income and equity that was included in our operating results for 2009. During 2010, a $43.6 million net tax benefit was recognized, primarily reflecting the increase in the net deferred tax asset relating to the assets acquired from the March 31, 2009 Franklin restructuring. RISK MANAGEMENT AND CAPITAL Risk awareness, identification and assessment, reporting, and active management are key elements in overall risk management. We manage risk to an aggregate moderate to low risk profile through a control framework and by monitoring and responding to potential risks. Controls include, among others, effective segregation of duties, access, authorization and reconciliation procedures, as well as staff education and a disciplined assessment process. We identify primary risks, and the sources of those risks, within each business unit. We utilize Risk and Control Self Assessments (RCSA) to identify exposure risks. Through this RCSA process, we continually assess the effectiveness of controls associated with the identified risks, regularly monitor risk profiles and material exposure to losses, and identify stress events and scenarios to which we may be exposed. Our chief risk officer is responsible for ensuring that appropriate systems of controls are in place for managing and monitoring risk across the Company. Potential risk concerns are shared with the Risk Management Committee and the board of directors, as appropriate. Our internal audit department performs on going independent reviews of the risk management process and ensures the adequacy of documentation. The results of these reviews are reported regularly to the audit committee of the board of directors. We believe our primary risk exposures are credit, market, liquidity, operational, and compliance risk. Credit risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in a counterpartys ability to meet their financial obligations under agreed upon terms. Market risk represents the risk of loss due to changes in the market value of assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates, exchange rates, and equity prices. Liquidity risk arises from the possibility that funds may not be available to satisfy current or future commitments resulting from external macro market issues, investor and customer perception of financial strength, and events unrelated to us, such as war, terrorism, or financial institution market specific issues. In addition, the mix and maturity structure of Huntingtons balance sheet, amount of on hand cash and unencumbered securities and the availability of contingent sources of funding, can have an impact on Huntingtons ability to satisfy current or future funding commitments. We manage liquidity risk at both the Bank and the parent company. Operational risk arises from our inherent day to day operations that could result in losses due to human error, inadequate or failed internal systems and controls, and external events. Compliance risk exposes us to money penalties, enforcement actions or other sanctions as a result of nonconformance with laws, rules, and regulations that apply to the financial services industry. 44 Table of Contents Some of the more significant processes used to manage and control credit, market, liquidity, operational, and compliance risks are described in the following paragraphs. Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a counterparty is not able to meet the agreed upon terms of the financial obligation. The majority of our credit risk is associated with lending activities, as the acceptance and management of credit risk is central to profitable lending. We also have significant credit risk associated with our available for sale and other investment and held to maturity securities portfolio (see Notes 4 and 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). We engage with other financial counterparties for a variety of purposes including investing, asset and liability management, mortgage banking, and for trading activities. Given the current level of global financial issues, we believe it is important to provide clarity around our exposure in this specific area (see European Sovereign Debt and Counterparty Exposure section). While there is credit risk associated with derivative activity, we believe this exposure is minimal. The significant change in the economic conditions and the resulting changes in borrower behavior over the past several years resulted in our continuing focus on the identification, monitoring, and managing of our credit risk. In addition to the traditional credit risk mitigation strategies of credit policies and processes, market risk management activities, and portfolio diversification, we added more quantitative measurement capabilities utilizing external data sources, enhanced use of modeling technology, and internal stress testing processes. The continued expansion of our portfolio management resources demonstrates our commitment to maintaining an aggregate moderate to low risk profile. In our efforts to continue to identify risk mitigation techniques, we have focused on product design features, origination policies, and treatment strategies for delinquent or stressed borrowers. The maximum level of credit exposure to individual credit borrowers is limited by policy guidelines based on the perceived risk of each borrower or related group of borrowers. All authority to grant commitments is delegated through the independent credit administration function and is closely monitored and regularly updated. Concentration risk is managed through limits on loan type, geography, industry, and loan quality factors. We continue to focus predominantly on extending credit to retail and commercial customers with existing or expandable relationships within our primary banking markets, although we will consider lending opportunities outside our primary markets if we believe the associated risks are acceptable and aligned with strategic initiatives. We continue to add new borrowers that meet our targeted risk and profitability profile. Although we offer a broad set of products, we continue to develop new lending products and opportunities. Each of these new products and opportunities goes through a rigorous development and approval process prior to implementation to ensure our overall objective of maintaining an aggregate moderate to low risk portfolio profile. The checks and balances in the credit process and the independence of the credit administration and risk management functions are designed to appropriately assess the level of credit risk being accepted, facilitate the early recognition of credit problems when they occur, and to provide for effective problem asset management and resolution. For example, we do not extend additional credit to delinquent borrowers except in certain circumstances that substantially improve our overall repayment or collateral coverage position. Asset quality metrics improved significantly in 2011, reflecting our proactive portfolio management initiatives as well as some stabilization in a still relatively weak economy. The improvements in the asset quality metrics, including lower levels of NPAs, commercial Criticized and Classified assets, and delinquencies have all been achieved through these policies and commitments. Our portfolio management policies demonstrate our commitment to maintaining an aggregate moderate to low risk profile. To that end, we continue to expand resources in our risk management areas. Although credit quality significantly improved in 2011, the weak residential real estate market and U.S. economy continued to negatively impact us and the financial services industry as a whole. The pronounced 45 Table of Contents downturn in the residential real estate market that began in early 2007 resulted in significantly lower residential real estate values and higher delinquencies and NCOs, including loans to builders and developers of residential real estate. In addition, continued high unemployment, among other economic conditions, throughout 2010 and 2011, slowed any significant recovery from the 2008 2009 U.S. recession. As a result, we continued to experience higher than historical levels of delinquencies and NCOs in our loan portfolios, with some continued negative pressure on the value of our investment securities backed by residential assets. Loan and Lease Credit Exposure Mix At December 31, 2011, our loans and leases totaled $38.9 billion, representing a 2% increase from December 31, 2010, primarily reflecting growth in the C&I, residential mortgage, and home equity portfolios. These increases were partially offset by a decline in the automobile portfolio reflecting the 2011 third quarter automobile securitization and the transfer of automobile loans to loans held for sale related to a planned automobile securitization (see Automobile Portfolio discussion), and the continued decline of the CRE portfolio reflecting our planned strategy to reduce our noncore CRE exposure. At December 31, 2011, commercial loans totaled $20.5 billion, and represented 52% of our total credit exposure. Our commercial loan portfolio is diversified along product type, customer size, and geography within our footprint, and is comprised of the following (see Commercial Credit discussion): C&I loans C&I loans are made to commercial customers for use in normal business operations to finance working capital needs, equipment purchases, or other projects. The majority of these borrowers are customers doing business within our geographic regions. C&I loans are generally underwritten individually and secured with the assets of the company and or the personal guarantee of the business owners. The financing of owner occupied facilities is considered a C&I loan even though there is improved real estate as collateral. This treatment is a function of the credit decision process, which focuses on cash flow from operations of the business to repay the debt. The operation, sale, rental, or refinancing of the real estate is not considered the primary repayment source for these types of loans. As we look to grow our C&I loan portfolio, we have further developed our ABL capabilities by adding experienced ABL professionals to take advantage of market opportunities resulting in better leveraging of the manufacturing base in our primary markets. Also, our Equipment Finance area is targeting larger equipment financings in the manufacturing sector in addition to our core products. We also expanded our large corporate banking group with sufficient resources to ensure we appropriately recognize and manage the risks associated with this type of lending. CRE loans CRE loans consist of loans for income producing real estate properties, real estate investment trusts, and real estate developers. We mitigate our risk on these loans by requiring collateral values that exceed the loan amount and underwriting the loan with projected cash flow in excess of the debt service requirement. These loans are made to finance properties such as apartment buildings, office and industrial buildings, and retail shopping centers, and are repaid through cash flows related to the operation, sale, or refinance of the property. Construction CRE loans Construction CRE loans are loans to individuals, companies, or developers used for the construction of a commercial or residential property for which repayment will be generated by the sale or permanent financing of the property. Our construction CRE portfolio primarily consists of retail, residential (land, single family, and condominiums), office, and warehouse project types. Generally, these loans are for construction projects that have been presold, preleased, or have secured permanent financing, as well as loans to real estate companies with significant equity invested in each project. These loans are underwritten and managed by a specialized real estate lending group that actively monitors the construction phase and manages the loan disbursements according to the predetermined construction schedule. Total consumer loans were $18.4 billion at December 31, 2011, and represented 48% of our total credit exposure. The consumer portfolio was diversified primarily among automobile, home equity loans and lines of credit, and residential mortgages (see Consumer Credit discussion). 46 Table of Contents Automobile Automobile loans and leases are primarily comprised of loans made through automotive dealerships and include exposure in selected states outside of our primary banking markets. No state outside of our primary banking market represented more than 3% of our total automobile portfolio at December 31, 2011. In late 2011, we expanded into Minnesota and Wisconsin, and in 2010, we expanded into eastern Pennsylvania and five New England states. The expansions were based on hiring experienced colleagues within the new markets that have existing dealer relationships. We have a loan securitization strategy to maintain any growth within our established portfolio concentration limits. Home equity Home equity lending includes both home equity loans and lines of credit. This type of lending, which is secured by a first lien or second lien on the borrowers residence, allows customers to borrow against the equity in their home. Given the current low interest rate environment, many borrowers have utilized the line of credit home equity product as the primary source of financing their home versus residential mortgages. As a result, the proportion of the home equity portfolio secured by a first lien has increased significantly over the past three years, positively impacting the portfolios performance. The portfolios credit risk profile is substantially reduced when we hold a first lien position. During 2011, 70% of our home equity portfolio originations were secured by a first lien. The first lien position combined with continued high average FICO scores significantly reduces the PD associated with these loans. The combination provides a strong base when assessing the expected future performance of this portfolio. Real estate market values at the time of origination directly affect the amount of credit extended and, in the event of default, subsequent changes in these values impact the severity of losses. We actively manage the extension of credit and the amount of credit extended through a combination of criteria including financial position, debt to income policies, and LTV policy limits. Residential mortgages Residential mortgages represent loans to consumers for the purchase or refinance of a residence. These loans are generally financed over a 15 year to 30 year term, and in most cases, are extended to borrowers to finance their primary residence. Generally, our practice is to sell a significant portion of our fixed rate originations in the secondary market. As such, at December 31, 2011, 50% of our total residential mortgage portfolio were ARMs. These ARMs primarily consist of a fixed rate of interest for the first 3 to 5 years, and then adjust annually. We are subject to repurchase risk associated with residential mortgage loans sold in the secondary market. An appropriate level of accounting reserve for representations and warranties related to residential mortgage loans sold has been established to address this repurchase risk inherent in the portfolio (see Operational Risk discussion). Other consumer loans/leases Primarily consists of consumer loans not secured by real estate, including personal unsecured loans. 47 Table of Contents The table below provides the composition of our total loan and lease portfolio: Table 10 Loan and Lease Portfolio Composition At December 31, 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 (dollar amounts in millions) Commercial:(1) Commercial and industrial $ 14,699 38 % $ 13,063 34 % $ 12,888 35 % $ 13,541 33 % $ 13,126 33 % Commercial real estate: Construction 580 1 650 2 1,469 4 2,080 5 1,962 5 Commercial 5,246 13 6,001 16 6,220 17 8,018 20 7,221 18 Total commercial real estate 5,826 14 6,651 18 7,689 21 10,098 25 9,183 23 Total commercial 20,525 52 19,714 52 20,577 56 23,639 58 22,309 56 Consumer: Automobile(2) 4,458 11 5,614 15 3,390 9 4,464 11 4,294 11 Home equity 8,215 21 7,713 20 7,563 21 7,557 18 7,290 18 Residential mortgage 5,228 13 4,500 12 4,510 12 4,761 12 5,447 14 Other consumer 498 3 566 1 751 2 671 1 715 1 Total consumer 18,399 48 18,393 48 16,214 44 17,453 42 17,746 44 Total loans and leases $ 38,924 100 % $ 38,107 100 % $ 36,791 100 % $ 41,092 100 % $ 40,055 100 % (1) There were no commercial loans outstanding that would be considered a concentration of lending to a particular industry or group of industries. (2) 2011 included a decrease of $1.3 billion resulting from the transfer of automobile loans to loans held for a sale reflecting an automobile securitization transaction planned for the first half of 2012. 2010 included an increase of $0.5 billion resulting from the adoption of a new accounting standard to consolidate a previously off balance sheet automobile loan securitization transaction. 48 Table of Contents The table below provides our total loan and lease portfolio segregated by the type of collateral securing the loan or lease: Table 11 Total Loan and Lease Portfolio by Collateral Type At December 31, 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 (dollar amounts in millions) Secured loans: Real estate commercial $ 9,557 25 % $ 10,389 27 % $ 11,286 31 % $ 13,121 32 % $ 13,149 33 % Real estate consumer 13,444 35 12,214 32 12,176 33 12,318 30 12,737 32 Vehicles 6,021 16 7,134 19 4,600 13 6,063 15 5,722 14 Receivables/Inventory 4,450 12 3,763 10 3,582 10 3,915 10 3,391 8 Machinery/Equipment 1,994 5 1,766 5 1,772 5 1,916 5 1,715 4 Securities/Deposits 800 2 734 2 1,145 3 862 2 788 2 Other 1,018 1 990 2 1,124 2 1,231 2 1,130 3 Total secured loans and leases 37,284 96 36,990 97 35,685 97 39,426 96 38,632 96 Unsecured loans and leases 1,640 4 1,117 3 1,106 3 1,666 4 1,423 4 Total loans and leases $ 38,924 100 % $ 38,107 100 % $ 36,791 100 % $ 41,092 100 % $ 40,055 100 % Commercial Credit The primary factors considered in commercial credit approvals are the financial strength of the borrower, assessment of the borrowers management capabilities, cash flows from operations, industry sector trends, type and sufficiency of collateral, type of exposure, transaction structure, and the general economic outlook. While these are the primary factors considered, there are a number of other factors that may be considered in the decision process. For all loans exceeding $5.0 million, we utilize a centralized senior loan committee, led by our chief credit officer. For loans less than $5.0 million, with the exception of small business loans, credit officers who understand each local region and are experienced in the industries and loan structures of the requested credit exposure are involved in all loan decisions and have the primary credit authority. For small business loans, we utilize a centralized loan approval process for standard products and structures. In this centralized decision environment, certain individuals who understand each local region may make credit extension decisions to preserve our commitment to the communities we operate in. In addition to disciplined and consistent judgmental factors, a sophisticated credit scoring process is used as a primary evaluation tool in the determination of approving a loan within the centralized loan approval process. In commercial lending, on going credit management is dependent on the type and nature of the loan. We monitor all significant exposures on an on going basis. All commercial credit extensions are assigned internal risk ratings reflecting the borrowers PD and LGD (severity of loss). This two dimensional rating methodology provides granularity in the portfolio management process. The PD is rated and applied at the borrower level. The LGD is rated and applied based on the type of credit extension and the quality and lien position associated with the underlying collateral. The internal risk ratings are assessed at origination and updated at each periodic monitoring event. There is also extensive macro portfolio management analysis on an on going basis. We continually review and adjust our risk rating criteria based on actual experience, which provides us with the current risk level in the portfolio and is the basis for determining an appropriate allowance amount for the commercial portfolio. To provide consistent oversight, a centralized portfolio management team monitors and reports on the performance of the entire commercial portfolio, including small business loans. 49 Table of Contents In addition to the initial credit analysis conducted during the approval process, our Credit Review group performs testing to provide an independent review and assessment of the quality and / or risk of new loan originations. This group is part of our Risk Management area, and conducts portfolio reviews on a risk based cycle to evaluate individual loans, validate risk ratings, as well as test the consistency of the credit processes. Our standardized loan grading system considers many components that directly correlate loan quality and likelihood of repayment, one of which is guarantor support. On an annual basis, or more frequently if warranted, we consider, among other things, the guarantors reputation and credit worthiness, along with various key financial metrics such as liquidity and net worth, assuming such information is available. Our assessment of the guarantors credit strength, or lack thereof, is reflected in our risk ratings for such loans, which is directly tied to, and an integral component of, our ALLL methodology. When a loan goes to impaired status, viable guarantor support is considered in the determination of the recognition of loan loss. If our assessment of the guarantors credit strength yields an inherent capacity to perform, we will seek repayment from the guarantor as part of the collection process and have done so successfully. However, we do not formally track the repayment success from guarantors. Substantially all commercial loans categorized as Classified (see Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) are managed by our SAD. The SAD is a specialized group of credit professionals that handle the day to day management of workouts, commercial recoveries, and problem loan sales. Its responsibilities include developing and implementing action plans, assessing risk ratings, and determining the appropriateness of the allowance, the accrual status, and the ultimate collectability of the Classified loan portfolio. Our commercial loan portfolio, including CRE loans, is diversified by product type, customer size, and geography throughout our footprint. No outstanding commercial loans and leases comprised an industry or geographic concentration of lending. Certain segments of our commercial loan portfolio are discussed in further detail below. C&I PORTFOLIO The C&I portfolio is comprised of loans to businesses where the source of repayment is associated with the on going operations of the business. Generally, the loans are secured with the financing of the borrowers assets, such as equipment, accounts receivable, or inventory. In many cases, the loans are secured by real estate, although the operation, sale, or refinancing of the real estate is not a primary source of repayment for the loan. For loans secured by real estate, appropriate appraisals are obtained at origination and updated on an as needed basis in compliance with regulatory requirements. There were no commercial loan segments considered an industry or geographic concentration of lending. Currently, higher risk segments of the C&I portfolio include loans to borrowers supporting the home building industry, contractors, and automotive suppliers. We manage the risks inherent in this portfolio through origination policies, a defined loan concentration policy with established limits, on going loan level reviews and portfolio level reviews, recourse requirements, and continuous portfolio risk management activities. Our origination policies for this portfolio include loan product type specific policies such as LTV and debt service coverage ratios, as applicable. While C&I borrowers have been challenged by the weak economy, problem loans have trended downward, reflecting a combination of proactive risk identification as well as some relative improvement in economic conditions. Nevertheless, some borrowers may no longer have sufficient capital to withstand the extended stress. As a result, these borrowers may not be able to comply with the original terms of their credit agreements. We continue to focus attention on the portfolio management process to proactively identify borrowers that may be facing financial difficulty to assess all potential solutions. The impact of the economic environment is further evidenced by the level of line of credit activity, as borrowers continued to maintain relatively low utilization percentages. 50 Table of Contents CRE PORTFOLIO We manage the risks inherent in this portfolio specific to CRE lending, focusing on the quality of the developer, and the specifics associated with each project. Generally, we: (1) limit our loans to 80% of the appraised value of the commercial real estate, (2) require net operating cash flows to be 125% of required interest and principal payments, and (3) if the commercial real estate is nonowner occupied, require that at least 50% of the space of the project be preleased. Additionally, we established a limit to our CRE exposure of no more than our amount of Tier 1 risk based capital plus the ACL. We have been actively reducing our CRE exposure during the past three years, and our CRE exposure met this established limit at December 31, 2011. We actively monitor both geographic and project type concentrations and performance metrics of all CRE loan types, with a focus on higher risk classes. Both macro level and loan level stress test scenarios based on existing and forecast market conditions are part of the on going portfolio management process for the CRE portfolio. Dedicated real estate professionals originated the majority of the portfolio, with the remainder obtained from prior bank acquisitions. Appraisals are obtained from approved vendors, and are reviewed by an internal appraisal review group comprised of certified appraisers to ensure the quality of the valuation used in the underwriting process. The portfolio is diversified by project type and loan size, and this diversification represents a significant portion of the credit risk management strategies employed for this portfolio. Subsequent to the origination of the loan, the Credit Review group performs testing to provide an independent review and assessment of the quality of the underwriting and or risk of new loan originations. Appraisal values are obtained in conjunction with all originations and renewals, and on an as needed basis, in compliance with regulatory requirements. We continue to perform on going portfolio level reviews within the CRE portfolio. These reviews generate action plans based on occupancy levels or sales volume associated with the projects being reviewed. Property values are updated using appraisals on a regular basis to ensure appropriate decisions regarding the on going management of the portfolio reflect the changing market conditions. This highly individualized process requires working closely with all of our borrowers, as well as an in depth knowledge of CRE project lending and the market environment. Each CRE loan is classified as either core or noncore. We separated the CRE portfolio into these categories in order to provide more clarity around our portfolio management strategies and to provide additional clarity for us and our investors. We believe segregating the noncore CRE from core CRE improves our ability to understand the nature, performance prospects, and problem resolution opportunities of these segments, thus allowing us to continue to deal proactively with any emerging credit issues. A CRE loan is generally considered core when the borrower is an experienced, well capitalized developer in our Midwest footprint, and has either an established meaningful relationship with us that generates an acceptable return on capital or demonstrates the prospect of becoming one. The core CRE portfolio was $4.0 billion at December 31, 2011, representing 68% of total CRE loans. The performance of the core portfolio met our expectations based on the consistency of the asset quality metrics within the portfolio. Based on our extensive project level assessment process, including forward looking collateral valuations, we continue to believe the credit quality of the core portfolio is stable. Loans are not reclassified between the core and noncore segments based on performance, and as such, we do not anticipate an elevated level of problem loans in the core portfolio. A CRE loan is generally considered noncore based on the lack of a substantive relationship outside of the loan product, with no immediate prospects for meeting the core relationship criteria. The noncore CRE portfolio declined from $2.6 billion at December 31, 2010, to $1.8 billion at December 31, 2011, and represented 32% of total CRE loans. Of the loans in the noncore portfolio at December 31, 2011, 67% were classified as Pass, 95% had guarantors, nearly 100% were secured, and 90% were located within our geographic footprint. However, it is within the noncore portfolio where most of the credit quality challenges exist. For example, $0.2 billion, or 11%, of related outstanding balances, are classified as NALs. We expect to exit the majority of noncore CRE relationships over time through normal repayments and refinancings, possible sales should economically attractive opportunities arise, or the reclassification to a core CRE relationship if it expands to meet the core criteria. 51 Table of Contents Credit quality data regarding the ACL and NALs, segregated by core CRE loans and noncore CRE loans, is presented in the following table: Table 12 Commercial Real Estate Core vs. Noncore portfolios December 31, 2011 EndingBalance Prior NCOs ACL $ ACL % Credit Mark(1) NonaccrualLoans (dollar amounts in millions) Total core $ 3,978 $ 25 $ 125 3.14 % 3.75 % $ 26 Noncore SAD(2) 735 253 182 24.76 44.03 195 Noncore Other 1,113 17 88 7.91 9.29 9 Total noncore 1,848 270 270 14.61 25.50 204 Total commercial real estate $ 5,826 $ 295 $ 395 6.78 % 11.27 % $ 230 December 31, 2010 EndingBalance Prior NCOs ACL $ ACL % Credit Mark(1) NonaccrualLoans Total core $ 4,042 $ 5 $ 160 3.96 % 4.08 % $ 16 Noncore SAD(2) 1,400 379 329 23.50 39.80 307 Noncore Other 1,209 5 105 8.68 9.06 41 Total noncore 2,609 384 434 16.63 27.33 348 Total commercial real estate $ 6,651 $ 389 $ 594 8.93 % 13.96 % $ 364 (1) Calculated as (Prior NCOs + ACL $) / (Ending Balance + Prior NCOs) (2) Noncore loans managed by SAD, the area responsible for managing loans and relationships designated as Classified loans. As shown in the above table, the ending balance of the CRE portfolio at December 31, 2011, declined $0.8 billion, or 12%, compared with December 31, 2010. Of this decline, 81% occurred in the noncore segment of the portfolio administered by SAD, and was a result of payoffs and NCOs as we actively focused on the noncore portfolio to reduce our overall CRE exposure. This reduction demonstrates our continued commitment to achieving a materially lower risk profile in the CRE portfolio, consistent with our overall objective of maintaining an aggregate moderate to low risk profile. We anticipate further noncore CRE declines, consistent with our strategy to continue to reduce our overall CRE exposure. The reduction in the core segment is a result of normal portfolio attrition combined with limited origination activity. We will continue to support our core developer customers as appropriate, however, we do not believe that significant additional CRE activity is appropriate given our current exposure in CRE lending and the current economic conditions. Also as shown above, substantial reserves for the noncore portfolio have been established. At December 31, 2011, the ACL related to the noncore portfolio was 14.61%. The combination of the existing ACL and prior NCOs represents the total credit actions taken on each segment of the portfolio. From this data, we calculate a credit mark that provides a consistent measurement of the cumulative credit actions taken against a specific portfolio segment. The 44.03% Credit Mark associated with the SAD managed noncore portfolio is an indicator of the aggressive portfolio management strategy employed for this portfolio. Consumer Credit Consumer credit approvals are based on, among other factors, the financial strength and payment history of the borrower, type of exposure, and the transaction structure. Consumer credit decisions are generally made in a centralized environment utilizing decision models. Importantly, certain individuals who understand each local 52 Table of Contents region have the authority to make credit extension decisions to preserve our focus on the local communities we operate in. Each credit extension is assigned a specific PD and LGD. The PD is generally based on the borrowers most recent credit bureau score (FICO), which we update quarterly, while the LGD is related to the type of collateral and the LTV ratio associated with the credit extension. In consumer lending, credit risk is managed from a segment (i.e., loan type, collateral position, geography, etc.) and vintage performance analysis. All portfolio segments are continuously monitored for changes in delinquency trends and other asset quality indicators. We make extensive use of portfolio assessment models to continuously monitor the quality of the portfolio, which may result in changes to future origination strategies. The on going analysis and review process results in a determination of an appropriate ALLL amount for our consumer loan portfolio. The independent risk management group has a consumer process review component to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of the consumer credit processes. Collection action is initiated as needed through a centrally managed collection and recovery function. The collection group employs a series of collection methodologies designed to maintain a high level of effectiveness while maximizing efficiency. In addition to the consumer loan portfolio, the collection group is responsible for collection activity on all sold and securitized consumer loans and leases. Collection practices include a single contact point for the majority of the residential real estate secured portfolios. AUTOMOBILE LOANS AND LEASES PORTFOLIO Our strategy in the automobile loan and lease portfolio continued to focus on high quality borrowers as measured by both FICO and internal custom scores, combined with appropriate LTVs, terms, and a reasonable level of profitability. Our strategy and operational capabilities allow us to appropriately manage the origination quality across the entire portfolio, including our newer markets. Although increased origination volume and the entering new markets can be associated with increased risk levels, we believe our strategy and operational capabilities significantly mitigate these risks. We continued to consistently execute our value proposition and took advantage of market opportunities that allowed us to grow our automobile loan portfolio. The significant growth in the portfolio was accomplished while maintaining high credit quality metrics. As we further execute our strategies and take advantage of these opportunities, we have developed and implemented a loan securitization strategy to maintain any growth within our established portfolio concentration limits. We have continued to expand our origination markets by entering Minnesota and Wisconsin in late 2011, after entering Pennsylvania and five New England states in 2010. Our market expansion strategy is based on hiring new colleagues with direct experience and established relationships with automobile dealers in the specific market. In the 2011 third quarter, we transferred $1.0 billion of automobile loans to a trust in a securitization transaction. The securitization qualified for sale accounting. As a result of this transaction, we recognized a $15.5 million gain on sale, which is reflected in noninterest income and recorded a $16.0 million servicing asset, which is reflected in accrued income and other assets. Additionally, in the 2011 fourth quarter, $1.3 billion of automobile loans were transferred to loans held for sale, reflecting an automobile loan securitization planned for the first half of 2012. RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE SECURED PORTFOLIOS The properties securing our residential mortgage and home equity portfolios are primarily located throughout our geographic footprint. The continued stress on home prices has caused the performance in these portfolios to remain weaker than historical levels. We continue to evaluate all of our policies and processes associated with managing these portfolios. In 2011, we accelerated the timing of charge off recognition in our residential mortgage portfolio. In addition, we established a writedown policy for loans in short sale situations. Both of these policy changes 53 Table of Contents resulted in accelerated recognition of residential mortgage charge offs totaling $6.8 million in 2011. Further, also in 2011, we implemented a policy change regarding the placement of loans on nonaccrual status in both the home equity and residential mortgage portfolios. This policy change resulted in accelerated placement of loans on nonaccrual status totaling $6.7 million in the home equity portfolio and $8.0 million in the residential mortgage portfolio.

LTV ratios reflect collateral values at the time of loan origination. (2) Portfolio weighted average FICO scores reflect currently updated customer credit scores whereas origination weighted average FICO scores reflect the customer credit scores at the time of loan origination. (3) Represents only owned portfolio originations. Home Equity Portfolio Our home equity portfolio (loans and lines of credit) consists of both first lien and second lien mortgage loans with underwriting criteria based on minimum credit scores, debt to income ratios, and LTV ratios. We offer closed end home equity loans which are generally fixed rate with principal and interest payments, and variable rate interest only home equity lines of credit which do not require payment of principal during the 10 year revolving period of the line of credit. Applications are underwritten centrally in conjunction with an automated underwriting system. At December 31, 2011, 46% of our home equity portfolio was secured by first lien mortgages. The credit risk profile is substantially reduced when we hold a first lien position. During 2011, 70% of our home equity portfolio originations were secured by a first mortgage lien. We focus on high quality borrowers primarily located within our footprint. The majority of our home equity line of credit borrowers consistently pay more than the minimum payment required in any given month. Additionally, since we focus on developing complete relationships with our customers, many of our home equity borrowers are utilizing our other products and services. The combination of high quality borrowers as measured by financial condition, FICO score, and the lien position status provide a high degree of confidence regarding the performance of the 2009 2011 originations. Within the home equity line of credit portfolio, the standard product is a 10 year interest only draw period with a balloon payment and represented a majority of the line of credit portfolio at December 31, 2011. As 54 Table of Contents previously discussed, a significant portion of recent originations are secured by first liens on the underlying property as high quality borrowers take advantage of the current low variable rates available with a line of credit. If the current 30 year fixed rate declines substantially from its already low level, we would anticipate some portion of these first lien line of credit borrowers to refinance to a more traditional residential mortgage at a fixed rate. We believe we have underwritten credit conservatively within this portfolio. We have not originated home equity loans or lines of credit with an LTV at origination greater than 100%, except for infrequent situations with high quality borrowers. However, continued declines in housing prices have likely decreased the value of the collateral for this portfolio and have caused a portion of the portfolio to have an LTV ratio greater than 100%. These higher LTV ratios are directly correlated with borrower payment patterns and are a particular focus of our Loss Mitigation and Home Saver groups. We obtain a property valuation for every loan or line of credit at origination. The type of property valuation obtained is based on a series of credit parameters, and ranges from an AVM to a complete walkthrough appraisal. While we believe an AVM estimate is an appropriate valuation source for a portion of our home equity lending activities, we continue to re evaluate all of our policies on an on going basis with the intent of ensuring complete independence in the requesting and reviewing of real estate valuations associated with loan decisions. We are committed to appropriate valuations for all of our real estate lending, and do not anticipate significant impacts to our loan decision process as a result of these guidelines. We update values as appropriate, and in compliance with applicable regulations, for loans identified as higher risk. Loans are identified as higher risk based on performance indicators and the updated values are utilized to facilitate our portfolio management processes, as well as our workout and loss mitigation functions. We continue to make origination policy adjustments based on our assessment of an appropriate risk profile, as well as industry actions. In addition to origination policy adjustments, we take actions, as necessary, to manage the risk profile of this portfolio. Residential Mortgages Portfolio We focus on higher quality borrowers and underwrite all applications centrally. We do not originate residential mortgage loans that allow negative amortization or allow the borrower multiple payment options. All residential mortgage loans are originated based on a completed full appraisal during the credit underwriting process. We update values on a regular basis in compliance with applicable regulations to facilitate our portfolio management, as well as our workout and loss mitigation functions. At December 31, 2011, 50% of our total residential mortgage loans have adjustable rates. At December 31, 2011, ARM loans that were expected to have rates reset totaled $1.9 billion through 2015. These loans scheduled to reset are primarily associated with loans originated subsequent to 2007, and as such, are not subject to the most significant declines in underlying property value. Given the quality of our borrowers and the relatively low current interest rates, we believe that we have a relatively limited exposure to ARM reset risk. Nonetheless, we have taken actions to mitigate our risk exposure. We initiate borrower contact at least six months prior to the interest rate resetting, and have been successful in converting many ARMs to fixed rate loans through this process. Several government programs continued to impact the residential mortgage portfolio, including various refinance programs such as HAMP and HARP, which positively affected the availability of credit for the industry. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we closed $605 million in HARP residential mortgages and $62 million in HAMP residential mortgages that are either in our residential mortgage portfolio or serviced for others. We utilize these programs to enhance our existing strategies of working closely with our customers. 55 Table of Contents European Sovereign Debt and Counterparty Exposure In the normal course of business, we engage with other financial institutions for a variety of purposes resulting from ordinary banking activities such as payment processing, transactions entered into for risk management purposes (see Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), and for investment diversification. As a result, we are exposed to credit risk, or risk of loss, if the other financial institution fails to perform according to the terms of our contract or agreement. Current European credit pressures have increased concerns about correlated adverse effects upon financial institutions. Specifically, there has been heightened emphasis on direct credit exposure to certain sovereigns, in particular, Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy, as well as to financial institutions headquartered in those countries. We analyze and assess each financial institution prior to approval as a counterparty. Our Treasury Credit Risk group within Credit Administration is responsible for the initial risk assessment as well as on going monitoring. We actively manage the level of exposure to each financial institution, with regular assessment of the exposure limits by our Credit Policy and Strategy Committee. We believe our overall exposure to financial institutions on a gross basis, including direct credit exposure to any of these named sovereigns and their banks, is not significant in the aggregate. Nonetheless, we minimize this risk through active monitoring and management of each contract or agreement. Credit Quality We believe the most meaningful way to assess overall credit quality performance for 2011 is through an analysis of credit quality performance ratios. This approach forms the basis of most of the discussion in the sections immediately following: NPAs and NALs, TDRs, ACL, and NCOs. In addition, we utilize delinquency rates, risk distribution and migration patterns, and product segmentation in the analysis of our credit quality performance. Credit quality performance in 2011 improved significantly throughout the year as evidenced by the improvement of every key asset quality metric. NPAs declined 30% from December 31, 2010, to December 31, 2011, along with declines in both commercial Criticized and Classified assets levels over the same period. Delinquent loan levels declined across all loan portfolios. We anticipate these positive trends will continue in 2012, although at a slower rate compared to 2011. NPAs, NALs, and TDRs (This section should be read in conjunction with Significant Item 6 and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) NPAs and NALs NPAs consist of (1) NALs, which represent loans and leases no longer accruing interest, (2) impaired loans held for sale, (3) OREO properties, and (4) other NPAs. Any loan in our portfolio may be placed on nonaccrual status prior to the policies described below when collection of principal or interest is in doubt. C&I and CRE loans are placed on nonaccrual status at 90 days past due. With the exception of residential mortgage loans guaranteed by government organizations which continue to accrue interest, residential mortgage loans are placed on nonaccrual status at 150 days past due. First lien and second lien home equity loans are placed on nonaccrual status at 150 days past due and 120 days past due, respectively. Automobile and other consumer loans are not placed on nonaccrual status, but are generally charged off when the loan is 120 days past due. When interest accruals are suspended, accrued interest income is reversed with current year accruals charged to earnings and prior year amounts generally charged off as a credit loss. When, in our judgment, the borrowers ability to make required interest and principal payments has resumed and collectability is no longer in doubt, the loan or lease is returned to accrual status. 56 Table of Contents The table reflects period end NALs and NPAs detail for each of the last five years.

At December 31, 2008, Franklin loans were reported as nonaccrual commercial and industrial loans. At December 31, 2009 and 2010, nonaccrual Franklin loans were reported as residential mortgage loans, home equity loans, and other real estate owned. At December 31, 2011, all Franklin related loans and other real estate owned were either sold or fully charged off. (2) Represents impaired loans obtained from the Sky Financial acquisition. Held for sale loans are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell. (3) Other nonperforming assets at December 31, 2011, represented an investment security backed by a municipal bond.

The decrease of $236.9 million, or 30%, primarily reflected: $144.9 million, or 42%, decrease in C&I NALs, primarily reflected both NCO activity and problem loan resolutions, including payments and pay offs. The decline was associated with loans throughout our footprint, with no specific industry concentration. $133.8 million, or 37%, decrease in CRE NALs, primarily reflecting both NCO activity and problem loan resolutions including payments and pay offs. We continued to focus on early recognition of risk through our on going portfolio management processes. Partially offset by: $23.6 million, or 53%, increase in residential mortgage NALs, primarily reflecting the continued weak economic conditions and decline of residential real estate property values. The process related to foreclosure and disposition of real estate assets has lengthened, resulting in loans remaining in a delinquency status for a significantly longer period of time. Residential mortgage NALs have been written down to net realizable value, less anticipated selling costs, which substantially limits any significant risk of future loss. Additionally, a policy change resulted in the accelerated placement of loans on NAL status totaling $8.0 million in 2011 (see Consumer Credit section). $18.2 million, or 81%, increase in home equity NALs, primarily reflecting the continued weak economic conditions and decline of residential real estate property values. The home equity portfolio will continue to be impacted by borrowers that are seeking to refinance but are in a negative equity position because of a second lien loan. Right sizing and debt forgiveness associated with these situations are becoming more frequent as borrowers realize the impact to their credit is minor, and that a default on a second lien loan is not likely to cause them to lose their home. Home equity NALs have been written down to net realizable value, less anticipated selling costs, which substantially limits any significant future risk of loss. Additionally, a policy change resulted in the accelerated placement of loans on NAL status totaling $6.7 million in 2011 (see Consumer Credit section). Of the $431.7 million of CRE and C&I related NALs at December 31, 2011, $128.0 million, or 30%, represented loans that were less than 30 days past due, demonstrating our continued commitment to proactive credit risk management. NPAs, which include NALs, were $590.3 million at December 31, 2011, and represented 1.51% of related assets. This compared with $844.8 million, or 2.21%, at December 31, 2010. The $254.5 million, or 30%, decrease reflected: $236.9 million decrease to NALs, discussed above. $28.4 million decrease to OREO, primarily reflecting lower inflows combined with active sales activities. As discussed previously, residential mortgages are placed on nonaccrual status at 150 days past due, with the exception of residential mortgages guaranteed by government organizations which continue to accrue interest. First lien and second lien home equity loans and lines of credit are placed on nonaccrual status at 150 days past due and 120 days past due, respectively. 58 Table of Contents The following table reflects period end accruing loans and leases 90 days or more past due for each of the last five years: Table 15 Accruing Past Due Loans and Leases At December 31, 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 (dollar amounts in thousands) Accruing loans and leases past due 90 days or more Commercial and industrial $ $ $ $ 10,889 $ 10,474 Commercial real estate 59,425 25,064 Residential mortgage (excluding loans guaranteed by the U.S. government) 45,198 53,983 78,915 71,553 67,391 Home equity 20,198 23,497 53,343 29,039 24,086 Other loans and leases 8,253 10,177 13,400 18,039 13,962 Total, excl. loans guaranteed by the U.S. government 73,649 87,657 145,658 188,945 140,977 Add: loans guaranteed by the U.S. government 96,703 98,288 101,616 82,576 51,174 Total accruing loans and leases past due 90 days or more, including loans guaranteed by the U.S. government $ 170,352 $ 185,945 $ 247,274 $ 271,521 $ 192,151 Ratios:(1) Excluding loans guaranteed by the U.S. government, as a percent of total loans and leases 0.19 % 0.23 % 0.40 % 0.46 % 0.35 % Guaranteed by the U.S. government, as a percent of total loans and leases 0.25 0.26 0.28 0.20 0.13 Including loans guaranteed by the U.S. government, as a percent of total loans and leases 0.44 0.49 0.68 0.66 0.48 (1) Ratios are calculated as a percentage of related loans and leases. TDR Loans TDRs are modified loans in which a concession is provided to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. TDRs can be classified as either accrual or nonaccrual loans. Nonaccrual TDRs are included in NALs, whereas accruing TDRs are excluded from NALs as it is probable that all contractual principal and interest due under the restructured terms will be collected. 59 Table of Contents The table below presents our accruing and nonaccruing TDRs at period end for each of the past three years: Table 16 Accruing and Nonaccruing Troubled Debt Restructured Loans December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (dollar amounts in thousands) Troubled debt restructured loans accruing: Residential mortgage $ 309,678 $ 328,411 $ 229,470 Other consumer(1) 94,905 76,586 52,871 Commercial 303,975 222,632 157,049 Total troubled debt restructured loans accruing 708,558 627,629 439,390 Troubled debt restructured loans nonaccruing: Residential mortgage 26,089 5,789 4,988 Other consumer(1) 482 Commercial 70,521 33,462 108,458 Total troubled debt restructured loans nonaccruing 97,092 39,251 113,446 Total troubled debt restructured loans $ 805,650 $ 666,880 $ 552,836 (1) Includes automobile, home equity, and other consumer TDRs.

A corresponding amount is included in the New TDRs amount above. 60 Table of Contents ACL (This section should be read in conjunction with Significant Item 6, and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) We maintain two reserves, both of which in our judgment are appropriate to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio: the ALLL and the AULC. Combined, these reserves comprise the total ACL. Our Credit Administration group is responsible for developing the methodology assumptions and estimates used in the calculation, as well as determining the appropriateness of the ACL. The ALLL represents the estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the reported date. Additions to the ALLL result from recording provision expense for loan losses or increased risk levels resulting from loan risk rating downgrades, while reductions reflect charge offs, recoveries, decreased risk levels resulting from loan risk rating upgrades, or the sale of loans. The AULC is determined by applying the transaction reserve process to the unfunded portion of the loan exposures adjusted by an applicable funding expectation. A provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the ACL to the level we have determined to be appropriate to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio. The provision for credit losses in 2011 was $174.1 million, compared with $634.5 million in 2010. While the total ACL balance declined in 2011, and the resulting ACL to loan coverage ratio declined to 2.60% from 3.39%, all of the ACL coverage benchmarks improved as a result of the improvement in the underlying quality of the portfolio. The coverage ratios associated with NALs, commercial Criticized, and commercial Classified loans all showed significant improvement in 2011 despite the decline in the ACL level. 61 Table of Contents The following table reflects activity in the ALLL and ACL for each of the last five years.

The reduction in the ACL compared with December 31, 2010, reflected declines in the ALLL in both the commercial and consumer portfolios. The decline in the commercial portfolio ALLL reflected NCOs on loans with specific reserves, and an overall reduction in the level of commercial Criticized loans. Commercial Criticized loans are commercial loans rated as OLEM, Substandard, Doubtful, or Loss (see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding loan risk ratings). As shown in the table below, commercial Criticized loans declined $927.9 million, or 30%, from December 31, 2010, reflecting upgrade and payment activity. Table 20 Criticized Commercial Loan Activity At December 31, 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 (dollar amounts in thousands) Criticized commercial loans, beginning of period $ 3,074,481 $ 4,971,637 $ 3,311,280 $ 2,736,166 $ 662,425 New additions / increases 1,068,299 1,284,216 4,707,518 1,688,022 2,670,616 Advances 193,679 298,511 390,872 292,295 282,614 Upgrades to Pass (901,633 ) (1,456,132 ) (522,150 ) (378,027 ) (271,394 ) Payments (986,919 ) (1,465,374 ) (1,843,535 ) (858,996 ) (531,255 ) Loan losses (301,300 ) (558,377 ) (1,072,348 ) (168,180 ) (76,840 ) Criticized commercial loans, end of period $ 2,146,607 $ 3,074,481 $ 4,971,637 $ 3,311,280 $ 2,736,166 The decline in the consumer related ALLL reflected the impact of the 2011 automobile securitization (see Automobile Portfolio discussion), as well as decreases in both the home equity related and residential mortgage related ALLL resulting from improved borrower quality as measured by updated FICO scores. 63 Table of Contents Compared with December 31, 2010, the AULC increased $6.3 million primarily resulting from the downgrade of a commercial letter of credit associated with one relationship. Credit quality trends within the entire loan and lease portfolio steadily improved throughout 2011 and 2010. The ACL to total loans ratio declined to 2.60% at December 31, 2011, compared to 3.39% at December 31, 2010. We believe the decline in the ratio is appropriate given the continued improvement in the risk profile of our loan portfolio. Further, we believe that early identification of problem loans and aggressive action plans for these problem loans, combined with originating high quality new loans will contribute to continued improvement in our key credit quality metrics. However, the continued weakness in the residential real estate market and the overall economic conditions remained stressed, and additional risks emerged throughout 2011. These additional risks included the European banking sector stress, the continued budget issues in local governments, flat domestic economic growth, and the variety of policy proposals regarding job growth, debt management, and domestic tax policy. Continued high unemployment, among other factors, has slowed any significant recovery. In the near term, we anticipate modest improvement in the unemployment rate, however we remain concerned that the U.S. and local government budget issues will continue to negatively impact the financial condition of some of our retail and commercial borrowers. The pronounced downturn in the residential real estate market that began in early 2007 has resulted in significantly lower residential real estate values. We have significant exposure to loans secured by residential real estate and continue to be an active lender in our communities. The impact of the downturn in real estate values has had a significant impact on some of our borrowers as evidenced by the higher delinquencies and NCOs since late 2007. Although there was improvement in 2011, we believe the impact of reduced property values and the continued weak economic conditions will continue to negatively impact us. Given the combination of these noted factors, we believe that our ACL is appropriate and its coverage level is reflective of the quality of our portfolio and the current operating environment. NCOs (This section should be read in conjunction with Significant Item 6, and Franklin related Impacts located within the Additional Disclosures section.) Any loan in any portfolio may be charged off prior to the policies described below if a loss confirming event has occurred. Loss confirming events include, but are not limited to, bankruptcy (unsecured), continued delinquency, foreclosure, or receipt of an asset valuation indicating a collateral deficiency and that asset is the sole source of repayment. C&I and CRE loans are either charged off or written down to net realizable value at 90 days past due. Automobile loans and other consumer loans are charged off at 120 days past due. First lien and second lien home equity loans are charged off to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less anticipated selling costs, at 150 days past due and 120 days past due, respectively. Residential mortgages are charged off to the estimated fair value of the collateral at 150 days past due. 64 Table of Contents The following table reflects NCO detail for each of the last five years.

In assessing NCO trends, it is helpful to understand the process of how commercial loans are treated as they deteriorate over time. The ALLL established at origination is consistent with the level of risk associated with the original underwriting. As part of our normal portfolio management process for commercial loans, the loan is periodically reviewed and the risk rating is adjusted based on a current assessment of the borrowers financial position. The ALLL is increased or decreased based on the revised risk rating. In certain cases, the ALLL is determined to not be sufficient, and a specific reserve is established based on the projected cash flow and collateral value of the specific loan. Charge offs, if necessary, are generally recognized in a period after the specific ALLL was established. If the previously established ALLL exceeds that needed to satisfactorily resolve 65 Table of Contents the problem loan, a reduction in the overall level of the ALLL could be recognized. Consumer loans are treated in much the same manner as commercial loans, although specific reserves are not identified for consumer loans. In summary, if loan quality deteriorates, the typical credit sequence would be periods of reserve building, followed by periods of higher NCOs as the previously established ALLL is utilized. Additionally, an increase in the ALLL typically either precedes or is in conjunction with increases in NALs. When a loan is classified as NAL, it is evaluated for a specific ALLL or charge off. As a result, an increase in NALs does not necessarily result in an increase in the ALLL or an expectation of higher future NCOs. Home equity NCO annualized percentages generally are greater than those of the residential mortgage portfolio primarily as a result of its second lien position. This relationship changed substantially in 2009 and 2010 as the residential mortgage NCO ratio significantly exceeded the home equity NCO ratio in both years. The NCO annualized percentage in the home equity portfolio is the result of a higher quality borrower base as measured by FICO distribution and a substantial portion of the growth representing first lien positions. We believe that higher quality borrowers were attracted to the HELOC product as a result of the relatively low interest rates associated with this variable rate product. Additionally, we accelerated the charge off policy associated with the residential mortgage portfolio in 2011 which shortened the maximum timeframe to charge off and, also during 2011, we executed two NPL sales in the residential mortgage portfolio with resulting charge offs. We anticipate a return to the historical pattern of residential mortgage portfolio NCOs being lower than the home equity portfolio NCOs as exhibited in the second half of 2011. As we have focused on originating high quality home equity loans, we believe the PD risk is lower in the home equity portfolio. However, the LGD component is significantly higher than the residential mortgage portfolio, which results in our projection for lower NCOs in the residential mortgage portfolio relative to the home equity portfolio going forward. Therefore, we believe the residential mortgage NCO rate will remain lower compared to the home equity portfolio as a result of the entire first lien composition of the residential mortgage portfolio, as well as the result of previous credit actions improving the underlying quality of these portfolios. The home equity portfolio NCO levels are not anticipated to increase compared to 2010 levels as a more significant portion of the portfolio is in a first lien position as described in Table 13. However, the home equity portfolio will continue to be impacted by borrowers that are seeking to refinance but are in a negative equity position because of the second lien loan. Right sizing and debt forgiveness associated with these situations are becoming more frequent as borrowers realize the impact to their credit is minor, and that a default on a second lien loan is not likely to cause them to lose their home. From a delinquency standpoint, all residential mortgage loans greater than 150 days past due are charged down to the estimated value of the collateral, less anticipated selling costs. The remaining balance is in delinquent status until a modification can be completed, or the loan goes through the foreclosure process. For the home equity portfolio, virtually all of the defaults represent full charge offs as there is no remaining equity, creating a lower delinquency rate but a higher charge off impact. 2011 versus 2010 The $165.2 million, or 65%, decrease in C&I NCOs and the $127.5 million, or 46%, decrease in CRE NCOs primarily reflected significant credit quality improvement in the underlying portfolio as well as our on going proactive credit management practices. There was not any concentration in either geography or project type. Based on asset quality trends, we anticipate lower levels of CRE NCOs in the future. The $11.5 million, or 43%, decline in the automobile portfolio reflected our consistent high quality origination profile, as well as a stronger market for used automobiles. Home equity NCOs declined $37.6 million, or 27%. 2010 included $20.8 million of Franklin related NCOs compared with no Franklin related NCOs in the current period. Excluding the Franklin related impacts, home 66 Table of Contents equity NCOs decreased $16.8 compared with 2010. Although the performance of this portfolio continued to be impacted by the overall weak economic conditions and the continued decline of residential real estate property values, the performance was consistent with our expectations for the portfolio and we anticipate continued improvement. Residential mortgage NCOs declined $96.2 million, or 63%. 2010 included $71.3 million of Franklin related net charge offs, and 2011 included Franklin related net recoveries of $2.5 million. Excluding the Franklin impacts, residential mortgage NCOs decreased $22.4 million compared with 2010. Additionally, 2011 included $6.8 million of NCOs related to a change in charge off recognition policy (see Consumer Credit section). Excluding these impacts, performance was consistent with our expectations for a continued downward trend in this portfolio. Market Risk Market risk represents the risk of loss due to changes in market values of assets and liabilities. We incur market risk in the normal course of business through exposures to market interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, credit spreads, and expected lease residual values. We have identified two primary sources of market risk: interest rate risk and price risk. Interest Rate Risk OVERVIEW Interest rate risk is the risk to earnings and value arising from changes in market interest rates. Interest rate risk arises from timing differences in the repricing and maturities of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities (reprice risk), changes in the expected maturities of assets and liabilities arising from embedded options, such as borrowers ability to prepay residential mortgage loans at any time and depositors ability to redeem certificates of deposit before maturity (option risk), changes in the shape of the yield curve where interest rates increase or decrease in a non parallel fashion (yield curve risk), and changes in spread relationships between different yield curves, such as U.S. Treasuries and LIBOR (basis risk). INCOME SIMULATION AND ECONOMIC VALUE ANALYSIS Interest rate risk measurement is performed monthly. Two broad approaches to modeling interest rate risk are employed: income simulation and economic value analysis. An income simulation analysis is used to measure the sensitivity of forecasted ISE to changes in market rates over a one year time period. Although bank owned life insurance, automobile operating lease assets, and excess cash balances held at the Federal Reserve Bank are classified as noninterest earning assets, and the net revenue from these assets is recorded in noninterest income and noninterest expense, these portfolios are included in the interest sensitivity analysis because they have attributes similar to interest earning assets. EVE analysis is used to measure the sensitivity of the values of period end assets and liabilities to changes in market interest rates. EVE analysis serves as a complement to ISE analysis as it provides risk exposure estimates for time periods beyond the one year simulation period. The models used for these measurements take into account prepayment speeds on mortgage loans, mortgage backed securities, and consumer installment loans, as well as cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Balance sheet growth assumptions are also considered in the ISE analysis. The models include the effects of derivatives, such as interest rate swaps, caps, floors, and other types of interest rate options. The FOMCs announcement of Operation Twist had the initial impact of lowering long term rates (e.g., rates with maturities greater than five years) while slightly increasing intermediate term rates (e.g., rates with maturities of two to three years). However, over time, both intermediate term and long term rates declined. Short term rates (e.g., rates with maturities of overnight through one year) were not materially impacted by Operation Twist. The impact to ISE at Risk was not material because short term rates were not materially 67 Table of Contents impacted, and the impact of changes in intermediate term and long term rates takes a longer amount of time to be reflected in financial results. The impact to EVE at Risk was meaningful because the impact of lower long term rates is reflected in higher mortgage asset prepayments. Higher mortgage asset prepayments has the effect of lowering EVE at Risk because the duration of assets declines while the duration of liabilities is not impacted. The baseline scenario for ISE analysis, with which all other scenarios are compared, is based on market interest rates implied by the prevailing yield curve as of the period end. Alternative interest rate scenarios are then compared with the baseline scenario. These alternative interest rate scenarios include parallel rate shifts on both a gradual and an immediate basis, movements in interest rates that alter the shape of the yield curve (e.g., flatter or steeper yield curve), and no changes in current interest rates for the entire measurement period. Scenarios are also developed to measure short term repricing risks, such as the impact of LIBOR based interest rates rising or falling faster than the prime rate. The simulations for evaluating short term interest rate risk exposure are scenarios that model gradual +/ 100 and +/ 200 basis points parallel shifts in market interest rates over the next one year period beyond the interest rate change implied by the current yield curve. We assumed market interest rates would not fall below 0% over the next one year period for the scenarios that used the 100 and 200 basis points parallel shift in market interest rates. The table below shows the results of the scenarios as of December 31, 2011, and December 31, 2010. All of the positions were within the board of directors policy limits as of December 31, 2011, except for the gradual 100 basis point scenario. ISE at risk for the 100 basis point scenario was 2.3% compared to the policy limit of 2.0%. The board of directors approved an exception to the policy limit given that the likelihood of rates declining 100, or even 200, basis points has a low probability of occurrence as a mitigating factor for being outside the policy limit.

The ALCOs strategy is to be near term asset sensitive to a rising rate scenario. The primary factors contributing to this change are the 2011 first quarter termination of $4.5 billion of interest rate swaps maturing through June 2012, offset slightly by $1.8 billion of interest rate swaps executed in the 2011 second and third quarters, the impact of lower interest rates on mortgage asset prepayments, and low cost deposit growth. The following table shows the income sensitivity of select portfolios to changes in market interest rates. A portfolio with 100% sensitivity would indicate that interest income and expense will change with the same magnitude and direction as interest rates. A portfolio with 0% sensitivity is insensitive to changes in interest rates. For the +200 basis points scenario, total interest sensitive income is 39.6% sensitive to changes in market interest rates, while total interest sensitive expense is 39.9% sensitive to changes in market interest rates. ISE at risk for the +200 basis points scenario has a near term asset sensitive interest rate risk position because of the larger base of total interest sensitive income relative to total interest sensitive expense. 68 Table of Contents Table 23 Interest Income/Expense Sensitivity Percent ofTotal EarningAssets(1) Percent Change in InterestIncome/Expense for a Given Change inInterest RatesOver / (Under) Base Case Parallel Ramp Basis point change scenario 200 100 +100 +200 Total loans 81 % 20.5 % 30.9 % 42.1 % 43.5 % Total investments and other earning assets 19 19.2 23.0 30.7 28.2 Total interest sensitive income 19.7 28.6 38.9 39.6 Total interest bearing deposits 67 10.4 17.5 34.9 36.3 Total borrowings 9 22.4 38.1 61.6 65.6 Total interest sensitive expense 11.9 20.0 38.2 39.9 (1) At December 31, 2011 The primary simulations for EVE at risk assume immediate +/ 100 and +/ 200 basis points parallel shifts in market interest rates beyond the interest rate change implied by the current yield curve.

The primary factors contributing to this change are the impact of lower interest rates on mortgage asset prepayments, the growth in low cost deposits, and the 2011 first quarter termination of $4.5 billion of interest rate swaps maturing through June 2012, offset slightly by $1.8 billion of interest rate swaps executed in the 2011 second and third quarters and higher levels of fixed rate loans. 69 Table of Contents The following table shows the economic value sensitivity of select portfolios to changes in market interest rates. The change in economic value for each portfolio is measured as the percent change from the base economic value for that portfolio. For the +200 basis points scenario, total net tangible assets decrease in value 3.1% to changes in market interest rates, while total net tangible liabilities increase in value 2.9% to changes in market interest rates. EVE at risk for the +200 basis points scenario is liability sensitive because of the decrease in economic value of total net tangible assets, which reduces the EVE, and the increase in economic value of total net tangible liabilities, which also reduces the EVE.

At December 31, 2011, we had $137.4 million of capitalized MSRs representing the right to service $15.9 billion in mortgage loans. Of this $137.4 million, $65.0 million was recorded using the fair value method, and $72.4 million was recorded using the amortization method. MSR fair values are very sensitive to movements in interest rates as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans, which can be greatly reduced by prepayments. Prepayments usually increase when mortgage interest rates decline and decrease when mortgage interest rates rise. We have employed strategies to reduce the risk of MSR fair value changes or impairment. In addition, we engage a third party to provide valuation tools and assistance with our strategies with the objective to decrease the volatility from MSR fair value changes. However, volatile changes in interest rates can diminish the effectiveness of these hedges. We typically report MSR fair value adjustments net of hedge related trading activity in the mortgage banking income category of noninterest income. Changes in fair value between reporting dates are recorded as an increase or a decrease in mortgage banking income. MSRs recorded using the amortization method generally relate to loans originated with historically low interest rates, resulting in a lower probability of prepayments and, ultimately, impairment. MSR assets are included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Price Risk Price risk represents the risk of loss arising from adverse movements in the prices of financial instruments that are carried at fair value and subject to fair value accounting. We have price risk from trading securities, 70 Table of Contents securities owned by our broker dealer subsidiaries, foreign exchange positions, equity investments, investments in mortgage backed securities, and marketable equity securities held by our insurance subsidiaries. We have established loss limits on the trading portfolio, the amount of foreign exchange exposure that can be maintained, and the amount of marketable equity securities that can be held by the insurance subsidiaries. Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk of loss due to the possibility that funds may not be available to satisfy current or future commitments resulting from external macro market issues, investor and customer perception of financial strength, and events unrelated to us, such as war, terrorism, or financial institution market specific issues. In addition, the mix and maturity structure of Huntingtons balance sheet, amount of on hand cash and unencumbered securities and the availability of contingent sources of funding, can have an impact on Huntingtons ability to satisfy current or future funding commitments. We manage liquidity risk at both the Bank and the parent company. The overall objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure that we can obtain cost effective funding to meet current and future obligations, and can maintain sufficient levels of on hand liquidity, under both normal business as usual and unanticipated stressed circumstances. The ALCO was appointed by our Board Risk Oversight Committee to oversee liquidity risk management and establish policies and limits based upon analyses of the ratio of loans to deposits, liquid asset coverage ratios, the percentage of assets funded with noncore or wholesale funding, net cash capital, liquid assets, and emergency borrowing capacity. In addition, operating guidelines are established to ensure that bank loans included in the business segments are funded with core deposits. These operating guidelines also ensure diversification of noncore funding by type, source, and maturity and provide sufficient liquidity to cover 100% of wholesale funds maturing within a six month period. A contingency funding plan is in place, which includes forecasted sources and uses of funds under various scenarios in order to prepare for unexpected liquidity shortages, including the implications of any credit rating changes and / or other trigger events related to financial ratios, deposit fluctuations, debt issuance capacity, stock performance, or negative news related to us or the banking industry. Liquidity risk is reviewed monthly for the Bank and the parent company, as well as its subsidiaries. In addition, liquidity working groups meet regularly to identify and monitor liquidity positions, provide policy guidance, review funding strategies, and oversee the adherence to, and maintenance of, the contingency funding plans. A Contingency Funding Working Group monitors daily cash flow trends, branch activity, unfunded commitments, significant transactions, and parent company subsidiary sources and uses of funds in order to identify areas of concern and establish specific funding strategies. This group works closely with the ALCO and our communication team in order to identify issues that may require a more proactive communication plan to shareholders, employees, and customers regarding specific events or issues that could have an impact on our liquidity position. In the normal course of business, in order to better manage liquidity risk, we perform stress tests to determine the effect that a potential downgrade in our credit ratings or other market disruptions could have on liquidity over various time periods. These credit ratings have a direct impact on our cost of funds and ability to raise funds under normal, as well as adverse, circumstances. The results of these stress tests indicate that at December 31, 2011, sufficient sources of funds were available to meet our financial obligations and fund our operations for 2012. The stress test scenarios include testing to determine the impact of an interruption to our access to the national markets for funding, a significant run off in core deposits and liquidity triggers inherent in other financial agreements. To compensate for the effect of these assumed liquidity pressures, we consider alternative sources of liquidity over different time periods to project how funding needs would be managed. The specific alternatives for enhancing liquidity include generating client deposits, securitizing or selling loans, selling or maturing of securities, and extending the level or maturity of wholesale borrowings. Liquidity stress testing was also an important component of the fourth quarter annual capital planning process. 71 Table of Contents Available for sale and other securities portfolio (This section should be read in conjunction with the Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Significant Estimates discussion, and Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) Our investment securities portfolio is evaluated under established asset/liability management objectives. Changing market conditions could affect the profitability of the portfolio, as well as the level of interest rate risk exposure. Our available for sale and other securities portfolio is comprised of various financial instruments. At December 31, 2011, our available for sale and other securities portfolio totaled $8.1 billion, a decrease of $1.8 billion from 2010. The duration of the portfolio increased by 0.1 years to 3.1 years. The composition and maturity of the portfolio is presented on the following two tables.

As of December 31, 2011, these core deposits funded 76% of total assets. At December 31, 2011, total core deposits represented 95% of total deposits, an increase from 93% at the prior year end. Core deposits are comprised of interest bearing and noninterest bearing demand deposits, money market deposits, savings and other domestic deposits, consumer certificates of deposit both over and under $250,000, and nonconsumer certificates of deposit less than $250,000. Noncore deposits consist of brokered money market deposits and certificates of deposit, foreign time deposits, and other domestic deposits of $250,000 or more comprised primarily of public fund certificates of deposit more than $250,000. Core deposits may increase our need for liquidity as certificates of deposit mature or are withdrawn before maturity and as nonmaturity deposits, such as checking and savings account balances, are withdrawn. Noninterest bearing demand deposits increased $3.9 billion from the prior year, but include certain large commercial deposits that may be more short term in nature. Demand deposit overdrafts that have been reclassified as loan balances were $26.2 million and $13.1 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The following tables contractual maturities of other domestic time deposits of $250,000 or more and brokered deposits and negotiable CDs as well as other domestic time deposits of $100,000 or more and brokered deposits and negotiable CDs at December 31, 2011.

We anticipate minimal impact on our liquidity position; mainly an increase to collateral requirements for our Public Fund clients whose deposits are currently covered by the FDIC insurance. We will continue to monitor this throughout 2012. 75 Table of Contents Table 30 Federal Funds Purchased and Repurchase Agreements 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 (dollar amounts in millions) Balance at period end Federal Funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase $ 1,434 $ 1,966 $ 851 $ 1,289 $ 2,706 Other short term borrowings 7 75 25 20 138 Weighted average interest rate at period end Federal Funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 0.17 % 0.19 % 0.21 % 0.36 % 2.88 % Other short term borrowings 2.74 0.53 1.17 3.45 1.66 Maximum amount outstanding at month end during the period Federal Funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase $ 2,431 $ 2,084 $ 1,095 $ 3,307 $ 2,798 Other short term borrowings 86 108 54 249 137 Average amount outstanding during the period Federal Funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase $ 2,009 $ 1,375 $ 903 $ 2,328 $ 2,201 Other short term borrowings 46 70 30 45 44 Weighted average interest rate during the period Federal Funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 0.16 % 0.19 % 0.21 % 1.74 % 4.09 % Other short term borrowings 0.59 0.43 1.47 3.59 6.03 To the extent we are unable to obtain sufficient liquidity through core deposits, we may meet our liquidity needs through wholesale funding. These sources include other domestic deposits of $250,000 or more, brokered deposits and negotiable CDs, deposits in foreign offices, short term borrowings, FHLB advances, other long term debt, and subordinated notes. At December 31, 2011, total wholesale funding was $6.6 billion, a decrease from $8.4 billion at December 31, 2010. The $6.6 billion portfolio at December 31, 2011, had a weighted average maturity of 3.9 years. The Bank has access to the Federal Reserve Banks discount window. These borrowings are secured by commercial loans and home equity lines of credit. The Bank is also a member of the FHLB, and as such, has access to advances from this facility. These advances are generally secured by residential mortgages, other mortgage related loans, and available for sale securities. Information regarding amounts pledged, for the ability to borrow if necessary, and unused borrowing capacity at both the Federal Reserve Bank and the FHLB is outlined in the following table: Table 31 Federal Reserve Bank and FHLB Cincinnati Borrowing Capacity December 31, (dollar amounts in billions) 2011 2010 Loans Pledged: Federal Reserve Bank $ 10.5 $ 9.7 FHLB 8.3 7.8 Total loans pledged $ 18.8 $ 17.5 Total unused borrowing capacity at Federal Reserve Bank and FHLB $ 10.5 $ 8.8 76 Table of Contents We can also obtain funding through other methods including: (1) purchasing federal funds, (2) selling securities under repurchase agreements, (3) selling or maturity of investment securities, (4) selling or securitization of loans, (5) selling of national market certificates of deposit, (6) the relatively shorter term structure of our commercial loans (see tables below) and automobile loans, and (7) issuing of common and preferred stock. At December 31, 2011, we believe the Bank had sufficient liquidity to meet its cash flow obligations for the foreseeable future.

The composition and maturity of these securities were presented in Table 27. Parent Company Liquidity The parent companys funding requirements consist primarily of dividends to shareholders, debt service, income taxes, operating expenses, funding of nonbank subsidiaries, repurchases of our stock, and acquisitions. The parent company obtains funding to meet obligations from dividends received from direct subsidiaries, net taxes collected from subsidiaries included in the federal consolidated tax return, fees for services provided to subsidiaries, and the issuance of debt securities. As a result of bank capital standards arising from the Dodd Frank Act, beginning in 2013 trust preferred securities will eventually cease to be considered Tier 1 risk based capital. The Exchange Offer described below was intended to improve our Tier 1 risk based capital in anticipation of these regulations by replacing a portion of our trust preferred securities with preferred stock, which we believe will qualify as additional Tier 1 risk based capital. During the 2011 fourth quarter, Huntington issued $35.5 million par value Floating Rate Series B Non Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock in exchange for $35.5 million of (1) Huntington Capital I Floating Rate Capital Securities, (2) Huntington Capital II Floating Rate Capital Securities, (3) Sky Financial Capital Trust III Floating Rate Capital Securities and (4) Sky Financial Capital Trust IV Floating Rate Capital Securities. Huntington will pay dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock at a floating rate equal to three month LIBOR plus a spread of 2.70%. 77 Table of Contents Upon receipt of the aforementioned trust preferred securities, Huntington exchanged $32.5 million of the trust preferred securities with the applicable Trust for a like amount of debentures issued by us. The debentures were surrendered to the applicable trustee for cancellation. Huntington anticipates exchanging the remaining $3.0 million of trust preferred securities and retiring the related subordinated debt obligation in the first quarter of 2012. In addition, during the fourth quarter the parent company received $325.0 million in funding from the Bank based on the payment of intercompany subordinated debt. The parent company also received $30.0 million in dividends from the Huntington Investment Company. At December 31, 2011, the parent company had $0.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents, compared with $0.6 billion at December 31, 2010. Appropriate limits and guidelines are in place to ensure the parent company has sufficient cash to meet operating expenses and other commitments over the next 18 months without relying on subsidiaries or capital markets for funding. On January 19, 2012, we announced that the board of directors had declared a quarterly common stock cash dividend of $0.04 per common share. The dividend is payable on April 2, 2012, to shareholders of record on March 19, 2012. Based on the current quarterly dividend of $0.04 per common share, cash demands required for common stock dividends are estimated to be approximately $34.6 million per quarter. Based on the current dividend, cash demands required for Series A Preferred Stock are estimated to be approximately $7.7 million per quarter. Cash demands required for Series B Preferred Stock are expected to be approximately $0.3 million per quarter. Based on a regulatory dividend limitation, the Bank could not have declared and paid a dividend to the parent company at December 31, 2011, without regulatory approval. We do not anticipate that the Bank will request regulatory approval to pay dividends in the near future as we continue to build Bank regulatory capital above its already well capitalized level. To help meet any additional liquidity needs, we have an open ended, automatic shelf registration statement filed and effective with the SEC, which permits us to issue an unspecified amount of debt or equity securities. With the exception of the common and preferred dividends previously discussed, the parent company does not have any significant cash demands. There are no maturities of parent company obligations until 2013, when a debt maturity of $50.0 million is payable. It is our policy to keep operating cash on hand at the parent company to satisfy any cash demands for the next 18 months. We sponsor a non contributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees hired or rehired prior to January 1, 2010. The Plan provides benefits based upon length of service and compensation levels. Our policy is to contribute an annual amount that is at least equal to the minimum funding requirements. The Bank and other subsidiaries fund approximately 90% of pension contributions. Although we contributed a total of $90.0 million in 2011, there was no required minimum contribution for 2011. Funding requirements are calculated annually as of the end of the year and are heavily dependent on the value of our pension plan assets and the interest rate used to discount plan obligations. To the extent that the low interest rate environment continues, including as a result of the Federal Reserve Maturity Extension Program, or the pension plan does not earn the expected asset return rates, annual pension contribution requirements in future years could increase and such increases could be significant. Any additional pension contributions are not expected to significantly impact liquidity. See the contractual obligations table for our pension minimum funding requirement. Considering the factors discussed above, and other analyses that we have performed, we believe the parent company has sufficient liquidity to meet its cash flow obligations for the foreseeable future. 78 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, we enter into various off balance sheet arrangements. These arrangements include financial guarantees contained in standby letters of credit issued by the Bank and commitments by the Bank to sell mortgage loans. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. These guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing, and similar transactions. Most of these arrangements mature within two years and are expected to expire without being drawn upon. Standby letters of credit are included in the determination of the amount of risk based capital that the parent company and the Bank are required to hold. Through our credit process, we monitor the credit risks of outstanding standby letters of credit. When it is probable that a standby letter of credit will be drawn and not repaid in full, losses are recognized in the provision for credit losses. At December 31, 2011, we had $0.6 billion of standby letters of credit outstanding, of which 80% were collateralized. Included in this $0.6 billion total are letters of credit issued by the Bank that support securities that were issued by our customers and remarketed by the Huntington Investment Company, our broker dealer subsidiary. We enter into forward contracts relating to the mortgage banking business to hedge the exposures we have from commitments to extend new residential mortgage loans to our customers and from our mortgage loans held for sale. At December 31, 2011, and December 31, 2010, we had commitments to sell residential real estate loans of $629.0 million and $998.7 million, respectively. These contracts mature in less than one year. We do not believe that off balance sheet arrangements will have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources.

See Note 18 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the pension plan. (3) The minimum required contributions for years after 2016 are currently not reliably estimable. 79 Table of Contents Operational Risk As with all companies, we are subject to operational risk. Operational risk is the risk of loss due to human error; inadequate or failed internal systems and controls; violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices, or ethical standards; and external influences such as market conditions, fraudulent activities, disasters, and security risks. We continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to ensure compliance with laws, rules, and regulations, and to improve the oversight of our operational risk. For example, we actively and continuously monitor cyber attacks such as attempts related to efraud and loss of sensitive customer data. We constantly evaluate internal systems, processes and controls to mitigate loss from cyber attacks and, to date, have not experienced any material losses. To mitigate operational risks, we have established a senior management Operational Risk Committee and a senior management Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance Committee. The responsibilities of these committees, among other duties, include establishing and maintaining management information systems to monitor material risks and to identify potential concerns, risks, or trends that may have a significant impact and ensuring that recommendations are developed to address the identified issues. Both of these committees report any significant findings and recommendations to the Risk Management Committee. Additionally, potential concerns may be escalated to our Board Risk Oversight Committee, as appropriate. The goal of this framework is to implement effective operational risk techniques and strategies, minimize operational and fraud losses, and enhance our overall performance. Representation and Warranty Reserve We primarily conduct our loan sale and securitization activity with FNMA and FHLMC. In connection with these and other securitization transactions, we make certain representations and warranties that the loans meet certain criteria, such as collateral type and underwriting standards. We may be required to repurchase individual loans and / or indemnify these organizations against losses due to a loan not meeting the established criteria. We have a reserve for such losses, which is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The reserves are estimated based on historical and expected repurchase activity, average loss rates, and current economic trends. The level of mortgage loan repurchase losses depends upon economic factors, investor demand strategies and other external conditions containing a level of uncertainty and risk that may change over the life of the underlying loans. We do not have sufficient information to estimate the range of reasonably possible loss related to representation and warranty exposure. The tables below reflect activity in the representations and warranties reserve: Table 34 Summary of Reserve for Representations and Warranties on Mortgage Loans Serviced for Others Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (dollar amounts in thousands) Reserve for representations and warranties, beginning of year $ 20,171 $ 5,916 $ 5,270 Assumed reserve for representations and warranties 7,000 Reserve charges (8,711 ) (9,012 ) (2,516 ) Provision for representations and warranties 11,758 16,267 3,162 Reserve for representations and warranties, end of year $ 23,218 $ 20,171 $ 5,916 80 Table of Contents Table 35 Mortgage Loan Repurchase Statistics Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 (dollar amounts in thousands) Number of loans sold 22,146 28,744 Amount of loans sold (UPB) $ 3,170,903 $ 4,309,247 Number of loans repurchased(1) 128 399 Amount of loans repurchased (UPB)(1) $ 19,442 $ 61,754 Number of claims received 445 472 Successful dispute rate(2) 50 % 31 % Number of make whole payments(3) 72 95 Amount of make whole payments(3) $ 5,553 $ 7,679 (1) Loans repurchased are loans that fail to meet the purchasers terms.

Foreclosure Documentation Compared to the high volume servicers, we service a relatively low volume of residential mortgage foreclosures, with approximately 4,200 foreclosure cases as of December 31, 2011, in states that require foreclosures to proceed through the courts. We have reviewed our residential foreclosure process. We have not found any evidence suggesting that any foreclosure by the Bank should not have proceeded. We have and are strengthening our processes and controls to ensure that our foreclosure processes do not have the deficiencies identified in the interagency review of foreclosure policies and procedures dated April 2011, of 14 federally regulated mortgage servicers. Compliance Risk Financial institutions are subject to a multitude of laws, rules, and regulations emanating at both the federal and state levels. These broad based mandates include, but are not limited to, expectations on anti money laundering, lending limits, client privacy, fair lending, community reinvestment, and other important areas. Recently, the volume and complexity of regulatory changes have added to the overall compliance risk. We have invested in various resources to help ensure we meet expectations, and we have a team of compliance experts dedicated to ensuring our conformance. We require training for our colleagues for several broad based laws and regulations. For example, all of our colleagues are expected to pass courses on anti money laundering and customer privacy. Those colleagues who are engaged in lending activities must also take training related to flood disaster protection, equal credit opportunity, fair lending, and / or a variety of other courses related to the extension of credit. We set a high standard of expectation for adherence to compliance management and seek to continuously enhance our performance. Capital (This section should be read in conjunction with Significant Items 4 and 7, and Notes 12 and 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) Capital is managed both at the Bank and on a consolidated basis. Capital levels are maintained based on regulatory capital requirements and the economic capital required to support credit, market, liquidity, and operational risks inherent in our business, and to provide the flexibility needed for future growth and new business opportunities. 81 Table of Contents Shareholders equity totaled $5.4 billion at December 31, 2011, representing a $0.4 billion, or 9%, increase compared with December 31, 2010. This increase primarily reflected an increase in retained earnings. We believe our current level of capital is adequate. Preferred Stock Exchange Offer (This section should be read in conjunction with Significant Item 1 and Notes 12, 14, and 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) As a result of bank capital standards arising from the Dodd Frank Act, beginning in 2013, trust preferred securities will eventually no longer be considered Tier 1 risk based capital. The Exchange Offer described below is intended to improve our Tier 1 risk based capital in anticipation of these regulations by replacing a portion of our trust preferred securities with preferred stock, which we believe will qualify as additional Tier 1 risk based capital. During the 2011 fourth quarter, Huntington issued $35.5 million par value Floating Rate Series B Non Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock in exchange for $35.5 million of (1) Huntington Capital I Floating Rate Capital Securities, (2) Huntington Capital II Floating Rate Capital Securities, (3) Sky Financial Capital Trust III Floating Rate Capital Securities and (4) Sky Financial Capital Trust IV Floating Rate Capital Securities. Huntington will pay dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock at a floating rate equal to three month LIBOR plus a spread of 2.70%. Upon receipt of the aforementioned trust preferred securities, Huntington exchanged $32.5 million of the trust preferred securities with the applicable Trust for a like amount of debentures issued by us. The debentures were surrendered to the applicable trustee for cancellation. Huntington anticipates exchanging the remaining $3.0 million of trust preferred securities and retiring the related subordinated debt obligation in the first quarter of 2012. As a result of the exchange, we recognized pretax gains of $9.7 million. These transactions were recorded as gains on early extinguishment of debt. TARP Capital During the 2011 first quarter, we fully exited our TARP relationship by repurchasing for $49.1 million the ten year warrant we had issued to the Treasury as part of the TARP. Refer to the 2010 Form 10 K for a complete discussion regarding the issuing and repayment of our TARP Capital. 82 Table of Contents Capital Adequacy The following table presents risk weighted assets and other financial data necessary to calculate certain financial ratios, including the Tier 1 common equity ratio, which we use to measure capital adequacy: Table 36 Capital Adequacy December 31, 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 (dollar amounts in millions) Consolidated capital calculations: Common shareholders equity $ 5,032 $ 4,618 $ 3,648 $ 5,351 $ 5,951 Preferred shareholders equity 386 363 1,688 1,878 Total shareholders equity 5,418 4,981 5,336 7,229 5,951 Goodwill (444 ) (444 ) (444 ) (3,055 ) (3,059 ) Other intangible assets (175 ) (229 ) (289 ) (357 ) (428 ) Other intangible asset deferred tax liability(1) 61 80 101 125 150 Total tangible equity(2) 4,860 4,388 4,704 3,942 2,614 Preferred shareholders equity (386 ) (363 ) (1,688 ) (1,878 ) Total tangible common equity(2) $ 4,474 $ 4,025 $ 3,016 $ 2,064 $ 2,614 Total assets $ 54,451 $ 53,820 $ 51,555 $ 54,353 $ 54,697 Goodwill (444 ) (444 ) (444 ) (3,055 ) (3,059 ) Other intangible assets (175 ) (229 ) (289 ) (357 ) (428 ) Other intangible asset deferred tax liability(1) 61 80 101 125 150 Total tangible assets(2) $ 53,893 $ 53,227 $ 50,923 $ 51,066 $ 51,360 Tier 1 capital $ 5,557 $ 5,022 $ 5,201 $ 5,036 $ 3,460 Preferred shareholders equity (386 ) (363 ) (1,688 ) (1,878 ) Trust preferred securities (532 ) (570 ) (570 ) (736 ) (785 ) REIT preferred stock (50 ) (50 ) (50 ) (50 ) (50 ) Tier 1 common equity(2) $ 4,589 $ 4,039 $ 2,893 $ 2,372 $ 2,625 Risk weighted assets (RWA) $ 45,891 $ 43,471 $ 43,248 $ 46,994 $ 46,044 Tier 1 common equity / RWA ratio(2) 10.00 % 9.29 % 6.69 % 5.05 % 5.70 % Tangible equity / tangible asset ratio(2) 9.02 8.24 9.24 7.72 5.09 Tangible common equity / tangible asset ratio(2) 8.30 7.56 5.92 4.04 5.09 Tangible common equity / RWA ratio(2) 9.75 9.26 6.97 4.39 5.68 (1) Intangible assets are net of deferred tax liability and calculated assuming a 35% tax rate. (2) See Non Regulatory and Capital Ratios located in the Additional Disclosure section. Capital continued to strengthen as period end capital ratios improved compared to December 31, 2010. Our Tier 1 common risk based ratio improved 71 basis points to 10.00% at December 31, 2011. This increase primarily reflected the combination of an increase in retained earnings and a reduction in the disallowed tax deferred asset, partially offset by an increase in risk weighted assets and the impacts related to the payments of dividends and the repurchase of the TARP warrants. Although not a regulatory capital ratio, the Tier 1 common risk based ratio has gained prominence with our regulators and investors. The Dodd Frank Act requires that any bank with assets over $50.0 billion would be subject to additional scrutiny. U.S. regulators have identified such qualifying banks as SIFIs. With $54.5 billion in assets at December 31, 2011, we are at the lower range of the SIFI group. Although we do not have sufficient 83 Table of Contents information to know what the impacts will be to us, we believe that our current period end capital ratios are well positioned. In December 2011, the Federal Reserve issued a proposal to implement Sections 165 and 166 of the Dodd Frank Act that would enhance prudential standards on SIFIs. The proposal uses or enhances requirements already imposed, or to be imposed, on SIFIs. Regulatory Capital Regulatory capital ratios are the primary metrics used by regulators in assessing the safety and soundness of banks. We intend to maintain both our and the Banks risk based capital ratios at levels at which both would be considered well capitalized by regulators. The Bank is primarily supervised and regulated by the OCC, which establishes regulatory capital guidelines for banks similar to those established for bank holding companies by the Federal Reserve Board. Regulatory capital primarily consists of Tier 1 risk based capital and Tier 2 risk based capital. The sum of Tier 1 risk based capital and Tier 2 risk based capital equals our total risk based capital. The following table presents certain regulatory capital data at both the consolidated and Bank levels for the past five years: Table 37 Selected Regulatory Capital Data At December 31, 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 (dollar amounts in millions) Total risk weighted assets Consolidated $ 45,891 $ 43,471 $ 43,248 $ 46,994 $ 46,044 Bank 45,651 43,281 43,149 46,477 45,731 Tier 1 risk based capital Consolidated 5,557 5,022 5,201 5,036 3,460 Bank 4,245 3,683 2,873 2,995 3,037 Tier 2 risk based capital Consolidated 1,221 1,263 1,030 1,499 1,535 Bank 1,508 1,866 1,907 1,983 1,613 Total risk based capital Consolidated 6,778 6,285 6,231 6,535 4,995 Bank 5,753 5,549 4,780 4,978 4,650 Tier 1 leverage ratio Consolidated 10.28 % 9.41 % 10.09 % 9.82 % 6.77 % Bank 7.89 6.97 5.59 5.99 5.99 Tier 1 risk based capital ratio Consolidated 12.11 11.55 12.03 10.72 7.51 Bank 9.30 8.51 6.66 6.44 6.64 Total risk based capital ratio Consolidated 14.77 14.46 14.41 13.91 10.85 Bank 12.60 12.82 11.08 10.71 10.17 The increase in our consolidated Tier 1 risk based capital ratios compared with December 31, 2010, primarily reflected 2011 earnings and a reduction in the disallowed deferred tax asset, partially offset by an increase in risk weighted assets and the impacts related to the payments of dividends and the repurchase of the TARP warrants. At December 31, 2011, our Tier 1 and total risk based capital in excess of the minimum levels required to be considered well capitalized were $2.8 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. The Bank had Tier 1 and total risk based capital in excess of the minimum levels required to be considered well capitalized of $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2011. 84 Table of Contents Other Capital Matters Beginning with the cash dividend declared on July 21, 2011, our quarterly cash dividend increased to $0.04 per common share from $0.01 per common share. We consider disciplined capital management as a key objective, with dividends representing one component. Our strong capital ratios and expectations for continued earnings growth positions us to continue to actively explore additional capital management opportunities. We are participating in the Federal Reserves CapPR stress test process and made our capital plan submission in January 2012. The Federal Reserve will evaluate our capital plan based on our risk profile and the strength of our internal capital assessment process under regulatory capital standards currently applicable and in accordance with our plans to address proposed revisions to the regulatory capital framework as set forth in Basel III and relevant provisions of the Dodd Frank Act. The Federal Reserves evaluation will take into consideration any capital distribution plans, such as plans to increase common stock dividends or to reinstate common stock repurchase programs and we expect to receive the results of their evaluation by the end of the 2012 first quarter. While we can give no assurances as to the outcome or specific interactions with the regulators, we believe we have a strong capital position. BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSION Overview We have four major business segments: Retail and Business Banking; Regional and Commercial Banking; Automobile Finance and Commercial Real Estate; and Wealth Advisors, Government Finance, and Home Lending. A Treasury / Other function also includes our insurance business and other unallocated assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. While this section reviews financial performance from a business segment perspective, it should be read in conjunction with the Discussion of Results of Operations, Note 25 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, and other sections for a full understanding of our consolidated financial performance. Business segment results are determined based upon our management reporting system, which assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each of the business segments. The process is designed around our organizational and management structure and, accordingly, the results derived are not necessarily comparable with similar information published by other financial institutions. Optimal Customer Relationship (OCR) Our OCR initiative is a cross business segment strategy designed to increase overall customer profitability and retention by deepening product and service penetration to consumer and commercial customers. We believe this can be accomplished by taking our broad array of services and products and delivering them through a rigorous and disciplined sales management process that is consistent across all business segments and regions. It is also supported by robust sales and cross referral technology. OCR was introduced in late 2009. Through 2010, much of the effort was spent on defining processes, sales training, and systems development to fully capture and measure OCR performance metrics. This year, we introduced OCR related metrics for commercial relationships, which complements the previously disclosed consumer OCR related metrics. CONSUMER OCR PERFORMANCE For consumer OCR performance there are three key performance metrics: (1) the number of checking account households, (2) the number of product penetration per consumer checking account household, and (3) the revenue generated. 85 Table of Contents The growth in consumer checking account number of households is a result of both new sales of checking accounts and improved retention of existing checking account households. The overall objective is to grow the number of households, along with an increase in product penetration. We use the checking account since it typically represents the primary banking relationship product. Further, in our definition of a checking account household, we only count a product or service once. We believe this is a better metric in that consumer behavior and loyalty are driven more by the variety of products used rather than just the number of products. For example, a household that has one checking account and one mortgage, we count as having two services. A household with four checking accounts, we count as having one service. The household relationship utilizing two services is viewed to be more profitable and loyal, even though it has a smaller number of accounts. The overall objective, therefore, is to decrease the percentage of 1 3 services per consumer checking account household, while increasing the percentage of those with 4 or more services. The following table presents consumer checking account household OCR metrics: Table 38 Consumer Checking Household OCR Cross sell Report 2011 2010 Fourth Third Second First Fourth Number of households 1,095,638 1,073,708 1,042,424 1,015,951 993,272 Product Penetration by Number of Services 1 Service 4.1 % 4.4 % 4.5 % 4.9 % 5.3 % 2 3 Services 22.4 22.8 24.2 24.6 25.3 4+ Services 73.5 72.8 71.3 70.5 69.4 Total revenue (in millions) $ 230.6 $ 251.9 $ 260.0 $ 248.6 $ 240.3 Our emphasis on cross sell, coupled with customers increasingly being attracted by benefits such as 24 Hour Grace&reg; on overdrafts and more recently the launch of Asterisk Free Checking, are having a positive effect. The percent of consumer households utilizing over four products at the end of the 2011 fourth quarter was 73.5%, up from 69.4% at the end of last year. In 2011, consumer checking account households grew at 10%. Total consumer checking account household revenue in the 2011 fourth quarter was $230.6 million, down $21.3 million, or 8%, from the 2011 third quarter, and down $9.7 million, or 4%, from the year ago quarter. These declines were primarily driven by a decline in interchange revenue related to the implementation of the Durbin amendment for the 2011 fourth quarter and the decline in the FTP related net interest income on core certificates of deposit. COMMERCIAL OCR PERFORMANCE For commercial OCR performance there are three key performance metrics: (1) the number of commercial relationships, (2) the number of product penetration per commercial relationship, and (3) the revenue generated. The growth in the number of commercial relationships is a result of both new sales of checking accounts and improved retention of existing commercial accounts. The overall objective is to grow the number of relationships, along with an increase in product service distribution. The commercial relationship is defined as a business banking or commercial banking customer with a checking account relationship. We use this metric because we believe that the checking account anchors a business relationship and creates the opportunity to increase our cross sell. 86 Table of Contents The following table presents commercial relationship OCR metrics: Table 39 Commercial Relationship OCR Cross sell Report 2011 2010 Fourth Third Second First Fourth Commercial Relationships 138,357 135,826 133,165 130,240 127,596 Product Penetration by Number of Services 1 Service 28.4 % 29.7 % 30.7 % 32.1 % 32.9 % 2 3 Services 40.2 41.1 42.6 42.5 42.9 4+ Services 31.4 29.2 26.7 25.4 24.2 Total revenue (in millions) $ 175.4 $ 175.5 $ 166.6 $ 157.7 $ 160.8 By focusing on targeted relationships we are able to achieve higher product service distribution among our commercial relationships. Our expanded product offerings allow us to focus not only on the credit driven relationship, but leverage these relationships to generate a deeper share of wallet. The percent of commercial relationships utilizing over four products at the end of the 2011 fourth quarter was 31.4%, up from 24.2% at the end of 2010. In 2011, commercial relationships grew at 8%. Total commercial relationship revenue in the 2011 fourth quarter was $175.4 million, down $0.1 million, or less than 1%, from the 2011 third quarter, and was up $14.6 million, or 9%, higher than the year ago quarter. This was primarily driven by capital markets activities. Revenue Sharing Revenue is recorded in the business segment responsible for the related product or service. Fee sharing is recorded to allocate portions of such revenue to other business segments involved in selling to, or providing service to, customers. Results of operations for the business segments reflect these fee sharing allocations. Expense Allocation The management accounting process that develops the business segment reporting utilizes various estimates and allocation methodologies to measure the performance of the business segments. Expenses are allocated to business segments using a two phase approach. The first phase consists of measuring and assigning unit costs (activity based costs) to activities related to product origination and servicing. These activity based costs are then extended, based on volumes, with the resulting amount allocated to business segments that own the related products. The second phase consists of the allocation of overhead costs to all four business segments from Treasury / Other. We utilize a full allocation methodology, where all Treasury / Other expenses, except those related to our insurance business, reported Significant Items (except for the goodwill impairment), and a small amount of other residual unallocated expenses, are allocated to the four business segments. Funds Transfer Pricing (FTP) We use an active and centralized FTP methodology to attribute appropriate net interest income to the business segments. The intent of the FTP methodology is to eliminate all interest rate risk from the business segments by providing matched duration funding of assets and liabilities. The result is to centralize the financial impact, management, and reporting of interest rate and liquidity risk in the Treasury / Other function where it can be centrally monitored and managed. The Treasury / Other function charges (credits) an internal cost of funds for assets held in (or pays for funding provided by) each business segment. The FTP rate is based on prevailing market interest rates for comparable duration assets (or liabilities), and includes an estimate for the cost of liquidity (liquidity premium). Deposits of an indeterminate maturity receive an FTP credit based on a combination of vintage based average lives and replicating portfolio pool rates. Other assets, liabilities, and capital are charged (credited) with a four year moving average FTP rate. The denominator in the net interest margin calculation has been modified to add the amount of net funds provided by each business segment for all periods presented. 87 Table of Contents Treasury / Other The Treasury / Other function includes revenue and expense related to our insurance business, and assets, liabilities, and equity not directly assigned or allocated to one of the four business segments. Assets include investment securities and bank owned life insurance. The financial impact associated with our FTP methodology, as described above, is also included. Net interest income includes the impact of administering our investment securities portfolios and the net impact of derivatives used to hedge interest rate sensitivity. Noninterest income includes insurance income, miscellaneous fee income not allocated to other business segments, such as bank owned life insurance income and any investment security and trading asset gains or losses. Noninterest expense includes any insurance related expenses, as well as certain corporate administrative, merger, and other miscellaneous expenses not allocated to other business segments. The provision for income taxes for the business segments is calculated at a statutory 35% tax rate, though our overall effective tax rate is lower. As a result, Treasury / Other reflects a credit for income taxes representing the difference between the lower actual effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate used to allocate income taxes to the business segments.

This was an increase of $44.4 million, or 34%, when compared to 2010. Results for the current year continued to be positively impacted by an increase in the number of households and improved product penetration, along with loan balance growth, improvements in deposit mix plus deposit spread management. The household and relationship growth for both consumer and small business customers has come from an increase in direct mail and media, plus improvements in sales execution. The retail deposit strategy is focused on increased checking balances and improved deposit margin on the remaining deposit portfolio through reductions in CD balances and increased money market and savings balances. This strategy has improved deposit spreads by 23 basis points compared to 2010. Provision for credit losses in 2011 was lower than the prior year as loan credit quality benefitted from aggressive account management and disciplined centralized underwriting both in consumer and small business. Finally, average loan and leases increased 3% over the prior year even though $257 million of SBA loans were sold during 2011. The loan portfolio has also had a 7 basis point improvement in the portfolio spread. The increase in net income reflected a combination of factors including: $65.3 million, or 8%, increase in net interest income. $38.0 million, or 24%, decline in the provision for credit losses. $10.6 million, or 3%, increase in non interest income. Partially offset by: $45.6 million, or 5%, increase in noninterest expense. The increase in net interest income from the year ago period reflected: $0.4 billion, or 3%, increase in total average loans and leases. 23 basis point increase in our deposit spread. 90 Table of Contents Partially offset by: $13.9 million of lower equity funding related to lower rate environment. The increase in total average loans and leases from the year ago period reflected: $365 million, or 5%, increase in the home equity portfolio. $68 million, or 2%, increase in our Business Banking portfolio even though there was a $164 million increase in sales of SBA loans, which generated $14.1 million in additional gains. Partially offset by: $123 million, or 11%, decrease in the residential mortgage portfolio reflecting the continued strategy of originating residential real estate for sale and not to hold in the portfolio. $90 million, or 17%, decrease in the CRE portfolio reflecting our commitment to reduce exposure to CRE loans. The decrease in total average deposits from the year ago period reflected: $1.5 billion, or 16%, decrease in core certificates of deposit. Partially offset by: $0.6 billion, or 18%, increase in noninterest bearing demand deposits. $0.3 billion, or 6%, increase in interest bearing demand deposits. $0.3 billion, or 4%, increase in money market deposits. The decrease in the provision for credit losses from the year ago period reflected: $97.2 million, or 43%, decrease in consumer NCOs and a $19.9 million, or 32%, decrease in commercial NCOs. Expressed as an annualized percentage of related average balance, total NCOs decreased to 1.41% in 2011 from 2.46% in 2010. The overall decline in NCOs was the result of improved credit quality of the portfolio. The increase in noninterest income from the year ago period reflected: $29.2 million, or 99%, increase in other income, which is primarily related to a $20.2 million increase in gains on sale of SBA loans and loan fees. The remainder reflects increases in both consumer and commercial fee based income as well as other income associated with debit card processor conversion based activities. $2.7 million, or 11%, increase in brokerage income, which reflected higher fee sharing from Huntington Insurance due to increased sales of investment products. Partially offset by: $21.1 million, or 10%, decrease in deposit service charge income due to the full year impact of Reg E changes relating to certain overdraft fees and Huntingtons 24 Hour Grace&reg; feature on all consumer checking accounts. $2.4 million, or 8%, decrease in non brokerage fee sharing, primarily due to lower mortgage fee share revenue. 91 Table of Contents The increase in noninterest expense from the year ago period reflected: $27.0 million, or 10%, increase in personnel costs, primarily driven by full time salaries, higher sales commissions, and increased benefits costs, due primarily to the addition of 41 in store and traditional branches in 2011. $18.6 million, or 3%, increase in other expenses, primarily due to a $12.9 million increase in outside services related to the increase in debit card processes and conversion expenses, $7.8 million increase in marketing expenses, which primarily reflected two additional quarters of advertising and additional direct mail expenses. Our brand advertising did not start until June 2010; therefore 2011 represents a more normalized run rate. Also contributing to the increase was a $6.2 million increase in occupancy expenses associated with the rebranding and refurbishment effort of the branch and ATM network. These increases were offset by a $4.5 million decrease in OREO loss and foreclosure expenses and a $5.4 million decrease in intangible amortization. 2010 vs. 2009 Retail and Business Banking reported net income of $131.0 million in 2010, compared with a net loss of $26.5 million in 2009. The $157.5 million increase included a $56.4 million, or 7%, increase in net interest income and a $312.2 million, or 66%, decline in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by a $105.5 million, or 13%, increase in noninterest expense.

This was an increase of $71.4 million, or 186%, compared to 2010. Contributing to the increase in net income was growth in both net interest income and noninterest income due to the successful execution of our strategic initiatives. In addition, current year results continued to reflect significant improvement in provision for credit losses, resulting from the proactive treatment of problem credits and an improved credit environment. 92 Table of Contents Significant investments have been made in our sales process, which entails robust customer relationship planning, as well as a renewed investment in technology, including OCR; a referral tracking system and new customer relationship management system. These investments have resulted in a 32% increase in loan originations over the last 12 months. Additionally, the Commercial Relationship Manager sales teams were focused on the importance of deposit relationships as well as partnering with Treasury Management to deliver customer focused liquidity management solutions. The increase in net income reflected a combination of factors including: $93.7 million, or 89%, decline in the provision for credit losses. $32.9 million, or 16%, increase in net interest income. $16.1 million, or 14%, increase in noninterest income. Partially offset by: $32.8 million, or 21%, increase in noninterest expense, due to our strategic initiatives investments. The increase in net interest income from the year ago period reflected: $0.9 billion, or 12%, increase in total average loans and leases. $0.7 billion, or 22%, increase in average core deposits. 10 basis point increase in the net interest margin due to a 29 basis point increase in the commercial loan spread.

In 2011, a money desk was created to assist commercial bankers with tailored solutions for customers having large dollar depository needs. This additional support and expertise provided additional value and helped our bankers win relationships and encouraged their expanded prospecting efforts. Strategic initiatives to deepen customer relationships, new and innovative product offerings, pricing discipline, and sales and retention initiatives. 93 Table of Contents Best practices from each region were shared and institutionalized. The decrease in the provision for credit losses from the year ago period reflected: $26.7 million decrease in NCOs. Expressed as a percentage of related average balance, NCOs decreased to 0.48% in 2011 from 0.89% in 2010. The decrease in NCOs was the result of improved credit quality in the portfolio. The increase in noninterest income from the year ago period reflected: $14.2 million, or 25%, increase in other income, of which $9.8 million represents increased sales of customer interest rate protection products and $4.1 million represents an increase in capital markets income resulting from strategic investments made over the last year in these types of products and services. $6.4 million, or 262%, increase in brokerage income primarily due to the transfer of our institutional sales business to our business segment from WGH during 2011. Partially offset by: $2.4 million, or 48%, decrease in operating lease income as lease originations were structured as direct finance leases beginning in the 2009 second quarter. $2.2 million, or 5%, decrease in deposit service charge income resulting primarily from completed strategic exits. The increase in noninterest expense from the year ago period reflected: $26.8 million, or 41%, increase in personnel costs, which represents a 16% increase in full year average FTE employees. This increase in personnel is attributable to our strategic investments in our core footprint markets, vertical strategies, and product capabilities, as well as transfers of Treasury Management colleagues from our Retail and Business Banking segment. $8.0 million, or 9%, increase in other expenses, which reflected $5.5 million in expanded marketing efforts and community development, as well as $2.1 million increase in FDIC insurance.

This was an increase of $139.7 million when compared to 2010. Results for 2011 continued to be significantly and positively impacted by lower provisions for credit losses due to reductions in required reserve levels as the underlying credit quality of the portfolios continued to improve and / or stabilize. This was in contrast to 2010, which included higher provisions for credit losses in order to increase reserves due to economic and CRE related weaknesses in our markets. Also contributing to the increase in net income was growth in net interest income. This primarily reflected the benefit of a higher net interest margin due to improved risk based pricing. Growth in average total loans and leases reflected the positive impact of an increase in auto finance loan production, which exceeded the record production levels reached in 2010, partially offset by the planned continued reduction in our CRE exposure and the sale of $1.0 billion of indirect auto loans in the third quarter of 2011. The increase in net income reflected a combination of factors including: $193.7 million, or 105%, decline in the provision for credit losses. $26.1 million, or 8%, increase in net interest income. $3.7 million, or 5%, increase in noninterest income. Partially offset by: $8.7 million, or 6%, increase in noninterest expense. The increase in net interest income from the year ago period reflected: 20 basis point increase in the net interest margin. This increase primarily reflected the continuation of a risk based pricing strategy in the CRE portfolio that began in early 2009 and has resulted in improved spreads on CRE loan renewals as well as new business originated. 95 Table of Contents Total average loans and leases were essentially unchanged from the year ago period and reflected: $1.0 billion, or 20%, increase in the average consumer automobile portfolio. This increase resulted from continued strong origination levels. Total production for 2011 was $3.6 billion compared to $3.4 billion for the year ago period. Contributing to this increase was the positive impact of our expansion into eastern Pennsylvania and New England. Partially offset by: $1.0 billion, or 12%, decrease in our average commercial portfolio. This decrease primarily reflected a $1.0 billion decrease in CRE loans offset, in part, by a $0.3 billion increase in automobile floor plan loans. The decline in CRE loans continued to reflect our managed reduction of this overall exposure, particularly in the noncore portfolio. The increase in total average deposits from the year ago period reflected: $79 million, or 12%, increase in average core deposits reflecting our commitment to strengthening relationships with core customers and prospects as well as new commercial automobile dealer relationships developed in 2010 and 2011. The decrease in the provision for credit losses from the year ago period reflected: $183.7 million, or 57%, decrease in commercial NCOs. Expressed as a percentage of related average balances, commercial NCOs decreased to 1.97% in 2011 from 4.03% in 2010. $11.5 million, or 43%, decrease in indirect automobile related NCOs. As a percentage of related average balances, indirect automobile related NCOs were 0.26% in 2011 compared to 0.54% in 2010. This decrease reflected our consistent focus on high credit quality of originations combined with a very strong resale market for used vehicles. A reduction in required reserve levels, primarily due to lower levels of commercial NALs which totaled $230 million at December 31, 2011, down 39% compared to December 31, 2010. The increase in noninterest income from the year ago period reflected: $22.4 million, or 89%, increase in other income which reflected a $15.5 million gain on the securitization, a sale of $1.0 billion of indirect auto loans, and a $12.1 million increase in market related gains on various equity investments. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in fee income associated with a lower volume of vehicles being returned at the end of their lease terms. Partially offset by: $19.2 million, or 42%, decrease in operating lease income resulting from the continued runoff of that portfolio as we exited that business at the end of 2008. The increase in noninterest expense from the year ago period reflected: $20.9 million, or 22%, increase in other expenses, primarily reflecting a $21.7 million increase in allocated costs associated with higher production and other activity levels. In addition, other expense in the year ago period was reduced by $3.1 million of OREO related gains as compared to $0.1 million of OREO losses in 2011. These increases were partially offset by lower legal and other collection related costs. $4.7 million, or 19%, increase in personnel costs, which primarily related to higher origination related activities, including automobile lending market expansion and additions to the CRE team to support our core CRE customers. 96 Table of Contents Partially offset by: $17.0 million, or 46%, decrease in operating lease expense resulting from the continued runoff of that portfolio. 2010 vs. 2009 AFCRE reported net income of $46.5 million in 2010, compared with a net loss of $588.2 million in 2009. The $634.6 million increase included a $60.9 million, or 22%, increase in net interest income and a $911.3 million, or 83%, decline in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by a $5.8 million, or 4%, increase in noninterest expense.

Results for the current year were impacted by a decrease in mortgage banking revenue, which reflected a decline in originations and the negative impact of net MSR activity. The other businesses within the WGH segment experienced significant growth, with increased revenues in 2011 when compared to 2010. As a result of improved credit quality in the portfolio, NCO activity decreased in 2011. A focus on structured investment sales, increased brokerage commissions and, despite market value declines in assets under management in the third quarter of 2011, trust income increased in 2011. 97 Table of Contents The decrease in net income reflected a combination of factors including: $89.9 million, or 27%, decrease in noninterest income. Partially offset by: $43.6 million, or 46%, decrease in the provision for credit losses. $30.3 million, or 18%, increase in net interest income. The increase in net interest income from the year ago period reflected: $0.6 billion, or 13%, increase in average total loans and leases. $1.1 billion, or 16%, increase in average total deposits. Partially offset by: 7 basis point decrease in the net interest margin. The increase in total average loans and leases from the year ago period reflected: $0.5 billion, or 16%, increase in the residential mortgage portfolio driven by historically low interest rates. The increase in average total deposits from the year ago period reflected: $0.8 billion, or 27%, increase in money market deposits. $0.7 billion or 60% increase in non interest bearing demand deposits driven by increases in commercial deposits expected to be short term and checking deposits of governmental entities. Partially offset by: $0.3 billion, or 25%, decrease in interest bearing demand deposits. The decrease in the provision for credit losses from the year ago period reflected: $22.2 million, or 28%, decrease in NCOs. Expressed as a percentage of related average balance, NCOs decreased to 1.06% in 2011 from 1.65% in 2010. The overall decline in NCOs was the result of improved credit quality of the portfolio. The decrease in noninterest income from the year ago period reflected: $91.5 million, or 61%, decrease in mortgage banking income due to a $52.8 million decline from MSR activity and hedging costs and a $39.6 million decline in other mortgage banking income due primarily to lower origination volumes in 2011 compared to 2010. $3.1 million, or 24%, decrease in insurance related income which reflected lower sales of wealth transfer products in 2011. Partially offset by: $6.8 million, or 6%, increase in trust service income reflecting a $1.3 billion increase in average assets under management and a $3.2 billion increase in average custodial assets. $2.0 million, or 5%, increase in brokerage income. Brokerage commissions increased $9.3 million, or 15%. The increase in retail brokerage commissions reflected improved sales of structured investment products. Institutional brokerage was transferred to the Regional and Commercial segment and the amount reported in WGH declined by $6.7 million. 98 Table of Contents The decrease in noninterest expense from the year ago period reflected: $8.0 million, or 5%, decrease in other expenses, which reflected primarily lower expenses allocated from other segments. Partially offset by: $5.8 million, or 3%, increase in personnel costs, which reflected higher benefit related expenses as well as higher sales commissions. 2010 vs. 2009 WGH reported net income of $34.8 million in 2010, compared with a net income of $1.7 million in 2009. The $33.1 million increase included a $70.9 million, or 26%, increase in noninterest income, $4.9 million, or 3%, increase in net interest income and a $33.0 million, or 26%, decline in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by a $57.9 million, or 19%, increase in noninterest expense. RESULTS FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER Earnings Discussion In the 2011 fourth quarter, we reported net income of $126.9 million, or $0.14 per common share, compared with net income of $122.9 million, or $0.05 per common share, in the year ago quarter. Significant items impacting fourth quarter performance included: Table 46 Significant Items Influencing Earnings Performance Comparison Impact(1) After tax EPS(2) (dollar amounts in millions, except per share amounts) Three Months Ended: December 31, 2011 GAAP income $ 126.9 $ 0.14 Gain on early extinguishment of debt 9.7 0.01 Visa&reg; related derivative loss (6.4 ) December 31, 2010 GAAP income $ 122.9 $ 0.05 Preferred stock conversion deemed dividend (0.07 ) (1) Favorable (unfavorable) impact on GAAP earnings; pretax unless otherwise noted. (2) After tax. EPS is reflected on a fully diluted basis. Net Interest Income / Average Balance Sheet FTE net interest income decreased $0.5 million, or less than 1%, from the year ago quarter. This reflected the $0.1 billion, or less than 1%, decrease in average total earning assets, partially offset by a 1 basis point increase in the fully taxable equivalent net interest margin. The decrease in average earning assets reflected the following factors: $1.7 billion, or 17%, decrease in average total available for sale and other securities. Partially offset by: $1.7 billion, or 5%, increase in average total loans and leases. 99 Table of Contents The following table presents the $1.7 billion, or 5%, increase in average total loans and leases: Table 47 Average Loans/Leases 2011 Fourth Quarter vs. 2010 Fourth Quarter Fourth Quarter Change 2011 2010 Amount Percent (dollar amounts in millions) Average Loans/Leases Commercial and industrial $ 14,219 $ 12,767 $ 1,452 11 % Commercial real estate 5,958 6,798 (840 ) (12 ) Total commercial 20,177 19,565 612 3 Automobile 5,639 5,520 119 2 Home equity 8,149 7,709 440 6 Residential mortgage 5,043 4,430 613 14 Other consumer 511 576 (65 ) (11 ) Total consumer 19,342 18,235 1,107 6 Total loans/leases $ 39,519 $ 37,800 $ 1,719 5 % The increase in average total loans and leases reflected: $1.5 billion, or 11%, increase in average C&I portfolio. Growth from the year ago quarter reflected the benefits from our strategic initiatives focusing on large corporate , asset based lending, business banking, automobile floor plan lending, and equipment finance. Traditional middle market loans continued to grow despite line utilization rates that remained well below historical norms. $0.6 billion, or 14%, increase in average residential mortgages. Partially offset by: $0.8 billion, or 12%, decrease in average CRE loans, reflecting the continued execution of our plan to reduce this exposure, primarily in the noncore CRE segment. This reduction is expected to continue at a slower pace. The following table details the $1.9 billion, or 5%, increase in average total deposits: Table 48 Average Deposits 2011 Fourth Quarter vs. 2010 Fourth Quarter Fourth Quarter Change 2011 2010 Amount Percent (dollar amounts in millions) Average Deposits Demand deposits: noninterest bearing $ 10,716 $ 7,188 $ 3,528 49 % Demand deposits: interest bearing 5,570 5,317 253 5 Total demand deposits 16,286 12,505 3,781 30 Money market deposits 13,594 13,158 436 3 Savings and other domestic deposits 4,706 4,640 66 1 Core certificates of deposit 6,769 8,646 (1,877 ) (22 ) Total core deposits 41,355 38,949 2,406 6 Other deposits 2,249 2,755 (506 ) (18 ) Total deposits $ 43,604 $ 41,704 $ 1,900 5 % 100 Table of Contents The increase in average total deposits from the year ago quarter reflected: $2.4 billion, or 6%, growth in average total core deposits which included a $3.8 billion, or 30%, growth in average total demand deposits, partially offset by $1.9 billion, or 22%, decline in average core certificates of deposit. Partially offset by: $0.3 billion, or 45%, decline in average other domestic deposits of $250,000 or more, reflecting a strategy to reduce such noncore funding. Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses in the 2011 fourth quarter was $45.3 million, down $41.7 million, or 48%, from the year ago quarter, reflecting a reduction of the ACL as a result of the improvement in the underlying credit quality of the loan portfolio. The 2011 fourth quarter provision for credit losses was $38.6 million less than total NCOs, reflecting the resolution of problem loans for which reserves had been previously established. Noninterest Income (This section should be read in conjunction with Significant Item 2.) Noninterest income decreased $34.9 million, or 13%, from the year ago quarter. Table 49 Noninterest Income 2011 Fourth Quarter vs. 2010 Fourth Quarter Fourth Quarter Change 2011 2010 Amount Percent (dollar amounts in thousands) Service charges on deposit accounts $ 63,324 $ 55,810 $ 7,514 13 % Trust services 28,775 29,394 (619 ) (2 ) Electronic banking 18,282 28,900 (10,618 ) (37 ) Mortgage banking income 24,098 53,170 (29,072 ) (55 ) Brokerage income 18,688 16,953 1,735 10 Insurance income 17,906 19,678 (1,772 ) (9 ) Bank owned life insurance income 14,271 16,113 (1,842 ) (11 ) Capital markets fees 9,811 8,779 1,032 12 Gain on sale of loans 2,884 3,423 (539 ) (16 ) Automobile operating lease income 4,727 10,463 (5,736 ) (55 ) Securities gains (losses) (3,878 ) (103 ) (3,775 ) 3665 Other income 30,464 21,640 8,824 41 Total noninterest income $ 229,352 $ 264,220 $ (34,868 ) (13 )% The $34.9 million decrease reflected: $29.1 million, or 55%, decrease in mortgage banking income. This primarily reflected a $27.0 million decrease in origination and secondary marketing income, as originations decreased 39% from the year ago quarter. Also impacting the year over year comparison was a $4.0 million net MSR hedging loss in the current quarter compared to a net MSR hedging gain of $3.3 million in the year ago quarter. $10.6 million, or 37%, decrease in electronic banking income, primarily due to the $10.4 million negative impact related to implementing the mandated lower debit card interchange fee structure. $5.7 million, or 55%, decline in automobile operating lease income reflecting the impact of a declining portfolio as a result of having exited that business in 2008. 101 Table of Contents Partially offset by: $8.8 million, or 41%, increase in other income, primarily reflecting an $8.2 million increase in mezzanine gains, partially offset by a $6.4 million Visa&reg; related derivative loss. $7.5 million, or 13%, increase in service charges on deposits, primarily reflecting fees resulting from continued strong customer growth. Noninterest Expense (This section should be read in conjunction with Significant Item 1.) Noninterest expense decreased $4.3 million, or 1%, from the year ago quarter. Table 50 Noninterest Expense 2011 Fourth Quarter vs. 2010 Fourth Quarter Fourth Quarter Change 2011 2010 Amount Percent (dollar amounts in thousands) Personnel costs $ 228,101 $ 212,184 $ 15,917 8 % Outside data processing and other services 53,422 40,943 12,479 30 Net occupancy 26,841 26,670 171 1 Equipment 25,884 22,060 3,824 17 Deposit and other insurance expense 18,481 23,320 (4,839 ) (21 ) Marketing 16,379 16,168 211 1 Professional services 16,769 21,021 (4,252 ) (20 ) Amortization of intangibles 13,175 15,046 (1,871 ) (12 ) Automobile operating lease expense 3,362 8,142 (4,780 ) (59 ) OREO and foreclosure expense 5,009 10,502 (5,493 ) (52 ) Gain on early extinguishment of debt (9,697 ) (9,697 ) Other expense 32,548 38,537 (5,989 ) (16 ) Total noninterest expense $ 430,274 $ 434,593 $ (4,319 ) (1 )% Full time equivalent employees, at period end 11,245 11,341 (96 ) (1 )% The $4.3 million decrease reflected: $9.7 million gain on the early extinguishment of debt related to the exchange of certain trust preferred securities. $5.5 million, or 52%, decrease in OREO and foreclosure expense. $4.8 million, or 21%, decrease in deposit and other insurance expense. $4.8 million, or 59%, decline in automobile operating lease expense as the portfolio continued its planned runoff as we exited that business in 2008. Partially offset by: $15.9 million, or 8%, increase in personnel costs, reflecting an increase in salary and benefit related expenses. $12.5 million, or 30%, increase in outside data processing and other services, reflecting costs associated with converting to a new debit card processer and the implementation of strategic initiatives. 102 Table of Contents Income Taxes The provision for income taxes in the 2011 fourth quarter was $42.0 million and $35.0 million in the 2010 fourth quarter. The effective tax rate in the 2011 fourth quarter was 24.9% compared to 22.2% in the 2010 fourth quarter. At December 31, 2011 and 2010 we had a deferred tax asset of $364.8 million and $538.3 million, respectively. Based on both positive and negative evidence and our level of forecasted future taxable income, there was no impairment of the deferred tax asset at December 31, 2011 and 2010. The total disallowed deferred tax asset for regulatory capital purposes decreased to $39.1 million at December 31, 2011 from $161.3 million at December 31, 2010. Credit Quality Credit quality performance in the 2011 fourth quarter reflected continued improvement in the overall loan portfolio relating to NCO activity, as well as in key credit quality metrics, including a 30% decline in NPAs and a 30% decline in the level of Criticized commercial loans compared to the year ago quarter. NCOs Total NCOs for the 2011 fourth quarter were $83.9 million, or an annualized 0.85% of average total loans and leases. NCOs in the year ago quarter were $172.3 million, or an annualized 1.82%. Total C&I NCOs for the 2011 fourth quarter were $10.9 million, or an annualized 0.31%, down from $59.1 million, or an annualized 1.85% of related loans, in the year ago quarter. Total CRE NCOs for the 2011 fourth quarter were $28.4 million, or an annualized 1.91%, down from $44.9 million, or an annualized 2.64% in the year ago quarter. These declines reflected improvement in the overall credit quality of the portfolio. Total consumer NCOs in the current quarter were $44.6 million, or an annualized 0.92%, down from $68.3 million, or an annualized 1.50% of average total consumer loans in the year ago quarter. Residential mortgage NCOs were $9.7 million, or an annualized 0.77% of related average balances, an decrease when compared with $26.8 million, or an annualized 2.42% in the year ago quarter and were consistent with our expectations for a continued downward trend. Home equity NCOs in the 2011 fourth quarter were $23.4 million, or an annualized 1.15%. This represented a decline from $29.2 million, or an annualized 1.51%, in the year ago quarter and was consistent with our expectations for continued improvement. Automobile loan and lease NCOs were $4.2 million, or an annualized 0.30%, down from $7.0 million, or an annualized 0.51%, in the year ago quarter. The relatively low level of NCOs in the current quarter reflected the continued high credit quality of originations and a strong resale market for used automobiles. NPAs and NALs Total NALs were $541.1 million at December 31, 2011, and represented 1.39% of total loans and leases. This was down $236.9 million, or 30%, from $777.9 million, or 2.04%, of total loans and leases at the end of the year ago period. This decrease primarily reflected a decline in commercial NALs as a result of problem loan resolution activity, including payoff. We continue to focus on early recognition of risks through our on going portfolio management processes. The decline in commercial NALs was partially offset by an increase in consumer NALs. These increases reflected the current weak economic conditions and the continued decline of residential real estate property values. Both home equity and residential mortgage NALs have been written down to net realizable value, less anticipated selling costs, which substantially limits any significant future risk of loss. 103 Table of Contents NPAs, which include NALs, were $590.3 million at December 31, 2011, and represented 1.51% of total loans and leases. This was significantly lower than $844.8 million, or 2.21% of related assets at the end of the year ago period. The $254.5 million decrease in NPAs from the end of the year ago period primarily reflected the $236.9 million decrease in NALs discussed above. The over 90 day delinquent, but still accruing, ratio for total loans not guaranteed by a U.S. government agency, was 0.19% at December 31, 2011, representing a 4 basis point decline compared with December 31, 2010. ACL (This section should be in read in conjunction with Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) At December 31, 2011, the ALLL was $964.8 million, down $284.2 million, or 23%, from $1,249.0 million at December 31, 2010. Expressed as a percent of period end loans and leases, the ALLL ratio at December 31, 2011, was 2.48%, a decline from 3.28% at December 31, 2010. The ALLL as a percent of NALs was 178% at December 31, 2011, an increase from 161% at 2010. At December 31, 2011, the AULC was $48.5 million, an increase of $6.3 million, or 15%, compared with December 31, 2010. This increase primarily reflected the downgrade of a commercial letter of credit associated with one relationship. On a combined basis, the ACL as a percent of total loans and leases at December 31, 2011, was 2.60%, down from 3.39% at December 31, 2010. This decline was primarily a result of the improvement in the underlying quality of the portfolio. While the total ACL balance declined, and the resulting ACL to loan coverage ratio declined, the ACL as a percent of NALs improved to 187% at December 31, 2011 from 166% at December 31, 2010, indicating additional strength in the ACL level relative to the level of problem loans. 104 Table of Contents Table 51 Selected Quarterly Income Statement Data(1) 2011 Fourth Third Second First (dollar amounts in thousands, except per share amounts) Interest income $ 485,216 $ 490,996 $ 492,137 $ 501,877 Interest expense 70,191 84,518 88,800 97,547 Net interest income 415,025 406,478 403,337 404,330 Provision for credit losses 45,291 43,586 35,797 49,385 Net interest income after provision for credit losses 369,734 362,892 367,540 354,945 Total noninterest income 229,352 258,559 255,767 236,945 Total noninterest expense 430,274 439,118 428,409 430,699 Income before income taxes 168,812 182,333 194,898 161,191 Provision for income taxes 41,954 38,942 48,980 34,745 Net income $ 126,858 $ 143,391 $ 145,918 $ 126,446 Dividends on preferred shares 7,703 7,703 7,704 7,703 Net income applicable to common shares $ 119,155 $ 135,688 $ 138,214 $ 118,743 Common shares outstanding Average basic 864,136 863,911 863,358 863,359 Average diluted(2) 868,156 867,633 867,469 867,237 Ending 864,406 864,075 863,323 863,399 Book value per common share $ 5.82 $ 5.83 $ 5.66 $ 5.42 Tangible book value per common share(3) 5.18 5.17 5.00 4.74 Per common share Net income basic $ 0.14 $ 0.16 $ 0.16 $ 0.14 Net income diluted 0.14 0.16 0.16 0.14 Cash dividends declared 0.04 0.04 0.01 0.01 Common stock price, per share High(4) $ 5.65 $ 6.74 $ 6.92 $ 7.70 Low(4) 4.67 4.46 6.00 6.38 Close 5.49 4.80 6.56 6.64 Average closing price 5.18 5.37 6.51 6.98 Return on average total assets 0.92 % 1.05 % 1.11 % 0.96 % Return on average common shareholders equity 9.3 10.8 11.6 10.3 Return on average tangible common shareholders equity(5) 11.2 13.0 13.3 12.7 Efficiency ratio(6) 64.0 63.5 62.7 64.7 Effective tax rate 24.9 21.4 25.1 21.6 Margin analysis as a % of average earning assets(7) Interest income(7) 3.96 % 4.02 % 4.14 % 4.24 % Interest expense 0.58 0.69 0.74 0.82 Net interest margin(7) 3.38 % 3.34 % 3.40 % 3.42 % Revenue FTE Net interest income $ 415,025 $ 406,478 $ 403,337 $ 404,330 FTE adjustment 3,479 3,658 3,834 3,945 Net interest income(7) 418,504 410,136 407,171 408,275 Noninterest income 229,352 258,559 255,767 236,945 Total revenue(7) $ 647,856 $ 668,695 $ 662,938 $ 645,220 Continued 105 Table of Contents Table 51 Selected Quarterly Income Statement, Capital, and Other Data Continued(1) 2011 Capital adequacy December 31, September 30, June 30, March 31, Total risk weighted assets (in millions) $ 45,891 $ 44,376 $ 44,080 $ 43,024 Tier 1 leverage ratio 10.28 % 10.24 % 10.25 % 9.80 % Tier 1 risk based capital ratio 12.11 12.37 12.14 12.04 Total risk based capital ratio 14.77 15.11 14.89 14.85 Tier 1 common risk based capital ratio 10.00 10.17 9.92 9.75 Tangible common equity / tangible asset ratio(8) 8.30 8.22 8.22 7.81 Tangible equity / tangible asset ratio(9) 9.02 8.88 8.91 8.51 Tangible common equity / risk weighted assets ratio 9.75 10.08 9.79 9.51 106 Table of Contents Table 52 Selected Quarterly Income Statement Data(1) 2010 Fourth Third Second First (dollar amounts in thousands, except per share amounts) Interest income $ 528,291 $ 534,669 $ 535,653 $ 546,779 Interest expense 112,997 124,707 135,997 152,886 Net interest income 415,294 409,962 399,656 393,893 Provision for credit losses 86,973 119,160 193,406 235,008 Net interest income after provision for credit losses 328,321 290,802 206,250 158,885 Total noninterest income 264,220 267,143 269,643 240,852 Total noninterest expense 434,593 427,309 413,810 398,093 Income before income taxes 157,948 130,636 62,083 1,644 Provision (benefit) for income taxes 35,048 29,690 13,319 (38,093 ) Net income $ 122,900 $ 100,946 $ 48,764 $ 39,737 Dividends on preferred shares 83,754 29,495 29,426 29,357 Net income applicable to common shares $ 39,146 $ 71,451 $ 19,338 $ 10,380 Common shares outstanding Average basic 757,924 716,911 716,580 716,320 Average diluted(2) 760,582 719,567 719,387 718,593 Ending 863,319 717,132 716,623 716,557 Book value per share $ 5.35 $ 5.39 $ 5.22 $ 5.13 Tangible book value per share(3) 4.66 4.55 4.37 4.26 Per common share Net income basic $ 0.05 $ 0.10 $ 0.03 $ 0.01 Net income diluted 0.05 0.10 0.03 0.01 Cash dividends declared 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 Common stock price, per share High(4) $ 7.00 $ 6.45 $ 7.40 $ 5.81 Low(4) 5.43 5.04 5.26 3.65 Close 6.87 5.69 5.54 5.39 Average closing price 6.05 5.79 6.13 4.84 Return on average total assets 0.90 % 0.76 % 0.38 % 0.31 % Return on average common shareholders equity 3.8 7.4 2.1 1.1 Return on average tangible common shareholders equity(5) 5.6 10.0 3.8 2.7 Efficiency ratio(6) 61.4 60.6 59.4 60.1 Effective tax rate (benefit) 22.2 22.7 21.5 N.R.

Other intangible assets are net of deferred tax, and calculated assuming a 35% tax rate. ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES Forward Looking Statements This report, including MD&A, contains certain forward looking statements, including certain plans, expectations, goals, projections, and statements, which are subject to numerous assumptions, risks, and uncertainties. Statements that do not describe historical or current facts, including statements about beliefs and expectations, are forward looking statements. The forward looking statements are intended to be subject to the safe harbor provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. While there is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, below are certain factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained or implied in the forward looking statements: (1) worsening of credit quality performance due to a number of factors such as the underlying value of the collateral could prove less valuable than otherwise assumed and assumed cash flows may be worse than expected; (2) changes in economic conditions; (3) movements in interest rates; (4) competitive pressures on product pricing and services; (5) success, impact, and timing of our business strategies, including 108 Table of Contents market acceptance of any new products or services introduced to implement our Fair Play banking philosophy; (6) changes in accounting policies and principles and the accuracy of our assumptions and estimates used to prepare our financial statements; (7) extended disruption of vital infrastructure; (8) the final outcome of significant litigation; (9) the nature, extent, and timing of governmental actions and reforms, including the Dodd Frank Act, as well as future regulations which will be adopted by the relevant regulatory agencies, including the CFPB, to implement the Dodd Frank Acts provisions; and (10) the outcome of judicial and regulatory decisions regarding practices in the residential mortgage industry, including among other things the processes followed for foreclosing residential mortgages. All forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and are based on information available at that time. We assume no obligation to update forward looking statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the forward looking statements were made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events except as required by federal securities laws. As forward looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, caution should be exercised against placing undue reliance on such statements. Non Regulatory Capital Ratios In addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators, the Company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including: Tangible common equity to tangible assets, Tier 1 common equity to risk weighted assets using Basel I definition, and Tangible common equity to risk weighted assets using Basel I definition. These non regulatory capital ratios are viewed by management as useful additional methods of reflecting the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions. Additionally, presentation of these ratios allows readers to compare the Companys capitalization to other financial services companies. These ratios differ from capital ratios defined by banking regulators principally in that the numerator excludes preferred securities, the nature and extent of which varies among different financial services companies. These ratios are not defined in Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) or federal banking regulations. As a result, these non regulatory capital ratios disclosed by the Company may be considered non GAAP financial measures. Because there are no standardized definitions for these non regulatory capital ratios, the Companys calculation methods may differ from those used by other financial services companies. Also, there may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors. As a result, the Company encourages readers to consider the consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in this Form 10 K in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure. Pretax, Pre provision Income Pretax, pre provision income is a non GAAP financial measure. Any ratio utilizing this financial measure is also non GAAP. This financial measure has been included as it is considered to be an important metric with which to analyze and evaluate our results of operations and financial strength. Other companies may calculate this financial measure differently. Going forward we do not intend to report a PTPP metric with our credit costs now returning to more normal levels. Risk Factors More information on risk is set forth under the heading Risk Factors included in Item 1A and incorporated by reference into this MD&A. Additional information regarding risk factors can also be found in the Risk Management and Capital discussion, as well as the Regulatory Matters section included in Item 1 and incorporated by reference into the MD&A. 109 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Significant Estimates Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated by reference into this MD&A, describes the significant accounting policies we use in our Consolidated Financial Statements. An accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimates are made under facts and circumstances at a point in time, and changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates. The most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed below. Total Allowance for Credit Losses Our ACL of $1.0 billion at December 31, 2011, represents our estimate of probable credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio and our unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. We regularly review our ACL for appropriateness by performing on going evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio. In doing so, we consider factors such as the differing economic risk associated with each loan category, the financial condition of specific borrowers, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or other documented support. We also evaluate the impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet their financial obligations when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the appropriateness of our ACL at each reporting date. There is no certainty that our ACL will be appropriate over time to cover losses in the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy, market conditions, or events adversely affecting specific customers, industries, or markets. If the credit quality of our customer base materially deteriorates, the risk profile of a market, industry, or group of customers changes materially, or if the ACL is not appropriate, our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected which, in turn, could have a material negative adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, bank regulators periodically review our ACL and may require us to increase our provision for loan and lease losses or loan charge offs. Any increase in our ACL or loan charge offs as required by these regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Fair Value Measurements (This section should be read in conjunction with Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) Huntington follows the fair value accounting guidance under ASC 820 and ASC 825. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. A three level valuation hierarchy was established for disclosure of fair value measurements. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows: Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. 110 Table of Contents Assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility. Assets measured at fair value include mortgage loans held for sale, available for sale and other certain securities, certain securitized automobile loans, derivatives, certain MSRs, trading account securities, and certain securitization trust notes payable. At December 31, 2011, approximately $8.9 billion of our assets and $0.4 billion of our liabilities were recorded at fair value. In addition to the above mentioned on going fair value measurements, fair value is also the unit of measure for recording business combinations. At the end of each quarter, we assess the valuation hierarchy for each asset or liability measured. As necessary, assets or liabilities may be transferred within hierarchy levels due to changes in availability of observable market inputs to measure fair value at the measurement date. The fair values measured at each level of the fair value hierarchy, as well as additional discussion regarding fair value measurements, can be found in Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. INVESTMENT SECURITIES (This section should be read in conjunction with the Investment Securities Portfolio discussion and Note 1 and Note 4 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) Level 3 Analysis on Certain Securities Portfolios Our Alt A, private label CMO, and pooled trust preferred securities portfolios are classified as Level 3, and as such, the significant estimates used to determine the fair value of these securities have greater subjectivity. The Alt A and private label CMO securities portfolios are subjected to a monthly review of the projected cash flows, while the cash flows of our pooled trust preferred securities portfolio are reviewed quarterly. These reviews are supported with analysis from independent third parties, and are used as a basis for impairment analysis. These three portfolios, and the results of our impairment analysis for each portfolio, are discussed in further detail below: Alt A mortgage backed / Private label collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO) securities are collateralized by first lien residential mortgage loans. The securities are valued by a third party specialist using a discounted cash flow approach and proprietary pricing model. The model uses inputs such as estimated prepayment speeds, losses, recoveries, default rates that are implied by the underlying performance of collateral in the structure or similar structures, discount rates that are implied by market prices for similar securities, collateral structure types, and house price depreciation / appreciation rates that are based upon macroeconomic forecasts. Pooled trust preferred securities are CDOs backed by a pool of debt securities issued by financial institutions. The collateral generally consists of trust preferred securities and subordinated debt securities issued by banks, bank holding companies, and insurance companies. A full cash flow analysis is used to estimate fair values and assess impairment for each security within this portfolio. We engaged a third party specialist with direct industry experience in pooled trust preferred securities valuations to provide assistance in estimating the fair value and expected cash flows for each security in this portfolio. Relying on cash flows is necessary because there was a lack of observable transactions in the market and many of the original sponsors or dealers for these securities are no longer able to provide a fair value that is compliant with ASC 820. 111 Table of Contents Certain other assets and liabilities which are not financial instruments also involve fair value measurements. A description of these assets and liabilities, and the methodologies utilized to determine fair value are discussed below: GOODWILL Goodwill is an intangible asset representing the difference between the purchase price of an asset and its fair market value and is created when a company pays a premium to acquire the assets of another company. We test goodwill for impairment annually, as of October 1, using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of a reporting unit. Goodwill impairment exists when a reporting units carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. Goodwill is also tested for impairment on an interim basis, using the same two step process as the annual testing, if an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. The first step (Step 1) of impairment testing requires comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with goodwill to its carrying value to identify potential impairment. For our annual impairment testing conducted during 2011, we identified four reporting units with goodwill: Retail and Business Banking, Regional and Commercial Banking, Wealth Advisors, Government Finance, and Home Lending (WGH), and Insurance. Auto Finance and Commercial Real Estate was not subject to impairment testing as it had no goodwill associated with the unit. In addition, although Insurance is included within Treasury/Other for business segment reporting, it was evaluated as a separate reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing because it had its own separately allocated goodwill resulting from prior acquisitions. For all four reporting units identified in the above paragraph, we utilized both income and market approaches to determine the fair value for each reporting unit. The income approach was based on discounted cash flows derived from assumptions of balance sheet and income statement activity. An internal forecast was developed by considering several long term key business drivers such as anticipated loan and deposit growth, net interest margins, and efficiency ratios. Long term growth rates were estimated to assist in determining the terminal values. The discount rates were estimated based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which considered the risk free interest rate (20 year Treasury Bonds), market risk premium, equity risk premium, and a company specific risk factor. The company specific risk factor was used to address the uncertainty of growth estimates and earnings projections of Management. For the market approach, revenue, earnings and market capitalization multiples of comparable public companies were selected and applied to each reporting units applicable metrics such as book and tangible book values. The results of the income and market approaches are combined to arrive at the final calculation of fair value. The aggregate fair market value of the reporting units compared with market capitalization indicated an implied premium of 29% at September 30, 2011. A control premium analysis indicated that the implied premium was within range of overall premiums observed in the market place. All four of the reporting units tested passed Step 1. The second step (Step 2) of impairment testing is necessary only if the reporting unit does not pass Step 1. Step 2 compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill for the reporting unit. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as goodwill that is recognized in a business combination. Significant judgment and estimates are involved in estimating the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. As none of the reporting units failed step 1, step 2 was not applicable during 2011 testing. Significant judgment is applied when goodwill is assessed for impairment. This judgment includes developing cash flow projections, selecting appropriate discount rates, identifying relevant market comparables, incorporating general economic and market conditions, and selecting an appropriate control premium. The selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a higher or lower fair value. Judgment is applied in determining the weightings that are most representative of fair value. 112 Table of Contents Due to the current economic environment and other uncertainties, it is possible that our estimates and assumptions may adversely change in the future. If our market capitalization decreases, we may be required to record goodwill impairment losses in future periods, whether in connection with our next annual impairment testing or prior to that time, if any changes constitute a triggering event. The 2010 and 2009 interim and annual assessments discussed below were performed in a manner consistent with the 2011 process described above. The assessments were based on our reporting units at that time. 2010 Annual Impairment Testing and Interim Evaluations In 2010, we performed an annual assessment at October 1 and interim evaluations of our goodwill balances at March 31 and June 30. No impairment was recorded in 2010. 2009 Other Interim and Annual Impairment Testing During the 2009 first quarter, our stock price declined 78%, from $7.66 per common share at December 31, 2008, to $1.66 per common share at March 31, 2009. Many peer banks also experienced similar significant declines in market capitalization during this same period. This decline primarily reflected the continuing economic slowdown and increased market concern surrounding financial institutions credit risks and capital positions, as well as uncertainty related to increased regulatory supervision and intervention. We determined that these changes would more likely than not reduce the fair value of certain reporting units below their carrying amounts. Therefore, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test during the 2009 first quarter. Our 2009 first quarter interim testing determined that the Regional Banking and Insurance reporting units goodwill carrying values exceeded their implied fair values of goodwill by $2,573.8 million and $28.9 million, respectively. As a result, we recorded a noncash pretax impairment charge of $2,602.7 million in the 2009 first quarter. In addition, we recorded an impairment charge of $4.2 million in the 2009 second quarter related to the sale of a small payments related business completed in July 2009. No other goodwill impairment was required during the remainder of 2009. PENSION Pension plan assets consist of mutual funds and our common stock. Investments are accounted for at cost on the trade date and are reported at fair value. Mutual funds are valued at quoted Net Asset Value. Our common stock is traded on a national securities exchange and is valued at the last reported sales price. The discount rate and expected return on plan assets used to determine the benefit obligation and pension expense are both assumptions. Actual results may be materially different. (See Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). OTHER REAL ESTATE OWNED OREO property obtained in satisfaction of a loan is recorded at its estimated fair value less anticipated selling costs based upon the propertys appraised value at the date of transfer, with any difference between the fair value of the property and the carrying value of the loan charged to the ALLL. Subsequent declines in value are reported as adjustments to the carrying amount and are charged to noninterest expense. Gains or losses resulting from the sale of OREO are recognized in noninterest expense on the date of sale. At December 31, 2011, OREO totaled $38.4 million, representing a 42% decrease compared with $66.8 million at December 31, 2010. 113 Table of Contents Income Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets INCOME TAXES The calculation of our provision for income taxes is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments. We have two accruals for income taxes: (1) our income tax payable represents the estimated net amount currently due to the federal, state, and local taxing jurisdictions, net of any reserve for potential audit issues, and is reported as a component of accrued income and other assets in our consolidated balance sheet; (2) our deferred federal income tax asset, reported as a component of accrued income and other assets, represents the estimated impact of temporary differences between how we recognize our assets and liabilities under GAAP, and how such assets and liabilities are recognized under the federal tax code. In the ordinary course of business, we operate in various taxing jurisdictions and are subject to income and non income taxes. The effective tax rate is based in part on our interpretation of the relevant current tax laws. We believe the aggregate liabilities related to taxes are appropriately reflected in the consolidated financial statements. We review the appropriate tax treatment of all transactions taking into consideration statutory, judicial, and regulatory guidance in the context of our tax positions. In addition, we rely on various tax opinions, recent tax audits, and historical experience. From time to time, we engage in business transactions that may affect our tax liabilities. Where appropriate, we have obtained opinions of outside experts and have assessed the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of business transactions taking into account statutory, judicial, and regulatory guidance in the context of the tax position. However, changes to our estimates of accrued taxes can occur due to changes in tax rates, implementation of new business strategies, resolution of issues with taxing authorities regarding previously taken tax positions, and newly enacted statutory, judicial, and regulatory guidance. Such changes could affect the amount of our accrued taxes and could be material to our financial position and / or results of operations. (See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) DEFERRED TAX ASSETS At December 31, 2011, we had a net federal deferred tax asset of $365.0 million and a net state deferred tax liability of $0.2 million. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. All available evidence, both positive and negative, was considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, impairment should be recognized. Our forecast process includes judgmental and quantitative elements that may be subject to significant change. If our forecast of taxable income within the carryforward periods available under applicable law is not sufficient to cover the amount of net deferred tax assets, such assets may be impaired. Based on our analysis of both positive and negative evidence and our ability to offset the net deferred tax assets against our forecasted future taxable income, there was no impairment of the deferred tax assets at December 31, 2011. Recent Accounting Pronouncements and Developments Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements discusses new accounting pronouncements adopted during 2011 and the expected impact of accounting pronouncements recently issued but not yet required to be adopted. To the extent the adoption of new accounting standards materially affect financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity, the impacts are discussed in the applicable section of this MD&A and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Acquisitions Sky Financial The merger with Sky Financial was completed on July 1, 2007. At the time of acquisition, Sky Financial had assets of $16.8 billion, including $13.3 billion of loans, and total deposits of $12.9 billion. The impact of this acquisition was included in our consolidated results for the last six months of 2007. 114 Table of Contents Franklin Related Impacts NCOs The following table reflects the Franklin related impact to NCOs for 2010 and 2011.
