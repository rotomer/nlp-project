ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion and analysis reflects Hudson City Bancorps audited consolidated financial statements and other relevant statistical data and is intended to enhance your understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. You should read the information in this section in conjunction with Hudson City Bancorps Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, and the other statistical data provided elsewhere in this document. GENERAL Our results of operations depend primarily on net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets, primarily mortgage loans, mortgage backed securities and investment securities, and the interest we pay on our interest bearing liabilities, primarily time deposits, savings deposits and borrowed funds. Our results of operations are also affected by our provision for loan losses, non interest income, and non interest expense. Non interest expense consists primarily of salaries and employee benefits, occupancy expenses and other general and administrative expenses. Non interest income consists mainly of service charges and fees. Our results of operations may also be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions, particularly those with respect to changes in market interest rates, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. Future changes in applicable law, regulations or government policies may materially impact us. Additionally, our lending activity is concentrated in loans secured by real estate primarily located in New Jersey. Accordingly, our results of operations may be affected by regional market and economic conditions. MUTUAL HOLDING COMPANY REORGANIZATION On July 13, 1999, Hudson City Savings converted and reorganized from a New Jersey chartered mutual savings bank into a two tiered mutual savings bank holding company structure and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Hudson City Bancorp. Hudson City Bancorp sold 54,350,000 shares of its common stock to the public, representing 47% of the then outstanding shares, at $10.00 per share and received net proceeds of $527.6 million. Hudson City Bancorp contributed 50% of the net proceeds from the initial public offering to Hudson City Savings. An additional 61,288,300 shares, or 53% of the then outstanding shares of Hudson City Bancorp, were issued to Hudson City, MHC. At December 31, 2001, as a result of stock repurchases, Hudson City, MHC owned 61.8% of Hudson City Bancorp. GROWTH INITIATIVES In accordance with our business plan, we have developed and employed several initiatives to effectively and prudently utilize our capital through internally generated growth. During 2001, these initiatives, in conjunction with the lower interest rate environment, allowed us to increase our long term borrowings and grow our assets by 21.9%, or over $2.0 billion. We expect to continue to grow through expansion using borrowed funds to supplement deposits as a funding source. We may also grow by adding new branch offices, a strategy that has been successful for us in the past. Page 48 MANAGEMENT OF INTEREST RATE RISK As a financial institution, our primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility. Fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact our level of both income and expense recorded on a large portion of our assets and liabilities. Fluctuations in interest rates will also affect the market value of all interest earning assets, other than those that possess a short term to maturity. During 2001, the Federal Open Market Committee reduced the federal funds rate on eleven successive occasions by a total of 475 basis points. These reductions, along with the economic recession experienced during 2001, have created a significantly different interest rate environment than that which existed at December 31, 2000. General market interest rates, particularly on short term maturities, decreased during 2001 as the overall yield curve steepened. A decreasing rate environment can be beneficial to our net interest income as our interest bearing liabilities generally reprice faster than our interest earning assets. A steepening yield curve is where the spread between long term interest rates and short term interest rates widens. A steep yield curve can also be beneficial to our net interest income as our interest bearing liabilities generally price off short term market rates while our mortgage loan products, particularly those with initial terms to maturity or repricing greater than one year, generally price off long term market rates. In the interest rate environment experienced in 2001, our net interest rate spread increased 21 basis points to 2.12% from 1.91% for 2000. Due to the nature of our operations, we are not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk. Instead, our real estate loan portfolio, primarily concentrated in New Jersey, is subject to risks associated with the local economy. We do not own any trading assets. We did not engage in any hedging transactions that use derivative instruments (such as interest rate swaps and caps) during 2001 and did not have any such hedging transactions in place at December 31, 2001. In the future, we may, with approval of our Board of Directors, engage in hedging transactions utilizing derivative instruments. The primary objectives of our interest rate risk management strategy are to: evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in certain balance sheet accounts; determine the appropriate level of interest rate risk given our business plan, the current business environment and our capital and liquidity requirements; and manage interest rate risk in a manner consistent with the approved guidelines and policies set by our Board of Directors. We seek to coordinate asset and liability decisions so that, under changing interest rate scenarios, earnings will remain within an acceptable range. To achieve the objectives of managing interest rate risk, our Asset/Liability Committee meets weekly to discuss and monitor the market interest rate environment compared to interest rates that are offered on our products. This committee consists of the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Operating Officer and the Investment Officer. The Asset/Liability Committee presents periodic reports to the Board of Directors at its regular meetings, as well as a comprehensive quarterly report to the Asset Management Committee of the Board of Directors. The quarterly reports address the results of activities and strategies and the effect that changes in interest rates will have on our results of operations and the present value of our equity. Page 49 Historically, our lending activities have emphasized one to four family first and second mortgage loans. We believe that the frequent repricing of our adjustable rate mortgage loans and adjustable rate securities, which reduces the exposure to interest rate fluctuations, will benefit our long term profitability. However, the prevailing interest rate environment in recent years has resulted in the increased demand for fixed rate first mortgage loans. The result has been an increase in the proportion of fixed rate loans in our portfolio. This may have an adverse impact on our net interest income, particularly in a rising interest rate environment. In addition, the actual amount of time before mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities are repaid can be significantly impacted by changes in mortgage prepayment rates and market interest rates. Mortgage prepayment rates will vary due to a number of factors, including the regional economy in the area where the underlying mortgages were originated, seasonal factors, demographic variables and the assumability of the underlying mortgages. However, the major factors affecting prepayment rates are prevailing interest rates, related mortgage refinancing opportunities and competition. We monitor interest rate sensitivity so that we can make adjustments to our asset and liability mix on a timely basis. Our primary source of funds has been deposits, consisting primarily of time deposits, which have substantially shorter terms to maturity than the loan portfolio. We use securities sold under agreements to repurchase and FHLB advances as additional sources of funds. These borrowings are generally long term, in an effort to off set our short term deposit liabilities and assist in managing our interest rate risk. Certain of these borrowings have call options which could shorten their maturities in a rising interest rate environment. Gap Analysis. The matching of the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are "interest rate sensitive" and by monitoring a financial institutions interest rate sensitivity "gap." An asset or liability is said to be "interest rate sensitive" within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period. The interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period exceeds the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that specific time period. A gap is considered negative when the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a specific time period exceeds the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within the same period. During a period of rising interest rates, a financial institution with a negative gap position would be expected, absent the effects of other factors, to experience a greater increase in the costs of its liabilities relative to the yields of its assets and thus a decrease in the institutions net interest income. An institution with a positive gap position would be expected, absent the effect of other factors, to experience the opposite result. Conversely, during a period of falling interest rates, a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to reduce net interest income. At December 31, 2001, based on the assumptions below, our interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year exceeded our interest earning assets maturing or repricing within the same period by $1.63 billion compared with $1.97 billion at December 31, 2000. This represented a cumulative one year interest rate sensitivity gap as a percent of total assets of negative 14.3% at December 31, 2001 compared with negative 21.0% at December 31, 2000. The ratio of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year to interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year was 71.9% at December 31, 2001 compared with 64.0% at December 31, 2000. The change in these ratios, year to year, is primarily due to accelerated prepayment assumptions for mortgage loans and mortgage backed Page 50 securities used during the current lower interest rate environment, maturing borrowed funds being funded with long term borrowings and the overall growth in our assets during 2001. Our negative gap position would be expected to more adversely impact our net interest income in a rising interest rate environment than if we had a positive gap position. The following table presents the amounts of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at December 31, 2001, which we anticipate to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown. Except as stated below, we determined the amounts of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period in accordance with the earlier of the term to repricing or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability. The information presented in the following table is also based on the following assumptions: we assumed an annual prepayment rate of 20.0% for mortgage loans repricing or maturing after one year; we assumed an annual prepayment rate of 25.0% for mortgage backed securities repricing or maturing after one year; we reported federal agency securities with call options at the earlier of the next call date or contractual maturity date, total agency securities reported as called were $25.0 million based on our assessment of market conditions at December 31, 2001; we reported savings and interest bearing demand accounts that had no stated maturity using decay rates of: 2.5% in less than six months, 2.5% in six months to one year, 25% in one year to two years, 30% in two years to three years, 20% in three years to five years, and 20% in over five years; we reported money market accounts using decay rates of: 25% in less than six months, 25% in six months to one year, 25% in one year to two years, and 25% in two years to three years; and we reported borrowed funds with call options at the earlier of the next call date or contractual maturity date, there were no borrowed funds reported as called based on our assessment of market conditions at December 31, 2001. In 2000, prepayment assumptions on mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities were 12.0% and 16.0%, respectively. The change in the prepayment assumptions for 2001 was due to the increase in prepayments experienced during the year on these investments resulting from the lower interest rate environment. If current mortgage loan and mortgage backed security prepayment assumptions were used at December 31, 2000, and all other assumptions remained the same for that analysis, the cumulative interest sensitivity gap as a percentage of total assets would have been approximately negative 16.4%. Deposit decay rates, as noted above, are based on regulatory guidance, as modified by our historical experience. Deposit decay rates, prepayment rates and anticipated call dates can have a significant impact on the estimated interest sensitivity gap. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, they may not be indicative of actual future deposit decay activity, mortgage and mortgage backed securities prepayments, and the actual timing of calls of federal agency bonds or borrowed funds. We have excluded non accrual loans totaling $8,262,000 from the table.

For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Certain assets, such as adjustable rate loans, have features which limit changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the loan. If interest rates change, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table. Finally, the ability of borrowers to make payments on their adjustable rate loans may decrease if interest rates increase. Present Value of Equity. In addition to the gap analysis table, we also use a simulation model to monitor interest rate risk. This model reports the present value of equity in different interest rate environments, assuming an instantaneous and permanent interest rate shock to all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities. The present value of equity is the difference between the present value of expected cash flows of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities. The changes in market value of assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates reflect the interest sensitivity of those assets and liabilities as their values are derived from the characteristics of the asset or liability (i.e., fixed rate, adjustable rate, caps, floors) relative to the current interest rate environment. For example, in a rising interest rate environment the fair market value of a fixed rate asset will decline, whereas the fair market value of an adjustable rate asset, depending on its repricing characteristics, may not decline. Increases in the market value of assets will increase the present value of equity whereas decreases in market value of assets will decrease the present value of equity. Conversely, increases in the market value of liabilities will decrease the present value of equity whereas decreases in the market value of liabilities will increase the present value of equity. Our policy sets a maximum percentage change in the present value of equity of 40% from the current present value of equity, given an instantaneous and parallel increase or decrease of 200 basis points. The following table presents the estimated present value of equity over a range of interest rate change scenarios at December 31, 2001. The present value ratio shown in the table is the present value of equity as a percent of the present value of total assets in each of the different rate environments. For purposes of this table, we have made assumptions such as prepayment rates and decay rates similar to those used for the gap analysis table. PRESENT VALUE OF EQUITY AS PERCENT OF PRESENT PRESENT VALUE OF EQUITY VALUE OF ASSETS CHANGE IN DOLLAR DOLLAR PERCENT PRESENT VALUE PERCENT INTEREST RATES AMOUNT CHANGE CHANGE RATIO CHANGE (BASIS POINTS) (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) 200 $ 992,487 $ (550,397) (35.67)% 9.28% (30.64)% 150 1,135,012 (407,872) (26.44) 10.41 (22.20) 100 1,273,871 (269,013) (17.44) 11.47 (14.28) 50 1,410,817 (132,067) (8.56) 12.47 (6.80) 0 1,542,884 13.38 (50) 1,609,056 66,172 4.29 13.76 2.84 (100) 1,591,664 48,780 3.16 13.51 0.97 (150) 1,536,568 (6,316) (0.41) 12.99 (2.91) (200) 1,454,977 (87,907) (5.70) 12.26 (8.37) Page 53 At December 31, 2000, the percent change in the present value of equity in the 200 basis point increase scenario was negative 23.8% compared with negative 35.7% at December 31, 2001. This increase at December 31, 2001, and the overall decrease in the present value of equity in the increasing interest rate scenarios, was primarily due to the growth in our fixed rate mortgage loans and fixed rate mortgage backed securities during 2001. The decrease in the present value of equity in certain decreasing rate scenarios was primarily due to the growth of borrowed funds with longer maturities during 2001. As in the case of the gap analysis table, the methods we used in the previous table have some shortcomings. This type of modeling requires that we make assumptions which may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. For example, we assume the composition of the interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will remain constant over the period being measured and that all interest rate shocks will be uniformly reflected across the yield curve, regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing. The table assumes that we will take no action in response to the changes in interest rates. In addition, prepayment estimates and other assumptions within the model are subjective in nature, involve uncertainties, and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Accordingly, although the present value of equity model may provide an estimate of our interest rate risk at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in interest rates on our present value of equity. ANALYSIS OF NET INTEREST INCOME Net interest income represents the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets, such as mortgage loans, mortgage backed securities and investment securities, and the expense we pay on interest bearing liabilities, such as time deposits and borrowed funds. Net interest income depends on our volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates we earned or paid on them. Average Balance Sheet. The following table presents certain information regarding our financial condition and net interest income for 2001, 2000 and 1999. The table presents the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities for the periods indicated. We derived the yields and costs by dividing income or expense by the average balance of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities, respectively, for the periods shown. We derived average balances from daily balances over the periods indicated. Interest income includes fees which we considered adjustments to yields. Yields on tax exempt obligations were not computed on a tax equivalent basis.

The following table presents the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected our interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated. Information is provided in each category with respect to: changes attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate); changes attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume); and the net change. The changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to rate. 2001 COMPARED TO 2000 2000 COMPARED TO 1999 INCREASE (DECREASE) DUE TO INCREASE (DECREASE) DUE TO VOLUME RATE NET VOLUME RATE NET (IN THOUSANDS) INTEREST EARNING ASSETS: First mortgage loans, net ............. $ 55,014 $ (1,337) $ 53,677 $ 48,538 $ 1,529 $ 50,067 Consumer and other loans .............. 1,809 (490) 1,319 2,941 116 3,057 Federal funds sold .................... 3,204 (2,740) 464 1,058 981 2,039 Mortgage backed securities ............ 55,020 (6,541) 48,479 5,027 17,018 22,045 Federal Home Loan Bank stock .......... 3,228 (390) 2,838 1,698 1,698 Investment securities .................

This increase was generally reflected in increases in mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities, partially offset by decreases in investment securities. Loans increased $1.10 billion, or 22.6%, to $5.97 billion at December 31, 2001 from $4.87 billion at December 31, 2000. For the year ended December 31, 2001, we originated and purchased first mortgage loans of approximately $1.52 billion and $857.6 million, respectively, compared with $895.1 million and $110.7 million, respectively, for the corresponding 2000 period. These originations and purchases were concentrated in one to four family residential mortgage loans. The increase in loan originations, a part of our growth strategy, was also due to the lower market interest rate environment during 2001 that caused an increase in prepayments and refinancings. To supplement our loan originations we began, late in 2000, to purchase a higher volume of first mortgage loans than were purchased in previous periods. See "Business of Hudson City Savings Bank Lending Activities Residential Mortgage Lending" for a discussion of loan purchases. We also originated for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, home equity loans of approximately $62.0 million and $71.4 million, respectively. Mortgage backed securities increased $1.75 billion, or 53.6%, to $5.01 billion at December 31, 2001 from $3.26 billion at December 31, 2000. Investment securities available for sale decreased $709.2 million, or 80.9%, to $167.5 million at December 31, 2001 from $876.7 million at December 31, 2000. The increase in mortgage backed securities, a part of our growth strategy, was also due to the reinvestment of $855.7 million of calls of investment securities into adjustable rate or higher yielding fixed rate mortgage backed securities during 2001. The large amount of calls of investment securities was due to the lower interest rate environment that existed during 2001. These increases in interest earning assets continue to reflect our emphasis on the origination and purchase of one to four family mortgage loans supplemented by the purchase of mortgage backed securities as part of our growth strategy. We began classifying certain mortgage backed security purchases as available for sale during 2001 to maintain internal liquidity requirements. Federal funds sold decreased $104.1 million, or 85.5%, to $17.6 million at December 31, 2001 from $121.7 million at December 31, 2000. The higher levels of federal funds sold at December 31, 2000 resulted from calls of investment securities, the proceeds from which had not yet been fully invested at year end. Federal Home Loan Bank of New York ("FHLB") stock increased $7.5 million to $81.1 million at December 31, 2001, which was the amount of stock we were required to hold based on our asset size. At December 31, 2001, total liabilities were $10.14 billion, an increase of 28.0%, or $2.22 billion, compared with $7.92 billion at December 31, 2000. Borrowed funds increased $900.0 million, or 72.0%, to $2.15 billion at December 31, 2001 from $1.25 billion at December 31, 2000. Borrowed funds at December 31, 2001 were comprised of $1.55 billion of securities sold under agreements to repurchase and $600.0 million of FHLB advances. Advances from the FHLB utilize our mortgage portfolio as collateral. The increase in borrowed funds was primarily used to fund asset growth consistent with our capital management strategy. Funding asset growth with borrowed funds generated additional earnings through a positive interest rate spread. Total deposits increased $1.31 billion, or 19.8%, to $7.91 billion at December 31, 2001 from $6.60 billion at December 31, 2000. Interest bearing deposits increased $1.27 billion, or 20.3%, to $7.54 billion at December 31, 2001 from $6.27 billion at December 31, 2000. The increase in interest bearing Page 57 deposits was primarily due to a $1.13 billion, or 22.7%, increase in time deposits to $6.10 billion at December 31, 2001 from $4.97 billion at December 31, 2000. Noninterest bearing deposits increased $43.5 million, or 13.1%, to $375.7 million at December 31, 2001 from $332.2 million at December 31, 2000. The increase in total deposits was primarily used to fund asset growth consistent with our capital management strategy. We believe the increase in interest bearing deposits was due in part to the volatility in the equity markets, our offering competitive rates on our time deposit products, and deposit movement among financial institutions due to consolidation within our industry. Accrued expenses and other liabilities increased $13.6 million, or 22.0%, to $75.3 million at December 31, 2001 from $61.7 million at December 31, 2000. This increase was primarily due to an increase in accrued interest payable because of the growth of our borrowed funds and an increase in accrued expenses related to certain employee benefit plans, primarily post retirement benefits. Total stockholders equity decreased $175.8 million, or 12.0%, to $1.29 billion at December 31, 2001 from $1.46 billion at December 31, 2000. Hudson City repurchased 12,983,400 shares of our common stock during 2001, which decreased stockholders equity by $278.5 million. As of December 31, 2001, there were 4,781,634 shares authorized to be purchased under our current stock repurchase program. Offsetting the effect of repurchases on stockholders equity was net income of $134.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, of $7.9 million. This increase was due to increases in the market values of our investment securities available for sale due to the lower interest rate environment. Stockholders equity was also decreased during 2001 by the declarations of cash dividends to common stockholders totaling $46.5 million and the purchase of 187,418 shares of common stock for the recognition and retention plans at an aggregate cost of $4.2 million. The exercise of 142,800 options during 2001 increased stockholders equity by $2.0 million. At December 31, 2001, the ratio of total stockholders equity to total assets was 11.28% compared with 15.61% at December 31, 2000. For the year ended December 31, 2001, the ratio of average stockholders equity to average assets was 13.05% compared with 16.35% for the year ended December 31, 2000. Stockholders equity per common share was $13.74 at December 31, 2001 compared with $13.78 at December 31, 2000. The decrease in these ratios is primarily due to the decrease in stockholders equity and the growth in assets as discussed above. COMPARISON OF OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND 2000 General. Net income was $134.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of $19.7 million, or 17.2%, from net income of $114.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Basic and diluted earnings per common share were $1.37 and $1.35, respectively, for 2001 compared with basic and diluted earnings per common share of $1.05 and $1.04, respectively, for 2000. Our return on average stockholders equity and return on average assets for 2001 was 10.09% and 1.32%, respectively, compared with 7.87% and 1.29%, respectively, for 2000. The increase in the return on average stockholders equity reflected the growth in net income and the decrease in stockholders equity. Interest and Dividend Income. Total interest and dividend income increased $76.5 million, or 12.5%, to $690.5 million for year ended December 31, 2001 compared with $614.0 million for the corresponding 2000 period. The increase in total interest and dividend income was primarily due to the average balance of total interest earning assets increasing $1.25 billion, or 14.3%, to $10.02 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared with $8.77 billion for the year ended December 31, 2000. The average balance of first mortgage loans, net increased $748.5 million, or 16.8%, to $5.20 billion for 2001 compared with $4.46 billion for 2000. The average balance of consumer and other loans increased $23.2 Page 58 million, or 17.7%, to $154.0 million for 2001 compared with $130.8 million for 2000. The average balance of mortgage backed securities increased $839.2 million, or 26.2%, to $4.04 billion for 2001 compared with $3.20 billion for 2000. These increases were offset in part by a decrease in the average balance of investment securities for 2001 of $492.7 million, or 55.8%, to $389.5 million from $882.2 million for 2000. The average balance of Federal funds sold increased $73.1 million, or 90.9%, to $153.5 million for 2001 compared with $80.4 million for 2000. The average balance of FHLB stock increased $55.4 million to $79.4 million for 2001 from $24.0 million for 2000. The above increases in the average balances of interest earning assets reflect internal growth that was consistent with our capital management strategy to originate and purchase first mortgage loans and consumer and other loans, while purchasing mortgage backed securities to supplement loan originations and manage interest rate risk. The increase in the average balance of first mortgage loans also reflected the program we established late in 2000 to supplement our loan originations by purchasing a higher volume of first mortgage loans than in previous periods. The growth in the average balance of mortgage backed securities and the decline in the average balance of investment securities reflected the calls of investment securities during 2001 due to the lower interest rate environment. The growth in the average balance of mortgage backed securities was also due to the investment of other funds in mortgage backed securities as part of our capital management strategy. The increase in the average balance of federal funds sold reflected the initial investment of the proceeds of the calls of investment securities, and the initial investment of the large volume of mortgage loan and mortgage backed security prepayments. These funds were subsequently invested in adjustable rate or higher yielding fixed rate mortgage backed securities or mortgage loans. The increase in the average balance of FHLB stock reflected the increase in the amount of FHLB stock required to be held by us based on our asset size. The increase in interest income due to the growth of average total interest earning assets was partially offset by an 11 basis point decrease in the average yield on interest earning assets to 6.89% for year ended December 31, 2001 compared with 7.00% for the year ended December 31, 2000. The average yield on first mortgage loans, net, decreased 3 basis points to 7.32% for 2001 compared with 7.35% for 2000. The average yield on mortgage backed securities decreased 20 basis points to 6.51% for 2001 compared with 6.71% for 2000. The slight decrease in the average yield on first mortgage loans, net, reflected the relative stability of our offered mortgage interest rates, which are based on long term market rates, in the lower short term interest rate environment during 2001. The decrease in the average yield on mortgage backed securities reflected the repricing of our variable rate mortgage backed securities in the lower interest rate environment. The decrease in the average yield on mortgage backed securities also reflected the large volume of purchases made in the lower rate environment due to the calls of investment securities and the large prepayment volume on our mortgage backed security portfolio. Interest Expense. Total interest expense increased $43.4 million, or 12.1%, to $403.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared with $360.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Interest expense on borrowed funds increased $46.9 million, or 94.7%, to $96.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared with $49.5 million for the corresponding 2000 period. Interest expense on deposits decreased $3.5 million, or 1.1%, to $307.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared with $310.5 million for the corresponding 2000 period. The increase in total interest expense was attributable to an increase in the average balance of total interest bearing liabilities of $1.38 billion, or 19.5%, to $8.45 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared with $7.07 billion for the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase in the average balance of total interest bearing liabilities primarily resulted from an increase in the average balance of Page 59 borrowed funds of $934.0 million, or 117.0%, to $1.73 billion for 2001 compared with $798.0 million for 2000. The use of borrowed funds has accelerated over the past year to fund asset growth . The increase also reflected our decision to assist in managing our interest rate risk by using long term borrowings to match our long term assets. The average balance of interest bearing deposits increased $443.6 million, or 7.1%, to $6.72 billion for 2001 compared with $6.27 billion for 2000. The increase in the average balance of interest bearing deposits was attributable to an increase in the average balance of time deposits of $449.4 million, or 9.1%, to $5.38 billion for the 2001 compared with $4.93 billion for 2000. We believe the overall increase in total interest bearing deposits was due in part to the volatility in the equity markets, our offering competitive rates on our time deposit products and deposit movement among financial institutions due to consolidation within our industry. The increase in interest expense due to the growth of total interest bearing liabilities was partially offset by a 32 basis point decrease in the average cost of total interest bearing liabilities to 4.77% for the year ended December 31, 2001 from 5.09% for the year December 31, 2000. The average cost of total interest bearing deposits decreased 38 basis points to 4.57% for 2001 compared with 4.95% for 2000. Within the interest bearing deposit mix, the average cost of time deposits decreased 48 basis points to 5.15% for 2001 compared with 5.63% for 2000. The decrease in the average cost of interest bearing deposits reflected the lower market interest rate environment in 2001. The average cost of borrowed funds decreased 64 basis points to 5.57% for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared with 6.21% for the corresponding 2000 period. The decrease in the average cost of borrowed funds reflected the continued growth in borrowings during the lower interest rate environment of 2001, and the maturing and refunding in 2001 of higher costing short term borrowings originated in 2000. The decreases in the average costs of the individual components of interest bearing liabilities reflected the lower interest rate environment experienced during 2001. However, the lower basis point decrease in the overall cost of total average interest bearing liabilities, when compared to the individual components, reflected the larger percentage of borrowed funds in our interest bearing liability mix. These borrowed funds had higher costs than our existing deposit portfolio. Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased $33.1 million, or 13.0%, to $287.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared with $254.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. This increase primarily reflected increases in the average balance of both interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, and the net interest rate spread earned on this growth. Our net interest rate spread, the difference between the average yield on average total interest earning assets and the average cost of average total interest bearing liabilities, increased 21 basis points to 2.12% for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared with 1.91% for the corresponding 2000 period. The increase in the net interest spread is primarily due to the lower interest rate environment experienced during 2001 and the fact that our interest bearing liabilities repriced faster than our interest earning assets. Our net interest margin, represented by net interest income divided by average total interest earning assets, decreased 3 basis points to 2.87% for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared with 2.90% for the corresponding 2000 period. The decrease in the net interest margin reflected the fact that the average balance of our interest bearing liabilities grew at a higher rate than the average balance of our interest earning assets. This was due, in part, to the use of funds, which could have been otherwise invested, to purchase our common stock. This use of funds caused our net interest income to grow at a lesser rate than did our average interest earning assets. Page 60 Provision for Loan Losses. Our provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $1.9 million, a decrease of $0.2 million, or 9.5%, compared with $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Net loan charge offs for 2001 were $9,000 compared with net recoveries of $4,000 during 2000. As a result, the allowance for loan losses increased $1.9 million, or 8.6%, to $24.0 million at December 31, 2001 from $22.1 million at December 31, 2000. The increase in the allowance for loan losses to its current level, through the continued provision for loan losses, reflected the overall growth of the loan portfolio, the level of delinquent and non performing loans and real estate market conditions during 2001. Non performing loans, defined as non accruing loans and accruing loans delinquent 90 days or more, increased $2.6 million, or 20.0%, to $15.6 million at December 31, 2001 from $13.0 million at December 31, 2000, primarily due to the continued growth in the loan portfolio and the slow economic conditions in 2001. Although non performing loans increased during 2001, the ratio of non performing loans to total loans decreased to 0.26% at December 31, 2001 compared with 0.27% at December 31, 2000. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans was 153.4% at December 31, 2001 compared with 170.7% at December 31, 2000. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans was 0.40% at December 31, 2001 compared with 0.45% at December 31, 2000. Future provisions for loan losses will continue to be based upon our assessment of the overall loan portfolio and the underlying collateral, trends in non performing loans, current economic conditions and other relevant factors in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at adequate levels to provide for estimated losses. Although management uses the best information available, the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate which is subject to significant judgement and short term change. Non Interest Income. Total non interest income, consisting primarily of service fees, was $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared with $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Non Interest Expense. Total non interest expense increased $2.8 million, or 3.5%, to $81.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared with $79.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase was primarily due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits of $2.4 million, or 4.8%, to $52.3 million for 2001 compared with $49.9 million for 2000. The increase in salaries and employee benefits reflected routine salary increases and included additional expense of our ESOP which is based on the market price of our common stock in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Position 93 6, "Employer Accounting for Employee Stock Ownership Plans." Our efficiency ratio, determined by dividing non interest expense by the sum of net interest income and non interest income, excluding net gains on securities transactions, was 28.0% for 2001 compared with 30.6% for 2000. Our ratio of non interest expense to average assets for 2001 was 0.80% compared with 0.89% for 2000. The decrease in these ratios reflected our efforts to control non interest expense while growing assets consistent with our capital management strategy. Income Taxes. Income tax expense increased $10.9 million, or 17.4%, to $73.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared with $62.6 million for year ended December 31, 2000. The increase in income tax expense was due to the increase in income before income tax expense. Our effective tax rate for 2001 and 2000 was 35.3%. Page 61 COMPARISON OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AT DECEMBER 31, 2000 AND DECEMBER 31, 1999 Our total assets increased $861.5 million, or 10.1%, to $9.38 billion at December 31, 2000 from $8.52 billion at December 31, 1999. This increase, funded by borrowed funds, was generally reflected in increases in mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities. Loans increased $566.9 million, or 13.2%, to $4.87 billion at December 31, 2000 from $4.31 billion at December 31, 1999. For the year ended December 31, 2000, we originated and purchased first mortgage loans of approximately $1.01 billion. These originations and purchases were concentrated in one to four family residential mortgage loans. We also originated for the year ended December 31, 2000, home equity loans of approximately $73.8 million. Mortgage backed securities increased $165.0 million, or 5.3%, to $3.26 billion at December 31, 2000 from $3.10 billion at December 31, 1999. Investment securities available for sale increased $64.6 million, or 8.0%, to $876.7 million at December 31, 2000 from $812.1 million at December 31, 1999. This increase reflected an increase in the market value of our investment securities portfolio as well as additional purchases of securities. These increases continued to reflect our emphasis on the origination and purchase of one to four family mortgage loans supplemented by the purchase of mortgage backed securities. Due to our membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York ("FHLB"), we purchased FHLB stock of $73.6 million during 2000, the amount required for us to hold based on our assets available to secure borrowings. The above increases in interest earning assets were partially offset by a $13.7 million, or 6.8%, decrease in total cash and cash equivalents to $187.1 million at December 31, 2000 from $200.8 million at December 31, 1999. Accrued interest receivable increased $10.3 million, or 19.8%, to $62.3 million at December 31, 2000 from $52.0 million at December 31, 1999 primarily due to the growth in our mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities. At December 31, 2000, total liabilities were $7.92 billion, an increase of 12.4%, or $876.0 million, compared with $7.04 billion at December 31, 1999. Borrowed funds, consisting entirely of securities sold under agreements to repurchase, increased $950.0 million to $1.25 billion at December 31, 2000 from $300.0 million at December 31, 1999. The use of borrowed funds accelerated in 2000 as compared to 1999 to fund asset growth consistent with our capital management strategy as well as to offset the decrease in total deposits. Funding asset growth with borrowed funds generated additional earnings through a positive interest rate spread on the borrowed funds that were invested. Total deposits decreased $83.9 million, or 1.3%, to $6.60 billion at December 31, 2000 from $6.69 billion at December 31, 1999. Interest bearing deposits decreased $108.0 million, or 1.7%, to $6.27 billion at December 31, 2000 from $6.38 billion at December 31, 1999. The decrease in interest bearing deposits reflects a $23.3 million, or 0.5%, decrease in time deposits to $4.97 billion at December 31, 2000 from $4.99 billion at December 31, 1999, a $37.9 million, or 7.8%, decrease in money market accounts to $448.9 million at December 31, 2000 from $486.8 million at December 31, 1999, and a $46.5 million, or 5.8%, decrease in regular savings deposits to $757.6 million at December 31, 2000 from $804.1 million at December 31, 1999. We believe the decrease in interest bearing deposits was due in part to the intense competition for deposits in the banking and financial services industry. The decrease also reflected our decision to use borrowed funds, which had a lower incremental cost in 2000 than our originated deposit products. The decrease in interest bearing deposits was partially offset by an increase in noninterest bearing deposits, particularly demand deposit accounts, of $24.1 million, or 7.8%, to $332.2 million at December 31, 2000 from $308.1 million at December 31, 1999. This increase was partially attributable to the introduction of a free checking account product during the second quarter of 2000. Accrued expenses and other liabilities increased $9.9 million, or 19.1%, to $61.7 million at December 31, 2000 from $51.8 million at December 31, 1999. This increase was primarily due to Page 62 increases in accrued interest payable on borrowed funds and accrued expenses for certain employee benefit plans. Total stockholders equity decreased $14.5 million, or 1.0%, to $1.46 billion at December 31, 2000 from $1.48 billion at December 31, 1999. Stockholders equity increased by net income of $114.8 million for 2000 and an unrealized gain of $24.9 million in accumulated other comprehensive loss due to increases in the market values of our investment securities available for sale. Declarations of cash dividends to common stockholders during 2000 decreased stockholders equity by $32.0 million. Transactions in 2000 to unallocated common stock held by the ESOP decreased stockholders equity $33.3 million due to purchases of Hudson City Bancorp common stock by the plan of approximately $35.3 million offset by $2.0 million of common stock allocations to plan participants. The balance in unearned common stock held by the RRP was $24.0 million at December 31, 2000, due to purchases of Hudson City Bancorp common stock by the plan in 2000 of $28.6 million offset by $4.6 million of RRP stock that vested to participants. Hudson City repurchased 3,664,000 shares of common stock during 2000, which decreased stockholders equity by $65.5 million. At December 31, 2000, the ratio of total stockholders equity to total assets was 15.61% compared with 17.36% at December 31, 1999. For the year ended December 31, 2000, the ratio of average stockholders equity to average assets was 16.35% compared with 14.60% for the year ended December 31, 1999. Stockholders equity per common share was $13.78 at December 31, 2000 compared with $12.99 at December 31, 1999. COMPARISON OF OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 AND 1999 General. Net income was $114.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, an increase of $7.4 million, or 6.9%, from net income of $107.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Basic and diluted earnings per common share were $1.05 and $1.04, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2000. From the date of our reorganization (July 13, 1999) to December 31, 1999, basic and diluted earnings were $0.47 per common share. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to an increase in net interest income. Our return on average assets for the year ended December 31, 2000 was 1.29% compared with 1.32% for the year ended December 31, 1999. Our return on average equity for 2000 was 7.87% compared with 9.05% for 1999. The decrease in the return on average equity was primarily due to the additional equity received in connection with the reorganization, which occurred July 13, 1999. Interest Income. Total interest income increased $77.9 million, or 14.5%, to $614.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared with $536.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. The increase in total interest income was due in part to the average balance of total interest earning assets increasing $803.5 million, or 10.1%, to $8.77 billion for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared with $7.97 billion for the year ended December 31, 1999. This increase was primarily attributable to a $659.6 million, or 17.4%, increase in the average balance of first mortgage loans, net to $4.46 billion for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared with $3.80 billion for the year ended December 31, 1999. The average balance of consumer and other loans increased $36.1 million, or 38.1%, to $130.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared with $94.7 million for year ended December 31, 1999. The average balance of mortgage backed securities increased $80.6 million, or 2.6%, to $3.20 billion for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared with $3.12 billion for the corresponding 1999 period. These increases were offset in part by a decrease in the average balance of investment securities for the year ended December 31, 2000 of $15.9 million, or 1.8%, to $882.2 million Page 63 from the average balance of $898.1 million for 1999. The average balance of FHLB stock purchased was $24.0 million for 2000. We did not own FHLB stock in 1999. The above increases in the average balances of interest earning assets reflected internal growth that was financed by borrowed funds. The growth was consistent with our capital management strategy to originate and purchase first mortgage loans and consumer and other loans, while purchasing mortgage backed securities to manage interest rate risk. In addition, the growth also reflected a decline in prepayment activity, year to year, primarily due to the increase in market interest rates. The decline in the average balance of investment securities reflects the initial deployment of funds received during our reorganization into short term securities during the second and third quarters of 1999. These short term securities were eventually reinvested in our loan and mortgage backed security portfolios, which currently generate higher yields. The increase in interest income was also attributable to an increase in the average yield on interest earning assets to 7.00% for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared with 6.73% for 1999. This increase in the average yield reflected across the board increases in the average yields of all categories of our interest earnings assets. The average yield on first mortgage loans, net was 7.35% for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared with 7.31% for 1999. The average yield on mortgage backed securities increased 54 basis points to 6.71% for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared with 6.17% for the year ended December 31, 1999. The average yield on investment securities increased slightly to 6.22% for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared with 6.21% for 1999. The slight increase in the average yield on first mortgage loans, net, in the higher market interest rate environment, reflected a general lag in the repricing of first mortgage loans due to less refinancing and an increase in originations of fixed mortgage loans in the prior periods. The increase in the average yield on mortgage backed securities reflected the increase in market interest rates, as our portfolio contains predominantly adjustable rate securities. Interest Expense. Total interest expense increased $61.2 million, or 20.5%, to $360.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared with $298.8 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Interest expense on borrowed funds increased $46.4 million to $49.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared with $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Interest expense on deposits increased $14.8 million, or 5.0%, to $310.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared with $295.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. The increase in deposit interest expense was primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense on time deposits of $19.6 million, or 7.6%, to $277.6 million for 2000. The increase in interest expense was attributable in part to an increase in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities of $499.1 million, or 7.6%, to $7.07 billion for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared with $6.57 billion for the corresponding 1999 period. The increase in the average balance of total interest bearing liabilities resulted from an increase in the average balance of borrowed funds of $744.4 million to $798.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared with $53.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. The use of borrowed funds accelerated in 2000 as compared to 1999 to fund asset growth consistent with our capital management strategy and to offset the decrease in the average balance of interest bearing deposits. The average balance of interest bearing deposits decreased $245.3 million, or 3.8%, to $6.27 billion for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared with $6.52 billion for the year ended December 31, 1999. Within the interest bearing deposit mix, the average balance of time deposits decreased $141.7 million, or 2.8%, to $4.93 billion for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared with $5.07 billion for the year ended December 31, 1999. The average balance of regular savings deposits decreased $66.6 Page 64 million, or 7.8%, to $782.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared with $848.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. The average balance of money market accounts decreased $35.1 million, or 7.0%, to $463.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The decrease in the average balance of interest bearing deposits reflected the effect of the intense competition for deposits in the banking and financial services industry. The decrease also reflected our decision to use borrowed funds, which had a lower incremental cost in 2000 than our originated deposit products. The decrease also reflected the use by our depositors of approximately $110.0 million of funds on deposit with Hudson City Savings Bank to fund their Hudson City Bancorp common stock purchases during the reorganization. The increase in interest expense was also attributable to a 54 basis point increase in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities to 5.09% for the year ended December 31, 2000 from 4.55% for 1999. The average cost of borrowed funds increased 39 basis points to 6.21% for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared with 5.82% for the year ended December 31, 1999. The average cost of interest bearing deposits increased 41 basis points to 4.95% for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared with 4.54% for the year ended December 31, 1999. Within the interest bearing deposit mix, the average cost of time deposits increased 54 basis points to 5.63% for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared with 5.09% for the corresponding 1999 period. The increase in the average cost of borrowed funds and time deposits reflected the rising market interest rate environment over the period, the fact that the majority of our time deposits reprice within one year, and the short term borrowing strategy employed during 2000. These increases were offset, in part, by decreases in the average cost of other interest bearing deposits due to our effort to manage the overall cost of funds. Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased $16.8 million, or 7.1%, to $254.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared with $237.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. This increase primarily reflected the increases in the average balance of first mortgage loans, net and our other investments due to the use of the net proceeds from the reorganization, and the additional earnings generated on the borrowed funds that were invested. Our net interest rate spread, the difference between the average yield on average total interest earning assets and the average cost of average total interest bearing liabilities, decreased 27 basis points to 1.91% for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared with 2.18% for the corresponding 1999 period. Our net interest margin, represented by net interest income divided by average total interest earning assets, decreased 8 basis points to 2.90% for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared with 2.98% for the year ended December 31, 1999. The decreases in the net interest rate spread and the net interest margin reflected the rising market interest rate environment over the period, the fact that our interest bearing liabilities reprice faster than our interest earning assets, and a shift within interest bearing liabilities to higher costing funds. Provision for Loan Losses. Our provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $2.13 million, a decrease of $220,000, or 9.4%, compared with $2.35 million for the corresponding 1999 period. The allowance for loan losses increased $2.1 million, or 10.5%, to $22.1 million at December 31, 2000 from $20.0 million at December 31, 1999. Non performing loans, defined as non accruing loans and accruing loans delinquent 90 days or more, decreased $1.0 million, or 7.1%, to $13.0 million at December 31, 2000 from $14.0 million at December 31, 1999 due, in part, to the favorable economy during the period. There were net loan recoveries of $4,000 during 2000. The increase in the allowance for loan losses, through the continued provision for loan losses, reflected the growth of the loan portfolio. The decrease in the provision, year to year, reflected the lower non performing loans to total loans ratio. At December 31, 2000, the ratio of non performing loans to total loans was 0.27% compared with 0.33% at December 31, 1999. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans was 170.7% at December 31, 2000 compared with 142.7% at December 31, 1999. The ratio of the allowance Page 65 for loan losses to total loans was 0.45% at December 31, 2000 compared with 0.46% at December 31, 1999. Non Interest Income. Total non interest income, consisting primarily of service fees, decreased $0.2 million to $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared with $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Non Interest Expense. Total non interest expense increased $10.6 million, or 15.5%, to $79.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared with $68.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Salaries and employee benefits increased $7.8 million, or 18.5%, to $49.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared with $42.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, primarily due to expense recognized in 2000 for the ESOP and RRP, and routine salary increases. The ESOP expense increased, year to year, due to the higher average market price for our stock in 2000. RRP expense began in 2000 after the plan was approved by the stockholders. Net occupancy expense increased $1.6 million, or 13.2%, to $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared with $12.1 million for the corresponding 1999 period. The increase was primarily due to increases in maintenance and repairs of banking premises and equipment and increases in rental expense. Federal deposit insurance expense increased primarily due to an industry wide increase in the assessment charged by the FDIC. Goodwill was fully amortized as of December 31, 1999, resulting in no amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2000. Other expenses increased $2.4 million, or 22.2%, to $13.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared with $10.8 million for 1999. The increase in other expenses was primarily due to increases in operating expenses incurred in 2000 related to our existence as a public company, increased fees for professional services and expense related to the RRP allocation of common stock to non officer directors. Our efficiency ratio, which we determined by dividing non interest expense by the sum of net interest income and non interest income, excluding net gains on securities transactions, was 30.6% for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared with 28.3% for the year ended December 31, 1999. Our ratio of non interest expense to average assets was 0.89% for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared with 0.84% for the corresponding period in 1999. The slight increase in these ratios reflected the increase in non interest expense discussed above. Income Taxes. Income tax expense decreased $1.3 million, or 2.0%, to $62.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared with $63.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2000 also decreased to 35.3% from 37.3% for the year ended December 31, 1999. These decreases reflected certain tax benefits attained from the formation and funding of a subsidiary of Hudson City Savings during 2000. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The term "liquidity" refers to our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to fund loan originations, loan purchases, deposit withdrawals and operating expenses. Our primary sources of funds are scheduled amortization and prepayments of loan principal and mortgage backed securities, deposits, Page 66 borrowed funds, maturities and calls of investment securities and funds provided by our operations. Our membership in the FHLB provides us access to additional sources of borrowed funds, which is generally limited to twenty times the amount of FHLB stock held. Scheduled loan repayments and maturing investment securities are a relatively predictable source of funds. However, deposit flows, calls of investment securities and borrowed funds, and prepayments of loans and mortgage backed securities are strongly influenced by interest rates, general and local economic conditions and competition in the marketplace. These factors reduce the predictability of the timing of these sources of funds. As mortgage interest rates decline, customer refinancing activity tends to accelerate causing an increase in cash flow from both our mortgage loan and mortgage backed security portfolios. If our pricing is competitive, the demand for mortgage originations also accelerates. When mortgage rates increase, the opposite effect tends to occur and our loan origination and purchase activity becomes increasingly dependant on the strength of the residential real estate market, home purchases and new construction activity. Principal repayments on loans were $1.35 billion during 2001 compared with $511.9 million for 2000. Principal payments received on mortgage backed securities totaled $1.62 billion during 2001 compared to $693.2 million during 2000. The increase in payments on loans and mortgage backed securities reflected the lower market interest rate environment during 2001, which caused an increase in prepayment activity. It also reflected the growth in those portfolios, thus a larger base from which to receive payments. Maturities and calls of investment securities totaled $855.7 million during 2001 compared with maturities and calls of $0.7 million during 2000. The higher amount of calls during 2001 was due to the lower interest rate environment. For the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, we borrowed funds of $950 million and $2.45 billion, respectively, through the use of securities sold under agreements to repurchase. Additionally, we borrowed $600.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 through the use of FHLB advances. An advance from the FHLB utilizes our mortgage portfolio as collateral. Borrowings with the FHLB are generally limited to twenty times the amount of FHLB stock owned. Principal payments on borrowed funds during 2001 were $650.0 million compared with principal payments of $1.50 billion during 2000. The higher level of borrowings and principal payments during 2000 reflected the planned use of short term funding in that period. The net increase in borrowed funds during 2001 of $900.0 million was used to fund asset growth which generated additional earnings through a positive interest rate spread. Additionally, during the lower interest rate environment of 2001, we lengthened the maturities of our borrowings which allowed us to manage our interest rate risk by using long term borrowings to match our long term assets. There are no borrowed funds scheduled to mature within one year at December 31, 2001. Total deposits increased $1.31 billion during 2001 compared with a decrease of $83.9 million during 2000. Deposit flows are affected by the level of market interest rates, the interest rates and products offered by competitors, and other factors. We believe the increase in total deposits in 2001 was due in part to the volatility in the equity markets, our offering competitive rates on our time deposit products and deposit movement among financial institutions due to consolidation within our industry. Time deposit accounts scheduled to mature within one year were $5.52 billion at December 31, 2001. Based on our deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy, we anticipate that a significant portion of these time deposits will remain with Hudson City Savings. We are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position; therefore, we monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. Page 67 Our primary investing activities are the origination and purchase of one to four family real estate loans and consumer and other loans, the purchase of mortgage backed securities, and to a lesser extent, the purchase of investment securities. We originated and purchased total loans of approximately $1.59 billion and $857.6 million, respectively, during 2001 compared with $968.9 million and $110.7 million, respectively, during 2000. The increase is primarily due to the lower market interest rate environment during 2001, which caused an increase in prepayments and refinancings and an overall increase in mortgage lending activity. Additionally, to supplement our loan originations, we established late in 2000 a program to purchase a higher volume of first mortgage loans than in previous periods. Purchases of mortgage backed securities during 2001 were $3.36 billion compared with $862.5 million during 2000. Of the mortgage backed securities purchased in 2001, $2.17 billion were real estate mortgage investment conduits ("REMIC") compared with no such purchases in 2000. The REMIC purchases in 2001 had fixed interest rates and generally had shorter average lives compared with alternate mortgage backed security investments available at the time of purchase. The increase in purchases of mortgage backed securities was related to the increase in prepayment activity due to the lower market interest rate environment during 2001. This increase also reflected the reinvestment of the proceeds from the calls of investment securities received during 2001. As part of the membership requirements of the FHLB, we are required to purchase a certain dollar amount of FHLB common stock. During 2001 we purchased $7.5 million of FHLB common stock, which brings our total investment in FHLB stock to $81.1 million, the amount we are currently required to hold based on our asset size. During 2001, the recognition and retention plan purchased 187,418 additional shares of common stock at a cost of $4.2 million. The purchase of 121,100 of these shares was due to additional awards made in 2001. The remaining 66,318 shares purchased were not allocated at December 31, 2001. Under our stock repurchase programs, shares of Hudson City Bancorp common stock may be purchased in the open market and through other privately negotiated transactions, from time to time, depending on market conditions. The repurchased shares are held as treasury stock for general corporate use. During 2001, we purchased 12,983,400 shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $278.5 million. During 2000, we purchased 3,664,000 shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $65.5 million. At December 31, 2001, there were 4,781,634 shares remaining to be repurchased under the current stock repurchase program. At December 31, 2001, Hudson City Savings had outstanding loan commitments to borrowers of approximately $314.8 million, commitments to purchase loans of approximately $101.2 million and available home equity and overdraft lines of credit of approximately $73.2 million. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds available to meet our current commitments in the normal course of business. Cash dividends declared and paid during 2001 were $46.5 million compared with $32.0 million during 2000. The dividend pay out ratio for the years ending December 31, 2001 and 2000, was 34.3% and 27.6%, respectively. On January 10, 2002, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of fifteen cents ($0.15) per common share. The dividend was paid on March 1, 2002 to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 8, 2002. We opened one new branch location in Ocean County during 2001 and opened a new branch in Bergen County in February 2002. The expenditures related to their establishment did not have a material impact on our liquidity, financial position or results of operations. We do not anticipate any material capital expenditures nor do we have any balloon or other payments due on any long term obligations or any off balance sheet items other than the commitments and unused lines of credit noted above. Page 68 At December 31, 2001, Hudson City Bancorp and Hudson City Savings exceeded all regulatory capital requirements. Hudson City Bancorps leverage capital ratio, Tier 1 risk based capital ratio and total risk based capital ratio were 11.55%, 34.02% and 34.66%, respectively. Hudson City Savings leverage capital ratio, Tier 1 risk based capital ratio and total risk based capital ratio were 10.64%, 31.32% and 31.96%, respectively. EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 The attacks of September 11, 2001, have not caused any significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We expect that any possible future impact caused by these events will result from their impact on overall economic conditions and our customers. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS On July 20, 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 141, "Business Combinations" and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS No. 141 requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 as well as all purchase method business combinations completed after June 30, 2001. SFAS No. 141 specifies the criteria acquired intangible assets must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill. SFAS No. 142 will require that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142. SFAS No. 142 will also require that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to be Disposed Of." SFAS No. 142 requires that after December 31, 2001, goodwill and any intangible asset determined to have an indefinite useful life will not be amortized, but will continue to be evaluated for impairment in accordance with the appropriate pre SFAS No. 142 accounting literature. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business combinations completed before July 1, 2001 will continue to be amortized prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 142. We are required to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 141 immediately. The initial adoption of SFAS No. 141 had no impact on our consolidated financial statements. We are required to adopt SFAS No. 142 effective January 1, 2002. We currently have no recorded goodwill or intangible assets and do not anticipate that the initial adoption of SFAS No. 142 will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. In July of 2001, FASB Technical Bulletin No. 01 1, "Effective Date for Certain Financial Institutions of Certain Provisions of Statement 140 Related to the Isolation of Transferred Financial Assets," was issued which delays the effective date for the isolation standards and related guidance under SFAS No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities," to transfers of financial assets occurring after December 31, 2001, instead of March 31, 2001. The implementation of SFAS No. 140 provisions, effective after December 15, 2000, did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. The implementation of the remaining Page 69 provisions, subsequent to December 31, 2001, is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. IMPACT OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES The Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Hudson City Bancorp have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). GAAP generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations. Unlike industrial companies, our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature. As a result, changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than do the effects of inflation. ITEM 7a. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
