ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Hudson City Bancorps Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, and the other statistical data provided elsewhere in this document. GENERAL Our results of operations depend primarily on net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets, primarily mortgage loans, mortgage backed securities and investment securities, and the interest we pay on our interest bearing liabilities, primarily time deposits, interest bearing demand deposits and borrowed funds. Our results of operations are also affected by our provision for loan losses, non interest income, and non interest expense. Non interest expense consists primarily of salaries and employee benefits, occupancy expenses and other general and administrative expenses. Non interest income generally consists of service charges and fees and may include gains on the disposition of assets. Our results of operations may also be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions, particularly those with respect to changes in market interest rates, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. Future changes in applicable law, regulations or government policies may materially impact us. Additionally, our lending activity is concentrated in loans secured by real estate primarily located in New Jersey. Accordingly, our results of operations may be affected by regional market and economic conditions. MUTUAL HOLDING COMPANY STRUCTURE In 1999, Hudson City Savings converted and reorganized from a New Jersey chartered mutual savings bank into a two tiered mutual savings bank holding company structure and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Hudson City Bancorp. Hudson City Bancorp sold 47% of the then outstanding shares of its common stock to the public at $10.00 per share and received net proceeds of $527.6 million. Hudson City Bancorp contributed 50% of the net proceeds from the initial public offering to Hudson City Savings. Hudson City Bancorp issued 53% of the then outstanding shares of its common stock to Hudson City, MHC. At December 31, 2002, as a result of stock repurchases, Hudson City, MHC owned 63.85% of Hudson City Bancorp. GROWTH INITIATIVES In accordance with our business plan, we have developed and employed several initiatives, including a program to purchase whole mortgage loans and the introduction of our interest bearing High Value Checking account, to effectively and prudently utilize our capital through internally generated growth. During 2002, these initiatives helped us to increase our core investments in mortgage related assets, increase our deposit customer base and grow our assets by 23.8%, or over $2.7 billion. We expect to continue to grow through internal expansion using borrowed funds to supplement our deposit initiatives as a funding source, as well as by adding new branch offices, a strategy that has been successful for us in the past. Page 50 MANAGEMENT OF INTEREST RATE RISK As a financial institution, our primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility. Net interest income is the primary component of our net income, and fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact the level of both income and expense recorded on a large portion of our assets and liabilities. Fluctuations in interest rates will also affect the market value of all interest earning assets, other than those that possess a short term to maturity. A decreasing interest rate environment, such as experienced during 2001 and 2002, can be beneficial to our net interest income as our interest bearing liabilities generally reprice faster than our interest earning assets. A steepening yield curve, where the spread between long term interest rates and short term interest rates widens, can also be beneficial to our net interest income as our interest bearing liabilities generally price off short term market rates while our mortgage loan products, particularly those with initial terms to maturity or repricing greater than one year, generally price off long term market rates. Conversely, a narrowing or flattening yield curve may have an adverse impact on our net interest income as the interest rate spread between our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities decreases. Also impacting our net interest income and net interest rate spread is the level of prepayment activity on our mortgage related assets. The actual amount of time before mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities are repaid can be significantly impacted by changes in market interest rates and mortgage prepayment rates. Mortgage prepayment rates will vary due to a number of factors, including the regional economy in the area where the underlying mortgages were originated, seasonal factors, demographic variables and the assumability of the underlying mortgages. However, the major factors affecting prepayment rates are prevailing interest rates, related mortgage refinancing opportunities and competition. The historically low market interest rates experienced during 2001 and 2002 increased prepayment activity on our mortgage related assets, which may have an adverse impact on our net interest income and interest rate spread in future periods. General market interest rates declined during 2001 and 2002, reflecting reductions of rates by the Federal Open Market Committee ("FOMC") of the Federal Reserve Bank. The overall market yield curve steepened during 2001 as interest rates on short term maturities declined faster than the interest rates on long term maturities. Market interest rates on short term maturities remained relatively stable through the first nine months of 2002, then declined slightly due to a further FOMC rate reduction in the fourth quarter of 2002. Long term market interest rates continued to steadily decline in 2002, thus narrowing the overall market yield curve. In the interest rate environment experienced in 2002, our net interest rate spread increased 54 basis points to 2.66% from 2.12% for 2001. It has been because of our ability to grow our business with low cost interest bearing liabilities that we have been able to increase our net interest income during 2002. However, the current narrower yield curve may have an adverse impact on our future net interest income and net interest rate spread. The primary objectives of our interest rate risk management strategy are to: evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in certain balance sheet accounts; determine the appropriate level of interest rate risk given our business plan, the current business environment and our capital and liquidity requirements; and manage interest rate risk in a manner consistent with the approved guidelines and policies set by our Board of Directors. Page 51 We seek to coordinate asset and liability decisions so that, under changing interest rate scenarios, earnings will remain within an acceptable range. To achieve the objectives of managing interest rate risk, our Asset/Liability Committee meets weekly to discuss and monitor the market interest rate environment compared to interest rates that are offered on our products. This committee consists of the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Operating Officer and the Investment Officer. The Asset/Liability Committee presents periodic reports to the Board of Directors at its regular meetings, as well as a comprehensive quarterly report to the Asset Management Committee of the Board of Directors. The quarterly reports address the results of activities and strategies and the effect that changes in interest rates will have on our results of operations and the present value of our equity. Historically, our lending activities have emphasized one to four family first and second mortgage loans. We believe that the frequent repricing of adjustable rate mortgage loans and adjustable rate securities, which reduces the exposure to interest rate fluctuations, would benefit our long term profitability. However, the prevailing interest rate environment in recent years has resulted in increased demand for fixed rate first mortgage loans. The result has been an increase in the proportion of fixed rate loans in our portfolio. This may have an adverse impact on our net interest income, particularly in a rising interest rate environment. The purchase of real estate mortgage investment conduits ("REMIC") to supplement our purchases of adjustable rate mortgage backed securities has given us additional interest rate risk protection. At the date of purchase, these REMIC securities generally had shorter weighted average lives than traditional mortgage backed security purchases due to their prepayment schedules. However, since the REMIC purchases have fixed interest rates, the weighted average life will vary with changes in market interest rates. Our primary source of funds has been deposits, consisting primarily of time deposits, which have substantially shorter terms to maturity than the loan portfolio. We use securities sold under agreements to repurchase and FHLB advances as additional sources of funds. These borrowings are generally long term, in an effort to offset our short term deposit liabilities and assist in managing our interest rate risk. Certain of these borrowings have call options that could shorten their maturities in a rising interest rate environment. Due to the nature of our operations, we are not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk. Instead, our real estate loan portfolio, primarily located in New Jersey, is subject to risks associated with the local economy. We do not own any trading assets. We did not engage in any hedging transactions that use derivative instruments (such as interest rate swaps and caps) during 2002 and did not have any such hedging transactions in place at December 31, 2002. In the future, we may, with approval of our Board of Directors, engage in hedging transactions utilizing derivative instruments. Gap Analysis. The matching of the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are "interest rate sensitive" and by monitoring a financial institutions interest rate sensitivity "gap." An asset or liability is said to be "interest rate sensitive" within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period. The interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period. Page 52 A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period exceeds the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that specific time period. A gap is considered negative when the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a specific time period exceeds the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within the same period. During a period of rising interest rates, a financial institution with a negative gap position would be expected, absent the effects of other factors, to experience a greater increase in the costs of its liabilities relative to the yields of its assets and thus a decrease in the institutions net interest income. An institution with a positive gap position would be expected, absent the effect of other factors, to experience the opposite result. Conversely, during a period of falling interest rates, a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to reduce net interest income. The following table, referred to as the gap table, presents the amounts of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at December 31, 2002, which we anticipate to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown. Except as stated below, we determined the amounts of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period in accordance with the earlier of the term to repricing or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability. The information presented in the gap table is also based on the following assumptions: we assumed an annual prepayment rate of 30.0% for mortgage loans repricing or maturing after one year; we assumed an annual prepayment rate of 30.0% for mortgage backed securities repricing or maturing after one year; we reported savings accounts that had no stated maturity using decay rates of: 2.5% in less than six months, 2.5% in six months to one year, 25% in one year to two years, 30% in two years to three years, 20% in three years to five years, and 20% in over five years; we reported the $943.2 million balance in our High Value Checking account, which is a component of interest bearing demand accounts, that had no stated maturity using decay rates of : 12.5% in less than six months, 12.5% in six months to one year, 25% in one to two years, 25% in two to three years, and 25% in three years to five years; we reported the $97.4 million balance in our traditional NOW accounts, which is a component of interest bearing demand accounts, that had no stated maturity using decay rates of: 2.5% in less than six months, 2.5% in six months to one year, 25% in one year to two years, 30% in two years to three years, 20% in three years to five years, and 20% in over five years; we reported money market accounts using decay rates of: 25% in less than six months, 25% in six months to one year, 25% in one year to two years, and 25% in two years to three years. In 2001, prepayment assumptions on mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities were 20.0% and 25.0%, respectively. The change in the prepayment assumptions for 2002 was due to the increase in prepayments experienced during the year on these investments resulting from the lower interest rate environment. Page 53 Our determination of deposit decay rates is based on regulatory guidance, as modified by our historical experience. The initial decay rates on our High Value Checking account are based on our initial assessment of the volatility of the product given its current interest rate in relation to the overall market interest rate environment. The initial decay rates will be monitored closely and adjusted as required in future periods. Deposit decay rates, prepayment rates and anticipated bond or borrowing calls can have a significant impact on the estimated interest sensitivity gap. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, they may not be indicative of actual future deposit decay activity, mortgage and mortgage backed securities prepayments, and the actual timing of calls of federal agency bonds or borrowed funds. We have excluded non accrual loans totaling $6,072,000 from the table. As indicated in the gap table at December 31, 2002, our interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year exceeded our interest earning assets maturing or repricing within the same period by $15.4 million compared with $1.63 billion at December 31, 2001. This represented a cumulative one year interest rate sensitivity gap as a percent of total assets of negative 0.1% at December 31, 2002 compared with negative 14.3% at December 31, 2001. However, if current mortgage loan and mortgage backed security prepayment assumptions were used at December 31, 2001, and all other assumptions remained the same for that analysis, the cumulative interest sensitivity gap as a percentage of total assets would have been approximately negative 8.0%. The ratio of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year to interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year was 99.7% at December 31, 2002 compared with 71.9% at December 31, 2001. The change in these ratios, year to year, was primarily due to the accelerated prepayment assumptions for mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities used during the current lower interest rate environment and the overall growth in our assets during 2002. The change also reflected the growth of borrowed funds in the current year with maturities in excess of one year, the shift of time deposit maturities to over one year due to pricing strategies, and the growth of our High Value Checking account, which we estimate to have a decay rate in excess of one year of 75%.

For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Certain assets, such as adjustable rate loans and mortgage backed securities, have features that limit changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the loan. If interest rates change, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table. Finally, the ability of borrowers to make payments on their adjustable rate loans may decrease if interest rates increase. Present Value of Equity. In addition to the gap analysis, we also use a simulation model to monitor interest rate risk. This model reports the present value of equity in different interest rate environments, assuming an instantaneous and permanent interest rate shock to all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities. The present value of equity is the difference between the estimated fair value of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities. The changes in market value of assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates reflect the interest sensitivity of those assets and liabilities as their values are derived from the characteristics of the asset or liability (i.e., fixed rate, adjustable rate, caps, floors) relative to the current interest rate environment. For example, in a rising interest rate environment the fair market value of a fixed rate asset will decline, whereas the fair market value of an adjustable rate asset, depending on its repricing characteristics, may not decline. Increases in the market value of assets will increase the present value of equity whereas decreases in market value of assets will decrease the present value of equity. Conversely, increases in the market value of liabilities will decrease the present value of equity whereas decreases in the market value of liabilities will increase the present value of equity. Our policy sets a maximum percentage change in the present value of equity of 55% from the current, or zero basis point, present value of equity, given an instantaneous and parallel increase or decrease of 200 basis points. Although the percent change in the present value of equity at December 31, 2002 was within the December 31, 2001 maximum percent change limit of 40%, the maximum percent change was increased in 2002 to 55% to allow for more flexibility in managing our asset/liability mix. Page 56 The following table presents the estimated present value of equity over a range of interest rate change scenarios at December 31, 2002. The present value ratio shown in the table is the present value of equity as a percent of the present value of total assets in each of the different rate environments. For purposes of this table, we have made assumptions such as prepayment rates and decay rates similar to those used for the gap analysis table. PRESENT VALUE OF EQUITY AS PERCENT OF PRESENT PRESENT VALUE OF EQUITY VALUE OF ASSETS CHANGE IN DOLLAR DOLLAR PERCENT PRESENT VALUE PERCENT INTEREST RATES AMOUNT CHANGE CHANGE RATIO CHANGE (BASIS POINTS) (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) 200 $ 1,074,506 $ (284,364) (20.93)% 7.91% (16.03)% 150 1,217,874 (140,996) (10.38) 8.79 (6.69) 100 1,350,015 (8,855) (0.65) 9.58 1.70 50 1,392,313 33,443 2.46 9.74 3.40 0 1,358,870 9.42 (50) 1,280,274 (78,596) (5.78) 8.83 (6.26) (100) 1,187,129 (171,741) (12.64) 8.14 (13.59) (150) 1,094,206 (264,664) (19.48) 7.45 (20.91) (200) 970,332 (388,538) (28.59) 6.56 (30.36) At December 31, 2001, the percent change in the present value of equity in the 200 basis point increase scenario was negative 35.67% and in the 100 basis point decrease scenario it was positive 3.16% compared with the table above. The decreases in the present value of equity and the percent change in the present value of equity in the increasing rate scenarios in the December 31, 2002 analysis were primarily due to the growth of our fixed rate mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities. Generally, these assets will not reprice in a rising rate environment. The overall decrease in the present value of equity and the percent change in the present value of equity in the decreasing rate scenarios in the December 31, 2002 analysis was primarily due to the growth of our fixed rate borrowed funds in this low interest rate environment. Fixed rate borrowed funds, even those with call options, generally do not reprice in a decreasing rate environment. We believe the 150 and 200 basis point decrease scenarios presented above may not be meaningful given the prevailing low market interest rate environment. As in the case of the gap table, the methods we used in the previous table are also inherently imprecise. This type of modeling requires that we make assumptions that may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. For example, we assume the composition of the interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will remain constant over the period being measured and that all interest rate shocks will be uniformly reflected across the yield curve, regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing. The table assumes that we will take no action in response to the changes in interest rates. In addition, prepayment estimates and other assumptions within the model are subjective in nature, involve uncertainties, and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Accordingly, although the present value of equity model may provide an estimate of our interest rate risk at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in interest rates on our present value of equity. Page 57 ANALYSIS OF NET INTEREST INCOME Net interest income represents the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets, such as mortgage loans, mortgage backed securities and investment securities, and the expense we pay on interest bearing liabilities, such as time deposits and borrowed funds. Net interest income depends on our volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates we earned or paid on them. Average Balance Sheet. The following table presents certain information regarding our financial condition and net interest income for 2002, 2001 and 2000. The table presents the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities for the periods indicated. We derived the yields and costs by dividing income or expense by the average balance of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities, respectively, for the periods shown. We derived average balances from daily balances over the periods indicated. Interest income includes fees that we considered adjustments to yields. Yields on tax exempt obligations were not computed on a tax equivalent basis.

The following table presents the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected our interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated. Information is provided in each category with respect to: changes attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate); changes attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume); and the net change. The changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to rate. 2002 COMPARED TO 2001 2001 COMPARED TO 2000 INCREASE (DECREASE) DUE TO INCREASE (DECREASE) DUE TO VOLUME RATE NET VOLUME RATE NET (IN THOUSANDS) INTEREST EARNING ASSETS: First mortgage loans, net.............. $ 80,168 $ (21,230) $ 58,938 $ 55,014 $ (1,337) $ 53,677 Consumer and other loans...............

Customer deposits and long term borrowings funded the growth. As a result, our total assets increased $2.72 billion, or 23.8%, to $14.14 billion at December 31, 2002 from $11.42 billion at December 31, 2001. Loans increased $1.00 billion, or 16.8%, to $6.97 billion at December 31, 2002 from $5.97 billion at December 31, 2001. For the year ended December 31, 2002, we originated first mortgage loans of $1.84 billion and purchased first mortgage loans of $1.72 billion, compared with $1.52 billion and $857.6 million, respectively, for the corresponding 2001 period. These first mortgage loan originations and purchases were exclusively in one to four family mortgage loans and were primarily fixed rate loans. At December 31, 2002, fixed rate mortgage loans accounted for 86.5% of our first mortgage loan portfolio compared with 72.2% at December 31, 2001. This percentage of fixed rate loans to total loans may have an adverse impact on our earnings in a rising rate environment as the interest rate on these loans would not reprice as would adjustable rate loans. The increase in loan originations and purchases reflected the low long term market interest rate environment experienced in 2002, which caused increases in loan prepayments and refinancings. The increase in mortgage loan purchases also reflected our internal growth strategy. The loan purchases were made pursuant to our wholesale loan purchase program established to supplement our retail loan originations. The purchasing agreements, as established with each seller/servicer, contain parameters as to the loans that can be included in each package. These parameters, such as maximum loan size and maximum loan to value ratio, conform to parameters utilized by us to originate mortgage loans. Purchased loan packages are subject to internal due diligence procedures that may include review of individual loan files. This review subjects the purchased loan file to substantially the same underwriting standards used in our own loan origination process. Loan packages purchased include mortgage loans secured by properties located primarily in the east coast corridor states between Boston and Washington D.C., and in Michigan and Illinois. In 2002, due to the low long term interest rate environment, approximately $496.8 million of our loan originations were the result of refinancing of our existing mortgage loans. These refinancings of existing loans are included in total loan originations. Last year we began to allow certain customers to modify, for a fee, their existing mortgage loans with the intent of maintaining customer relationships in periods of extensive refinancing due to lower interest rates. In general, all terms and conditions of the existing mortgage loan remain the same except the adjustment of the interest rate to the currently offered fixed rate product with a similar term to maturity or to a reduced term at the request of the borrower. Approximately $866.3 million of existing mortgage loans were modified during the year ended December 31, 2002. This total is not included in total loan originations. Mortgage backed securities increased $1.12 billion, or 22.4%, to $6.13 billion at December 31, 2002 from $5.01 billion at December 31, 2001. This increase includes a $861.2 million increase in mortgage backed securities available for sale. In addition to purchases of mortgage backed securities as part of our internal growth strategy, purchases also increased due to the low market interest rate environment experienced during 2002, which caused increased prepayment activity. Investment securities available for sale increased $393.5 million to $560.9 million at December 31, 2002 from $167.4 million at December 31, 2001. The increase in investment securities primarily reflected the investment of part of the excess cash flows from mortgage related prepayment activity. These increases in interest earning assets reflected our continued emphasis on the origination and purchase of one to four family Page 61 mortgage loans as our primary growth strategy, supplemented by the purchase of mortgage backed securities and investment securities to help manage interest rate risk. Cash and due from banks increased $68.9 million to $153.1 million at December 31, 2002 from $84.2 million at December 31, 2001. Of the cash and due from banks balance at December 31, 2002, $54.5 million was held at the Federal Home Loan Bank. This balance receives interest credits equivalent to the current federal funds overnight borrowing rate. Federal funds sold increased $70.1 million to $87.7 million at December 31, 2002 from $17.6 million at December 31, 2001. These increases in cash and cash equivalents were primarily due to the overall growth in assets, increased levels of cash flows due to mortgage related prepayment activity and excess liquidity received late in the period having been temporarily invested in federal funds sold. FHLB stock increased $56.4 million, or 69.5%, to $137.5 million at December 31, 2002, which was the amount of stock we were required by the FHLB to hold. The growth in accrued interest receivable of $7.4 million to $69.2 million at December 31, 2002 was primarily due to the growth of our interest earning assets. At December 31, 2002, total liabilities were $12.83 billion, an increase of 26.5%, or $2.69 billion, compared with $10.14 billion at December 31, 2001. Borrowed funds increased $1.45 billion, or 67.4%, to $3.60 billion at December 31, 2002 from $2.15 billion at December 31, 2001. The additional borrowed funds were primarily used to fund asset growth consistent with our capital management strategy. Funding asset growth with borrowed funds generated additional earnings through a positive interest rate spread. Borrowed funds were comprised of $1.85 billion of securities sold under agreements to repurchase and $1.75 billion of Federal Home Loan Bank advances. Securities pledged as collateral against our securities sold under agreements to repurchase had a market value at December 31, 2002 of approximately $1.96 billion. Advances from the FHLB utilize our mortgage portfolio as collateral. Our increase in borrowed funds consisted primarily of 10 year terms to maturity with call options starting from 3 to 5 years from the borrowing date. The use of long term borrowed funds has allowed us to better manage our interest rate risk by matching our long term assets with long term liabilities. Borrowing long term in this low interest rate environment should also allow us to better manage interest expense in future periods. Total deposits increased $1.23 billion, or 15.5%, to $9.14 billion at December 31, 2002 from $7.91 billion at December 31, 2001. Interest bearing deposits increased $1.21 billion, or 16.0%, to $8.75 billion at December 31, 2002 from $7.54 billion at December 31, 2001. The increase in interest bearing deposits was primarily due to growth in interest bearing demand accounts of $938.4 million due to the introduction of our interest bearing High Value Checking account. The balance in the High Value Checking account at December 31, 2002 was $943.2 million. In April 2002, we introduced our interest bearing High Value Checking account, which we view as an attractive alternative to cash management accounts offered by brokerage firms. This account offers unlimited checking, on line banking and debit card availability as part of the product, and pays an interest rate generally above market competitive rates. The growth in interest bearing deposits was also due to a $112.3 million, or 21.7% increase in money market deposits to $629.0 million, an $84.0 million, or 1.4%, increase in time deposits to $6.19 billion, and a $78.3 million, or 9.6%, increase in regular savings deposits to $892.7 million at December 31, 2002. Non interest bearing deposits increased $12.8 million, or 3.4%, to $388.5 million at December 31, 2002 from $375.7 million at December 31, 2001. The increase in total deposits was primarily used to fund our planned asset growth. We believe the increase in interest bearing deposits was due primarily to our consistent offering of competitive rates on our deposit products, the introduction of our interest bearing High Value Checking account and an overall decrease in investor confidence in the equity markets. Page 62 Accrued expenses and other liabilities increased $14.6 million, or 19.4%, to $89.9 million at December 31, 2002 from $75.3 million at December 31, 2001 primarily due to an increase in accrued interest payable because of the growth in our borrowed funds and an increase in our accrued income tax payable due to timing of tax payments. Total stockholders equity increased $27.3 million, or 2.1%, to $1.32 billion at December 31, 2002 from $1.29 billion at December 31, 2001. The increase was primarily the result of net income of $192.0 million, an increase of $19.4 million in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, an increase of $9.9 million due to the exercise of 1,410,330 stock options, and an increase of $12.5 million due to the allocation of stock related employee benefit plans. The increase in accumulated other comprehensive income was primarily due to the growth in our portfolio of mortgage backed securities available for sale and increases in the value of our investment securities available for sale. Partially offsetting these increases in stockholders equity were repurchases of 7,754,472 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $140.2 million and cash dividends declared and paid to common stockholders of $64.5 million. As of December 31, 2002, there remained 1,808,796 shares authorized to be purchased under our current stock repurchase program. At December 31, 2002, the ratio of total stockholders equity to total assets was 9.30% compared with 11.28% at December 31, 2001. For the year ended December 31, 2002, the ratio of average stockholders equity to average assets was 10.12% compared with 13.05% for the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease in these ratios was primarily due to our capital management strategy of planned internal asset growth, and a slower percentage growth in stockholders equity as compared to the percentage growth in assets due to payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases. Stockholders equity per common share was $7.22 and $6.87 at December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001, respectively. COMPARISON OF OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001 General. Net income was $192.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, an increase of $57.5 million, or 42.8%, compared with net income of $134.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Basic and diluted earnings per common share were $1.04 and $1.01, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared with basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.69 and $0.68, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2001. For the year ended December 31, 2002 our return on average stockholders equity was 14.84% compared with 10.09% for the year ended December 31, 2001. Our return on average assets for the year ended December 31, 2002 was 1.50% compared with 1.32% for the year ended December 31, 2001. These increases reflected our improved profitability due to increased interest rate spreads that we experienced in the low interest rate environment and our ability to grow our business with low cost interest bearing liabilities. Interest and Dividend Income. Total interest and dividend income increased $93.7 million, or 13.6%, to $784.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared with $690.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase in total interest income was primarily due to the average balance of total interest earning assets increasing $2.50 billion, or 25.0%, to $12.52 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared with $10.02 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001. This increase was due in part to a $1.15 billion, or 22.1%, increase in the average balance of first mortgage loans, net to $6.35 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared with $5.20 billion for 2001. The average balance of mortgage backed securities increased $1.42 billion, or 35.1%, to $5.46 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared with $4.04 billion for 2001. These increases were slightly offset by a decrease in the average balance of investment securities for the year ended December 31, 2002 of $74.3 million, or 19.1%, to $315.2 million from $389.5 million for 2001. The increase in the average Page 63 balance of FHLB stock of $22.2 million reflected the increase in the amount of FHLB stock required to be held by us. The above increases in the average balances of first mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities reflected internal growth that was consistent with our capital management strategy to originate and purchase first mortgage loans as our primary growth strategy, while purchasing mortgage backed securities to supplement loan originations and purchases, and assist in the management of interest rate risk. The growth in the average balance of mortgage backed securities also reflected the investment of excess cash flows, due to the increased prepayment activity on our mortgage related assets, into mortgage backed securities. Although the increase in the average balance of loans was somewhat less than the increase in the average balance of mortgage backed securities, the impact of the loan growth was more significant in terms of interest income because our first mortgage loans are generally higher yielding assets than our mortgage backed securities. The impact on interest income due to the growth in the average balance of interest earning assets, was partially offset by a 63 basis point decrease in the average yield on interest earning assets to 6.26% for the year ended December 31, 2002 from 6.89% for the year ended December 31, 2001. The average yield on first mortgage loans, net decreased 39 basis points to 6.93% for the year ended December 31, 2002 from 7.32% for 2001. The average yield on mortgage backed securities decreased 88 basis points to 5.63% for the year ended December 31, 2002 from 6.51% for 2001. The decrease in the average yield on first mortgage loans reflected the large volume of loan originations, purchases and modifications during the low interest rate environment of 2001 and 2002. The decrease in the average yield on mortgage backed securities reflected the large volume of purchases and the downward repricing of our adjustable rate securities during the low interest rate environment of 2001 and 2002. The larger decrease in the average yield on mortgage backed securities compared with mortgage loans was due to the larger increase in the average balance of mortgage backed securities in this low rate environment and the greater percentage of adjustable rate securities in the mortgage backed security portfolio as compared to our mortgage loan portfolio. If market interest rates remain low, the yield on our mortgage backed securities may continue to adjust downward due to annual rate change limits that are part of the terms of the security, which have limited the extent our adjustable rate securities may have adjusted in prior periods. Interest Expense. Total interest expense, comprised of interest on deposits and interest on borrowed funds, decreased $7.6 million, or 1.9%, to $395.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $403.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, notwithstanding an overall increase in interest bearing liabilities. Interest expense on borrowed funds increased $43.6 million, or 45.2%, to $140.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $96.4 million for 2001. Interest expense on deposits decreased $51.2 million, or 16.7%, to $255.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $307.0 million for 2001. The decrease in total interest expense reflected the impact of a 117 basis point decrease in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities to 3.60% for the year ended December 31, 2002 from 4.77% for 2001. The decrease in interest expense was offset, in part, by an increase in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities of $2.55 billion, or 30.2%, to $11.00 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $8.45 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase in interest expense on borrowed funds was primarily due to a $1.12 billion, or 64.7%, increase in the average balance of borrowed funds to $2.85 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $1.73 billion for 2001. The impact on interest expense on borrowed funds due to the increase in the average balance of borrowed funds was offset, in part, by a 67 basis point decrease in the average cost of borrowed funds to 4.90% for the year ended December 31, 2002 from 5.57% for 2001. Page 64 The growth of borrowed funds has been used to fund internal asset growth consistent with our capital management and growth strategies. The funds borrowed during 2002 had 10 year terms to maturity with call options starting 3 to 5 years from the borrowing date. Although these borrowings generally had higher costs than short term borrowings, the use of long term borrowed funds has allowed us to better manage our interest rate risk by matching long term assets with long term liabilities. Borrowing long term in the prevailing interest rate environment should also allow us to better manage interest expense in future periods. The decrease in the average cost of borrowed funds reflected the continued growth of our borrowed funds in the low interest rate environment that existed during 2001 and 2002 and the restructuring of certain of our borrowed funds to obtain lower interest rates. The $51.2 million decrease in interest expense on deposits was primarily due to a 143 basis point decrease in the average cost of interest bearing deposits to 3.14% for the year ended December 31, 2002 from 4.57% for 2001. The decrease in the average cost of interest bearing deposits was primarily due to a 171 basis point decrease in the average cost of our time deposits to 3.44% for 2002 from 5.15% for 2001. The average cost of regular savings accounts decreased 27 basis points to 1.98% for 2002 and the average cost of money market deposits decreased 34 basis points to 1.97% for 2002. Partially offsetting these decreases, the average cost of interest bearing demand accounts increased 97 basis points to 2.55% for 2002 from 1.58% for 2001 due to the introduction during the second quarter of 2002 of our High Value Checking account. The decrease in the annualized average cost of interest bearing deposits reflected the low interest rate environment experienced during 2001 and 2002. The impact on the average cost of interest bearing liabilities due to possible further decreases in market interest rates may not be as favorable in future periods as short term market rates are currently at historically low levels. The impact on interest expense on deposits due to the decrease in the average cost of interest bearing deposits was offset, in part, by a $1.43 billion, or 21.3%, increase in the average balance of interest bearing deposits to $8.15 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $6.72 billion for 2001. The average balance of time deposits increased $930.0 million, or 17.3%, to $6.31 billion for 2002 from $5.38 billion for 2001. The average balance of interest bearing demand accounts increased $276.6 million to $370.8 million for 2002 from $94.2 million for 2001 due to the introduction of our High Value Checking account in the second quarter of 2002. The average balance of money market accounts increased $128.0 million to $593.0 million for 2002 from $465.0 million for 2001 and the average balance of regular savings accounts increased $93.4 million to $869.8 million for 2002 from $776.4 million for 2001. We believe the increase in the interest bearing deposits was due primarily to our consistent offering of competitive rates on our deposit products, the introduction of our interest bearing High Value Checking account and an overall decrease in investor confidence in the equity markets. Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased $101.3 million, or 35.3%, to $388.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared with $287.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. This increase primarily reflected our planned balance sheet growth, which resulted in increases in the average balance of both interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, and the improved net interest rate spread earned on this growth. Our net interest rate spread, the difference between the average yield on total interest earning assets and the average cost of total interest bearing liabilities, increased 54 basis points to 2.66% for the year ended December 31, 2002 from 2.12% for 2001. Our net interest margin, represented by net interest income divided by average total interest earning assets, increased 23 basis points to 3.10% for the year December 31, 2002 from 2.87% for 2001. These increases reflected our improved profitability due to the declining interest rate environment experienced during 2001 and 2002, the fact that our interest bearing liabilities repriced faster than our interest earning assets in the declining interest rate environment and our ability to grow our business with Page 65 low cost interest bearing liabilities during this period. The larger increase in our net interest spread compared with the increase in our net interest margin reflected the use of investable funds to purchase treasury stock. However, during 2002, long term interest rates generally declined, while short term interest rates remained relatively stable, thus narrowing the yield curve. The narrower yield curve and the increased prepayment activity on our mortgage related assets, due to the historically low market interest rates, may have a negative impact on our net interest income, net interest rate spread and net interest margin in future periods. Provision for Loan Losses. Our provision for loan losses for the year December 31, 2002 was $1.5 million, a decrease of $0.4 million, or 21.1%, compared with $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Net charge offs for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $9,000 compared with net charge offs of $9,000 for 2001. The decrease in the provision reflected our recent low charge off history given the relative stability of the housing market. The allowance for loan losses increased $1.5 million, or 6.3%, to $25.5 million at December 31, 2002 from $24.0 million at December 31, 2001. The increase in the allowance for loan losses, through the provision for loan losses, reflected the overall growth of the loan portfolio and the level of delinquent and non performing loans. Non performing loans, defined as non accruing loans and accruing loans delinquent 90 days or more, increased $4.6 million, or 29.5%, to $20.2 million at December 31, 2002 from $15.6 million at December 31, 2001. The increase in the dollar amount of our non performing loans, which was primarily due to an increase of our non performing purchased FHA/VA loan portfolio of $4.5 million, was due to the slow economic conditions during 2002, characterized by higher unemployment. The ratio of non performing loans to total loans was 0.29% at December 31, 2002 compared with 0.26% at December 31, 2001. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans was 126.27% at December 31, 2002 compared with 153.44% at December 31, 2001. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans was 0.37% at December 31, 2002 compared with 0.40% at December 31, 2001. Although we believe that we have established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at adequate levels, additions may be necessary if future economic and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment. Although we use the best information available, the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate that is subject to significant judgment and short term change. See "Critical Accounting Policies." Non Interest Income. Total non interest income, consisting generally of service charges and fees on customer accounts, was $8.0 million and $4.7 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001. The increase in service fees and other income of $1.2 million was primarily due to a $760,000 gain on the sale of a commercial property not deemed to be a strategic part of our business plan. The $2.1 million gain on securities transactions, net, which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2002, resulted from an opportunity to restructure certain assets and liabilities to allow us to be better positioned for future changes in interest rates. The cash flow of $88.7 million from the sale of the securities was reinvested in higher yielding securities at a slightly longer duration. To match this duration extension, we restructured certain of our borrowed funds to extend their maturity and lower the contract rate. Non Interest Expense. Total non interest expense increased $11.7 million, or 14.3%, to $93.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $81.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase was primarily due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits of $8.4 million, or 16.1%, to $60.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $52.3 million for 2001. The increase in salaries and employee benefits reflected routine salary increases, senior level promotions, increases in stock related compensation expense and increases in pension expense. The expense of certain of the Page 66 stock related plans is based on the average market price of our common stock in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Position 93 6, "Employer Accounting for Employee Stock Ownership Plans." The increase in our stock price has resulted in a $3.7 million increase in stock related compensation expense. Other expenses increased $3.2 million, or 24.4%, to $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared with $13.1 million for 2001. This increase was due, in part, to expenses related to new marketing initiatives and accelerated recognition of stock related expense due to the passing of one of our directors. Our efficiency ratio, determined by dividing non interest expense by the sum of net interest income and non interest income, excluding net gains on securities transactions, was 23.72% for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared with 28.04% for the year ended December 31, 2001. Our ratio of non interest expense to average assets for the year ended December 31, 2002 was 0.73% compared with 0.80% for the year ended December 31, 2001. Income Taxes. Income tax expense increased $35.9 million, or 48.8%, to $109.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $73.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. This increase was primarily due to the $93.3 million, or 44.8% increase in income before income tax expense and changes to the New Jersey corporate business tax code. In July 2002, the New Jersey State Legislature passed the Business Tax Reform Act. This new legislation, which was retroactive to January 1, 2002, has increased our annual effective tax rate to approximately 36.5%. The overall change in income tax expense, due to the new state tax structure, was approximately $2.9 million. Our effective tax rate for 2002 was 36.29% compared with 35.33% for 2001. COMPARISON OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AT DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND DECEMBER 31, 2000 Our total assets increased $2.05 billion, or 21.9%, to $11.43 billion at December 31, 2001 from $9.38 billion at December 31, 2000. This increase was generally reflected in increases in mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities, partially offset by decreases in investment securities. Loans increased $1.10 billion, or 22.6%, to $5.97 billion at December 31, 2001 from $4.87 billion at December 31, 2000. For the year ended December 31, 2001, we originated and purchased first mortgage loans of approximately $1.52 billion and $857.6 million, respectively, compared with $895.1 million and $110.7 million, respectively, for the corresponding 2000 period. These originations and purchases were concentrated in one to four family residential mortgage loans. The increase in loan originations, a part of our growth strategy, was also due to the lower market interest rate environment during 2001 that caused an increase in prepayments and refinancings. To supplement our loan originations we began, late in 2000, to purchase a higher volume of first mortgage loans than were purchased in previous periods. See "Business of Hudson City Savings Bank Lending Activities Residential Mortgage Lending" for a discussion of loan purchases. We also originated for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, home equity loans of approximately $62.0 million and $71.4 million, respectively. Mortgage backed securities increased $1.75 billion, or 53.6%, to $5.01 billion at December 31, 2001 from $3.26 billion at December 31, 2000. Investment securities available for sale decreased $709.2 million, or 80.9%, to $167.5 million at December 31, 2001 from $876.7 million at December 31, 2000. The increase in mortgage backed securities, a part of our growth strategy, was also due to the reinvestment of $855.7 million of calls of investment securities into adjustable rate or higher yielding fixed rate mortgage backed securities during 2001. The large amount of calls of investment securities was due to the lower interest rate environment that existed during 2001. These increases in interest earning assets continue to reflect our emphasis on the origination and purchase of one to four family Page 67 mortgage loans supplemented by the purchase of mortgage backed securities as part of our growth strategy. We began classifying certain mortgage backed security purchases as available for sale during 2001 to maintain internal liquidity requirements. Federal funds sold decreased $104.1 million, or 85.5%, to $17.6 million at December 31, 2001 from $121.7 million at December 31, 2000. The higher levels of federal funds sold at December 31, 2000 resulted from calls of investment securities, the proceeds from which had not yet been fully invested at year end. FHLB stock increased $7.5 million to $81.1 million at December 31, 2001, which was the amount of stock we were required to hold. At December 31, 2001, total liabilities were $10.14 billion, an increase of 28.0%, or $2.22 billion, compared with $7.92 billion at December 31, 2000. Borrowed funds increased $900.0 million, or 72.0%, to $2.15 billion at December 31, 2001 from $1.25 billion at December 31, 2000. Borrowed funds at December 31, 2001 were comprised of $1.55 billion of securities sold under agreements to repurchase and $600.0 million of FHLB advances. Advances from the FHLB utilize our mortgage portfolio as collateral. The increase in borrowed funds was primarily used to fund asset growth consistent with our capital management strategy. Funding asset growth with borrowed funds generated additional earnings through a positive interest rate spread. Total deposits increased $1.31 billion, or 19.8%, to $7.91 billion at December 31, 2001 from $6.60 billion at December 31, 2000. Interest bearing deposits increased $1.27 billion, or 20.3%, to $7.54 billion at December 31, 2001 from $6.27 billion at December 31, 2000. The increase in interest bearing deposits was primarily due to a $1.13 billion, or 22.7%, increase in time deposits to $6.10 billion at December 31, 2001 from $4.97 billion at December 31, 2000. Noninterest bearing deposits increased $43.5 million, or 13.1%, to $375.7 million at December 31, 2001 from $332.2 million at December 31, 2000. The increase in total deposits was primarily used to fund asset growth consistent with our capital management strategy. We believe the increase in interest bearing deposits was due in part to the volatility in the equity markets, our offering competitive rates on our time deposit products, and deposit movement among financial institutions due to consolidation within our industry. Accrued expenses and other liabilities increased $13.6 million, or 22.0%, to $75.3 million at December 31, 2001 from $61.7 million at December 31, 2000. This increase was primarily due to an increase in accrued interest payable because of the growth of our borrowed funds and an increase in accrued expenses related to certain employee benefit plans, primarily postretirement benefits. Total stockholders equity decreased $175.8 million, or 12.0%, to $1.29 billion at December 31, 2001 from $1.46 billion at December 31, 2000. Hudson City repurchased 25,966,800 dividend adjusted shares of our common stock during 2001, which decreased stockholders equity by $278.5 million. As of December 31, 2001, there were 9,563,268 dividend adjusted shares authorized to be purchased under our current stock repurchase program. Offsetting the effect of repurchases on stockholders equity was net income of $134.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, of $7.9 million. This increase was due to increases in the market values of our investment securities available for sale due to the lower interest rate environment. Stockholders equity was also decreased during 2001 by the declarations of cash dividends to common stockholders totaling $46.5 million and the purchase of 374,836 dividend adjusted shares of common stock for the recognition and retention plans at an aggregate cost of $4.2 million. The exercise of 285,600 dividend adjusted options during 2001 increased stockholders equity by $2.0 million. At December 31, 2001, the ratio of total stockholders equity to total assets was 11.28% compared with 15.61% at December 31, 2000. For the year ended December 31, 2001, the ratio of average Page 68 stockholders equity to average assets was 13.05% compared with 16.35% for the year ended December 31, 2000. Stockholders equity per common share was $6.87 at December 31, 2001 compared with $6.89 at December 31, 2000. The decrease in these ratios was primarily due to the decrease in stockholders equity and the growth in assets as discussed above. COMPARISON OF OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND 2000 General. Net income was $134.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, an increase of $19.7 million, or 17.2%, from net income of $114.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Basic and diluted earnings per common share were $0.69 and $0.68, respectively, for 2001 compared with basic and diluted earnings per common share of $0.52 for 2000. Our return on average stockholders equity and return on average assets for 2001 was 10.09% and 1.32%, respectively, compared with 7.87% and 1.29%, respectively, for 2000. The increase in the return on average stockholders equity reflected the growth in net income and the decrease in stockholders equity. Interest and Dividend Income. Total interest and dividend income increased $76.5 million, or 12.5%, to $690.5 million for year ended December 31, 2001 compared with $614.0 million for the corresponding 2000 period. The increase in total interest and dividend income was primarily due to the average balance of total interest earning assets increasing $1.25 billion, or 14.3%, to $10.02 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared with $8.77 billion for the year ended December 31, 2000. The average balance of first mortgage loans, net increased $748.5 million, or 16.8%, to $5.20 billion for 2001 compared with $4.46 billion for 2000. The average balance of consumer and other loans increased $23.2 million, or 17.7%, to $154.0 million for 2001 compared with $130.8 million for 2000. The average balance of mortgage backed securities increased $839.2 million, or 26.2%, to $4.04 billion for 2001 compared with $3.20 billion for 2000. These increases were offset in part by a decrease in the average balance of investment securities for 2001 of $492.7 million, or 55.8%, to $389.5 million from $882.2 million for 2000. The average balance of Federal funds sold increased $73.1 million, or 90.9%, to $153.5 million for 2001 compared with $80.4 million for 2000. The average balance of FHLB stock increased $55.4 million to $79.4 million for 2001 from $24.0 million for 2000. The above increases in the average balances of interest earning assets reflected internal growth that was consistent with our capital management strategy to originate and purchase first mortgage loans and consumer and other loans, while purchasing mortgage backed securities to supplement loan originations and manage interest rate risk. The increase in the average balance of first mortgage loans also reflected the program we established late in 2000 to supplement our loan originations by purchasing a higher volume of first mortgage loans than in previous periods. The growth in the average balance of mortgage backed securities and the decline in the average balance of investment securities reflected the calls of investment securities during 2001 due to the lower interest rate environment. The growth in the average balance of mortgage backed securities was also due to the investment of other funds in mortage backed securities as part of our capital management strategy. The increase in the average balance of federal funds sold reflected the initial investment of the proceeds of the calls of investment securities, and the initial investment of the large volume of mortgage loan and mortgage backed security prepayments. These funds were subsequently invested in adjustable rate or higher yielding fixed rate mortgage backed securities or mortgage loans. The increase in the average balance of FHLB stock reflected the increase in the amount of FHLB stock required to be held by us based on our asset size. The increase in interest income due to the growth of average total interest earning assets was partially offset by an 11 basis point decrease in the average yield on interest earning assets to 6.89% for year ended December 31, 2001 compared with 7.00% for the year ended December 31, 2000. The average yield on first mortgage loans, net, decreased 3 basis points to 7.32% for 2001 compared with Page 69 7.35% for 2000. The average yield on mortgage backed securities decreased 20 basis points to 6.51% for 2001 compared with 6.71% for 2000. The slight decrease in the average yield on first mortgage loans, net, reflected the relative stability of our offered mortgage interest rates, which are based on long term market rates, in the lower short term interest rate environment during 2001. The decrease in the average yield on mortgage backed securities reflected the repricing of our variable rate mortgage backed securities in the lower interest rate environment. The decrease in the average yield on mortgage backed securities also reflected the large volume of purchases made in the lower rate environment due to the calls of investment securities and the large prepayment volume on our mortgage backed security portfolio. Interest Expense. Total interest expense increased $43.4 million, or 12.1%, to $403.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared with $360.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Interest expense on borrowed funds increased $46.9 million, or 94.7%, to $96.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared with $49.5 million for the corresponding 2000 period. Interest expense on deposits decreased $3.5 million, or 1.1%, to $307.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared with $310.5 million for the corresponding 2000 period. The increase in total interest expense was attributable to an increase in the average balance of total interest bearing liabilities of $1.38 billion, or 19.5%, to $8.45 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared with $7.07 billion for the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase in the average balance of total interest bearing liabilities primarily resulted from an increase in the average balance of borrowed funds of $934.0 million, or 117.0%, to $1.73 billion for 2001 compared with $798.0 million for 2000. The use of borrowed funds has accelerated over the past year to fund asset growth. The increase also reflected our decision to assist in managing our interest rate risk by using long term borrowings to match our long term assets. The average balance of interest bearing deposits increased $443.6 million, or 7.1%, to $6.72 billion for 2001 compared with $6.27 billion for 2000. The increase in the average balance of interest bearing deposits was attributable to an increase in the average balance of time deposits of $449.4 million, or 9.1%, to $5.38 billion for 2001 compared with $4.93 billion for 2000. We believe the overall increase in total interest bearing deposits was due in part to the volatility in the equity markets, our offering competitive rates on our time deposit products and deposit movement among financial institutions due to consolidation within our industry. The increase in interest expense due to the growth of total interest bearing liabilities was partially offset by a 32 basis point decrease in the average cost of total interest bearing liabilities to 4.77% for the year ended December 31, 2001 from 5.09% for the year ended December 31, 2000. The average cost of total interest bearing deposits decreased 38 basis points to 4.57% for 2001 compared with 4.95% for 2000. Within the interest bearing deposit mix, the average cost of time deposits decreased 48 basis points to 5.15% for 2001 compared with 5.63% for 2000. The decrease in the average cost of interest bearing deposits reflected the lower market interest rate environment in 2001. The average cost of borrowed funds decreased 64 basis points to 5.57% for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared with 6.21% for the corresponding 2000 period. The decrease in the average cost of borrowed funds reflected the continued growth in borrowings during the lower interest rate environment of 2001, and the maturing and refunding in 2001 of higher costing short term borrowings originated in 2000. The decreases in the average costs of the individual components of interest bearing liabilities reflected the lower interest rate environment experienced during 2001. However, the lower basis point decrease in the overall cost of total average interest bearing liabilities, Page 70 when compared to the individual components, reflected the larger percentage of borrowed funds in our interest bearing liability mix. These borrowed funds had higher costs than our existing deposit portfolio. Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased $33.1 million, or 13.0%, to $287.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared with $254.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. This increase primarily reflected increases in the average balance of both interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, and the net interest rate spread earned on this growth. Our net interest rate spread, the difference between the average yield on average total interest earning assets and the average cost of average total interest bearing liabilities, increased 21 basis points to 2.12% for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared with 1.91% for the corresponding 2000 period. The increase in the net interest spread was primarily due to the lower interest rate environment experienced during 2001 and the fact that our interest bearing liabilities repriced faster than our interest earning assets. Our net interest margin, represented by net interest income divided by average total interest earning assets, decreased 3 basis points to 2.87% for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared with 2.90% for the corresponding 2000 period. The decrease in the net interest margin reflected the fact that the average balance of our interest bearing liabilities grew at a higher rate than the average balance of our interest earning assets. This was due, in part, to the use of funds, which could have been otherwise invested, to purchase our common stock. This use of funds caused our net interest income to grow at a lesser rate than did our average interest earning assets. Provision for Loan Losses. Our provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $1.9 million, a decrease of $0.2 million, or 9.5%, compared with $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Net loan charge offs for 2001 were $9,000 compared with net recoveries of $4,000 during 2000. As a result, the allowance for loan losses increased $1.9 million, or 8.6%, to $24.0 million at December 31, 2001 from $22.1 million at December 31, 2000. The increase in the allowance for loan losses to its current level, through the continued provision for loan losses, reflected the overall growth of the loan portfolio, the level of delinquent and non performing loans and real estate market conditions during 2001. Non performing loans, defined as non accruing loans and accruing loans delinquent 90 days or more, increased $2.6 million, or 20.0%, to $15.6 million at December 31, 2001 from $13.0 million at December 31, 2000, primarily due to the continued growth in the loan portfolio and the slow economic conditions in 2001. Although non performing loans increased during 2001, the ratio of non performing loans to total loans decreased to 0.26% at December 31, 2001 compared with 0.27% at December 31, 2000. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans was 153.4% at December 31, 2001 compared with 170.7% at December 31, 2000. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans was 0.40% at December 31, 2001 compared with 0.45% at December 31, 2000. Non Interest Income. Total non interest income, consisting primarily of service fees, was $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared with $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Non Interest Expense. Total non interest expense increased $2.8 million, or 3.5%, to $81.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared with $79.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase was primarily due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits of $2.4 million, or 4.8%, to $52.3 million for 2001 compared with $49.9 million for 2000. The increase in salaries and employee benefits reflected routine salary increases and included additional expense of our ESOP which is based on the market price of our common stock in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Position 93 6, "Employer Accounting for Employee Stock Ownership Plans." Page 71 Our efficiency ratio, determined by dividing non interest expense by the sum of net interest income and non interest income, excluding net gains on securities transactions, was 28.0% for 2001 compared with 30.6% for 2000. Our ratio of non interest expense to average assets for 2001 was 0.80% compared with 0.89% for 2000. The decrease in these ratios reflected our efforts to control non interest expense while growing assets consistent with our capital management strategy. Income Taxes. Income tax expense increased $10.9 million, or 17.4%, to $73.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared with $62.6 million for year ended December 31, 2000. The increase in income tax expense was due to the increase in income before income tax expense. Our effective tax rate for 2001 and 2000 was 35.3%. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The term "liquidity" refers to our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to fund loan originations, loan purchases, deposit withdrawals and operating expenses. Our primary sources of funds are scheduled amortization and prepayments of loan principal and mortgage backed securities, deposits, borrowed funds, maturities and calls of investment securities and funds provided by our operations. Our membership in the FHLB provides us access to additional sources of borrowed funds, which is generally limited to twenty times the amount of FHLB stock owned. Scheduled loan repayments and maturing investment securities are a relatively predictable source of funds. However, deposit flows, calls of investment securities and borrowed funds, and prepayments of loans and mortgage backed securities are strongly influenced by interest rates, general and local economic conditions and competition in the marketplace. These factors reduce the predictability of the timing of these sources of funds. As mortgage interest rates decline, customer prepayment activity tends to accelerate causing an increase in cash flow from both our mortgage loan and mortgage backed security portfolios. If our pricing is competitive, the demand for mortgage originations also accelerates. When mortgage rates increase, the opposite effect tends to occur and our loan origination and purchase activity becomes increasingly dependent on the strength of our residential real estate market, home purchase and new construction activity. Principal repayments on loans were $2.63 billion during 2002 compared with $1.35 billion for 2001. Principal payments received on mortgage backed securities totaled $2.38 billion during 2002 compared to $1.62 billion during 2001. The increase in payments on loans and mortgage backed securities reflected the low market interest rate environment during 2001 and 2002, which caused an increase in prepayment activity when compared with the prior period. The increase also reflected the growth in those portfolios, thus a larger base from which to receive payments. Maturities and calls of investment securities totaled $203.4 million during 2002 compared with maturities and calls of $855.7 million during 2001. The higher amount of calls during 2001 was due to the declining interest rate environment that began early in 2001 and the larger balance of callable investment securities held at the beginning of 2001 compared with the amount of callable investment securities held at the beginning of 2002. For the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, we borrowed funds of $1.45 billion and $1.55 billion, respectively. The $1.45 billion of new long term borrowed funds in 2002 consisted primarily of borrowings with 10 year terms to maturity with call options starting from 3 to 5 years from the borrowing date. There were no principal payments on borrowed funds during 2002, but there were $650.0 million of principal payments during 2001. Page 72 The $1.45 billion increase in borrowed funds during 2002 funded planned internal asset growth and generated additional earnings through a positive interest rate spread. The use of long term borrowed funds has allowed us to better manage our interest rate risk by matching long term assets with long term liabilities. Borrowing long term funds in this low interest rate environment should also allow us to better control interest expense in future periods. At December 31, 2002, there were $50.0 million of borrowed funds scheduled to mature within one year. Total deposits increased $1.23 billion during 2002 compared with an increase of $1.31 billion during 2001. Deposit flows are affected by the level of market interest rates, the interest rates and products offered by competitors, the volatility of equity markets, and other factors. We believe the increase in interest bearing deposits was due primarily to our consistent offering of competitive rates on our deposit products, the introduction of our interest bearing High Value Checking account and an overall decrease in investor confidence in the equity markets. Time deposit accounts scheduled to mature within one year were $5.12 billion at December 31, 2002. Based on our deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy, we anticipate that a significant portion of these time deposits will remain with Hudson City Savings. We are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position; therefore, we monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. Our primary investing activities are the origination and purchase of one to four family real estate loans and consumer and other loans, the purchase of mortgage backed securities, and to a lesser extent, the purchase of investment securities. We originated and purchased total loans of approximately $1.91 billion and $1.72 billion, respectively, during 2002 compared with $1.59 billion and $857.6 million, respectively, during 2001. The increase was primarily due to planned balance sheet growth and the low market interest rate environment during 2001 and 2002, which caused an increase in prepayment and loan refinancing activity. Additionally, to supplement our loan originations, we purchased a higher volume of first mortgage loans than in previous periods. Purchases of mortgage backed securities during 2002 were $3.57 billion compared with $3.36 billion during 2001. Of the mortgage backed securities purchased in 2002, $1.44 billion were real estate mortgage investment conduits ("REMIC") compared with $2.17 billion purchased in 2001. The REMIC purchases in 2002 and 2001 had fixed interest rates and generally had shorter average lives compared with alternate mortgage backed security investments available at the time of purchase. Generally, these purchases experienced faster prepayment speeds during 2002 than other mortgage backed securities. The volume of purchases of mortgage backed securities was related to the increase in prepayment activity due to the low market interest rate environment during 2001 and 2002 and the internal growth strategies employed by us during these periods. During 2002, we purchased $598.5 million of investment securities compared with purchases of $140.4 million during 2001. These purchases were made with excess cash flows from payments on our mortgage related assets. As part of the membership requirements of the FHLB, we are required to purchase a certain dollar amount of FHLB common stock. During 2002, we purchased $56.4 million of FHLB common stock compared with purchases of $7.5 million during 2001. The purchases in 2002 bring our total investment in FHLB stock to $137.5 million, the amount we are currently required to hold. On April 16, 2002, a 100 percent stock dividend was declared, having the effect of a two for one stock split. Stockholders of record on May 24, 2002 received one additional share of common stock for every share of common stock held on that date. The stock dividend was paid on June 17, 2002. The effect of the 100% stock dividend has been retroactively reflected in the presentation of this document. Page 73 During 2002, our recognition and retention plan purchased 100,580 dividend adjusted shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $1.9 million. 167,900 shares were awarded to plan participants during 2002. As of December 31, 2002 we had 65,316 shares purchased and unallocated for the recognition and retention plan. Under our stock repurchase programs, shares of Hudson City Bancorp common stock may be purchased in the open market and through other privately negotiated transactions, from time to time, depending on market conditions. The repurchased shares are held as treasury stock for general corporate use. During 2002, we purchased 7,754,472 dividend adjusted shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $140.2 million. During 2001, we purchased 25,966,800 dividend adjusted shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $278.5 million. At December 31, 2002, there were 1,808,796 shares remaining to be repurchased under the existing stock repurchase program. At December 31, 2002, Hudson City Savings had outstanding loan commitments to borrowers of approximately $213.0 million, commitments to purchase loans of approximately $261.6 million, commitments to purchase mortgage backed securities of $263.2 million and available home equity and overdraft lines of credit of approximately $83.3 million. We anticipate we will have sufficient funds available to meet our current commitments in the normal course of business. Cash dividends declared and paid during 2002 were $64.5 million compared with $46.5 million during 2001. The dividend pay out ratio for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 was 33.17% and 34.06%, respectively. On January 14, 2003, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of eleven cents ($0.11) per common share. The dividend was paid on March 3, 2003 to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 7, 2003. We opened one new branch during 2002 in Midland Park, NJ. We also purchased, for future use, an office building near our corporate headquarters at a cost of approximately $2.8 million. We do not anticipate any other material capital expenditures nor do we have any balloon or other payments due on any long term obligations or any significant off balance sheet items other than the commitments and unused lines of credit noted above. At December 31, 2002, Hudson City Bancorp and Hudson City Savings exceeded all regulatory capital requirements. Hudson City Bancorps leverage capital ratio, tier 1 risk based capital ratio and total risk based capital ratio were 9.48%, 28.11% and 28.67%, respectively. Hudson City Savings leverage capital ratio, tier 1 risk based capital ratio and total risk based capital ratio were 8.85%, 26.26% and 26.81%, respectively. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In April 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections." This Statement rescinds FASB No. 4, "Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt," and an amendment of that Statement, SFAS No. 64, "Extinguishments of Debt Made to Satisfy Sinking Fund Requirements." This Statement also rescinds SFAS No. 44, "Accounting for Intangible Assets of Motor Carriers." This Statement amends SFAS No. 13, "Accounting for Leases," to eliminate an inconsistency between the required accounting for sale leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions. This Statement also amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections, clarify meanings, or Page 74 describe their applicability under change conditions. SFAS No. 145 is effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. Management does not anticipate that the initial adoption of SFAS No. 145 will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities." This Statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 94 3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)." This Statement is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. In October 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 147, "Acquisitions of Certain Financial Institutions an amendment of FASB Statements No. 72 and 144 and FASB Interpretation No 9." This Statement removes acquisitions of financial institutions from the scope of both SFAS No. 72 and Interpretation 9 and requires that those transactions be accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations," and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." The provisions of SFAS No. 147 that relate to the application of the purchase method of accounting apply to all acquisitions of financial institutions, except transactions between two or more mutual enterprises. SFAS No. 147 clarifies that a branch acquisition that meets the definition of a business should be accounted for as a business combination, otherwise the transaction should be accounted for as an acquisition of net assets that does not result in the recognition of goodwill. The provisions of SFAS No. 147 are effective October 1, 2002. This Statement did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December, 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, Transition and Disclosure." SFAS No. 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. SFAS No. 148 also requires that disclosures of the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation be displayed more prominently and in a tabular format. Additionally, SFAS No. 148 requires disclosure of the pro forma effect in interim financial statements. The additional disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 148 are effective for fiscal years ended after December 15, 2002. We have adopted the expanded disclosure provisions of this statement effective December 31, 2002. IMPACT OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES The Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Hudson City Bancorp have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). GAAP generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations. Unlike industrial companies, our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature. As a result, changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than do the effects of inflation. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Note 1 to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2002, included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," of this Annual Report on Form 10 K Page 75 for the year ended December 31, 2002, contains a summary of our significant accounting policies. We believe our policies with respect to the methodology for our determination of the allowance for loan losses and asset impairment judgments, including other than temporary declines in the value of our securities, involve a higher degree of complexity and require management to make difficult and subjective judgments which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters. Changes in these judgments, assumptions or estimates could cause reported results to differ materially. These critical policies and their application are periodically reviewed with the Audit Committee and our Board of Directors. Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses has been determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, under which we are required to maintain adequate allowances for loan losses. We are responsible for the timely and periodic determination of the amount of the allowance required. We believe that our allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover specifically identifiable loan losses, as well as estimated losses inherent in our portfolio for which certain losses are probable but not specifically identifiable. As part of our evaluation of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses, each month we prepare a worksheet. This worksheet categorizes the entire loan portfolio by certain risk characteristics such as loan type (one to four family, multi family, etc.) and payment status (i.e., current or number of days delinquent). Loans with known potential losses are categorized separately. We assign potential loss factors to the payment status categories on the basis of our assessment of the potential risk inherent in each loan type. We use this worksheet, together with loan portfolio balances and delinquency reports, to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Other key factors we consider in this process are current real estate market conditions, changes in the trend of non performing loans, the current state of the local and national economy and loan portfolio growth. We maintain the allowance for loan losses through provisions for loan losses that we charge to income. We charge losses on loans against the allowance for loan losses when we believe the collection of loan principal is unlikely. We establish the provision for loan losses after considering the results of our review of delinquency and charge off trends, the allowance for loan loss worksheet, the amount of the allowance for loan losses in relation to the total loan balance, loan portfolio growth, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and regulatory guidance. We have applied this process consistently and we have made minimal changes in the estimation methods and assumptions that we have used. Our primary lending emphasis is the origination of one to four family first mortgage loans on residential properties and, to a lesser extent, second mortgage loans on one to four family residential properties. As a result of our lending emphasis, we had a loan concentration in residential first mortgage loans at December 31, 2002, the majority of which are secured by real property located in New Jersey. Based on the composition of our loan portfolio and the growth in our loan portfolio, we believe the primary risks inherent in our portfolio are possible increases in interest rates, a further decline in the economy, generally, and a possible decline in real estate market values. Any one or a combination of these events may adversely affect our loan portfolio resulting in increased delinquencies, loan losses and future levels of provisions. We have maintained our provision for loan losses at the current level to primarily address the actual growth in our loan portfolio. Although we believe that we have established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at adequate levels, additions may be necessary if future economic and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment. Although management uses the best information available, the Page 76 level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate that is subject to significant judgment and short term change. See "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 Provision for Loan Losses." Asset Impairment Judgments. Certain of our assets are carried in our consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or at the lower of cost or fair value. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to recognize impairment of such assets. We periodically perform analyses to test for impairment of various assets. In addition to our impairment analyses related to loans discussed above, another significant impairment analysis relates to the value of other than temporary declines in the value of our securities. Our available for sale portfolio is carried at estimated fair value, with any unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity. The securities which we have the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and are carried at amortized cost. We conduct a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if the value of any security has declined below its carrying value and whether such decline is other than temporary. If such decline is deemed other than temporary, we would adjust the carrying amount of the security through a valuation allowance. The market values of our securities are significantly affected by changes in interest rates. In general, as interest rates rise, the market value of fixed rate securities will decrease; as interest rates fall, the market value of fixed rate securities will increase. Estimated fair values for securities are based on published or securities dealers market values. ITEM 7a. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
