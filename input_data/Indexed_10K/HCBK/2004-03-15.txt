Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Hudson City Bancorps Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, and the other statistical data provided elsewhere in this document. Executive Summary Our results of operations depend primarily on net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets, primarily mortgage loans, mortgage backed securities and investment securities, and the interest we pay on our interest bearing liabilities, primarily time deposits, interest bearing demand deposits and borrowed funds. Our results of operations may also be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions, particularly those with respect to changes in market interest rates, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. Our results are also affected by the price of our stock, as the expense of certain of our employee stock compensation plans are related to the current price of our common stock. We experienced a historically low interest rate environment during 2003. Market interest rates, which began to decline in 2001, continued to decrease during the first six months of 2003. In particular, long term interest rates decreased while short term interest rates remained relatively stable. This environment had an adverse impact on our earnings as the rates on our interest earning assets are generally based upon long term interest rates while the rates paid on our interest bearing liabilities are generally based upon short term rates. During the third quarter of 2003 there was a modest increase in long term interest rates, which, combined with the subsequent positive economic news, stabilized the interest rate environment, though we did experience a modest decrease in long term rates during January 2004. This stabilized rate environment and increase in long term interest rates helped improve our net interest rate margin and net interest rate spread in the fourth quarter of 2003 when compared to the prior quarters reported in 2003. If rates remain stable or long term interest rates increase, we believe the resulting situation could have a positive impact on our earnings, net interest margin and net interest spread in 2004. The low long term interest rate environment caused an acceleration of prepayment activity on our mortgage backed securities, and caused an acceleration of prepayment, refinancing and modification activity on our mortgage loans during the first nine months of 2003. The higher level of prepayment activity subsequently caused an acceleration of the amortization of the net premium on these mortgage related assets, which had an adverse impact on our net interest income. The reinvestment of the proceeds from the accelerated prepayment activity at the prevailing lower interest rates and the decreased interest rates on our mortgage loans that were refinanced or modified contributed to the narrowing of our interest rate spread and net interest margin, and a reduction in the growth of our net interest income. The modest increase in long term interest rates during the third quarter of 2003 caused a slowing of the prepayment, refinancing and modification activity on these assets during the fourth quarter of 2003. If the prepayment, refinancing and modification activity remains stable or continues to decline in 2004, and the amortization of the net premium on our mortgage related assets also declines, we believe the resulting situation could have a positive impact on our earnings, net interest margin and net interest spread in 2004 This same low interest rate environment also afforded us the opportunity to realize gains on certain of our mortgage backed and investment securities prior to interest rate changes, such as the long term rate increase seen in July 2003, which would have adversely affected their fair market value. The low market interest rates caused increases in the fair market value of the variable rate portion of our mortgage backed Page 47 Table of Contents securities portfolio, as these variable rate securities had annual rate change limits. The cash flows from the sales of these securities were reinvested in fixed rate securities. During 2003, we continued to grow our balance sheet consistent with the capital management and growth strategies we employed during recent periods. Our balance sheet growth, primarily due to increases in fixed rate callable government sponsored agency securities and first mortgage loans, was funded principally by customer deposits and borrowed funds. The growth in our core investment of residential first mortgage loans was due to our continued strong levels of loan originations and loan purchases, despite their high level of prepayment activity. The growth in customer deposits was primarily due to the continued success of our interest bearing High Value Checking account. Borrowed funds were increased to meet the goals of our growth strategies and to take advantage of the current low interest rate environment. During 2003, these initiatives helped us to increase our core investments in mortgage loans by 26.3%, increase our customer deposits by 14.3% and grow our total assets by 20.4%, or $2.89 billion. It was because of our ability to grow our business with low cost interest bearing liabilities that we were able to increase our net interest income during 2003. We expect to continue to grow through internal expansion primarily through the origination and purchase of mortgage loans, while purchasing mortgage backed securities and investment securities as a supplement to our mortgage loans. The primary funding for our growth is expected to come from customer deposits, using borrowed funds to supplement our deposit initiatives as a funding source. We intend to grow customer deposits by continuing to offer desirable products at competitive rates and by opening new branch offices. We have currently received approval for the opening of four new offices, including one in Suffolk County, New York, and intend to file for regulatory approval for at least five more during 2004. The conversion to a federal charter gives us greater flexibility to expand our branch network into markets outside New Jersey. In the fourth quarter of 2003, Hudson City Savings applied for and was granted approval to convert from a New Jersey chartered savings bank to a federally chartered savings bank. The conversion to a federal charter was effective January 1, 2004. Under this new charter, Hudson City Savings, Hudson City Bancorp and Hudson City, MHC will be subject to supervision and examination by the Office of Thrift Supervision, or OTS. In the first quarter of 2004, we applied for and were granted approval to waive dividends payments to Hudson City, MHC, the holding company of Hudson City Bancorp. This dividend waiver will provide additional operating capital at Hudson City Bancorp. Management of Interest Rate Risk As a financial institution, our primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility. Net interest income is the primary component of our net income, and fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact the level of both income and expense recorded on a large portion of our assets and liabilities. Fluctuations in interest rates will also affect the market value of all interest earning assets, other than those that possess a short term to maturity. The interest rate environment experienced during 2003, where long term rates decreased and short term rates remained relatively stable, had an adverse impact on our net interest income as our interest earning assets, particularly those with initial terms to maturity or repricing greater than one year, generally price off long term rates while our interest bearing liabilities generally price off short term rates. The rate changes experienced during 2003 generally flattened the yield curve, though the yield curve did remain relatively steep. The flattening yield curve, where the spread between long term interest rates and short term interest rates decreases, had an adverse impact on our net interest income, as the interest rate spread Page 48 Table of Contents between our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities decreased. Additionally, the impact on our interest income due to interest rate changes is generally felt in later periods than the impact on our interest expense due to the timing of the recording on the balance sheet of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. The recording of interest earning assets on the balance sheet generally lags the current market rate due to commitment periods of up to three months, while the recording of interest bearing liabilities on the balance sheet generally times the current market. A steep yield curve, where the difference in interest rates is greater in the long term time periods, could be beneficial to our net interest income as the interest rate spread between our originated interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities would be larger. Also impacting our net interest income and net interest rate spread is the level of prepayment activity on our mortgage related assets. The actual amount of time before mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities are repaid can be significantly impacted by changes in market interest rates and mortgage prepayment rates. Mortgage prepayment rates will vary due to a number of factors, including the regional economy in the area where the underlying mortgages were originated, seasonal factors, demographic variables and the assumability of the underlying mortgages. However, the major factors affecting prepayment rates are prevailing interest rates, related mortgage refinancing opportunities and competition. The historically low market interest rates experienced during 2003 increased the prepayment activity on our mortgage related assets, which had an adverse impact on our net interest income, interest rate spread and net interest margin. The rate increase experienced in the second half of 2003 slowed the prepayment activity on our mortgage related assets. If the activity continues to decline or stabilizes, the resulting situation could have a positive impact on our net interest income in 2004. The primary objectives of our interest rate risk management strategy are to: evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in certain balance sheet accounts; determine the appropriate level of interest rate risk given our business plan, the current business environment and our capital and liquidity requirements; and manage interest rate risk in a manner consistent with the approved guidelines and policies set by our Board of Directors. We seek to coordinate asset and liability decisions so that, under changing interest rate scenarios, earnings will remain within an acceptable range. To achieve the objectives of managing interest rate risk, our Asset/Liability Committee meets weekly to discuss and monitor the market interest rate environment compared to interest rates that are offered on our products. This committee consists of the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Operating Officer and the Investment Officer. The Asset/Liability Committee presents periodic reports to the Board of Directors at its regular meetings, as well as a comprehensive quarterly report to the Asset Management Committee of the Board of Directors. The quarterly reports address the results of activities and strategies and the effect that changes in interest rates will have on our results of operations and the present value of our equity. Historically, our lending activities have emphasized one to four family first and second mortgage loans. We believe that the frequent repricing of adjustable rate mortgage loans and adjustable rate securities, which reduces the exposure to interest rate fluctuations, would benefit our long term profitability. However, the prevailing interest rate environment has resulted in increased demand for fixed rate first Page 49 Table of Contents mortgage loans. The result has been an increase in the proportion of fixed rate loans in our portfolio. This may have an adverse impact on our net interest income, particularly in a rising interest rate environment. The purchase of real estate mortgage investment conduits (REMIC) to supplement our purchases of adjustable rate mortgage backed securities has given us additional interest rate risk protection. At their date of purchase, these REMIC securities generally had shorter weighted average lives than traditional mortgage backed security purchases due to their prepayment schedules. However, since the REMIC purchases have fixed interest rates, the weighted average life will vary with changes in market interest rates. Our primary source of funds has been deposits, consisting primarily of time deposits and the interest bearing High Value Checking demand account, which have substantially shorter terms to maturity than the loan portfolio. We use securities sold under agreements to repurchase and FHLB advances as additional sources of funds. These borrowings are generally long term to maturity, in an effort to offset our short term deposit liabilities and assist in managing our interest rate risk. Certain of these borrowings have call options that could shorten their maturities in a changing interest rate environment. Due to the nature of our operations, we are not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk. Instead, our real estate loan portfolio, the majority of which is located in New Jersey, is subject to risks associated with the local economy. We do not own any trading assets. We did not engage in any hedging transactions that use derivative instruments (such as interest rate swaps and caps) during 2003 and did not have any such hedging transactions in place at December 31, 2003. In the future, we may, with approval of our Board of Directors, engage in hedging transactions utilizing derivative instruments. Gap Analysis. The matching of the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring a financial institutions interest rate sensitivity gap. An asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period. The interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period exceeds the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period. A gap is considered negative when the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a specific time period exceeds the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within that same period. During a period of rising interest rates, a financial institution with a negative gap position would be expected, absent the effects of other factors, to experience a greater increase in the costs of its liabilities relative to the yields of its assets and thus a decrease in the institutions net interest income. An institution with a positive gap position would be expected, absent the effect of other factors, to experience the opposite result. Conversely, during a period of falling interest rates, a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to reduce net interest income. The following table, referred to as the gap table, presents the amounts of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at December 31, 2003, which we anticipate to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown. Except as stated below, we determined the amounts of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period in accordance with the earlier of the term to repricing or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability. The information presented in the gap table is also based on the following assumptions: Page 50 Table of Contents we assumed an annual prepayment rate of 30.0% for mortgage loans repricing or maturing after one year; we assumed an annual prepayment rate of 30.0% for mortgage backed securities repricing or maturing after one year; we reported savings accounts that had no stated maturity using decay rates of: 2.5% in less than six months, 2.5% in six months to one year, 5% in one year to two years, 5% in two years to three years, 10% in three years to five years, and 75% in over five years; we reported interest bearing demand accounts that had no stated maturity using decay rates of : 2.5% in less than six months, 2.5% in six months to one year, 10% in one to two years, 10% in two to three years, 20% in three years to five years, and 55% in over five years; we reported money market accounts that had no stated maturity using decay rates of: 2.5% in less than six months, 2.5% in six months to one year, 10% in one to two years, 10% in two to three years, 20% in three years to five years, and 55% in over five years; we assumed $50.0 million of callable federal agency securities, which are reported at maturity date, will be called in less than six months. In 2002, the prepayment assumptions for both mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities were 30.0%. We have maintained this level of prepayment assumptions on our mortgage related assets, notwithstanding the slowing of prepayment activity in the fourth quarter of 2003, as market interest rates are still at historical low levels. We also believe the 30% prepayment assumption is supported by the fact that a significant portion of our portfolio is in the active New Jersey real estate market and is primarily over the conforming amount. We believe these loans will tend to prepay at higher levels than other types of loans. Our determination of deposit decay rates is based on regulatory guidance, as modified by our historical experience. The change in decay rates from our 2002 gap analysis reflected the recent growth experience in our non maturity deposits and the one year experience of our portfolio. Had these decay rate assumptions used in the 2003 gap analysis been applied to the 2002 analysis, and all other assumptions remained the same, the cumulative one year interest rate sensitivity gap as a percent of total assets would have been positive 2.95%. Deposit decay rates, prepayment rates and anticipated calls of investment securities or borrowed funds can have a significant impact on the estimated interest sensitivity gap. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, they may not be indicative of actual future deposit decay activity, mortgage and mortgage backed securities prepayments, and the actual timing of calls of federal agency bonds. We have excluded non accrual mortgage loans totaling $4,401,000 and non accrual other loans totaling $102,000 from the table. As indicated in the gap table at December 31, 2003, our interest bearing assets maturing or repricing within one year exceeded our interest earning liabilities maturing or repricing within the same period by $434.3 million compared with our interest bearing liabilities exceeding our interest earning assets by $15.4 million at December 31, 2002. This represented a cumulative one year interest rate sensitivity gap as a percent of total assets of positive 2.6% at December 31, 2003 compared with negative 0.1% at Page 51 Table of Contents December 31, 2002. The ratio of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year to interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year was 108.9% at December 31, 2003 compared with 99.7% at December 31, 2002. The change in these ratios, year to year, was partially due to the lengthening of the decay rate assumptions on our non maturity deposits. The change also reflected the growth of borrowed funds in the current year with maturities in excess of one year, the shift of time deposit maturities to over one year due to pricing strategies, and the growth of our High Value Checking account, which we have estimated to have a decay rate in excess of one year of 95%.

For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Certain assets, such as adjustable rate loans and mortgage backed securities, have features that limit changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the loan. If interest rates change, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table. Finally, the ability of borrowers to make payments on their adjustable rate loans may decrease if interest rates increase. Present Value of Equity. In addition to the gap analysis, we also use a simulation model to monitor interest rate risk. This model reports the present value of equity in different interest rate environments, assuming an instantaneous and permanent interest rate shock to all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities. The present value of equity is the difference between the estimated fair value of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities. The changes in market value of assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates reflect the interest sensitivity of those assets and liabilities as their values are derived from the characteristics of the asset or liability (i.e., fixed rate, adjustable rate, caps, floors) relative to the current interest rate environment. For example, in a rising interest rate environment the fair market value of a fixed rate asset will decline, whereas the fair market value of an adjustable rate asset, depending on its repricing characteristics, may not decline. Increases in the market value of assets will increase the present value of equity whereas decreases in the market value of assets will decrease the present value of equity. Conversely, increases in the market value of liabilities will decrease the present value of equity whereas decreases in the market value of liabilities will increase the present value of equity. The following table presents the estimated present value of equity over a range of interest rate change scenarios at December 31, 2003. The present value ratio shown in the table is the present value of equity as a percent of the present value of total assets in each of the different rate environments. For purposes of this table, we have made assumptions such as prepayment rates and decay rates similar to those used for the gap analysis table. Our current policy sets a maximum percentage change in the present value of equity of 55% from the current, or zero basis point, present value of equity, given an instantaneous and parallel increase or decrease of 200 basis points. We feel this percent change is acceptable given the high equity ratios we currently report. Present Value of Equity As Percent of Present Present Value of Equity Value of Assets Change in Dollar Dollar Percent Present Percent Interest Rates Amount Change Change Value Ratio Change (Basis points) (Dollars in thousands) 200 $ 1,408,411 $ (756,816 ) (34.95 )% 8.98 % (28.90 )% 150 1,631,805 (533,422 ) (24.64 ) 10.16 (19.56 ) 100 1,828,672 (336,555 ) (15.54 ) 11.14 (11.80 ) 50 2,048,743 (116,484 ) (5.38 ) 12.19 (3.48 ) 0 2,165,227 12.63 (50) 2,113,798 (51,429 ) (2.38 ) 12.20 (3.40 ) (100) 1,986,291 (178,936 ) (8.26 ) 11.40 (9.74 ) Page 54 Table of Contents At December 31, 2002, the percent change in the present value of equity in the 200 basis point increase scenario was negative 20.93% and in the 100 basis point decrease scenario it was negative 12.64% compared with the table above. The decreases in the present value of equity and the percent change in the present value of equity in the increasing rate scenarios in the December 31, 2003 analysis were primarily due to the high percentage of fixed rate mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities in our portfolio. Generally, these assets will not reprice in a rising rate environment. The decreases in the present value of equity and the percent change in the present value of equity in the decreasing rate scenarios in the December 31, 2003 analysis were primarily due to the growth of our fixed rate borrowed funds and the growth in our interest bearing High Value Checking account in this low interest rate environment. Fixed rate borrowed funds, even those with call options, generally do not reprice in a decreasing rate environment. We believe the 150 and 200 basis point decrease scenarios may not be meaningful given the prevailing low market interest rate environment and are not presented in the table. As in the case of the gap table, the methods we used in the previous table are also inherently imprecise. This type of modeling requires that we make assumptions that may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. For example, we assume the composition of the interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will remain constant over the period being measured and that all interest rate shocks will be uniformly reflected across the yield curve, regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing. The table assumes that we will take no action in response to the changes in interest rates. In addition, prepayment estimates and other assumptions within the model are subjective in nature, involve uncertainties, and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Accordingly, although the present value of equity model may provide an estimate of our interest rate risk at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in interest rates on our present value of equity. Analysis of Net Interest Income Net interest income represents the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets, such as mortgage loans, mortgage backed securities and investment securities, and the expense we pay on interest bearing liabilities, such as time deposits and borrowed funds. Net interest income depends on our volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates we earned or paid on them. Average Balance Sheet. The following table presents certain information regarding our financial condition and net interest income for 2003, 2002 and 2001. The table presents the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities for the periods indicated. We derived the yields and costs by dividing income or expense by the average balance of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities, respectively, for the periods shown. We derived average balances from daily balances over the periods indicated. Interest income includes fees that we considered adjustments to yields. Yields on tax exempt obligations were not computed on a tax equivalent basis.

The following table presents the extent to which the changes in interest rates and the changes in volume of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected our interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated. Information is provided in each category with respect to: changes attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate); changes attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume); and the net change. The changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to rate. 2003 Compared to 2002 2002 Compared to 2001 Increase (Decrease) Due To Increase (Decrease) Due To Volume Rate Net Volume Rate Net (In thousands) Interest earning assets: First mortgage loans, net $ 41,578 $ (67,234 ) $ (25,656 ) $ 80,168 $ (21,230 ) $ 58,938 Consumer and other loans (713 ) (935 ) (1,648 ) (1,079 ) (853 ) (1,932 ) Federal funds sold 242 (875 ) (633 ) 10 (3,019 ) (3,009 ) Mortgage backed securities 25,625 (65,133 ) (39,508 ) 83,795 (38,966 ) 44,829 Federal Home Loan Bank stock 2,064 (2,642 ) (578 ) 1,150 (684 ) 466 Investment securities 66,479 (5,345 ) 61,134 (4,490 ) (1,083 ) (5,573 ) Total 135,275 (142,164 ) (6,889 ) 159,554 (65,835 ) 93,719 Interest bearing liabilities: Savings accounts 1,075 (7,607 ) (6,532 ) 1,956 (2,241 ) (285 ) Interest bearing demand accounts 35,492 (1,426 ) 34,066 6,587 1,377 7,964 Money market accounts 573 (5,381 ) (4,808 ) 2,690 (1,724 ) 966 Time deposits (11,222 ) (57,940 ) (69,162 ) 42,506 (102,383 ) (59,877 ) Borrowed funds 53,248 (26,232 ) 27,016 56,334 (12,755 ) 43,579 Total 79,166 (98,586 ) (19,420 ) 110,073 (117,726 ) (7,653 ) Net change in net interest income $ 56,109 $ (43,578 ) $ 12,531 $ 49,481 $ 51,891 $ 101,372 Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002 During 2003, our total assets increased $2.89 billion, or 20.4%, to $17.03 billion at December 31, 2003 from $14.14 billion at December 31, 2002. Loans increased $1.83 billion, or 26.3%, to $8.80 billion at December 31, 2003 from $6.97 billion at December 31, 2002. The increase in loans reflected a significant increase in our loan purchase activity as well as our continued focus on the origination of one to four family first mortgage loans, consistent with our growth strategies. For 2003, we originated first mortgage loans of $2.17 billion and purchased first mortgage loans of $3.21 billion, compared with originations of $1.84 billion and purchases of $1.72 billion for 2002. Loan purchases exceeded originations due to their availability in the high prepayment activity environment experienced during 2003 Page 57 Table of Contents and the growth initiatives employed by us in recent periods. These first mortgage loan originations and purchases were exclusively in one to four family mortgage loans and were primarily fixed rate loans. At December 31, 2003, fixed rate mortgage loans accounted for 90.9% of our first mortgage loan portfolio compared with 86.5% at December 31, 2002. This percentage of fixed rate loans to total loans may have an adverse impact on our earnings in a rising rate environment as the interest rate on these loans would not reprice as would adjustable rate loans. The strong levels of loan originations and purchases during 2003 reflected the continuation of the impact of the low interest rate environment. During 2003, due to the low long term interest rate environment, $530.4 million of our loan originations were the result of refinancing of our existing mortgage loans. The dollar amount of refinancing of existing mortgage loans was included in total loan originations. We allow certain customers to modify, for a fee, their existing mortgage loans with the intent of maintaining customer relationships in periods of extensive refinancing due to low long term interest rates. In general, all terms and conditions of the existing mortgage loan remain the same except the adjustment of the interest rate to the currently offered fixed rate product with a similar term to maturity or to a reduced term at the request of the borrower. Modifications of our existing mortgage loans during the 2003 were approximately $1.46 billion. These loan modifications were not reflected in loan origination totals. We feel loan refinancing and modification activity are directly tied to the level of interest rates. As rates have increased in the second half of 2003 and have remained relatively stable since, we feel these amounts may not be as high in 2004. The loan purchases were made pursuant to our wholesale loan purchase program established to supplement our retail loan originations. The purchasing agreements, as established with each seller/servicer, contain parameters as to the loans that can be included in each package. These parameters, such as maximum loan size and maximum loan to value ratio, conform to parameters generally utilized by us to originate mortgage loans. Purchased loan packages are subject to internal due diligence procedures that may include review of individual loan files. This review subjects the purchased loan file to substantially the same underwriting standards used in our own loan origination process. Loan packages purchased include mortgage loans secured by properties located primarily in the east coast corridor states between Massachusetts and North Carolina, and in Michigan and Illinois. Investment securities available for sale increased $1.68 billion to $2.24 billion at December 31, 2003 from $560.9 million at December 31, 2002. The increase in investment securities available for sale primarily reflected the investment of part of the cash flow from the high levels of prepayment activity on our mortgage related assets into investment securities. The increase in investment securities also reflected our decision to shorten the overall weighted average life of our assets by investing in callable government sponsored agency securities with initial call dates of three months to one year and terms to maturity of generally under ten years. Mortgage backed securities decreased $703.5 million, or 11.5%, to $5.42 billion at December 31, 2003 from $6.13 billion at December 31, 2002. This decrease was primarily due to the high level of prepayment activity and sales of approximately $1.37 billion of our mortgage backed securities during 2003. The $27.4 million increase in Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) stock to $164.9 million at December 31, 2003, was due to the amount of stock we were required by the FHLB to hold. The $24.5 million increase in other assets was primarily due to an increase in our deferred tax asset calculations as required by generally accepted accounting principles. Total liabilities increased $2.87 billion, or 22.4%, to $15.70 billion at December 31, 2003 compared with $12.83 billion at December 31, 2002. Total deposits increased $1.31 billion, or 14.3%, to $10.45 billion at December 31, 2003 from $9.14 billion at December 31, 2002. The increase in total deposits was primarily used to fund our growth initiatives. Interest bearing deposits increased $1.31 billion primarily Page 58 Table of Contents due to an increase of $1.77 billion in our interest bearing High Value Checking account product. We believe the increase in interest bearing deposits was due primarily to our consistent offering of competitive rates on our deposit products, primarily on our interest bearing High Value Checking account product. We view our interest bearing High Value Checking account as an attractive alternative to cash management accounts offered by brokerage firms. This account offers unlimited checking, no charge on line banking, no charge bill payment and debit card availability as part of the product, and pays an interest rate generally above competitive market rates. The balance in the High Value Checking account at December 31, 2003 was $2.71 billion compared with $943.2 million at December 31, 2002. This growth in interest bearing deposits was partially offset by a $508.9 million decrease in time deposits. Although our time deposit rates are competitive, we believe the decrease in time deposits was due, in part, to transfers to our High Value Checking account. Borrowed funds increased $1.55 billion, or 43.1%, to $5.15 billion at December 31, 2003 from $3.60 billion at December 31, 2002. The additional borrowed funds were primarily used to fund asset growth consistent with our capital management strategy. Borrowed funds were comprised of $3.20 billion of securities sold under agreements to repurchase and $1.95 billion of FHLB advances. Securities pledged as collateral against our securities sold under agreements to repurchase had a market value at December 31, 2003 of approximately $3.47 billion. Advances from the FHLB utilize our mortgage portfolio as collateral. The $2.03 billion in new borrowings had initial call dates of three months to three years from the date of borrowing. These short and intermediate term borrowed funds complement the $3.60 billion of previously existing long term borrowings. During 2003 we also restructured certain of our borrowed funds, which resulted in the extension of the weighted average maturity and lowered the contract interest rate. Total stockholders equity increased $13.3 million, or 1.0%, to $1.33 billion at December 31, 2003 from $1.32 billion at December 31, 2002. The increase was primarily the result of net income for 2003 of $207.4 million, an increase of $11.0 million due to the exercise of approximately 1.5 million stock options, and an increase of $14.2 million due to the commitment of shares for our stock related employee benefit plans. Partially offsetting these increases in stockholders equity were repurchases of approximately 3.7 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $101.1 million, cash dividends declared and paid to common stockholders of $95.6 million and a $30.2 million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income due to the decrease in the overall market value of our investment and mortgage backed securities available for sale, reflecting a generally lower interest rate environment. At December 31, 2003, the ratio of total stockholders equity to total assets was 7.80% compared with 9.30% at December 31, 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the ratio of average stockholders equity to average assets was 8.73% compared with 10.12% for the year ended December 31, 2002. The decrease in these ratios was primarily due to our capital management strategy of planned asset growth, and a slower percentage growth in stockholders equity as compared to the percentage growth in assets, due to payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases. Stockholders equity per common share was $7.33 at December 31, 2003 compared with $7.22 at December 31, 2002. Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 General. Net income was $207.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of $15.4 million, or 8.0%, compared with net income of $192.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Basic and diluted earnings per common share were $1.14 and $1.11, respectively, for 2003 compared with basic and diluted earnings per share of $1.04 and $1.01, respectively, for 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2003 our return on average stockholders equity was 15.38% compared with 14.84% for Page 59 Table of Contents 2002. The increase in the return on average stockholders equity was primarily due to the growth of our net income and a slower percentage growth in stockholders equity as compared to the percentage growth in assets due to payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases. Our return on average assets for 2003 was 1.34% compared with 1.50% for 2002. The decrease in the return on average assets was primarily due to the lower net interest margin due to the low interest rate environment. The decline in the return on average assets also reflected our overall balance sheet growth. Interest and Dividend Income. Total interest and dividend income decreased $6.9 million, or 0.9%, to $777.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared with $784.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The decrease in total interest and dividend income was primarily due to a 112 basis point decrease in the average yield on interest earning assets to 5.14% for 2003 from 6.26% for 2002, reflecting yield declines to varying degrees in all asset categories. The impact on interest and dividend income from the decrease in the weighted average yield on our interest earning assets was partially off set by an increase in the average balance of total interest earning assets of $2.61 billion, or 20.8%, to $15.13 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared with $12.52 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002. The $25.7 million decrease in interest and fee income on first mortgage loans was primarily due to a 100 basis point decrease in the average yield, which reflected the large volume of loan origination and purchase activity during the low long term interest rate environment of 2003 and the acceleration of the amortization of the net premium on these assets due to the high levels of modification and refinancing activity. The decrease in mortgage loan income due to the decreases in yields was partially off set by a $637.1 million increase in the average balance of first mortgage loans, which reflected internal growth that was consistent with our capital management strategy and growth initiatives. The $39.5 million decrease in interest income on mortgage backed securities was primarily due to a 112 basis point decrease in the average yield on mortgage backed securities, which reflected the significant turnover in the portfolio, the downward repricing of our adjustable rate securities during the low interest rate environment of 2003 and the acceleration of the net premium on these assets. The decrease in income on mortgage backed securities due to the decrease in yield was partially off set by the impact of a $486.7 million increase in the average balance of mortgage backed securities, which reflected our internal growth initiatives. If short term market interest rates remain low, the yield on our mortgage backed securities may continue to adjust downward due to annual rate change limits that are part of the terms of the securities, which have limited the extent our adjustable rate securities may have adjusted in prior periods. The $61.1 million growth in interest and dividends on investment securities available for sale was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of $1.42 billion, which reflected the investment of certain of the cash flows from the high level of prepayment activity on our mortgage related assets into investment securities, and the decision to shorten the overall weighted average life of our assets by investing in callable securities with initial call dates of three months to one year. The increase in income on investment securities due to the increase in the average balance was partially off set by a 139 basis point decrease in the average yield on our investment securities, which reflected the large volume of purchases made during the low interest rate environment of 2003. We expect to continue to grow our assets by originating and purchasing first mortgage loans as our primary growth strategy, while purchasing mortgage backed and investment securities to supplement our loan growth, and assist in the management of interest rate risk. If the interest rate environment remains stable, and the prepayment activity continues to decline, we believe the resulting situation would have a positive impact on our interest income in 2004. Page 60 Table of Contents Interest Expense. Total interest expense, comprised of interest on deposits and interest on borrowed funds, decreased $19.4 million, or 4.9%, to $376.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $395.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities of 83 basis points to 2.77% for 2003 from 3.60% for 2002. The impact of the decline in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities was offset, in part, by an increase in the average balance of total interest bearing liabilities of $2.58 billion, or 23.5%, to $13.58 billion for 2003 from $11.00 billion for 2002. Interest expense on borrowed funds increased $27.0 million primarily due to an increase in the average balance of $1.24 billion, the impact of which was partially off set by a decrease in the average cost of borrowed funds of 82 basis points. The increase in the average balance of borrowed funds was used to fund asset growth consistent with our capital management and growth strategies. The decrease in the average cost of borrowed funds reflected the continued growth of our borrowed funds in the low interest rate environment that existed during 2003. The decrease in the average cost of borrowed funds also reflected the restructuring of certain of our borrowed funds during 2003, which resulted in the extension of the weighted average maturity and lowered the contract rates. Interest expense on deposits decreased $46.5 million primarily due to a decrease in the average cost of 93 basis points, the impact of which was partially off set by an increase in the average balance of deposits of $1.34 billion. The decrease in the average cost of interest bearing deposits reflected a 96 basis point decrease in the average cost of our time deposits, an 83 basis point decrease in the average cost of savings accounts, an 87 basis point decrease in the average cost of money market deposits, and a 34 basis point decrease in the average cost of interest bearing demand deposits. These decreases in the average cost of interest bearing deposits reflected the low interest rate environment experienced during 2003 and the growth of our High Value Checking account product, the rate for which was lower than our average cost of total deposits during 2003. The impact on the average cost of interest bearing liabilities due to possible further decreases in market interest rates may not be as favorable in future periods as short term market rates are currently at historically low levels. The increase in the average balance of deposits, primarily used to fund asset growth, reflected a $1.60 billion increase in the average balance of interest bearing demand accounts due to the growth in our High Value Checking account product, and an increase of $57.4 million in the average balance of our regular savings account. We believe the increase in the average balance of deposits was primarily due to our consistent offering of competitive rates on desirable customer deposit products. Although our time deposit rates are competitive, we believe the decrease of $341.1 million in the average balance of time deposits was primarily due to transfers to our High Value Checking account. We intend to continue to fund future asset growth using customer deposits as our primary source of funds, by continuing to pay attractive above market rates, while supplementing the deposit growth with long term borrowed funds. Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased $12.6 million, or 3.2%, to $401.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared with $388.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase primarily reflected our growth initiatives, which resulted in increases in the average balance of both interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, and the net interest rate spread earned on this growth. Our net interest rate spread, the difference between the average yield on total interest earning assets and the average cost of total interest bearing liabilities, decreased 29 basis points to 2.37% for 2003 from 2.66% for 2002. Our net interest margin, represented by net interest income divided by average total interest earning assets, decreased 45 basis points to 2.65% for 2003 from 3.10% for 2002. These decreases reflected the larger decrease in the yield on interest earning assets compared with the decrease in the cost of interest bearing liabilities due to the continued decline in long term market interest Page 61 Table of Contents rates during the first six months of 2003 and the timing of the impact on earnings of the market rate changes. The decrease also reflected the increased amortization of the net premium on our mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities due to the high level of prepayment activity on these mortgage related assets. However, the stabilized rate environment and steeper yield curve which occurred in the second half of 2003 improved our net interest rate margin and net interest rate spread in the fourth quarter of 2003 when compared to the prior quarters reported in 2003. If rates remain stable, we believe this environment could have a positive impact on our earnings, net interest margin and net interest spread in 2004. Provision for Loan Losses. Our provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $900,000, a decrease of $600,000, compared with $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Net recoveries were $146,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared with net charge offs of $9,000 for 2002. The decrease in the provision reflected our recent low charge off history given the relative stability of the housing market. The allowance for loan losses increased $1.0 million, or 3.9%, to $26.5 million at December 31, 2003 from $25.5 million at December 31, 2002. The increase in the allowance for loan losses, through the provision for loan losses, reflected the overall growth of the loan portfolio and the level of delinquent and non performing loans. Non performing loans, defined as non accruing loans and accruing loans delinquent 90 days or more, increased $100,000 to $20.3 million at December 31, 2003 from $20.2 million at December 31, 2002. The ratio of non performing loans to total loans was 0.23% at December 31, 2003 compared with 0.29% at December 31, 2002. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans was 131.09% at December 31, 2003 compared with 126.27% at December 31, 2002. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans was 0.30% at December 31, 2003 compared with 0.37% at December 31, 2002. Although we believe that we have established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at adequate levels, additions may be necessary if future economic and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment. Although we use the best information available, the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate that is subject to significant judgment and short term change. See Critical Accounting Policies. Non Interest Income. Total non interest income increased $21.7 million to $29.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, primarily reflecting gains on securities transactions, net. Service charges and other income, which generally consist of service charges and fees on deposit accounts, decreased $600,000 to $5.3 million for 2003 compared with $5.9 million for 2002, due to a gain on the sale of a commercial property in 2002. The $24.3 million gain on securities transactions, net, during 2003, resulted from an opportunity to realize gains from the sale of certain available for sale mortgage backed and investment securities prior to an interest rate change which would have had an adverse impact on their fair market value. The gain also reflected the disposition of certain of our held to maturity mortgage backed securities whose amortized principal was less than fifteen percent of the purchased principal, as allowed under SFAS No. 115. The cash flow of $1.45 billion from the sale of the securities was reinvested into fixed rate securities. We may continue to take gains on the sale of investment securities in 2004 if given the opportunity to sell these assets in a favorable interest rate environment where we can invest the proceeds in an interest bearing asset with an equivalent rate. Non Interest Expense. Total non interest expense increased $9.0 million, or 9.6%, to $102.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $93.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $8.1 million in compensation and employee benefits Page 62 Table of Contents reflecting routine salary increases, increases in stock related compensation expense and increases in pension expense. Stock related compensation expense increased $4.5 million primarily due to increases in the current average market price of our common stock. Our efficiency ratio, determined by dividing total non interest expense by the sum of net interest income and non interest income was 23.81% for 2003 compared with 23.59% for 2002. Our ratio of non interest expense to average total assets for 2003 was 0.66% compared with 0.73% for 2002. The relative stability of these ratios reflected our efforts to control costs, notwithstanding the actual increase in non interest expense, as our assets grew in excess of 20%. Income Taxes. Income tax expense increased $10.4 million, or 9.5%, to $119.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $109.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, primarily due to the 8.6% increase in income before income tax expense. Our effective tax rate for the 2003 was 36.61% compared with 36.29% for 2002. Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001 During the year ended December 31, 2002, we continued to grow our operating subsidiary, Hudson City Savings Bank, primarily through our core investments of residential mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities. Customer deposits and long term borrowings funded the growth. As a result, our total assets increased $2.72 billion, or 23.8%, to $14.14 billion at December 31, 2002 from $11.42 billion at December 31, 2001. Loans increased $1.00 billion, or 16.8%, to $6.97 billion at December 31, 2002 from $5.97 billion at December 31, 2001. For the year ended December 31, 2002, we originated first mortgage loans of $1.84 billion and purchased first mortgage loans of $1.72 billion, compared with $1.52 billion and $857.6 million, respectively, for the corresponding 2001 period. These first mortgage loan originations and purchases were exclusively in one to four family mortgage loans and were primarily fixed rate loans. At December 31, 2002, fixed rate mortgage loans accounted for 86.5% of our first mortgage loan portfolio compared with 72.2% at December 31, 2001. This percentage of fixed rate loans to total loans may have an adverse impact on our earnings in a rising rate environment as the interest rate on these loans would not reprice as would adjustable rate loans. The increase in loan originations and purchases reflected the low long term market interest rate environment experienced in 2002, which caused increases in loan prepayments and refinancings. The increase in mortgage loan purchases also reflected our internal growth strategy. The loan purchases were made pursuant to our wholesale loan purchase program established to supplement our retail loan originations. The purchasing agreements, as established with each seller/servicer, contain parameters as to the loans that can be included in each package. These parameters, such as maximum loan size and maximum loan to value ratio, conform to parameters utilized by us to originate mortgage loans. Purchased loan packages are subject to internal due diligence procedures that may include review of individual loan files. This review subjects the purchased loan file to substantially the same underwriting standards used in our own loan origination process. Loan packages purchased include mortgage loans secured by properties located primarily in the east coast corridor states between Boston and Washington D.C., and in Michigan and Illinois. In 2002, due to the low long term interest rate environment, approximately $496.8 million of our loan originations were the result of refinancing of our existing mortgage loans. These refinancings of existing loans are included in total loan originations. Last year we began to allow certain customers to modify, for a fee, their existing mortgage loans with the intent of maintaining customer relationships in periods of Page 63 Table of Contents extensive refinancing due to lower interest rates. In general, all terms and conditions of the existing mortgage loan remain the same except the adjustment of the interest rate to the currently offered fixed rate product with a similar term to maturity or to a reduced term at the request of the borrower. Approximately $866.3 million of existing mortgage loans were modified during the year ended December 31, 2002. This total is not included in total loan originations. Mortgage backed securities increased $1.12 billion, or 22.4%, to $6.13 billion at December 31, 2002 from $5.01 billion at December 31, 2001. This increase includes a $861.2 million increase in mortgage backed securities available for sale. In addition to purchases of mortgage backed securities as part of our internal growth strategy, purchases also increased due to the low market interest rate environment experienced during 2002, which caused increased prepayment activity. Investment securities available for sale increased $393.5 million to $560.9 million at December 31, 2002 from $167.4 million at December 31, 2001. The increase in investment securities primarily reflected the investment of part of the excess cash flows from mortgage related prepayment activity. These increases in interest earning assets reflected our continued emphasis on the origination and purchase of one to four family mortgage loans as our primary growth strategy, supplemented by the purchase of mortgage backed securities and investment securities to help manage interest rate risk. Cash and due from banks increased $68.9 million to $153.1 million at December 31, 2002 from $84.2 million at December 31, 2001. Of the cash and due from banks balance at December 31, 2002, $54.5 million was held at the Federal Home Loan Bank. This balance receives interest credits equivalent to the current federal funds overnight borrowing rate. Federal funds sold increased $70.1 million to $87.7 million at December 31, 2002 from $17.6 million at December 31, 2001. These increases in cash and cash equivalents were primarily due to the overall growth in assets, increased levels of cash flows due to mortgage related prepayment activity and excess liquidity received late in the period having been temporarily invested in federal funds sold. FHLB stock increased $56.4 million, or 69.5%, to $137.5 million at December 31, 2002, which was the amount of stock we were required by the FHLB to hold. The growth in accrued interest receivable of $7.4 million to $69.2 million at December 31, 2002 was primarily due to the growth of our interest earning assets. At December 31, 2002, total liabilities were $12.83 billion, an increase of 26.5%, or $2.69 billion, compared with $10.14 billion at December 31, 2001. Borrowed funds increased $1.45 billion, or 67.4%, to $3.60 billion at December 31, 2002 from $2.15 billion at December 31, 2001. The additional borrowed funds were primarily used to fund asset growth consistent with our capital management strategy. Funding asset growth with borrowed funds generated additional earnings through a positive interest rate spread. Borrowed funds were comprised of $1.85 billion of securities sold under agreements to repurchase and $1.75 billion of Federal Home Loan Bank advances. Securities pledged as collateral against our securities sold under agreements to repurchase had a market value at December 31, 2002 of approximately $1.96 billion. Advances from the FHLB utilize our mortgage portfolio as collateral. Our increase in borrowed funds consisted primarily of 10 year terms to maturity with call options starting from 3 to 5 years from the borrowing date. The use of long term borrowed funds has allowed us to better manage our interest rate risk by matching our long term assets with long term liabilities. Borrowing long term in this low interest rate environment should also allow us to better manage interest expense in future periods. Total deposits increased $1.23 billion, or 15.5%, to $9.14 billion at December 31, 2002 from $7.91 billion at December 31, 2001. Interest bearing deposits increased $1.21 billion, or 16.0%, to $8.75 billion at December 31, 2002 from $7.54 billion at December 31, 2001. The increase in interest bearing deposits was primarily due to growth in interest bearing demand accounts of $938.4 million due to the introduction of our interest bearing High Value Checking account. The balance in the High Value Checking account at December 31, 2002 was $943.2 million. In April 2002, we introduced our interest Page 64 Table of Contents bearing High Value Checking account, which we view as an attractive alternative to cash management accounts offered by brokerage firms. This account offers unlimited checking, on line banking and debit card availability as part of the product, and pays an interest rate generally above market competitive rates. The growth in interest bearing deposits was also due to a $112.3 million, or 21.7% increase in money market deposits to $629.0 million, an $84.0 million, or 1.4%, increase in time deposits to $6.19 billion, and a $78.3 million, or 9.6%, increase in regular savings deposits to $892.7 million at December 31, 2002. Non interest bearing deposits increased $12.8 million, or 3.4%, to $388.5 million at December 31, 2002 from $375.7 million at December 31, 2001. The increase in total deposits was primarily used to fund our planned asset growth. We believe the increase in interest bearing deposits was due primarily to our consistent offering of competitive rates on our deposit products, the introduction of our interest bearing High Value Checking account and an overall decrease in investor confidence in the equity markets. Accrued expenses and other liabilities increased $14.6 million, or 19.4%, to $89.9 million at December 31, 2002 from $75.3 million at December 31, 2001 primarily due to an increase in accrued interest payable because of the growth in our borrowed funds and an increase in our accrued income tax payable due to timing of tax payments. Total stockholders equity increased $27.3 million, or 2.1%, to $1.32 billion at December 31, 2002 from $1.29 billion at December 31, 2001. The increase was primarily the result of net income of $192.0 million, an increase of $19.4 million in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, an increase of $9.9 million due to the exercise of 1,410,330 stock options, and an increase of $12.5 million due to the allocation of stock related employee benefit plans. The increase in accumulated other comprehensive income was primarily due to the growth in our portfolio of mortgage backed securities available for sale and increases in the value of our investment securities available for sale. Partially offsetting these increases in stockholders equity were repurchases of 7,754,472 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $140.2 million and cash dividends declared and paid to common stockholders of $64.5 million. As of December 31, 2002, there remained 1,808,796 shares authorized to be purchased under our current stock repurchase program. At December 31, 2002, the ratio of total stockholders equity to total assets was 9.30% compared with 11.28% at December 31, 2001. For the year ended December 31, 2002, the ratio of average stockholders equity to average assets was 10.12% compared with 13.05% for the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease in these ratios was primarily due to our capital management strategy of planned internal asset growth, and a slower percentage growth in stockholders equity as compared to the percentage growth in assets due to payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases. Stockholders equity per common share was $7.22 and $6.87 at December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001, respectively. Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 General. Net income was $192.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, an increase of $57.5 million, or 42.8%, compared with net income of $134.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Basic and diluted earnings per common share were $1.04 and $1.01, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared with basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.69 and $0.68, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2001. For the year ended December 31, 2002 our return on average stockholders equity was 14.84% compared with 10.09% for the year ended December 31, 2001. Our return on average assets for the year ended December 31, 2002 was 1.50% compared with 1.32% for the year ended December 31, 2001. These increases reflected our improved profitability due to increased Page 65 Table of Contents interest rate spreads that we experienced in the low interest rate environment and our ability to grow our business with low cost interest bearing liabilities. Interest and Dividend Income. Total interest and dividend income increased $93.7 million, or 13.6%, to $784.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared with $690.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase in total interest income was primarily due to the average balance of total interest earning assets increasing $2.50 billion, or 25.0%, to $12.52 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared with $10.02 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001. This increase was due in part to a $1.15 billion, or 22.1%, increase in the average balance of first mortgage loans, net to $6.35 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared with $5.20 billion for 2001. The average balance of mortgage backed securities increased $1.42 billion, or 35.1%, to $5.46 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared with $4.04 billion for 2001. These increases were slightly offset by a decrease in the average balance of investment securities for the year ended December 31, 2002 of $74.3 million, or 19.1%, to $315.2 million from $389.5 million for 2001. The increase in the average balance of FHLB stock of $22.2 million reflected the increase in the amount of FHLB stock required to be held by us. The above increases in the average balances of first mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities reflected internal growth that was consistent with our capital management strategy to originate and purchase first mortgage loans as our primary growth strategy, while purchasing mortgage backed securities to supplement loan originations and purchases, and assist in the management of interest rate risk. The growth in the average balance of mortgage backed securities also reflected the investment of excess cash flows, due to the increased prepayment activity on our mortgage related assets, into mortgage backed securities. Although the increase in the average balance of loans was somewhat less than the increase in the average balance of mortgage backed securities, the impact of the loan growth was more significant in terms of interest income because our first mortgage loans are generally higher yielding assets than our mortgage backed securities. The impact on interest income due to the growth in the average balance of interest earning assets, was partially offset by a 63 basis point decrease in the average yield on interest earning assets to 6.26% for the year ended December 31, 2002 from 6.89% for the year ended December 31, 2001. The average yield on first mortgage loans, net decreased 39 basis points to 6.93% for the year ended December 31, 2002 from 7.32% for 2001. The average yield on mortgage backed securities decreased 88 basis points to 5.63% for the year ended December 31, 2002 from 6.51% for 2001. The decrease in the average yield on first mortgage loans reflected the large volume of loan originations, purchases and modifications during the low interest rate environment of 2001 and 2002. The decrease in the average yield on mortgage backed securities reflected the large volume of purchases and the downward repricing of our adjustable rate securities during the low interest rate environment of 2001 and 2002. The larger decrease in the average yield on mortgage backed securities compared with mortgage loans was due to the larger increase in the average balance of mortgage backed securities in this low rate environment and the greater percentage of adjustable rate securities in the mortgage backed security portfolio as compared to our mortgage loan portfolio. Interest Expense. Total interest expense, comprised of interest on deposits and interest on borrowed funds, decreased $7.6 million, or 1.9%, to $395.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $403.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, notwithstanding an overall increase in interest bearing liabilities. Interest expense on borrowed funds increased $43.6 million, or 45.2%, to $140.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $96.4 million for 2001. Interest expense on deposits decreased $51.2 million, or 16.7%, to $255.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $307.0 Page 66 Table of Contents million for 2001. The decrease in total interest expense reflected the impact of a 117 basis point decrease in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities to 3.60% for the year ended December 31, 2002 from 4.77% for 2001. The decrease in interest expense was offset, in part, by an increase in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities of $2.55 billion, or 30.2%, to $11.00 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $8.45 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase in interest expense on borrowed funds was primarily due to a $1.12 billion, or 64.7%, increase in the average balance of borrowed funds to $2.85 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $1.73 billion for 2001. The impact on interest expense on borrowed funds due to the increase in the average balance of borrowed funds was offset, in part, by a 67 basis point decrease in the average cost of borrowed funds to 4.90% for the year ended December 31, 2002 from 5.57% for 2001. The growth of borrowed funds has been used to fund internal asset growth consistent with our capital management and growth strategies. The funds borrowed during 2002 had 10 year terms to maturity with call options starting 3 to 5 years from the borrowing date. Although these borrowings generally had higher costs than short term borrowings, the use of long term borrowed funds has allowed us to better manage our interest rate risk by matching long term assets with long term liabilities. Borrowing long term in the prevailing interest rate environment should also allow us to better manage interest expense in future periods. The decrease in the average cost of borrowed funds reflected the continued growth of our borrowed funds in the low interest rate environment that existed during 2001 and 2002 and the restructuring of certain of our borrowed funds to obtain lower interest rates. The $51.2 million decrease in interest expense on deposits was primarily due to a 143 basis point decrease in the average cost of interest bearing deposits to 3.14% for the year ended December 31, 2002 from 4.57% for 2001. The decrease in the average cost of interest bearing deposits was primarily due to a 171 basis point decrease in the average cost of our time deposits to 3.44% for 2002 from 5.15% for 2001. The average cost of regular savings accounts decreased 27 basis points to 1.98% for 2002 and the average cost of money market deposits decreased 34 basis points to 1.97% for 2002. Partially offsetting these decreases, the average cost of interest bearing demand accounts increased 97 basis points to 2.55% for 2002 from 1.58% for 2001 due to the introduction during the second quarter of 2002 of our High Value Checking account. The decrease in the annualized average cost of interest bearing deposits reflected the low interest rate environment experienced during 2001 and 2002. The impact on the average cost of interest bearing liabilities due to possible further decreases in market interest rates may not be as favorable in future periods as short term market rates are currently at historically low levels. The impact on interest expense on deposits due to the decrease in the average cost of interest bearing deposits was offset, in part, by a $1.43 billion, or 21.3%, increase in the average balance of interest bearing deposits to $8.15 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $6.72 billion for 2001. The average balance of time deposits increased $930.0 million, or 17.3%, to $6.31 billion for 2002 from $5.38 billion for 2001. The average balance of interest bearing demand accounts increased $276.6 million to $370.8 million for 2002 from $94.2 million for 2001 due to the introduction of our High Value Checking account in the second quarter of 2002. The average balance of money market accounts increased $128.0 million to $593.0 million for 2002 from $465.0 million for 2001 and the average balance of regular savings accounts increased $93.4 million to $869.8 million for 2002 from $776.4 million for 2001. We believe the increase in the interest bearing deposits was due primarily to our consistent offering of competitive rates on our deposit products, the introduction of our interest bearing High Value Checking account and an overall decrease in investor confidence in the equity markets. Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased $101.3 million, or 35.3%, to $388.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared with $287.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Page 67 Table of Contents This increase primarily reflected our planned balance sheet growth, which resulted in increases in the average balance of both interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, and the improved net interest rate spread earned on this growth. Our net interest rate spread, the difference between the average yield on total interest earning assets and the average cost of total interest bearing liabilities, increased 54 basis points to 2.66% for the year ended December 31, 2002 from 2.12% for 2001. Our net interest margin, represented by net interest income divided by average total interest earning assets, increased 23 basis points to 3.10% for the year December 31, 2002 from 2.87% for 2001. These increases reflected our improved profitability due to the declining interest rate environment experienced during 2001 and 2002, the fact that our interest bearing liabilities repriced faster than our interest earning assets in the declining interest rate environment and our ability to grow our business with low cost interest bearing liabilities during this period. The larger increase in our net interest spread compared with the increase in our net interest margin reflected the use of investable funds to purchase treasury stock. However, during 2002, long term interest rates generally declined, while short term interest rates remained relatively stable, thus narrowing the yield curve. Provision for Loan Losses. Our provision for loan losses for the year December 31, 2002 was $1.5 million, a decrease of $0.4 million, or 21.1%, compared with $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Net charge offs for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $9,000 compared with net charge offs of $9,000 for 2001. The decrease in the provision reflected our recent low charge off history given the relative stability of the housing market. The allowance for loan losses increased $1.5 million, or 6.3%, to $25.5 million at December 31, 2002 from $24.0 million at December 31, 2001. The increase in the allowance for loan losses, through the provision for loan losses, reflected the overall growth of the loan portfolio and the level of delinquent and non performing loans. Non performing loans, defined as non accruing loans and accruing loans delinquent 90 days or more, increased $4.6 million, or 29.5%, to $20.2 million at December 31, 2002 from $15.6 million at December 31, 2001. The increase in the dollar amount of our non performing loans, which was primarily due to an increase of our non performing purchased FHA/VA loan portfolio of $4.5 million, was due to the slow economic conditions during 2002, characterized by higher unemployment. The ratio of non performing loans to total loans was 0.29% at December 31, 2002 compared with 0.26% at December 31, 2001. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans was 126.27% at December 31, 2002 compared with 153.44% at December 31, 2001. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans was 0.37% at December 31, 2002 compared with 0.40% at December 31, 2001. Non Interest Income. Total non interest income, consisting generally of service charges and fees on customer accounts, was $8.0 million and $4.7 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001. The increase in service fees and other income of $1.2 million was primarily due to a $760,000 gain on the sale of a commercial property not deemed to be a strategic part of our business plan. The $2.1 million gain on securities transactions, net, which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2002, resulted from an opportunity to restructure certain assets and liabilities to allow us to be better positioned for future changes in interest rates. The cash flow of $88.7 million from the sale of the securities was reinvested in higher yielding securities at a slightly longer duration. To match this duration extension, we restructured certain of our borrowed funds to extend their maturity and lower the contract rate. Non Interest Expense. Total non interest expense increased $11.7 million, or 14.3%, to $93.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $81.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase was primarily due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits of $8.4 million, or 16.1%, to $60.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $52.3 million for 2001. The increase in salaries Page 68 Table of Contents and employee benefits reflected routine salary increases, senior level promotions, increases in stock related compensation expense and increases in pension expense. The expense of certain of the stock related plans is based on the average market price of our common stock in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Position 93 6, Employer Accounting for Employee Stock Ownership Plans. The increase in our stock price has resulted in a $3.7 million increase in stock related compensation expense. Other expenses increased $3.2 million, or 24.4%, to $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared with $13.1 million for 2001. This increase was due, in part, to expenses related to new marketing initiatives and accelerated recognition of stock related expense due to the passing of one of our directors. Our efficiency ratio, determined by dividing non interest expense by the sum of net interest income and non interest income, was 23.59% for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared with 28.04% for the year ended December 31, 2001. Our ratio of non interest expense to average assets for the year ended December 31, 2002 was 0.73% compared with 0.80% for the year ended December 31, 2001. Income Taxes. Income tax expense increased $35.9 million, or 48.8%, to $109.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $73.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. This increase was primarily due to the $93.3 million, or 44.8% increase in income before income tax expense and changes to the New Jersey corporate business tax code. In July 2002, the New Jersey State Legislature passed the Business Tax Reform Act. This new legislation, which was retroactive to January 1, 2002, has increased our annual effective tax rate to approximately 36.5%. The overall change in income tax expense, due to the new state tax structure, was approximately $2.9 million. Our effective tax rate for 2002 was 36.29% compared with 35.33% for 2001. Liquidity and Capital Resources The term liquidity refers to our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to fund loan originations, loan purchases, deposit withdrawals and operating expenses. Our primary sources of funds are scheduled amortization and prepayments of loan principal and mortgage backed securities, deposits, borrowed funds, maturities and calls of investment securities and funds provided by our operations. Our membership in the FHLB provides us access to additional sources of borrowed funds, which is generally limited to twenty times the amount of FHLB stock owned. Deposit flows, calls of investment securities and borrowed funds, and prepayments of loans and mortgage backed securities are strongly influenced by interest rates, general and local economic conditions and competition in the marketplace. These factors reduce the predictability of the timing of these sources of funds. As mortgage interest rates decline, customer prepayment activity tends to accelerate causing an increase in cash flow from both our mortgage loan and mortgage backed security portfolios. If our pricing is competitive, the demand for mortgage originations also accelerates. When mortgage rates increase, the opposite effect tends to occur and our loan origination and purchase activity becomes increasingly dependent on the strength of our residential real estate market, home purchases and new construction activity. Principal repayments on loans were $3.63 billion during the year ended December 31, 2003 compared with $2.63 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002. Principal payments received on mortgage backed securities totaled $3.80 billion during 2003 compared to $2.38 billion during 2002. The increase in payments on loans and mortgage backed securities reflected the low market interest rate environment during 2003, which caused an increase in prepayment activity. Maturities and calls of investment securities totaled $1.33 billion during 2003 compared with maturities and calls of $203.4 million during Page 69 Table of Contents 2002. The higher amount of calls during 2003 was due to the continuing declining interest rate environment experienced during 2003 and the larger balance of callable investment securities held during 2003 compared with the amount of callable investment securities held during 2002. Total deposits increased $1.32 billion during the year ended December 31, 2003 compared with an increase of $1.23 billion during the year ended December 31, 2002. Deposit flows are affected by the level of market interest rates, the interest rates and products offered by competitors, the volatility of equity markets, and other factors. We believe the increase in interest bearing deposits was due primarily to our consistent offering of competitive rates on our deposit products, primarily on our interest bearing High Value Checking account. Time deposit accounts scheduled to mature within one year were $4.61 billion at December 31, 2003. Based on our deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy, we anticipate that a significant portion of these time deposits will remain with us. We are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position; therefore we monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis. We anticipate that we will have sufficient resources to meet this current funding commitment. For the year ended December 31, 2003 we borrowed $2.03 billion compared with new borrowings of $1.45 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002. Principal payments on borrowed funds during 2003 were $475.0 million. There were no principal payments on borrowed funds during 2002. The funds borrowed during 2003 had initial call dates of three months to three years from the date of borrowing. These short and intermediate term borrowed funds complement the $3.60 billion of previously existing long term borrowings. At December 31, 2003, there were $50.0 million of borrowed funds scheduled to mature within one year, and $1.40 billion of borrowed funds with the potential to be called within one year. We anticipate we will have sufficient resources to meet either funding commitment by borrowing new funds at the prevailing market interest rate, or paying off the borrowed funds, as they mature or are called, from our usual cash flow sources. Our primary investing activities are the origination and purchase of one to four family real estate loans and consumer and other loans, the purchase of mortgage backed securities, and the purchase of investment securities. We originated total loans of $2.27 billion during the year ended December 31, 2003 compared with $1.91 billion during the year ended December 31, 2002. We purchased total loans of $3.21 billion during 2003 compared with $1.72 billion during 2002. The increase in loan originations and purchases reflected the investment of the proceeds from the accelerated prepayment activity during 2003. The increase also reflected the growth strategies we have employed during recent periods, using customer deposits and borrowed funds as our funding sources. Purchases of mortgage backed securities during the year ended December 31, 2003 were $4.53 billion compared with $3.57 billion during the year ended December 31, 2002. Of the mortgage backed securities purchased in 2003, $1.58 billion were real estate mortgage investment conduits (REMIC). The REMIC purchases in 2003 had fixed interest rates and generally had shorter average lives compared with alternate mortgage backed security investments available at the time of purchase. Of the mortgage backed securities purchased in 2003, $1.49 billion were classified as available for sale. Of these available for sale purchases, $1.37 billion had fixed interest rates. The increase in purchases of mortgage backed securities was related to the increase in prepayment activity due to the low market interest rate environment experienced during 2003. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we purchased $3.09 billion of investment securities available for sale compared with purchases of $598.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase in purchases of investment securities available for sale primarily reflected the investment of part of the cash flow from the high levels of prepayment activity on our mortgage related assets into investment securities. The increase in investment securities also reflected our decision to shorten the Page 70 Table of Contents overall weighted average life of our assets by investing in callable government sponsored agency securities with initial call dates of three months to one year and terms to maturity of generally under ten years. As part of the membership requirements of the FHLB, we are required to hold a certain dollar amount of FHLB common stock. During 2003, we purchased $27.4 million of FHLB common stock compared with purchases of $56.4 million during 2002. The purchases made during 2003 brought our total investment in FHLB stock to $164.9 million, the amount we are currently required to hold. Under our stock repurchase programs, shares of Hudson City Bancorp common stock may be purchased in the open market and through other privately negotiated transactions, from time to time, depending on market conditions. The repurchased shares are held as treasury stock for general corporate use. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we purchased 3,667,375 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $101.1 million. During the first quarter of 2003, the Board of Directors approved our fifth stock repurchase program. This program authorized the repurchase of up to 9,525,000 shares of common stock. At December 31, 2003, there were 7,666,421 shares remaining to be repurchased under the existing stock repurchase program. Cash dividends declared and paid during 2003 were $95.6 million compared with $64.5 million during 2002. The dividend pay out ratio for 2003 was 45.61% compared with 33.17% for 2002. On January 22, 2004, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of sixteen cents ($0.16) per common share. The dividend was paid on March 1, 2004 to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 6, 2004. At December 31, 2003, Hudson City Bancorp and Hudson City Savings exceeded all regulatory capital requirements. Hudson City Bancorps leverage capital ratio, tier 1 risk based capital ratio and total risk based capital ratio were 8.14%, 22.12% and 22.56%, respectively. Hudson City Savings leverage capital ratio, tier 1 risk based capital ratio and total risk based capital ratio were 7.52%, 20.45% and 20.89%, respectively. The primary source of liquidity for Hudson City Bancorp, the holding company of Hudson City Savings, is capital distributions from the banking subsidiary. During 2003, Hudson City Bancorp received $199.2 million in dividend payments from Hudson City Savings, which amounted to 97.3% of Hudson City Savings net income for that year. The primary use of these funds is the payment of dividends to our shareholders and the repurchase of our common stock. Hudson City Bancorps ability to continue these activities is solely dependent upon capital distributions from Hudson City Savings. Applicable federal law may limit the amount of capital distributions Hudson City Savings may make. In the first quarter of 2004, we applied for and were granted approval to waive dividends payments to Hudson City, MHC, the holding company of Hudson City Bancorp. This dividend waiver will provide additional operating capital at Hudson City Bancorp. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Hudson City is a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements, which occur in the normal course of our business, to meet the credit needs of our customers and the growth initiatives of the Bank. These arrangements are primarily commitments to originate and purchase mortgage loans, and to purchase mortgage backed securities. We did not engage in any hedging transactions that use derivative instruments (such as interest rate swaps and caps) during 2003 and did not have any such hedging transactions in place at December 31, 2003, which would create other off balance sheet arrangements. Page 71 Table of Contents The following table reports the amounts of contractual obligations for Hudson City as of December 31, 2003. Payments Due By Period Less Than 1 Year to 3 Years to More Than Contractual Obligation Total 1 Year 3 Years 5 Years 5 Years (In thousands) First mortgage loans $ 112,554 $ 112,554 $ $ $ Mortgage loan purchases 274,549 274,549 Mortgage backed security purchases 300,000 300,000 Operating leases 19,446 3,460 5,966 4,816 5,204 Total $ 706,549 $ 690,563 $ 5,966 $ 4,816 $ 5,204 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend money to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments to fund first mortgage loans generally have fixed expiration dates of approximately 90 days and other termination clauses. Since some commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Hudson City Savings evaluates each customers credit worthiness on a case by case basis. Additionally, we have available home equity and overdraft lines of credit, which do not have fixed expiration dates, of approximately $86.0 million. We are not obligated to advance further amounts on credit lines if the customer is delinquent, or otherwise in violation of the agreement. The commitments to purchase first mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities had a normal period from trade date to settlement date of approximately 60 days. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirement of Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 addresses disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under guarantees. The interpretation also requires the recognition, at estimated fair value, of a liability by the guarantor at the inception of certain guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements of FIN 45 were effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. The recognition and measurement provisions are applicable prospectively to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 149 was generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, and for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003, and should generally be applied prospectively. The provisions of SFAS No. 149 that relate to SFAS No. 133 Implementation Issues that have been effective for fiscal quarters that began prior to June 15, 2003, should continue to be applied in accordance with their respective effective dates. In addition, the provisions of SFAS No. 149 which relate to forward purchases or sales of when issued securities or other securities that do not yet exist, were applied to both existing contracts and new contracts entered into after June 30, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 149 did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Page 72 Table of Contents In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity, which requires issuers of certain financial instruments, falling within the scope of SFAS No. 150, with characteristics of both liabilities and equity to be classified and measured as liabilities. SFAS No. 150 was effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. For financial instruments created before the issuance date of SFAS No. 150 and still existing at the beginning of the interim period of adoption, SFAS No. 150 was to be implemented by reporting the cumulative effect of a change in an accounting principle. Restatement is not permitted. The adoption of SFAS No. 150 did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46), was issued in January 2003 and was reissued as FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003) (FIN 46R). For public entities, FIN 46R is applicable no later than the end of the first reporting period ending after December 15, 2003 to all special purpose entities (SPEs) in which the entity holds a variable interest. FIN 46R may be applied prospectively with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date on which it is first applied or by restating previously issued financial statements for one or more years with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the beginning of the first year restated. FIN 46 and FIN 46R provides guidance on the identification of entities controlled through means other than voting rights. FIN 46 and FIN 46R specifies how a business enterprise should evaluate its interest in a variable interest entity to determine whether to consolidate that entity. A variable interest entity must be consolidated by its primary beneficiary if the entity does not effectively disperse risks among the parties involved. We adopted FIN 46R as of December 31, 2003. The adoption of FIN 46 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 132 (revised), Employers Disclosures about Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits. SFAS No. 132 (revised) prescribes employers disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans; it does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans. SFAS No. 132 (revised) retains and revises the disclosure requirements contained in the original SFAS No. 132. It also requires additional disclosures about the assets, obligations, cash flows, and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. The Statement generally is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003. Our disclosures in Note 10 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report incorporate the requirements of SFAS No. 132 (revised). On January 12, 2004, The FASB issued Staff Position No. 106 1 Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, which allows companies to recognize or defer recognizing the effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, or Medicare Act, for annual financial statements of fiscal years ending after December 7, 2003. The Medicare Act introduced both a Medicare prescription drug benefit and a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care plans that provide a benefit at least actuarially equivalent to the Medicare benefit. These provisions of the Medicare Act will affect accounting measurements. We have elected to defer accounting for the effects of the Medicare Act. The specific authoritative guidance on accounting for the federal subsidy is pending and the issued guidance could require us to change previously reported information. As a result, we have not yet determined the impact of the Medicare Act on our financial condition or results of operations. Page 73 Table of Contents Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices The Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Hudson City Bancorp have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, commonly referred as GAAP. GAAP generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations. Unlike industrial companies, our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature. As a result, changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than do the effects of inflation. Critical Accounting Policies Note 1 to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report contains a summary of our significant accounting policies. We believe our policies with respect to the methodology for our determination of the allowance for loan losses and asset impairment judgments, including other than temporary declines in the value of our securities, involve a higher degree of complexity and require management to make difficult and subjective judgments which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters. Changes in these judgments, assumptions or estimates could cause reported results to differ materially. These critical policies and their application are periodically reviewed with the Audit Committee and our Board of Directors. Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses has been determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, under which we are required to maintain adequate allowances for loan losses. We are responsible for the timely and periodic determination of the amount of the allowance required. We believe that our allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover specifically identifiable loan losses, as well as estimated losses inherent in our portfolio for which certain losses are probable but not specifically identifiable. As part of our evaluation of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses, each month we prepare a worksheet. This worksheet categorizes the entire loan portfolio by certain risk characteristics such as loan type (one to four family, multi family, etc.) and payment status (i.e., current or number of days delinquent). Loans with known potential losses are categorized separately. We assign potential loss factors to the payment status categories on the basis of our assessment of the potential risk inherent in each loan type. We use this worksheet, together with loan portfolio balances and delinquency reports, to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Other key factors we consider in this process are current real estate market conditions, changes in the trend of non performing loans, the current state of the local and national economy and loan portfolio growth. We maintain the allowance for loan losses through provisions for loan losses that we charge to income. We charge losses on loans against the allowance for loan losses when we believe the collection of loan principal is unlikely. We establish the provision for loan losses after considering the results of our review of delinquency and charge off trends, the allowance for loan loss worksheet, the amount of the allowance for loan losses in relation to the total loan balance, loan portfolio growth, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and regulatory guidance. We have applied this process consistently and we have made minimal changes in the estimation methods and assumptions that we have used. Our primary lending emphasis is the origination and purchase of one to four family first mortgage loans on residential properties and, to a lesser extent, second mortgage loans on one to four family residential Page 74 Table of Contents properties. As a result of our lending emphasis, we had a loan concentration in residential first mortgage loans at December 31, 2003, the majority of which are secured by real property located in New Jersey. Based on the composition of our loan portfolio and the growth in our loan portfolio, we believe the primary risks inherent in our portfolio are possible increases in interest rates, a decline in the economy, generally, and a decline in real estate market values. Any one or a combination of these events may adversely affect our loan portfolio resulting in increased delinquencies, loan losses and future levels of provisions. Accordingly, we have maintained our provision for loan losses at the current level to primarily address the actual growth in our loan portfolio. We consider it important to maintain the ratio of our allowance for loan losses to total loans at an acceptable level given current economic conditions, interest rates and the composition of our portfolio. At December 31, 2003, the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 0.30%. Because of the primary emphasis of our lending practices and the current market conditions, we consider 0.30% to be at an acceptable level. Furthermore, the increase in the allowance for loan losses each year reflected the continued growth in the loan portfolio, the relatively low levels of loan charge offs, the stability in the real estate market during those years and the resulting stability in our overall loan quality. Although we believe that we have established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at adequate levels, additions may be necessary if future economic and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment. Although management uses the best information available, the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate that is subject to significant judgment and short term change. Asset Impairment Judgments. Certain of our assets are carried in our consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or at the lower of cost or fair value. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to recognize impairment of such assets. We periodically perform analyses to test for impairment of various assets. In addition to our impairment analyses related to loans discussed above, another significant impairment analysis relates to the value of other than temporary declines in the value of our securities. Our available for sale portfolio is carried at estimated fair value, with any unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity. The securities which we have the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and are carried at amortized cost. We conduct a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if the value of any security has declined below its carrying value and whether such decline is other than temporary. If such decline is deemed other than temporary, we would adjust the carrying amount of the security by writing down the security to fair market value through a charge to current period operations. The market values of our securities are significantly affected by changes in interest rates. In general, as interest rates rise, the market value of fixed rate securities will decrease; as interest rates fall, the market value of fixed rate securities will increase. With significant changes in interest rates, we evaluate our intent and ability to hold the security to maturity or for a sufficient time to recover the recorded principal balance. Estimated fair values for securities are based on published or securities dealers market values. Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
