Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Hudson City Bancorps Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, and the other statistical data provided elsewhere in this document. Executive Summary Our results of operations depend primarily on net interest income, which, in part, is a direct result of the market interest rate environment. Our results of operations may also be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions, particularly those with respect to changes in market interest rates, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. Our results are also affected by the price of our stock, as the expense of certain of our employee stock compensation plans is related to the current price of our common stock. Our net income for 2004 grew $31.9 million to $239.3 million. Basic and diluted earnings per share for 2004 were $1.33 and $1.29, respectively. The increase in net income was primarily the result of the growth of our assets to $20.15 billion at December 31, 2004 from $17.03 billion at December 31, 2003. Our return on average assets for 2004 was 1.29%. Our asset growth was funded from a $2.0 billion increase in borrowed funds and a $1.03 billion increase in total deposits. Stockholders equity grew $73.5 million during 2004, with repurchases of common stock partially offsetting growth due to net income. Our return on average stockholders equity for 2004 was 17.66%. During 2004, we continued to grow our balance sheet consistent with our traditional thrift business model and the growth initiatives we have employed during recent periods. Our balance sheet growth, primarily due to increases in residential first mortgage loans and callable government sponsored agency securities classified as held to maturity, was funded principally by customer deposits and borrowed funds. The growth in our core investment of residential first mortgage loans was due to our continued strong levels of loan purchases that allows us to grow and geographically diversify our mortgage loan portfolio at a relatively low overhead cost while maintaining our traditional thrift business model. The growth in customer deposits was primarily due to the continued success of our interest bearing High Value Checking account. Borrowed funds were increased to meet the goals of our growth initiatives and to take advantage of the still historically low interest rate environment. Our ability to grow our business with relatively low cost interest bearing liabilities, notwithstanding the general increase in short term interest rates, resulted in the increase in our net interest income during the year ended December 31, 2004. Short term market interest rates generally increased during 2004, primarily during the last three quarters of the year. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) of the Federal Reserve Bank increased the overnight lending rate 25 basis points at each of the five regularly scheduled meetings beginning in June 2004. The rates we paid on our deposit products, which are generally tied to short term market rates, also increased during 2004. Overall, during 2004, long term market interest rates generally decreased, notwithstanding an increase during the second quarter of 2004. The rates we earned on our mortgage loans, which are generally tied to long term market rates, also decreased during 2004. This general increase in short term interest rates, in conjunction with the slight decrease in long term interest rates, has flattened the market yield curve. Page 53 Table of Contents Despite the impact on our 2004 net interest income due to the increases in short term interest rates, the flattening of the market yield, and the timing impact of placement of interest sensitive assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, both our net interest rate spread and net interest margin increased during 2004 due to the proportionally larger growth of our first mortgage loans when compared to total interest earning assets, as the interest rate earned on first mortgage loans is greater than the overall yield on our total interest earning assets. We anticipate short term market interest rates will continue to increase in 2005, and long term market interest rates will begin to increase, but not as fast as short term interest rates. The result of this potential market interest rate scenario would be a further flattening of the market yield curve, which would cause the spread between long term interest rates and short term interest rates to decrease. If this occurs, the resulting interest rate environment is expected to have a negative impact on our results of operations as our interest bearing liabilities, both deposits and borrowed funds, generally price off short term interest rates, while our interest earning assets, both mortgage loans and securities, generally price off long term interest rates. If both short and long term interest rates increase by the same amount, and the shape of the yield curve does not change, the resulting environment is also likely to have a negative impact on our results of operations, as our interest bearing liabilities will reset to the current market interest rate faster than our interest earning assets. Prepayment activity decreased on our mortgage related assets during 2004 when compared to the prepayment activity experienced during 2003. This decrease in prepayment activity was due to the general stability of long term interest rates during the second half of 2003 and 2004, notwithstanding the slight decreases in long term interest rates during 2004. The decrease in prepayment rates was also due to the large volume of refinancing and modification activity that occurred during the declining interest rate environment of 2003. The mortgage related assets that were purchased or originated with the cash flows from this prepayment activity will not tend to prepay as fast, as their contractual interest rate is relatively low. The slowing of the prepayment activity in turn decreased the amount of related premium amortized on these assets during 2004. The decrease in the prepayment activity and the slowing of the premium amortization generally had a positive impact on our net interest income, net interest rate spread and net interest margin for 2004 when compared to 2003. The low interest rate environment of 2004 afforded us the opportunity to realize gains on certain of our mortgage backed securities prior to interest rate changes, such as the long term interest rate increase seen in the second quarter of 2004, which would have adversely affected their fair market value. The low market interest rates caused increases in the fair market value of the fixed rate mortgage backed securities sold. The larger volume of sales and larger gain reported for 2003, when compared with the gain reported for 2004, resulted from the enhanced opportunities to realize gains on sales due to the declining interest rate environment experienced during 2003. We may continue to realize gains on the sale of securities if given the opportunity to sell these assets in a favorable interest rate environment and reinvest the proceeds advantageously. We expect to continue to grow our assets primarily through the origination and purchase of mortgage loans, while purchasing investment and mortgage backed securities as a supplement to our mortgage loans. We plan that approximately half of these originations and purchases will be short term or variable rate in nature, in order to assist in the management of interest rate risk. The primary funding for our asset growth is expected to come from customer deposits and borrowed funds, also using borrowed funds as a means to extend the maturity of our liabilities. We plan that the funds borrowed will have initial reprice or maturity dates of three to five years in order to assist in the management of interest rate risk. Page 54 Table of Contents We intend to grow customer deposits by continuing to offer desirable products at competitive rates and by opening new branch offices. We opened three additional branch offices in New Jersey and our first branch in Suffolk County, NY during 2004. We have received regulatory approval to open an additional three branch offices in New Jersey and four additional branch offices in Suffolk County. We also plan to open two branch offices in Staten Island, NY during the first half of 2005. We will continue to explore branch expansion opportunities in market areas that present significant opportunities for our traditional thrift business model and intend to open ten to fifteen branches per year. Although new branching activity results in additional expenses, overall we continue to maintain a low level of operating expenses. Effective January 1, 2004, Hudson City Savings converted to a federal savings bank charter and became subject to supervision and regulation by the OTS. Hudson City Bancorp and Hudson City, MHC, as savings and loan holding companies, are also subject to supervision and regulation by the OTS. On December 16, 2004, the Boards of Directors of Hudson City Bancorp, Hudson City Savings and Hudson City, MHC unanimously adopted a Plan of Conversion and Reorganization (the Plan). Under the terms of the Plan, Hudson City Savings will reorganize from the two tier mutual holding company structure to a stock holding company structure and Hudson City Bancorp will undertake a second step stock offering of new shares of common stock. Hudson City, MHC will be merged into Hudson City Bancorp as part of the reorganization. The transactions contemplated by the Plan are subject to the approval of Hudson City Savings depositors, Hudson City Bancorps stockholders (other than Hudson City, MHC) and regulatory agencies. We believe the transactions should be completed in the second quarter of 2005. Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003 During 2004, our total assets increased $3.12 billion, or 18.3%, to $20.15 billion at December 31, 2004 from $17.03 billion at December 31, 2003. Loans increased $2.56 billion, or 29.1%, to $11.36 billion at December 31, 2004 from $8.80 billion at December 31, 2003. The increase in loans reflected our loan purchase activity, our continued focus on the origination of one to four family first mortgage loans, primarily in New Jersey and the New York metropolitan area, and a significant decline in loan prepayment activity during the period. For 2004, we purchased first mortgage loans of $3.12 billion and originated first mortgage loans of $1.38 billion, compared with purchases of $3.21 billion and originations of $2.17 billion for 2003. The larger volume of purchased mortgage loans, when compared to the amount of mortgage loans originated, allowed us to grow and geographically diversify our mortgage loan portfolio at a relatively low overhead cost while maintaining our traditional thrift business model. We will continue to purchase mortgage loans to grow and diversify our portfolio, as opportunities and funding are available. The lower volume of origination activity was primarily due to a decline in refinancing activity. Our first mortgage loan originations and purchases were exclusively in one to four family mortgage loans and were primarily fixed rate loans. At December 31, 2004, fixed rate mortgage loans accounted for 92.5% of our first mortgage loan portfolio compared with 90.9% at December 31, 2003. This percentage of fixed rate loans to total loans may have an adverse impact on our earnings in a rising rate environment as the interest rate on these loans would not reprice, while our interest bearing deposits and callable borrowed funds would reprice, from time to time, to the higher market interest rates. Page 55 Table of Contents During 2004, $144.0 million of our loan originations were the result of refinancing of our existing mortgage loans compared with $530.4 million during 2003. The dollar amount of refinancing of existing mortgage loans was included in total loan originations. We allow customers with Hudson City originated loans to modify, for a fee, their existing mortgage loans with the intent of maintaining customer relationships in periods of extensive refinancing due to low long term interest rates. In general, all terms and conditions of the existing mortgage loan remain the same except the adjustment of the interest rate to the currently offered fixed rate product with a similar term to maturity or to a reduced term at the request of the borrower. Modifications of our existing mortgage loans during 2004 were approximately $220.1 million compared with $1.46 billion during 2003. These loan modifications were not reflected in loan origination totals. We feel loan refinancing and modification activity are inversely related to the level of interest rates. The decrease in the refinancing and modification activity, when comparing the 2004 activity to the 2003 activity, was due to the general stability of long term interest rates during 2004 compared to the steeply declining interest rate environment during the first half of 2003 and prior periods. If long term rates increase or remain relatively stable, we expect the amount of loan refinancings and modifications to remain at the 2004 levels or decrease. Investment securities held to maturity increased to $1.33 billion at December 31, 2004 from $1.4 million at December 31, 2003. During 2004, we began to classify certain of our government sponsored agency security purchases as held to maturity. This increase in investment securities held to maturity reflected, in part, the subsequent reinvestment of part of the resulting cash flows from the $649.2 million decrease of investment securities available for sale due to calls of such securities during 2004. The increase in investment securities held to maturity also represented a strategy to shorten the overall final maturity of our interest earning assets, while continuing to grow our balance sheet, by investing a portion of the cash flows from our mortgage related assets into investment securities. Of the agency securities purchased and classified as held to maturity, $621.6 million have step up features, where the interest rate is increased on scheduled future dates. These securities have call options that are generally effective prior to the initial rate increase but after an initial non call period of three months to one year. The initial rate for the securities purchased was higher than interest rates on similar agency securities offered at the time of purchase without the step up feature. The rate increases are at least one percent per adjustment and are fixed over the life of the security. Overall, the aggregate balance of the mortgage backed securities portfolio remained relatively stable at $5.38 billion at December 31, 2004 compared with $5.42 billion at December 31, 2003. Payments received on mortgage backed securities were primarily reinvested into fixed rate mortgage backed securities at the prevailing market interest rates. Accrued interest receivable increased $17.3 million, primarily due to increased balances in loans and investments. Fixed assets increased $5.0 million primarily due to our branch expansion. Total liabilities increased $3.04 billion, or 19.4%, to $18.74 billion at December 31, 2004 compared with $15.70 billion at December 31, 2003. Total deposits increased $1.03 billion, or 9.8%, to $11.48 billion at December 31, 2004 from $10.45 billion at December 31, 2003. The increase in total deposits was primarily used to fund our growth initiatives. Interest bearing deposits increased $1.00 billion primarily due to an increase of $1.48 billion in our interest bearing High Value Checking account product, partially offset by a $405.8 million decrease in time deposits. We believe the increase in interest bearing deposits was due primarily to our consistent offering of competitive rates on our interest bearing High Value Checking account product. The balance in the High Value Checking account at December 31, 2004 was $4.19 billion compared with $2.71 billion at December 31, 2003. We believe the decrease in time deposits was due, in part, to transfers to our High Value Checking account and significant competition for deposits in the New York metropolitan area. Page 56 Table of Contents Borrowed funds increased $2.00 billion, or 38.8%, to $7.15 billion at December 31, 2004 from $5.15 billion at December 31, 2003. The additional borrowed funds were primarily used to fund our asset growth. Borrowed funds were comprised of $5.30 billion of securities sold under agreements to repurchase and $1.85 billion of FHLB advances. Securities pledged as collateral against our securities sold under agreements to repurchase had a market value at December 31, 2004 of approximately $5.63 billion. Advances from the FHLB utilize our mortgage portfolio as collateral. The $3.75 billion in new borrowings, which had initial call dates of predominately two to four years from the date of borrowing, were partially offset by calls and maturities of borrowed funds in an aggregate amount of $1.75 billion. Total stockholders equity increased $73.5 million, or 5.5%, to $1.40 billion at December 31, 2004 from $1.33 billion at December 31, 2003. The increase in stockholders equity was primarily due to net income of $239.3 million for 2004, a $6.5 million increase due to the exercise of 900,198 stock options, a $20.9 million permanent tax benefit due to the exercise of stock options and the vesting of employee stock benefit plans, and a $19.5 million increase due to the commitment of shares for our employee stock benefit plans. These increases to stockholders equity were partially offset by repurchases of 4,590,200 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $161.7 million, purchases of 200,000 shares of common stock for our recognition and retention plan at an aggregate cost of $7.3 million, cash dividends declared and paid to common stockholders of $40.5 million and a $3.1 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss primarily due to a decrease in the fair value of our available for sale investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2004 there remained 3,076,221 shares authorized to be purchased under our current stock repurchase program. The decrease from prior years in the amount of the cash dividend paid to common stockholders reflects the waiver of receipt of the dividend by Hudson City, MHC, the majority stockholder of Hudson City Bancorp in accordance with the regulations and policies of the OTS. Prior to 2004, Hudson City, MHC was subject to the policies of the FDIC, which did not permit dividend waivers. At December 31, 2004, the ratio of total stockholders equity to total assets was 6.96% compared with 7.80% at December 31, 2003. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the ratio of average stockholders equity to average assets was 7.29% compared with 8.73% for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease in these ratios was primarily due to our capital management strategy of planned asset growth, and a slower percentage growth in stockholders equity as compared to the percentage growth in assets, due to payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases. Stockholders equity per common share was $7.85 at December 31, 2004 compared with $7.33 at December 31, 2003. Analysis of Net Interest Income Net interest income represents the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets, such as mortgage loans, mortgage backed securities and investment securities, and the expense we pay on interest bearing liabilities, such as time deposits and borrowed funds. Net interest income depends on our volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates we earned or paid on them. Page 57 Table of Contents Average Balance Sheet. The following table presents certain information regarding our financial condition and net interest income for 2004, 2003, and 2002. The table presents the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities for the periods indicated. We derived the yields and costs by dividing income or expense by the average balance of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities, respectively, for the periods shown. We derived average balances from daily balances over the periods indicated. Interest income includes fees that we considered adjustments to yields. Yields on tax exempt obligations were not computed on a tax equivalent basis.

(3) Determined by dividing net interest income by average total interest earning assets. Page 59 Table of Contents Rate/Volume Analysis. The following table presents the extent to which the changes in interest rates and the changes in volume of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected our interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated. Information is provided in each category with respect to: changes attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate); changes attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume); and the net change. The changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to rate. 2004 Compared to 2003 2003 Compared to 2002 Increase (Decrease) Due To Increase (Decrease) Due To Volume Rate Net Volume Rate Net (In thousands) Interest earning assets: First mortgage loans, net $ 155,901 $ (30,352 ) $ 125,549 $ 41,578 $ (67,234 ) $ (25,656 ) Consumer and other loans 960 (689 ) 271 (713 ) (935 ) (1,648 ) Federal funds sold (540 ) 326 (214 ) 242 (875 ) (633 ) Mortgage backed securities (25,313 ) (587 ) (25,900 ) 25,625 (65,133 ) (39,508 ) Federal Home Loan Bank stock (181 ) (1,030 ) (1,211 ) 2,064 (2,642 ) (578 ) Investment securities 41,920 (2,685 ) 39,235 66,479 (5,345 ) 61,134 Total 172,747 (35,017 ) 137,730 135,275 (142,164 ) (6,889 ) Interest bearing liabilities: Savings accounts 175 (1,496 ) (1,321 ) 1,075 (7,607 ) (6,532 ) Interest bearing demand accounts 35,836 398 36,234 35,492 (1,426 ) 34,066 Money market accounts (331 ) (877 ) (1,208 ) 573 (5,381 ) (4,808 ) Time deposits (11,613 ) (16,618 ) (28,231 ) (11,222 ) (57,940 ) (69,162 ) Borrowed funds 73,146 (24,908 ) 48,238 53,248 (26,232 ) 27,016 Total 97,213 (43,501 ) 53,712 79,166 (98,586 ) (19,420 ) Net change in net interest income $ 75,534 $ 8,484 $ 84,018 $ 56,109 $ (43,578 ) $ 12,531 Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 General. Net income was $239.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $31.9 million, or 15.4%, compared with net income of $207.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Basic and diluted earnings per common share were $1.33 and $1.29, respectively, for 2004 compared with basic and diluted earnings per share of $1.14 and $1.11, respectively, for 2003. For the year ended December 31, 2004 our return on average stockholders equity was 17.66% compared with 15.38% for 2003. The increase in the return on average stockholders equity was primarily due to the growth of our net income and a slower percentage growth of stockholders equity due to payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases. Our return on average assets for 2004 was 1.29% compared with 1.34% for 2003. The decrease in the return on average assets was primarily due to our overall balance sheet growth in the prevailing interest rate environments of 2003 and 2004. Page 60 Table of Contents Interest and Dividend Income. Total interest and dividend income increased $137.8 million, or 17.7%, to $915.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared with $777.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in total interest and dividend income was primarily due to a $3.12 billion, or 20.6%, increase in the average balance of total interest earning assets to $18.25 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared with $15.13 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003. The growth in the average balance of total interest earning assets was consistent with the growth initiatives employed by us during recent periods. The impact on interest and dividend income from the increase in the average balance of our total interest earning assets was partially off set by a 13 basis point decrease in the average yield on total interest earning assets to 5.01% for 2004 from 5.14% for 2003, primarily reflecting the growth of our interest earning assets during the prevailing interest rate environments of 2003 and 2004. The $125.6 million increase in interest and fee income on first mortgage loans was primarily due to a $2.79 billion increase in the average balance of first mortgage loans, which reflected our continued emphasis on balance sheet growth in our core business of first mortgage loans. The increase in mortgage loan income due to the increase in the average balance was partially offset by a 41 basis point decrease in the average yield, which reflected the large volume of loan origination and purchase activity during the prevailing long term interest rate environments of 2003 and 2004. The $39.2 million increase in interest and dividends on total investment securities was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of investment securities of $938.0 million, which reflected the subsequent reinvestment of certain of the cash flows from the prepayment activity on our mortgage related assets in 2003 and 2004 into investment securities, and was consistent with the decision to shorten the overall weighted average life of our interest earning assets by investing in callable securities with initial call dates of three months to one year and final maturity dates of five to seven years. The increase in income on total investment securities due to the increase in the average balance was partially offset by a 15 basis point decrease in the average yield on our investment securities, which reflected the large volume of purchases made during the prevailing interest rate environments of 2003 and 2004. The $25.9 million decrease in interest income on total mortgage backed securities was primarily due to a $568.9 million decrease in the average balance of total mortgage backed securities, which reflected the high volume of prepayment activity, the sales of mortgage backed securities available for sale, and the subsequent reinvestment of certain of the resulting cash flows into investment securities or purchased mortgage loans. The decrease in interest income on total mortgage backed securities also reflected a 1 basis point decrease in the average yield on mortgage backed securities. The impact on mortgage backed securities interest income of the decline in the average balance and weighted average yield was partially offset by the slowing of the net premium amortization due to the decline in prepayment activity during the second half of 2003 and 2004. Interest Expense. Total interest expense, comprised of interest on deposits and interest on borrowed funds, increased $53.7 million, or 14.3%, to $430.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $376.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily due to a $3.11 billion, or 22.9%, increase in the average balance of total interest bearing liabilities to $16.69 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared with $13.58 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003. The impact of the increase in the average balance of total interest bearing liabilities was offset, in part, by a 19 basis point decrease in the average cost of total interest bearing liabilities to 2.58% for 2004 from 2.77% for 2003. Page 61 Table of Contents Interest expense on borrowed funds increased $48.3 million primarily due to a $2.01 billion increase in the average balance of borrowed funds to $6.10 billion for 2004, the impact of which was partially offset by a 55 basis point decrease in the average cost of borrowed funds to 3.53% for 2004. The increase in the average balance of borrowed funds was used to fund asset growth. The decrease in the average cost of borrowed funds reflected the continued growth of our borrowed funds in the prevailing interest rate environments that existed during 2003 and 2004. We intend to continue to use borrowed funds as a funding source for our asset growth initiatives, with new borrowings primarily having periods to initial repricing of three to five years. Interest expense on interest bearing deposits increased $5.5 million primarily due to a $1.10 billion increase in the average balance of interest bearing deposits to $10.59 billion for 2004, the impact of which was partially offset by an 18 basis point decrease in the average cost to 2.03%. The increase in the average balance of interest bearing deposits, primarily used to fund asset growth, reflected a $1.61 billion increase in the average balance of interest bearing demand accounts due to the growth in our High Value Checking account product. We believe the increase in the average balance of interest bearing deposits was primarily due to our consistent offering of competitive rates on our High Value Checking account product. We believe the $487.9 million decrease in the average balance of time deposits was due in part to transfers to our High Value Checking account and significant competition for deposits in the New York metropolitan area. We intend to continue to fund future asset growth using customer deposits as our primary source of funds, by continuing to pay competitive rates and by opening new branch offices, while supplementing the deposit growth with borrowed funds. The 18 basis point decrease in the average cost of interest bearing deposits primarily reflected a 29 basis point decrease in the average cost of our time deposits, a 16 basis point decrease in the average cost of savings accounts and a 14 basis point decrease in the average cost of money market accounts. These decreases were partially offset by a 2 basis point increase in the average cost of interest bearing demand deposits reflecting the increasing short term interest rate environment of 2004. This decrease in the average cost of interest bearing deposits reflected the prevailing interest rate environments experienced during 2003 and 2004. Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased $84.0 million, or 20.9%, to $485.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared with $401.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase primarily reflected our growth initiatives, which resulted in increases in the average balance of both interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, and the net interest rate spread earned on this growth. Our net interest rate spread, determined by subtracting the weighted average cost of total interest bearing liabilities from the weighted average yield on total interest earning assets, increased 6 basis points to 2.43% for 2004 from 2.37% for 2003. Our net interest margin, determined by dividing net interest income by total average interest earning assets, increased 1 basis point to 2.66% for 2004 from 2.65% for 2003. The increases in these ratios reflected the larger decrease in the cost of total interest bearing liabilities compared with the decrease in the yield of total interest earning assets primarily due to the decreased prepayment activity on our mortgage related assets, and the resulting decrease in the amortization of the net premium on these assets. The increase in these ratios also reflected the overall shift in our asset mix towards first mortgage loans, which have a higher yield than our other interest earning assets, the impact of which was partially offset by an overall shift in our liability mix toward borrowed funds, which have a higher average rate than our other interest bearing liabilities. Page 62 Table of Contents Provision for Loan Losses. Our provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $790,000 compared with $900,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003. Net charge offs for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $18,000 compared with net recoveries of $146,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003. The allowance for loan losses increased $772,000 to $27.3 million at December 31, 2004 from $26.5 million at December 31, 2003. The increase in the allowance for loan losses, through the provision for loan losses, reflected the overall growth of the loan portfolio, increases in non performing loans and low levels of charge offs. Non performing loans, defined as non accruing loans and accruing loans delinquent 90 days or more, increased $1.3 million to $21.6 million at December 31, 2004 from $20.3 million at December 31, 2003, primarily reflecting increases in non accrual loans. The ratio of non performing loans to total loans was 0.19% at December 31, 2004 compared with 0.23% at December 31, 2003. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans was 126.44% at December 31, 2004 compared with 131.09% at December 31, 2003. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans was 0.24% at December 31, 2004 compared with 0.30% at December 31, 2003. During 2004, we lowered the loss factors used in our worksheet on our purchased mortgage loans to reflect the seasoning of the portfolio, and the charge off and delinquency experience. Notwithstanding such decrease, we have maintained a minimal provision for loan losses during 2004 to reflect expected losses resulting from the actual growth in our loan portfolio. We consider the ratio of allowance for loan losses to total loans at December 31, 2004, given our primary lending emphasis and current market conditions, to be at an acceptable level. Furthermore, the increase in the allowance for loan losses during 2004 reflected the growth in the loan portfolio, the low levels of loan charge offs, the stability in the real estate market and the resulting stability in our overall loan quality. Although we believe that we have established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at adequate levels, additions may be necessary if future economic and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment. Although we use the best information available, the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate that is subject to significant judgment and short term change. See Critical Accounting Policies. Non Interest Income. Total non interest income decreased $13.1 million to $16.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $29.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease in non interest income primarily reflected a $12.9 million decrease in gains on securities transactions, net to $11.4 million for 2004 from $24.3 million for 2003, primarily due to decreases in sales of mortgage backed securities. The $11.4 million gain on securities transactions during 2004 resulted from an opportunity to realize gains from the sale of certain available for sale mortgage backed securities prior to interest rate changes, such as seen in the second quarter of 2004, which would have had an adverse impact on their fair market value. The historically low interest rate environment enabled us to realize these gains on the sales of securities, as the lower rates increased the fair value of the fixed rate securities sold. The gains in 2003 resulted from the enhanced opportunities to realize gains due to the declining interest rate environment. The total cash flow from the sales of these securities during 2004 was $510.5 million, which was subsequently reinvested into mortgage loans and investment securities. Page 63 Table of Contents Non Interest Expense. Total non interest expense increased $15.8 million, or 15.4%, to $118.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $102.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase was primarily due to increases in compensation and employee benefit expense related to our employee stock benefit plans, compensation expense related to staff increases due to our branch expansion program, occupancy expenses due to our branch expansion program and expenses related to internal control evaluation and testing in order to comply with the new certification requirements imposed by the Sarbanes Oxley Act and other regulatory costs. Our efficiency ratio was 23.60% for 2004 compared with 23.81% for 2003. Our ratio of non interest expense to average total assets for 2004 was 0.64% compared with 0.66% for 2003. The relative stability of these ratios reflected our efforts to control costs, notwithstanding the actual increase in non interest expense, as our average assets grew in excess of 20.0% when comparing 2004 to 2003. Income Taxes. Income tax expense increased $23.3 million, or 19.4%, to $143.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $119.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, primarily due to the 16.9% increase in income before income tax expense. Our effective tax rate increased for 2004 to 37.43% from 36.61% for 2003, primarily due to the expense of the employee stock ownership plan, which is not fully deductible for income tax purposes. Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002 During 2003, our total assets increased $2.89 billion, or 20.4%, to $17.03 billion at December 31, 2003 from $14.14 billion at December 31, 2002. Loans increased $1.83 billion, or 26.3%, to $8.80 billion at December 31, 2003 from $6.97 billion at December 31, 2002. The increase in loans reflected a significant increase in our loan purchase activity as well as our continued focus on the origination of one to four family first mortgage loans, consistent with our growth strategies. For 2003, we originated first mortgage loans of $2.17 billion and purchased first mortgage loans of $3.21 billion, compared with originations of $1.84 billion and purchases of $1.72 billion for 2002. Loan purchases exceeded originations due to their availability in the high prepayment activity environment experienced during 2003 and the growth initiatives employed by us in recent periods. These first mortgage loan originations and purchases were exclusively in one to four family mortgage loans and were primarily fixed rate loans. At December 31, 2003, fixed rate mortgage loans accounted for 90.9% of our first mortgage loan portfolio compared with 86.5% at December 31, 2002. The strong levels of loan originations and purchases during 2003 reflected the continuation of the impact of the low interest rate environment. During 2003, due to the low long term interest rate environment, $530.4 million of our loan originations were the result of refinancing of our existing mortgage loans. The dollar amount of refinancing of existing mortgage loans was included in total loan originations. We allow certain customers to modify, for a fee, their existing mortgage loans with the intent of maintaining customer relationships in periods of extensive refinancing due to low long term interest rates. In general, all terms and conditions of the existing mortgage loan remain the same except the adjustment of the interest rate to the currently offered fixed rate product with a similar term to maturity or to a reduced term at the request of the borrower. Modifications of our existing mortgage loans during the 2003 were approximately $1.46 billion. These loan modifications were not reflected in loan origination totals. We feel loan refinancing and modification activity are directly tied to the level of interest rates. Page 64 Table of Contents The loan purchases were made pursuant to our wholesale loan purchase program established to supplement our retail loan originations. The purchasing agreements, as established with each seller/servicer, contain parameters as to the loans that can be included in each package. These parameters, such as maximum loan size and maximum loan to value ratio, conform to parameters generally utilized by us to originate mortgage loans. Purchased loan packages are subject to internal due diligence procedures that may include review of individual loan files. This review subjects the purchased loan file to substantially the same underwriting standards used in our own loan origination process. Loan packages purchased include mortgage loans secured by properties located primarily in the east coast corridor states between Massachusetts and North Carolina, and in Michigan and Illinois. Investment securities available for sale increased $1.68 billion to $2.24 billion at December 31, 2003 from $560.9 million at December 31, 2002. The increase in investment securities available for sale primarily reflected the investment of part of the cash flow from the high levels of prepayment activity on our mortgage related assets into investment securities. The increase in investment securities also reflected our decision to shorten the overall weighted average life of our assets by investing in callable government sponsored agency securities with initial call dates of three months to one year and terms to maturity of generally less than ten years. Mortgage backed securities decreased $703.5 million, or 11.5%, to $5.42 billion at December 31, 2003 from $6.13 billion at December 31, 2002. This decrease was primarily due to the high level of prepayment activity and sales of approximately $1.37 billion of our mortgage backed securities during 2003. The $27.4 million increase in Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) stock to $164.9 million at December 31, 2003, was due to the amount of stock we were required by the FHLB to hold. The $24.5 million increase in other assets was primarily due to an increase in our deferred tax asset calculations as required by generally accepted accounting principles. Total liabilities increased $2.87 billion, or 22.4%, to $15.70 billion at December 31, 2003 compared with $12.83 billion at December 31, 2002. Total deposits increased $1.31 billion, or 14.3%, to $10.45 billion at December 31, 2003 from $9.14 billion at December 31, 2002. The increase in total deposits was primarily used to fund our growth initiatives. Interest bearing deposits increased $1.31 billion primarily due to an increase of $1.77 billion in our interest bearing High Value Checking account product. We believe the increase in interest bearing deposits was due primarily to our consistent offering of competitive rates on our deposit products, primarily on our interest bearing High Value Checking account product. The balance in the High Value Checking account at December 31, 2003 was $2.71 billion compared with $943.2 million at December 31, 2002. This growth in interest bearing deposits was partially offset by a $508.9 million decrease in time deposits. Although our time deposit rates are competitive, we believe the decrease in time deposits was due, in part, to transfers to our High Value Checking account. Borrowed funds increased $1.55 billion, or 43.1%, to $5.15 billion at December 31, 2003 from $3.60 billion at December 31, 2002. The additional borrowed funds were primarily used to fund asset growth consistent with our capital management strategy. Borrowed funds were comprised of $3.20 billion of securities sold under agreements to repurchase and $1.95 billion of FHLB advances. Securities pledged as collateral against our securities sold under agreements to repurchase had a market value at December 31, 2003 of approximately $3.47 billion. Advances from the FHLB utilize our mortgage portfolio as collateral. The $2.03 billion in new borrowings had initial call dates of three months to three years from the date of borrowing. These short and intermediate term borrowed funds complement the $3.60 billion of previously existing long term borrowings. During 2003 we also restructured certain of our borrowed funds, which resulted in the extension of the weighted average maturity and lowered the contract interest rate. Page 65 Table of Contents Total stockholders equity increased $13.3 million, or 1.0%, to $1.33 billion at December 31, 2003 from $1.32 billion at December 31, 2002. The increase was primarily the result of net income for 2003 of $207.4 million, an increase of $11.0 million due to the exercise of approximately 1.5 million stock options, and an increase of $14.2 million due to the commitment of shares for our stock related employee benefit plans. Partially offsetting these increases in stockholders equity were repurchases of approximately 3.7 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $101.1 million, cash dividends declared and paid to common stockholders of $95.6 million and a $30.2 million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income due to the decrease in the overall market value of our investment and mortgage backed securities available for sale, reflecting a generally lower interest rate environment. At December 31, 2003, the ratio of total stockholders equity to total assets was 7.80% compared with 9.30% at December 31, 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the ratio of average stockholders equity to average assets was 8.73% compared with 10.12% for the year ended December 31, 2002. The decrease in these ratios was primarily due to our capital management strategy of planned asset growth, and a slower percentage growth in stockholders equity as compared to the percentage growth in assets, due to payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases. Stockholders equity per common share was $7.33 at December 31, 2003 compared with $7.22 at December 31, 2002. Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 General. Net income was $207.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of $15.4 million, or 8.0%, compared with net income of $192.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Basic and diluted earnings per common share were $1.14 and $1.11, respectively, for 2003 compared with basic and diluted earnings per share of $1.04 and $1.01, respectively, for 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2003 our return on average stockholders equity was 15.38% compared with 14.84% for 2002. The increase in the return on average stockholders equity was primarily due to the growth of our net income and a slower percentage growth in stockholders equity as compared to the percentage growth in assets due to payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases. Our return on average assets for 2003 was 1.34% compared with 1.50% for 2002. The decrease in the return on average assets was primarily due to the lower net interest margin due to the low interest rate environment. The decline in the return on average assets also reflected our overall balance sheet growth. Interest and Dividend Income. Total interest and dividend income decreased $6.9 million, or 0.9%, to $777.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared with $784.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The decrease in total interest and dividend income was primarily due to a 112 basis point decrease in the average yield on interest earning assets to 5.14% for 2003 from 6.26% for 2002, reflecting yield declines to varying degrees in all asset categories. The impact on interest and dividend income from the decrease in the weighted average yield on our interest earning assets was partially off set by an increase in the average balance of total interest earning assets of $2.61 billion, or 20.8%, to $15.13 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared with $12.52 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002. Page 66 Table of Contents The $25.7 million decrease in interest and fee income on first mortgage loans was primarily due to a 100 basis point decrease in the average yield, which reflected the large volume of loan origination and purchase activity during the low long term interest rate environment of 2003 and the acceleration of the amortization of the net premium on these assets due to the high levels of modification and refinancing activity. The decrease in mortgage loan income due to the decreases in yields was partially off set by a $637.1 million increase in the average balance of first mortgage loans, which reflected internal growth that was consistent with our capital management strategy and growth initiatives. The $39.5 million decrease in interest income on mortgage backed securities was primarily due to a 112 basis point decrease in the average yield on mortgage backed securities, which reflected the significant turnover in the portfolio, the downward repricing of our adjustable rate securities during the low interest rate environment of 2003 and the acceleration of the net premium on these assets. The decrease in income on mortgage backed securities due to the decrease in yield was partially off set by the impact of a $486.7 million increase in the average balance of mortgage backed securities, which reflected our internal growth initiatives. The $61.1 million growth in interest and dividends on investment securities available for sale was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of $1.42 billion, which reflected the investment of certain of the cash flows from the high level of prepayment activity on our mortgage related assets into investment securities, and the decision to shorten the overall weighted average life of our assets by investing in callable securities with initial call dates of three months to one year. The increase in income on investment securities due to the increase in the average balance was partially off set by a 139 basis point decrease in the average yield on our investment securities, which reflected the large volume of purchases made during the low interest rate environment of 2003. Interest Expense. Total interest expense, comprised of interest on deposits and interest on borrowed funds, decreased $19.4 million, or 4.9%, to $376.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $395.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities of 83 basis points to 2.77% for 2003 from 3.60% for 2002. The impact of the decline in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities was offset, in part, by an increase in the average balance of total interest bearing liabilities of $2.58 billion, or 23.5%, to $13.58 billion for 2003 from $11.00 billion for 2002. Interest expense on borrowed funds increased $27.0 million primarily due to an increase in the average balance of $1.24 billion, the impact of which was partially off set by a decrease in the average cost of borrowed funds of 82 basis points. The increase in the average balance of borrowed funds was used to fund asset growth consistent with our capital management and growth strategies. The decrease in the average cost of borrowed funds reflected the continued growth of our borrowed funds in the low interest rate environment that existed during 2003. The decrease in the average cost of borrowed funds also reflected the restructuring of certain of our borrowed funds during 2003, which resulted in the extension of the weighted average maturity and lowered the contract rates. Interest expense on deposits decreased $46.5 million primarily due to a decrease in the average cost of 93 basis points, the impact of which was partially off set by an increase in the average balance of deposits of $1.34 billion. The decrease in the average cost of interest bearing deposits reflected a 96 basis point decrease in the average cost of our time deposits, an 83 basis point decrease in the average cost of savings accounts, an 87 basis point decrease in the average cost of money market deposits, and a 34 basis point decrease in the average cost of interest bearing demand deposits. Page 67 Table of Contents These decreases in the average cost of interest bearing deposits reflected the low interest rate environment experienced during 2003 and the growth of our High Value Checking account product, the rate for which was lower than our average cost of total deposits during 2003. The increase in the average balance of deposits, primarily used to fund asset growth, reflected a $1.60 billion increase in the average balance of interest bearing demand accounts due to the growth in our High Value Checking account product, and an increase of $57.4 million in the average balance of our regular savings account. We believe the increase in the average balance of deposits was primarily due to our consistent offering of competitive rates on desirable customer deposit products. Although our time deposit rates are competitive, we believe the decrease of $341.1 million in the average balance of time deposits was primarily due to transfers to our High Value Checking account. Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased $12.6 million, or 3.2%, to $401.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared with $388.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase primarily reflected our growth initiatives, which resulted in increases in the average balance of both interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, and the net interest rate spread earned on this growth. Our net interest rate spread, the difference between the average yield on total interest earning assets and the average cost of total interest bearing liabilities, decreased 29 basis points to 2.37% for 2003 from 2.66% for 2002. Our net interest margin, represented by net interest income divided by average total interest earning assets, decreased 45 basis points to 2.65% for 2003 from 3.10% for 2002. These decreases reflected the larger decrease in the yield on interest earning assets compared with the decrease in the cost of interest bearing liabilities due to the continued decline in long term market interest rates during the first six months of 2003 and the timing of the impact on earnings of the market rate changes. The decrease also reflected the increased amortization of the net premium on our mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities due to the high level of prepayment activity on these mortgage related assets. However, the stabilized rate environment and steeper yield curve which occurred in the second half of 2003 improved our net interest rate margin and net interest rate spread in the fourth quarter of 2003 when compared to the prior quarters reported in 2003. Provision for Loan Losses. Our provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $900,000, a decrease of $600,000, compared with $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Net recoveries were $146,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared with net charge offs of $9,000 for 2002. The decrease in the provision reflected our recent low charge off history given the relative stability of the housing market. The allowance for loan losses increased $1.0 million, or 3.9%, to $26.5 million at December 31, 2003 from $25.5 million at December 31, 2002. The increase in the allowance for loan losses, through the provision for loan losses, reflected the overall growth of the loan portfolio and the level of delinquent and non performing loans. Non performing loans, defined as non accruing loans and accruing loans delinquent 90 days or more, increased $100,000 to $20.3 million at December 31, 2003 from $20.2 million at December 31, 2002. The ratio of non performing loans to total loans was 0.23% at December 31, 2003 compared with 0.29% at December 31, 2002. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans was 131.09% at December 31, 2003 compared with 126.27% at December 31, 2002. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans was 0.30% at December 31, 2003 compared with 0.37% at December 31, 2002. Page 68 Table of Contents Non Interest Income. Total non interest income increased $21.7 million to $29.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, primarily reflecting gains on securities transactions, net. Service charges and other income, which generally consist of service charges and fees on deposit accounts, decreased $600,000 to $5.3 million for 2003 compared with $5.9 million for 2002, due to a gain on the sale of a commercial property in 2002. The $24.3 million gain on securities transactions, net, during 2003, resulted from an opportunity to realize gains from the sale of certain available for sale mortgage backed and investment securities prior to an interest rate change which would have had an adverse impact on their fair market value. The gain also reflected the disposition of certain of our held to maturity mortgage backed securities whose amortized principal was less than fifteen percent of the purchased principal, as allowed under SFAS No. 115. The cash flow of $1.45 billion from the sale of the securities was reinvested into fixed rate securities. Non Interest Expense. Total non interest expense increased $9.0 million, or 9.6%, to $102.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $93.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $8.1 million in compensation and employee benefits reflecting routine salary increases, increases in stock related compensation expense and increases in pension expense. Stock related compensation expense increased $4.5 million primarily due to increases in the current average market price of our common stock. Our efficiency ratio, determined by dividing total non interest expense by the sum of net interest income and non interest income was 23.81% for 2003 compared with 23.59% for 2002. Our ratio of non interest expense to average total assets for 2003 was 0.66% compared with 0.73% for 2002. The relative stability of these ratios reflected our efforts to control costs, notwithstanding the actual increase in non interest expense, as our assets grew in excess of 20%. Income Taxes. Income tax expense increased $10.4 million, or 9.5%, to $119.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $109.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, primarily due to the 8.6% increase in income before income tax expense. Our effective tax rate for the 2003 was 36.61% compared with 36.29% for 2002. Liquidity and Capital Resources The term liquidity refers to our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to fund loan originations, loan purchases, deposit withdrawals and operating expenses. Our primary sources of funds are scheduled amortization and prepayments of loan and mortgage backed securities principal, new deposits, borrowed funds, maturities and calls of investment securities and funds provided by our operations. Our membership in the FHLB provides us access to additional sources of borrowed funds, which is generally limited to twenty times the amount of FHLB stock owned. Deposit flows, calls of investment securities and borrowed funds, and prepayments of loans and mortgage backed securities are strongly influenced by interest rates, general and local economic conditions and competition in the marketplace. These factors reduce the predictability of the timing of these sources of funds. As mortgage interest rates decline, customer prepayment activity tends to accelerate causing an increase in cash flow from both our mortgage loan and mortgage backed security portfolios. If our pricing is competitive, the demand for mortgage originations also accelerates. Page 69 Table of Contents When mortgage rates increase, the opposite effect on prepayment activity tends to occur and our loan origination and purchase activity becomes increasingly dependent on the strength of the residential real estate markets and the volume of home purchases and new construction activity in the markets we serve. Principal repayments on loans were $2.02 billion during the year ended December 31, 2004 compared with $3.63 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003. Principal payments received on mortgage backed securities totaled $1.73 billion during 2004 compared with $3.80 billion during 2003. The decrease in payments on loans and mortgage backed securities reflected the high levels of prepayment activity in 2003, due to the declining interest rate environment during that year. The aggregate amount of maturities and calls of investment securities during 2004 was $1.42 billion compared with maturities and calls of $1.33 billion during 2003. Total deposits increased $1.02 billion during the year ended December 31, 2004 compared with a $1.32 billion increase during year ended December 31, 2003. Deposit flows are affected by the level of market interest rates, the interest rates and products offered by competitors, the volatility of equity markets, and other factors. We believe the increase in interest bearing deposits during 2004 was due primarily to our consistent offering of competitive rates on our interest bearing High Value Checking account. Time deposit accounts scheduled to mature within one year were $3.71 billion at December 31, 2004. We anticipate that we will have sufficient resources to meet this current funding commitment. Based on our deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy, we anticipate that a significant portion of these time deposits will remain with us as renewed time deposits or transfers to our High Value Checking account product. We are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position; therefore we monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis. For the year ended December 31, 2004 we borrowed $3.75 billion compared with new borrowings of $2.03 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003. Principal payments on borrowed funds during 2004 were $1.75 billion compared with $475.0 million in 2003. The increase in principal payments reflected the increase in calls and maturities on borrowed funds during this generally increasing short term interest rate environment and the use of borrowed funds during 2004 with maturities of less than one year. The increase in new borrowings reflected the increase in call activity and maturities of short term borrowings and the subsequent origination of new borrowed funds to support our balance sheet growth initiatives. The funds borrowed during 2004 had initial call dates of one month to four years from the date of borrowing and final maturities of one month to ten years. At December 31, 2004, there were no borrowed funds scheduled to mature within one year, however, $2.03 billion of borrowed funds have the potential to be called within one year. We anticipate we will have sufficient resources to meet this funding commitment by borrowing new funds at the prevailing market interest rate, or paying off the borrowed funds, as they mature or are called. Our primary investing activities are the origination and purchase of one to four family real estate loans and consumer and other loans, the purchase of mortgage backed securities, and the purchase of investment securities. We originated total loans of $1.46 billion during the year ended December 31, 2004 compared with $2.27 billion during the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease in originations reflected the high volume of refinancing and prepayment activity in 2003 due to the declining interest rate environment. During 2004 we purchased total loans of $3.12 billion compared with $3.21 billion during 2003. The continued larger volume of purchased mortgage loans in 2004, when compared to originated loans, allowed us to grow and geographically diversify our mortgage loan portfolio at a relatively low overhead cost while maintaining our traditional thrift business model. The increase in loan purchases also reflected the asset growth strategies we have employed during recent periods, using customer deposits and borrowed funds as our funding sources. We will continue to purchase mortgage loans to grow and diversify our portfolio, as opportunities and funding are available. Page 70 Table of Contents Purchases of mortgage backed securities during the year ended December 31, 2004 were $2.20 billion compared with $4.53 billion during the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease in purchases of mortgage backed securities reflected the decline in prepayment activity that resulted in a decrease in funds to reinvest, and a shift of reinvestment of cash flows to purchases to government sponsored agency investment securities and mortgage loans. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we purchased $2.11 billion of investment securities compared with purchases of $3.09 billion during the year ended December 31, 2003. This decrease in purchases was primarily due to the lower amount of investable cash flows in 2004 caused by lower prepayment activity on our mortgage related assets. Of the investment securities purchased during 2004, $1.77 billion were classified as held to maturity. Of these securities, $621.6 million have step up features, where the interest rate is increased on scheduled future dates. These securities have call options that are generally effective prior to the initial rate increase but after an initial non call period of three months to one year. The initial rate for the securities purchased was higher than interest rates on similar agency securities offered at the time of purchase without the step up feature. The rate increases are at least one percent per adjustment and are fixed over the life of the security. As part of the membership requirements of the FHLB, we are required to hold a certain dollar amount of FHLB common stock based on our asset size or our borrowings from the FHLB. During 2004, we redeemed $24.9 million of FHLB common stock due to calls of funds borrowed from the FHLB. During 2003, we purchased $27.4 million of FHLB stock. The redemptions made during 2004 brought our total investment in FHLB stock to $140.0 million, the amount we are currently required to hold. Under our stock repurchase programs, shares of Hudson City Bancorp common stock may be purchased in the open market and through other privately negotiated transactions, from time to time, depending on market conditions. The repurchased shares are held as treasury stock for general corporate use. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we purchased 4,590,200 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $161.7 million compared with purchases of 3,677,375 shares during the year ended December 31, 2003 at an aggregate cost of $101.1 million. At December 31, 2004, there were 3,076,221 shares remaining to be repurchased under the existing stock repurchase program. During 2004, the trustee of our recognition and retention plan purchased 200,000 shares of common stock for our recognition and retention plan at an aggregate cost of $7.3 million due to awards to employees made during the year. Cash dividends declared and paid during 2004 were $40.5 million compared with $95.6 million during 2003. In the first quarter of 2004, Hudson City, MHC applied for and was granted approval from the OTS to waive receipt of dividends declared by Hudson City Bancorp during 2004. This dividend waiver provided additional operating capital and liquidity at Hudson City Bancorp. The decrease in the dividend payment reflected the waiver by Hudson City, MHC. The dividend pay out ratio, using amount per share information that does not reflect the dividend waiver by Hudson City, MHC, was 52.63% for 2004 compared with 45.61% for 2003. On January 18, 2005, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of twenty cents ($0.20) per common share. The dividend is payable on March 1, 2005 to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 4, 2005. At December 31, 2004, Hudson City Savings exceeded all regulatory capital requirements. Hudson City Savings tangible capital ratio, leverage (core) capital ratio and total risk based capital ratio were 6.36%, 6.36% and 17.49%, respectively. Page 71 Table of Contents The primary source of liquidity for Hudson City Bancorp, the holding company of Hudson City Savings, is capital distributions from the banking subsidiary. During 2004, Hudson City Bancorp received $226.6 million in dividend payments from Hudson City Savings, which amounted to 95.7% of Hudson City Savings net income for that period. The primary use of these funds is the payment of dividends to our shareholders and the repurchase of our common stock. Hudson City Bancorps ability to continue these activities is solely dependent upon capital distributions from Hudson City Savings. Applicable federal law may limit the amount of capital distributions Hudson City Savings may make. (See Regulation of Hudson City Savings Bank and Hudson City Bancorp) Management of Interest Rate Risk As a financial institution, our primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility. Net interest income is the primary component of our net income, and fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact the level of both income and expense recorded on a large portion of our assets and liabilities. Fluctuations in interest rates will also affect the market value of all interest earning assets, other than those that possess a short term to maturity. During 2004, short term interest rates generally increased and long term interest rates slightly decreased causing a flattening of the market yield curve. This interest rate environment had an adverse impact on our net interest income as our interest bearing liabilities generally price off short term interest rates, while our interest earning assets, a majority of which have initial terms to maturity or repricing greater than one year, generally price off long term rates. The timing of the placement of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities on our balance sheet, particularly during this rising short term interest rate environment, also had an adverse impact on our net interest income. The impact of interest rate changes on our interest income is generally felt in later periods than the impact on our interest expense due to the timing of the recording on the balance sheet of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. The recording of interest earning assets on the balance sheet generally lags the current market due to normal delays of up to three months between the time we commit to originate or purchase a mortgage loan and the time we fund the loan, while the recording of interest bearing liabilities on the balance sheet generally reflects the current market rates. Also impacting our net interest income and net interest rate spread is the level of prepayment activity on our mortgage related assets. The actual amount of time before mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities are repaid can be significantly impacted by changes in market interest rates and mortgage prepayment rates. Mortgage prepayment rates will vary due to a number of factors, including the regional economy in the area where the underlying mortgages were originated, seasonal factors, demographic variables and the assumability of the underlying mortgages. However, the major factors affecting prepayment rates are prevailing interest rates, related mortgage refinancing opportunities and competition. Generally, the level of prepayment activity directly affects the yield earned on those assets, as the payments received on the interest earning assets will be reinvested at the prevailing market interest rate. Prepayment rates are generally inversely related to the prevailing market interest rate, thus, as market interest rates increase, prepayment rates tend to decrease. Prepayment activity decreased on our mortgage related assets during 2004 when compared to the prepayment activity experienced during 2003. This decrease in prepayment activity was due to the general stability of long term interest rates during the second half of 2003 and 2004, compared to the first half of 2003 and earlier periods. Page 72 Table of Contents The mortgage related assets resulting from this prepayment activity will not tend to prepay as fast, as their contractual interest rate is relatively low. The slowing of the prepayment activity in turn decreased the amount of related premium amortized on these assets during 2004. The decrease in the prepayment activity and the slowing of the premium amortization generally had a positive impact on our net interest income, net interest rate spread and net interest margin for 2004 when compared to 2003. The primary objectives of our interest rate risk management strategy are to: evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in our balance sheet accounts; determine the appropriate level of interest rate risk given our business plan, the current business environment and our capital and liquidity requirements; and manage interest rate risk in a manner consistent with the approved guidelines and policies set by our Board of Directors. We seek to manage our asset/liability mix to help minimize the impact that interest rate fluctuations may have on our earnings. To achieve the objectives of managing interest rate risk, our Asset/Liability Committee meets weekly to discuss and monitor the market interest rate environment compared to interest rates that are offered on our products. This committee consists of the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Operating Officer, the Investment Officer and other senior officers of the institution as required. The Asset/Liability Committee presents periodic reports to the Board of Directors at its regular meetings and, on a quarterly basis, presents a comprehensive report addressing the results of activities and strategies and the effect that changes in interest rates will have on our results of operations and the present value of our equity. Historically, our lending activities have emphasized one to four family fixed rate first and second mortgage loans. Our planned growth in adjustable rate assets is expected to help reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and benefit our long term profitability. However, the prevailing interest rate environment has resulted in increased demand for fixed rate first mortgage loans. This may have an adverse impact on our net interest income, particularly in a rising interest rate environment. The purchase of U.S. government sponsored agency securities to supplement our purchases of adjustable rate mortgage backed securities has given us additional interest rate risk protection. The securities purchased have final maturity dates between five and seven years, which, when compared to mortgage loans or mortgage backed securities, limits extension risk of principal repayment. Approximately $621.6 million of the agency securities purchased and classified as held to maturity have step up features, where the interest rate is increased on scheduled future dates. These securities have call options that are generally effective prior to the initial rate increase but after an initial non call period of three months to one year. The initial rate for the securities purchased was higher than interest rates on similar agency securities offered at the time of purchase without the step up feature. The rate increases are at least one percent per adjustment and are fixed over the life of the security. Our primary source of funds has been deposits, consisting primarily of time deposits and the interest bearing High Value Checking demand account, which have substantially shorter terms to maturity than our mortgage loan portfolio. We use securities sold under agreements to repurchase and FHLB advances as additional sources of funds. These borrowings are generally long term to maturity, in an effort to offset our short term deposit liabilities and assist in managing our interest rate risk. Page 73 Table of Contents Certain of these borrowings have call options that could shorten their maturities in a changing interest rate environment. We intend to continue to grow our borrowed funds, as part of our interest rate risk management strategy with new borrowings having maturities of ten years and initial non call periods of at least three to five years. Due to the nature of our operations, we are not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk. Instead, our mortgage loan portfolio, the majority of which is located in New Jersey, is subject to risks associated with the local economy. The purchases of mortgage loans have allowed us to geographically diversify our mortgage loan portfolio in order to attempt to mitigate this concentration risk. We do not own any trading assets. We did not engage in any hedging transactions that use derivative instruments (such as interest rate swaps and caps) during 2004 and did not have any such hedging transactions in place at December 31, 2004. In the future, we may, with approval of our Board of Directors, engage in hedging transactions utilizing derivative instruments, but we have no current plans to do so. Gap Analysis. The matching of the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring a financial institutions interest rate sensitivity gap. An asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period. The interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period. A gap is considered negative when the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a specific time period exceeds the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within that same period. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period exceeds the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period. During a period of rising interest rates, a financial institution with a negative gap position would be expected, absent the effects of other factors, to experience a greater increase in the costs of its interest bearing liabilities relative to the yields of its interest earning assets and thus a decrease in the institutions net interest income. An institution with a positive gap position would be expected, absent the effect of other factors, to experience the opposite result. Conversely, during a period of falling interest rates, a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to reduce net interest income. The following table, referred to as the gap table, presents the amounts of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at December 31, 2004, which we anticipate to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown. Except as stated below, we determined the amounts of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period in accordance with the earlier of the term to repricing or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability. The information presented in the gap table is also based on the following assumptions: we assumed an annual prepayment rate of 15.0% for mortgage loans repricing or maturing after one year; we assumed an annual prepayment rate of 20.0% for mortgage backed securities repricing or maturing after one year; Page 74 Table of Contents we reported savings accounts that had no stated maturity using decay rates (the assumed rate at which the balance of existing accounts would decline) of: 2.5% in less than six months, 2.5% in six months to one year, 5.0% in one year to two years, 5.0% in two years to three years, 10.0% in three years to five years, and 75.0% in over five years; we reported interest bearing demand accounts that had no stated maturity using decay rates of : 2.5% in less than six months, 2.5% in six months to one year, 10.0% in one to two years, 10.0% in two to three years, 20.0% in three years to five years, and 55.0% in over five years; we reported money market accounts that had no stated maturity using decay rates of: 2.5% in less than six months, 2.5% in six months to one year, 10.0% in one to two years, 10.0% in two to three years, 20.0% in three years to five years, and 55.0% in over five years; we assumed $875.0 million of borrowed funds, which are reported at maturity date, will be called in less than one year. At December 31, 2003, the prepayment assumptions for both mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities were 30.0%. The decrease in the assumed prepayment activity on our mortgage related assets was due to the decline in prepayment activity experienced during 2004 and the general stability of long term interest rates during the second half of 2003 and 2004, notwithstanding the slight decrease of long term interest rates during 2004. We believe the 15% prepayment assumption for mortgage loans and 20% prepayment assumption for mortgage backed securities is appropriate, notwithstanding the anticipated long term interest rate increases, due to recent prepayment history. The prepayment assumption for mortgage loans is also supported by the fact that a significant portion of our mortgage loan portfolio is in the active New Jersey and metropolitan New York real estate market and is over the conforming loan limit. We believe these loans will tend to prepay at higher levels than other types of loans. Our determination of deposit decay rates is based on historical experience with the varying non maturity deposit types and an analysis of the current deposit base. The deposit decay rate assumptions are examined by a third party for reasonableness. Deposit decay rates, prepayment rates and anticipated calls of investment securities or borrowed funds can have a significant impact on the estimated interest sensitivity gap. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, actual future deposit decay activity, mortgage and mortgage backed securities prepayments, and the timing of calls of federal agency bonds and borrowings may vary materially from our estimates and assumptions. Significant increases in market interest rates may tend to reduce prepayment speeds on our mortgage related assets, as fewer borrowers refinance their loans. At the same time, deposit decay rates may tend to increase in the shorter term periods, as depositors seek higher yielding investments elsewhere. If these trends occur, the effect would be to make our interest sensitivity gap more negative. We have excluded non accrual mortgage loans totaling $6,057,000 from the table.

This represented a cumulative one year interest rate sensitivity gap as a percent of total assets of negative 5.3% at December 31, 2004 compared with positive 2.6% at December 31, 2003. The ratio of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year to interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year was 78.2% at December 31, 2004 compared with 108.9% at December 31, 2003. This negative gap position is expected to have an adverse impact on our net interest income in a rising interest rate environment. The change in these ratios, year to year, was partially due to the decrease of the assumed prepayment rate on our mortgage related assets and the continued growth of our primarily fixed rate long term mortgage loan portfolio. The change also reflects the anticipated calls of borrowed funds in the current year due to the rising interest rate environment. The impact of these items was partially offset by a shift of time deposit maturities to over one year due to internal pricing strategies, and the growth of our High Value Checking account, which we have estimated to have a decay rate in excess of one year of 95%. Had the mortgage related prepayment assumptions used at December 31, 2003 been applied to our December 31, 2004 gap analysis, and all other assumption used at December 31, 2004 were not changed, the cumulative one year gap as a percent of total assets would have been a positive 5.19%. The methods used in the gap table are inherently imprecise. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Certain assets, such as adjustable rate loans and mortgage backed securities, have features that limit changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the loan. If interest rates change, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate from those assumed in calculating the table. Finally, the ability of borrowers to make payments on their adjustable rate loans may decrease if interest rates increase. Present Value of Equity. In addition to the gap analysis, we also use a simulation model to monitor interest rate risk. This model reports the present value of equity in different interest rate environments, assuming an instantaneous and permanent interest rate shock to all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities. The present value of equity is the difference between the estimated fair value of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities. The changes in market value of assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates reflect the interest sensitivity of those assets and liabilities as their values are derived from the characteristics of the asset or liability (i.e., fixed rate, adjustable rate, caps, floors) relative to the current interest rate environment. For example, in a rising interest rate environment the fair market value of a fixed rate asset will decline, whereas the fair market value of an adjustable rate asset, depending on its repricing characteristics, may not decline. Increases in the market value of assets will increase the present value of equity whereas decreases in the market value of assets will decrease the present value of equity. Conversely, increases in the market value of liabilities will decrease the present value of equity whereas decreases in the market value of liabilities will increase the present value of equity. The following table presents the estimated present value of equity over a range of interest rate change scenarios at December 31, 2004. The present value ratio shown in the table is the present value of equity as a percent of the present value of total assets in each of the different rate environments. For purposes of this table, we have made assumptions such as prepayment rates and decay rates similar to those used for the gap analysis table. Page 77 Table of Contents Our current policy sets a minimum ratio of the present value of equity to the fair value of assets in the current interest rate environment (no rate shock) of 7.50% and in the plus 200 basis point interest rate shock scenario of 5.50%. The policy in effect at December 31, 2003 set a maximum percentage change in the present value of equity of 55% in the plus and minus 200 basis points shock tests. The internal policy change from prior periods, regarding the minimum present value ratio, was due to the change in our primary regulatory agency and that agencys interest rate risk policy requirements. We believe the 200 basis point decrease scenario may not be meaningful given the prevailing low market interest rate environment and it is not presented in the table. Present Value of Equity As Percent of Present Present Value of Equity Value of Assets Change in Dollar Dollar Percent Present Percent Interest Rates Amount Change Change Value Ratio Change (Basis points) (Dollars in thousands) 200 $ 1,752,586 $ (782,548 ) (30.87 )% 9.44 % (24.54 )% 100 2,186,949 (348,185 ) (13.73 ) 11.25 (10.07 ) 50 2,387,254 (147,880 ) (5.83 ) 12.02 (3.92 ) 0 2,535,134 12.51 (50) 2,467,662 (67,472 ) (2.66 ) 12.04 (3.76 ) (100) 2,271,184 (263,950 ) (10.41 ) 11.02 (11.91 ) At December 31, 2003, the percent change in the present value of equity in the 200 basis point increase scenario was negative 34.95% and in the 100 basis point decrease scenario it was negative 8.26% compared with the table above. The decreases in the present value of equity and the percent change in the present value of equity in the increasing rate scenarios in the December 31, 2004 analysis were primarily due to the high percentage of fixed rate mortgage loans, mortgage backed securities and investment securities in our portfolio. At December 31, 2004, fixed rate interest earning assets were 85.2% of total interest earning assets. This percentage of fixed rate interest earning assets to total interest earning assets may have an adverse impact on our earnings in a rising rate environment, as these assets will not reprice in a rising rate environment. The decrease of the percent change in the present value of equity to negative 30.87% at December 31, 2004 from negative 34.95% at December 31, 2003 reflected the growth of our borrowed funds with ten year maturities and the growth of our High Value Checking product. The decreases in the present value of equity and the percent change in the present value of equity in the decreasing rate scenarios in the December 31, 2004 analysis were primarily due to the growth of our fixed rate borrowed funds with long terms to maturity and the growth in our interest bearing demand accounts. Fixed rate borrowed funds, even those with call options, generally do not reprice in a decreasing rate environment. As in the case of the gap table, the methods we used in the previous table are also inherently imprecise. This type of modeling requires that we make assumptions that may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. For example, we assume the composition of the interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will remain constant over the period being measured and that all interest rate shocks will be uniformly reflected across the yield curve, regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing. The table assumes that we will take no action in response to the changes in interest rates. In addition, prepayment estimates and other assumptions within the model are subjective in nature, involve uncertainties, and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Accordingly, although the present value of equity model may provide an estimate of our interest rate risk at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in interest rates on our present value of equity. Page 78 Table of Contents Net Interest Income. As a primary means of managing interest rate risk, we monitor the impact of interest rate changes on our net interest income over the next twelve month period. This model does not purport to provide estimates of net interest income over the next twelve month period, but attempts to assess the impact of a simultaneous and parallel interest rate change on our net interest income. Assumptions for this model are the same as those used for our present value of equity analysis.

These arrangements are primarily commitments to originate and purchase mortgage loans, and to purchase mortgage backed securities. We did not engage in any hedging transactions that use derivative instruments (such as interest rate swaps and caps) during 2004 and did not have any such hedging transactions in place at December 31, 2004, which would create other off balance sheet arrangements. The following table reports the amounts of contractual obligations for Hudson City as of December 31, 2004. Payments Due By Period Less Than 1 Year to 3 Years to More Than Contractual Obligation Total 1 Year 3 Years 5 Years 5 Years (In thousands) First mortgage loan originations $ 192,191 $ 192,191 $ $ $ Mortgage loan purchases 298,396 298,396 Mortgage backed security purchases 317,250 317,250 Operating leases 73,753 4,449 9,522 9,131 50,651 Total $ 881,590 $ 812,286 $ 9,522 $ 9,131 $ 50,651 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend money to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments to fund first mortgage loans generally have fixed expiration dates of approximately 90 days and other termination clauses. Since some commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Hudson City Savings evaluates each customers credit worthiness on a case by case basis. Additionally, we have available home equity and overdraft lines of credit, which do not have fixed expiration dates, of approximately $80.4 million. Page 79 Table of Contents We are not obligated to advance further amounts on credit lines if the customer is delinquent, or otherwise in violation of the agreement. The commitments to purchase first mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities had a normal period from trade date to settlement date of approximately 60 days. Recent Accounting Pronouncements On January 12, 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position No. 106 1 Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, which allows companies to recognize or defer recognizing the effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, or Medicare Act, for annual financial statements of fiscal years ending after December 7, 2003. The Medicare Act introduced both a Medicare prescription drug benefit and a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care plans that provide a benefit at least actuarially equivalent to the Medicare benefit. These provisions of the Medicare Act affect accounting measurements. We adopted Staff Position No. 106 1 in the third quarter of 2004. Our disclosure in Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report incorporates the requirements of Staff Position No. 106 1. On September 30, 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 03 01, Effective Date of Paragraphs 10 20 of EITF Issue No. 03 01, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, which delays the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in EITF Issue No. 03 01. EITF Issue No. 03 01 provides guidance for evaluating whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired and was originally effective for other than temporarily impairment evaluations made in reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2004. The delay in the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs 10 through 20 of EITF Issue No. 03 01 does not suspend the requirement to recognize other than temporary impairments as required by existing authoritative literature. The disclosure guidance in paragraphs 21 and 22 of EITF Issue No. 03 01 remains effective. The delay will be superseded concurrent with the final issuance of EITF Issue No. 03 01a, which is expected to provide implementation guidance on matters such as impairment evaluations for declines in value caused by increases in interest rates and or sector spreads. In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, which amends APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions. SFAS No. 153 eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in Opinion No. 29 and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance. SFAS No. 153 specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. SFAS No. 153 is effective for nonmonetary exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 153 will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment. This Statement is a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related guidance. SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) established standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. This Statement requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements. Page 80 Table of Contents This Statement establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share based payment arrangements and requires all entities to apply a fair value based measurement method in accounting for share based payment transactions with employees, except for equity instruments held by employee share ownership plans. This Statement is effective for public entities that do not file as small business issuers as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices The Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Hudson City Bancorp have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, commonly referred as GAAP. GAAP generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations. Unlike industrial companies, our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature. As a result, changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than do the effects of inflation. Critical Accounting Policies Note 1 to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report contains a summary of our significant accounting policies. We believe our policies with respect to the methodology for our determination of the allowance for loan losses and asset impairment judgments, including other than temporary declines in the value of our securities, involve a higher degree of complexity and require management to make difficult and subjective judgments which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters. Changes in these judgments, assumptions or estimates could cause reported results to differ materially. These critical policies and their application are continually reviewed by management, and are periodically reviewed with the Audit Committee and our Board of Directors. Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses has been determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, under which we are required to maintain adequate allowances for loan losses. We are responsible for the timely and periodic determination of the amount of the allowance required. We believe that our allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover specifically identifiable loan losses, as well as estimated losses inherent in our portfolio for which certain losses are probable but not specifically identifiable. Our primary lending emphasis is the origination and purchase of one to four family first mortgage loans on residential properties and, to a lesser extent, second mortgage loans on one to four family residential properties resulting in a loan concentration in residential first mortgage loans at December 31, 2004. As a result of our lending practices, we also have a concentration of loans secured by real property located in New Jersey. Based on the composition of our loan portfolio and the growth in our loan portfolio, we believe the primary risks inherent in our portfolio are increases in interest rates, a decline in the economy, generally, and a decline in real estate market values. Any one or a combination of these events may adversely affect our loan portfolio resulting in increased delinquencies, loan losses and future levels of provisions. We consider it important to maintain the ratio of our allowance for loan losses to total loans at an acceptable level given current economic conditions, interest rates and the composition of our portfolio. Page 81 Table of Contents Due to the nature of our loan portfolio, our evaluation of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses is performed each month on a pooled basis. Each month we prepare a worksheet which categorizes the entire loan portfolio by certain risk characteristics such as loan type (one to four family, multi family, etc.), loan source (originated or purchased) and payment status (i.e., current or number of days delinquent). Loans with known potential losses are categorized separately. We assign potential loss factors to the payment status categories on the basis of our assessment of the potential risk inherent in each loan type. These factors are periodically reviewed for appropriateness giving consideration to charge off history and delinquency trends. We use this worksheet, as a tool, together with principal balances and delinquency reports, to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Other key factors we consider in this process are current real estate market conditions in geographic areas where our loans are located, changes in the trend of non performing loans, the current state of the local and national economy and loan portfolio growth. We maintain the allowance for loan losses through provisions for loan losses that we charge to income. We charge losses on loans against the allowance for loan losses when we believe the collection of loan principal is unlikely. We establish the provision for loan losses after considering the results of our review of delinquency and charge off trends, the allowance for loan loss worksheet, the amount of the allowance for loan losses in relation to the total loan balance, loan portfolio growth, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and regulatory guidance. We have applied this process consistently and we have made minimal changes in the estimation methods and assumptions that we have used. During 2004, we lowered the loss factors used in our worksheet on our purchased mortgage loans to reflect the seasoning of the portfolio, and the charge off and delinquency experience. Notwithstanding such decrease, we have maintained a minimal provision for loan losses during 2004 to reflect expected losses resulting from the actual growth in our loan portfolio. At December 31, 2004, the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 0.24%, which, given the primary emphasis of our lending practices and the current market conditions, we consider to be at an acceptable level. Furthermore, the increase in the allowance for loan losses during 2004 reflected the growth in the loan portfolio, the low levels of loan charge offs, the stability in the real estate market and the resulting stability in our overall loan quality. Although we believe that we have established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at adequate levels, additions may be necessary if future economic and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment. Although management uses the best information available, the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate that is subject to significant judgment and short term change. Asset Impairment Judgments. Certain of our assets are carried in our consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or at the lower of cost or fair value. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to recognize impairment of such assets. We periodically perform analyses to test for impairment of various assets. In addition to our impairment analyses related to loans discussed above, another significant impairment analysis relates to the value of other than temporary declines in the value of our securities. Our available for sale portfolio is carried at estimated fair value, with any unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity. The securities which we have the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and are carried at amortized cost. We conduct a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to Page 82 Table of Contents determine if the value of any security has declined below its carrying value and whether such decline is other than temporary. If such decline is deemed other than temporary, we would adjust the carrying amount of the security by writing down the security to fair market value through a charge to current period operations. The market values of our securities are significantly affected by changes in interest rates. In general, as interest rates rise, the market value of fixed rate securities will decrease; as interest rates fall, the market value of fixed rate securities will increase. With significant changes in interest rates, we evaluate our intent and ability to hold the security to maturity or for a sufficient time to recover the recorded principal balance. Estimated fair values for securities are based on published or securities dealers market values. Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
