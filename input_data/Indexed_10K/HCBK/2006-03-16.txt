Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Hudson City Bancorps Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, and the other statistical data provided elsewhere in this document. Executive Summary Our results of operations depend primarily on net interest income, which, in part, is a direct result of the market interest rate environment. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets, primarily mortgage loans, mortgage backed securities and investment securities, and the interest we pay on our interest bearing liabilities, primarily time deposits, interest bearing transaction deposits and borrowed funds. Net interest income is affected by the shape of the market yield curve, the timing of the placement and repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities on our balance sheet, and the prepayment rate on our mortgage related assets. Our results of operations may also be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions, particularly those with respect to changes in market interest rates, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. Our results are also affected by the market price of our stock, as the expense of certain of our employee stock compensation plans is related to the current price of our common stock. We completed the second step conversion and stock offering in June 2005, selling a total of 392,980,580 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $10.00 per share and raising approximately $3.93 billion. The net $3.80 billion increase to stockholders equity due to the conversion reflected the receipt of the $3.93 billion gross offering proceeds less the payment of $125.0 million in conversion related expenses. Equity was further increased by $145.8 million due to the consolidation of Hudson City, MHC into Hudson City Bancorp, Inc. We also effected a stock split pursuant to which each share of common stock outstanding or held as treasury stock before completion of the offering was split into 3.206 shares. All prior share and per share data has been adjusted to reflect the 3.206 to 1 stock split effected as part of the second step conversion and stock offering. Hudson City Bancorp contributed $3.00 billion of the net proceeds to Hudson City Savings Bank, resulting in a significant increase in the Banks capital. The amount of funds available for investment from the net offering proceeds was approximately $3.57 billion, reflecting a further $229.9 million reduction from the net offering proceeds due to the use of customer deposits to purchase stock. Of this amount available for investment, approximately $2.80 billion was invested in securities with maturities or initial rate reset dates of less than two years. The remainder of the proceeds available for investment was primarily used to purchase adjustable rate mortgage backed securities and, to a lesser extent, purchase and originate first mortgage loans. During 2005 we grew our balance sheet $7.93 billion, reflecting the use of the net offering proceeds and internally generated growth. The internally generated growth, consistent with our traditional thrift business model, primarily reflected a $3.70 billion increase in total loans, funded by a $4.20 billion increase in borrowed funds. The growth in our core investment of residential first mortgage loans was due to our continued strong levels of loan purchases, which allowed us to grow and geographically diversify our mortgage loan portfolio at a relatively low overhead cost. The new borrowed funds had ten year maturities and initial non call periods of one to five years. Our net income for 2005 increased 15.4% to $276.1 million for the year 2005, generally due to the growth in our interest earning assets. Basic and diluted earnings per share for 2005 were $0.49 and $0.48, respectively, compared with $0.41 and $0.40, respectively, for 2004. Our return on average assets was Page 58 Table of Contents 1.14% for 2005. Total stockholders equity increased $3.80 billion during 2005, primarily due to the completion of our second step conversion and stock offering. Our return on average stockholders equity was 7.52% for 2005. Short term market interest rates increased during 2005 following increases during the entirety of 2004. The Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve Bank (FOMC) increased the overnight lending rate 25 basis points at each of the regularly scheduled meetings beginning in June 2004 to the current rate of 4.50%. Intermediate term market interest rates, those with maturities of two to five years, and long term market interest rates, in particular the 10 year bond, also increased during the year 2005, but at a slower pace than short term interest rates. The result of these market interest rate changes was a continued flattening of the market yield curve during 2005. This interest rate environment, where short term rates increased to the same level as intermediate and long term rates, had a negative impact on our results of operations and net interest margin as our interest bearing liabilities generally price off short term market interest rates while our interest earning assets generally price off long term interest rates. In this rate environment, our net interest margin decreased 31 basis points and our net interest rate spread decreased 59 basis points when comparing the year 2005 to 2004. The decrease in these ratios reflected the flattening market yield curve as our interest income, in general, reflects movements in long term rates while our interest expense, in general, reflects movements in short term rates. The smaller decrease in our net interest margin, when compared to our net interest rate spread, reflected the infusion of capital due to the completion of our second step conversion. The increase in our interest income for the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily derived from the overall growth in our interest earning assets, while the increase in our interest expense reflected both the growth in our interest bearing liabilities and increases in prevailing interest rates. Net interest income increased $77.1 million for the year 2005, when compared to the corresponding period in 2004, reflecting the larger growth of our interest earning assets when compared to the growth of our interest bearing liabilities. Interest earning assets increased approximately 31.3% for the year 2005, as compared to prior year period, while our interest bearing liabilities increased 20.1% for the year 2005. This difference in growth rates offset the negative impact of the flattening market yield curve, where the yield on our interest earning assets decreased 9 basis points during the year 2005, as compared to the prior year, while the cost of our interest bearing liabilities increased 50 basis points, over that same period. We anticipate that short term interest rates will continue to increase in 2006, as it is anticipated the FOMC will continue to increase the Fed funds rate at its current measured pace in the near term. We also anticipate long term interest rates will increase at a similar rate, thus maintaining the flat market yield curve. The result of this potential market interest rate scenario, where the market yield curve remains flat, would have a negative impact on our results of operations and our net interest margin as the yields on our interest earning assets and the costs of our interest bearing liabilities will increase at a similar rate, thus maintaining the current narrow spread. In addition, our interest bearing liabilities will reset to the current market interest rates faster than our interest earning assets as our interest bearing liabilities generally have shorter periods to reset than our interest earning assets. Our originated and purchased interest earning assets generally have commitment periods of up to 90 days. However, we expect the planned growth in our balance sheet resulting from the infusion of capital due to the completion of the second step conversion will continue to offset the impact of movements in interest rates on our net interest income. We plan to grow our assets in 2006 primarily through the origination and purchase of mortgage loans, while purchasing investment and mortgage backed securities as a supplement to our investments in mortgage loans. We also plan that approximately half of the growth in interest earning assets will be short term or variable rate in nature, in order to assist in the management of our interest rate risk. We Page 59 Table of Contents consider a loan or security to be variable rate if there exists a contractual rate adjustment during the life of the instrument, including those variable rate mortgage related assets with three , five or ten year initial fixed rate periods. The primary funding for our asset growth is expected to come from customer deposits and borrowed funds, using the funding source that is most reasonably priced given the overall market interest rate conditions. In the second half of 2005, we experienced extreme competitive pricing of short term deposits in the New York metropolitan market. During this period, wholesale borrowing costs were more economical and reflective of current rates. We expect this condition to continue in the first six months of 2006. We plan that the funds borrowed will primarily have initial non call periods of one to five years and final maturities of ten years in order to extend the maturity of our liabilities and assist in the management of our interest rate risk. We intend to grow customer deposits by continuing to offer desirable products at competitive, but prudent rates and by opening new branch offices. We opened three branch offices in Suffolk County, NY and two branch offices in Richmond County (Staten Island), NY during 2005. We will continue to explore branch expansion opportunities in market areas that present significant opportunities for our traditional thrift business model and intend to expand our branch network by ten to fifteen branches annually. On February 9, 2006, Hudson City announced a definitive agreement to acquire Sound Federal Bancorp, Inc. (Sound Federal) for $20.75 per share in cash, representing an aggregate transaction value of approximately $265.0 million. Sound Federal has 14 branch offices in Westchester, Rockland and Putnam Counties, New York and Fairfield County, Connecticut. This network will complement our current branch network as well as our organic branch expansion plans. Sound Federal has $1.15 billion in assets and $969.6 million in deposits as of December 31, 2005. The transaction is subject to approval by shareholders of Sound Federal as well as customary regulatory approvals, and is expected to close in the early summer of 2006. Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004 During 2005, our total assets increased $7.93 billion, or 39.4%, to $28.08 billion at December 31, 2005 from $20.15 billion at December 31, 2004, reflecting the investment of the proceeds from the second step conversion and stock offering, which was completed in June 2005, and internally generated growth. We raised approximately $3.93 billion from the second step conversion, which was reduced by $125.0 million in related expenses and $229.9 million due to the use of customer deposits to purchase stock to $3.57 billion, reflecting the net cash available for investment. Of the proceeds, approximately $1.50 billion was directly invested into government sponsored agency discount notes yielding approximately 3.24%, $900.0 million was invested into callable government sponsored agency securities with an average yield of 3.94%, and $400.0 million was invested into government sponsored agency step up notes with an initial average yield of 4.00%. All the discount notes purchased immediately after the second step conversion matured during the third and fourth quarters of 2005 and were subsequently reinvested primarily into callable government sponsored agency securities with maturities not exceeding two years or callable government sponsored agency step up notes. These purchases and maturities were reflected in the $2.57 billion increase in total investment securities during 2005. The remainder of the proceeds from the second step conversion was primarily used to purchase adjustable rate mortgage backed securities and, to a lesser extent, purchase and originate one to four family first mortgage loans. Loans increased $3.70 billion, or 32.6%, to $15.06 billion at December 31, 2005 from $11.36 billion at December 31, 2004. The increase in loans reflected our continued loan purchase activity as well as our focus on the origination of one to four family first mortgage loans, primarily in New Jersey and the New York metropolitan area. For the year 2005, we purchased first mortgage loans of $3.68 billion and Page 60 Table of Contents originated first mortgage loans of $2.07 billion, compared with purchases of $3.12 billion and originations of $1.38 billion for 2004. The larger volume of purchased mortgage loans in 2005, when compared to the volume of loan originations, allowed us to continue to grow and geographically diversify our mortgage loan portfolio at a relatively low overhead cost while maintaining our traditional thrift business model. The increase in origination and purchase activity, when compared to the prior year, reflected the investment of part of the proceeds from our second step conversion and stock offering. We will continue to purchase mortgage loans to grow and diversify our portfolio, as opportunities and funding are available. Our first mortgage loan originations and purchases were exclusively in one to four family mortgage loans. Approximately 25.4% of the mortgage loan purchases and 52.9% of the mortgage loan originations were variable rate loans, which we consider to be any loan with a contractual annual rate adjustment, including those loans with an initial fixed rate period of one to ten years. At December 31, 2005, fixed rate mortgage loans accounted for 82.7% of our first mortgage loan portfolio compared with 92.5% at December 31, 2004. Notwithstanding the decrease in the percent of fixed rate loans to total loans, this percentage of fixed rate loans to total loans may have an adverse impact on our earnings in a rising rate environment as the interest rate on these loans would not reprice to current market interest rates, while our interest bearing deposits and callable borrowed funds would reprice, from time to time, to the higher market interest rates. At December 31, 2005, we were committed to purchase and originate $715.4 million and $260.8 million, respectively, of first mortgage loans, which are expected to settle during the first quarter of 2006. Total mortgage backed securities increased $1.53 billion to $6.91 billion at December 31, 2005 from $5.38 billion at December 31, 2004 reflecting the investment of part of the proceeds from our second step conversion and our growth initiatives. This increase in total mortgage backed securities resulted from $3.28 billion in purchases of securities, all of which are directly or indirectly insured or guaranteed by a government agency or government sponsored enterprise. Of these purchases, approximately 93.1% were variable rate or hybrid instruments, with initial fixed rate periods ranging from one to seven years. At December 31, 2005, variable rate mortgage backed securities accounted for 53.6% of our portfolio compared with 23.4% at December 31, 2004. We intend to continue to purchase variable rate securities, as well as originate and purchase variable rate mortgage loans, growing our fixed rate and variable rate portfolios by equal amounts, as part of our strategy to assist in the management of our interest rate risk. At December 31, 2005, we were committed to purchase $452.5 million of when issued government agency or government sponsored agency variable rate mortgage backed securities, which are expected to settle during the first quarter of 2006. Accrued interest receivable increased $43.2 million, primarily due to increased balances in loans and investments. The $12.7 million increase in banking premises and equipment, net, reflected additional growth related to our branch expansion strategy. The $41.4 million increase in other assets primarily reflected the increase in the deferred tax asset related to the increase in the unrealized loss on our available for sale investment and mortgage backed securities. Total liabilities increased $4.13 billion, or 22.0%, to $22.87 billion at December 31, 2005 compared with $18.74 billion at December 31, 2004. Borrowed funds increased $4.20 billion, or 58.7%, to $11.35 billion at December 31, 2005 from $7.15 billion at December 31, 2004. The additional borrowed funds were primarily used to fund our asset growth. Borrowed funds were comprised of $7.90 billion of securities sold under agreements to repurchase and $3.45 billion of Federal Home Loan Bank advances. The fair market value of securities pledged as collateral for our reverse repurchase agreements was approximately $8.23 billion. Advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank utilize our mortgage loan portfolio as Page 61 Table of Contents collateral. The $5.13 billion in new borrowings have initial non call periods ranging from one to five years, final maturities of ten years, and a weighted average rate of 3.82%. Total deposits decreased $94.0 million during 2005, reflecting the consolidation of the $145.8 million deposit of Hudson City, MHC, which was added to our capital, and the use of approximately $229.9 million of customer deposits to purchase stock during our second step stock offering. We experienced increased competitive pressure and extreme pricing of short term deposits during the second half of 2005 in the New York metropolitan area. We believed the price of borrowed funds was more economical and reflective of current rates than the price of deposits and therefore priced our deposits at a competitive, but prudent rate, resulting in the use of borrowed funds at a greater rate to fund our asset growth. During 2005, a portion of our customers shifted deposits to the higher costing time deposit accounts from the High Value Checking account product. At December 31, 2005, the aggregate balance in our time deposits was $6.17 billion and the aggregate balance in the High Value Checking account was $3.52 billion compared with $5.27 billion and $4.19 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2004. Total stockholders equity increased $3.80 billion to $5.20 billion at December 31, 2005 from $1.40 billion at December 31, 2004. The increase in stockholders equity was primarily due to the net offering proceeds of $3.80 billion, a $145.8 million increase due to the consolidation of the deposit of Hudson City, MHC into Hudson City Bancorp as part of the second step conversion, and net income of $276.1 million for 2005. Also increasing stockholders equity was a $2.8 million increase due to the exercise of stock options, a $9.4 million permanent tax benefit due to the exercise of stock options and the vesting of employee stock benefit plans, and an $11.9 million increase due to the commitment of shares for our employee stock benefit plans. These increases to stockholders equity were partially offset by cash dividends declared and paid to common stockholders of $102.1 million, purchases of 15,719,223 shares for our employee stock ownership plan at an aggregate cost of $189.3 million, and purchases of 9,119,768 shares of treasury stock at an aggregate cost of $107.5 million. Further decreasing stockholders equity were purchases of 115,839 shares of common stock for our recognition and retention plan at an aggregate cost of $1.3 million and a $54.4 million further increase in our accumulated other comprehensive loss primarily due to higher market interest rates decreasing the market value of our available for sale portfolio. In October 2005, a sixth stock repurchase plan was approved to repurchase up to 29,880,000 shares, or approximately five percent of the then outstanding common stock. The fifth repurchase plan was terminated upon approval of the sixth plan. As of December 31, 2005, 21,017,000 shares are available for repurchase under this program. At December 31, 2005, the ratio of total stockholders equity to total assets was 18.53% compared with 6.96% at December 31, 2004. For 2005, the ratio of average stockholders equity to average assets was 15.10% compared with 7.29% for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in these ratios was primarily due to our completion of the second step conversion and stock offering. Stockholders equity per common share, calculated using the period end share count of outstanding shares, less purchased but unallocated employee stock ownership plan shares and less purchased but unvested management plan shares, was $9.44 at December 31, 2005 compared with $7.85 at December 31, 2004, reflecting the funds received from our second step conversion. Analysis of Net Interest Income Net interest income represents the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets, such as mortgage loans, mortgage backed securities and investment securities, and the expense we pay on interest bearing liabilities, such as time deposits and borrowed funds. Net interest income depends Page 62 Table of Contents on our volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates we earned or paid on them. Average Balance Sheet. The following table presents certain information regarding our financial condition and net interest income for 2005, 2004, and 2003. The table presents the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities for the periods indicated. We derived the yields and costs by dividing income or expense by the average balance of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities, respectively, for the periods shown. We derived average balances from daily balances over the periods indicated. Interest income includes fees that we considered adjustments to yields. Yields on tax exempt obligations were not computed on a tax equivalent basis.

(3) Determined by dividing net interest income by average total interest earning assets. (4) At December 31, 2005, the weighted average rate on our outstanding interest earning assets, other than our FHLB stock, was as follows: first mortgage loans, 5.64%, consumer and other loans, 5.81%, federal funds sold, 4.25%, mortgage backed securities, 4.75%, investment securities, 4.37%. At December 31, 2005, the weighted average rate on our outstanding interest bearing liabilities was as follows: savings accounts, 0.98%, interest bearing transaction accounts, 3.19%, money market accounts, 1.14%, time deposits, 3.51%, borrowed funds, 3.72%. Page 64 Table of Contents Rate/Volume Analysis. The following table presents the extent to which the changes in interest rates and the changes in volume of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected our interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated. Information is provided in each category with respect to: changes attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate); changes attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume); and the net change. The changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to rate. 2005 Compared to 2004 2004 Compared to 2003 Increase (Decrease) Due To Increase (Decrease) Due To Volume Rate Net Volume Rate Net (In thousands) Interest earning assets: First mortgage loans, net $ 156,410 $ (6,941 ) $ 149,469 $ 155,901 $ (30,352 ) $ 125,549 Consumer and other loans 2,373 (237 ) 2,136 960 (689 ) 271 Federal funds sold 1,963 1,470 3,433 (540 ) 326 (214 ) Mortgage backed securities 36,795 (6,067 ) 30,728 (25,313 ) (587 ) (25,900 ) Federal Home Loan Bank stock 472 5,709 6,181 (181 ) (1,030 ) (1,211 ) Investment securities 78,056 (6,153 ) 71,903 41,920 (2,685 ) 39,235 Total 276,069 (12,219 ) 263,850 172,747 (35,017 ) 137,730 Interest bearing liabilities: Savings accounts 350 350 175 (1,496 ) (1,321 ) Interest bearing transaction accounts 13,514 25,266 38,780 35,836 398 36,234 Money market accounts (1,279 ) 770 (509 ) (331 ) (877 ) (1,208 ) Time deposits 1,416 38,886 40,302 (11,613 ) (16,618 ) (28,231 ) Borrowed funds 102,151 5,634 107,785 73,146 (24,908 ) 48,238 Total 116,152 70,556 186,708 97,213 (43,501 ) 53,712 Net change in net interest income $ 159,917 $ (82,775 ) $ 77,142 $ 75,534 $ 8,484 $ 84,018 Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 General. Net income was $276.1 million for the year 2005, reflecting an increase of $36.8 million, or 15.4%, compared with net income of $239.3 million for the year 2004. Basic and diluted earnings per common share were $0.49 and $0.48, respectively, for 2005 compared with basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.41 and $0.40, respectively, for 2004. For the year 2005 our return on average stockholders equity was 7.52% compared with 17.66% for the year 2004. Our return on average assets for 2005 was 1.14% compared with 1.29% for 2004. The decreases in these ratios were primarily due to the receipt of the net proceeds from our second step conversion and stock offering completed in June 2005, which significantly increased average stockholders equity and average assets. The decrease in the return on average assets also reflected our balance sheet growth during a period of narrowing net interest rate spreads and a flattening market yield curve. Page 65 Table of Contents Interest and Dividend Income. Total interest and dividend income increased $263.9 million, or 28.8%, to $1.18 billion for 2005 compared with $915.1 million for 2004. The increase in total interest and dividend income was primarily due to a $5.72 billion, or 31.3%, increase in the average balance of total interest earning assets to $23.97 billion for 2005 compared with $18.25 billion for 2004. The growth in the average balance of total interest earning assets was consistent with the growth initiatives employed by us during recent periods and also reflected the receipt of the net offering proceeds from our second step conversion. The increase in interest and dividend income due to the increase in the average balance was partially offset by a decrease of nine basis points in the weighted average yield on total interest earning assets to 4.92% for the year 2005 from 5.01% for the year 2004. This decrease in the weighted average yield reflected a shift in our interest earning asset mix to shorter term investment securities to help manage our interest rate risk. Investments of this type included the purchase of agency discount notes from the second step conversion net offering proceeds, and the origination and purchase of a larger percentage of variable rate mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities. The $149.4 million increase in interest and fee income on first mortgage loans was primarily due to a $2.88 billion increase in the average balance of first mortgage loans, which reflected our continued emphasis on balance sheet growth in our core investment in first mortgage loans. The increase in mortgage loan income due to the increase in the average balance was partially offset by a seven basis point decrease in the weighted average yield, which reflected the larger volume of originations and purchases of variable rate loans during 2005, which generally have initial yields that are less than fixed rate loans. The $71.9 million increase in interest and dividends on total investment securities was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of total investment securities of $1.83 billion, which reflected the investment of part of the net proceeds from the second step conversion and stock offering, and the investment of certain of the cash flows from the prepayment activity on our mortgage related assets in 2004 into investment securities. The increase in interest and dividends on total investment securities due to the increase in the average balance was partially offset by a 22 basis point decrease in the weighted average yield reflecting purchases of securities with maturity or initial rate reset dates of less than two years, in order to assist in our management of interest rate risk. The $30.8 million increase in interest income on total mortgage backed securities was due to an $838.9 million increase in the average balance of total mortgage backed securities, which primarily reflected the purchase of variable rate securities during 2005 from the investment of part of the net proceeds from the second step offering to assist in our management of interest rate risk. The increase in income due to the increase in the average balance was partially offset by a 11 basis point decrease in the weighted average yield, reflecting the larger volume of purchases of variable rate and hybrid instruments, which generally have initial yields that are less than fixed rate securities. Interest Expense. Total interest expense, comprised of interest on deposits and interest on borrowed funds, increased $186.7 million, or 43.4%, to $616.8 million for the year 2005 from $430.1 million for the year 2004. This increase was primarily due to a $3.35 billion, or 20.1%, increase in the average balance of total interest bearing liabilities to $20.04 billion for 2005 compared with $16.69 billion for 2004. This increase in interest bearing liabilities was primarily used to fund asset growth. The increase in total interest expense was also due to a 50 basis point increase in the weighted average cost of total interest bearing liabilities to 3.08% for the year 2005 compared with 2.58% for the year 2004, which reflected the growth of our interest bearing liabilities during the rising short term interest rate environment experienced during 2004 and 2005. Page 66 Table of Contents Interest expense on borrowed funds increased $107.7 million primarily due to a $2.82 billion increase in the average balance of borrowed funds and, to a lesser extent, a nine basis point increase in the weighted average cost of borrowed funds. The increase in the average balance of borrowed funds was used to fund asset growth. The $5.13 billion of new borrowings incurred during 2005 all had maturity periods of ten years and initial non call periods of one to five years, extending the overall maturity of our liabilities in order to assist in the management of interest rate risk. The new borrowings had a weighted average rate of 3.82%. The increase in the average cost of borrowed funds reflected the continued growth of our borrowed funds in the increasing intermediate and long term interest rate environment that existed during 2004 and 2005. The $78.9 million increase in interest expense on interest bearing deposits for the year 2005 was due to a $526.8 million increase in the average balance of interest bearing deposits and a 61 basis point increase in the weighted average cost of interest bearing deposits. The growth in the average balance of interest bearing deposits was primarily used to fund our growth initiatives and was primarily due to increases in our interest bearing transaction account. The increase in the weighted average cost of interest bearing deposits, experienced principally in interest bearing transaction accounts and time deposits, reflected the rising short term market interest rate environment experienced during 2004 and 2005 and the need to increase rates on these deposit products in the highly competitive deposit market of the New York metropolitan area. The $38.7 million increase in interest expense on our interest bearing transaction accounts reflected an increase in the average balance of interest bearing transaction accounts of $548.9 million, primarily due to the growth of our High Value Checking account product, and a 64 basis point increase in the weighted average cost due to the rising short term market interest rate environment. The $40.3 million increase in interest expense on our time deposit accounts reflected a 70 basis point increase in the weighted average cost, due to the rising short term market interest rate environment, and a $63.8 million increase in the average balance of time deposit accounts. We intend to continue to fund future asset growth using customer deposits as our primary source of funds, by continuing to pay competitive, but prudent rates and by opening new branch offices. We will continue to supplement deposit growth using borrowed funds. Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased $77.1 million, or 15.9%, to $562.1 million for the year 2005 compared with $485.0 million for the year 2004. This increase primarily reflected the investment of the net offering proceeds from our second step conversion and our internally generated growth initiatives, the combination of which resulted in a larger increase in the average balance of total interest earning assets when compared to the increase in the average balance of total interest bearing liabilities. The increase due to our growth was partially offset by an increase in the costs of our interest bearing deposits and borrowed funds. Our net interest rate spread decreased 59 basis points to 1.84% for 2005 from 2.43% for 2004 and our net interest margin decreased 31 basis points to 2.35% for 2005 from 2.66% for 2004. The decrease in these ratios was primarily due to an increase in the weighted average cost of interest bearing liabilities and a decrease in the weighted average yield on interest earning assets. The increase in the cost of our interest bearing liabilities reflected the rising short term interest rate environment and the borrowing of funds with longer terms to initial reprice or maturity than in previous periods. The decrease in the yield on our interest earning assets reflected the shift in our investment portfolio to shorter term interest earning assets, accomplished by purchasing and originating a larger percentage of variable rate instruments and purchasing agency discount notes with part of the proceeds from our second step conversion and stock offering. The smaller decrease in our net interest margin, when compared to the decrease in our net interest rate spread, reflected the infusion of capital due to the completion of our second step conversion. Page 67 Table of Contents Provision for Loan Losses. Our provision for loan losses during 2005 was $65,000 compared with $790,000 during 2004. The decrease in the provision reflected recent favorable charge off trends and strong payment performance by our borrowers during 2005 resulting in a positive delinquency experience. Net recoveries for the year 2005 were $9,000 compared with net charge offs of $18,000 for the year 2004. The allowance for loan losses increased $74,000 to $27.4 million at December 31, 2005 from $27.3 million at December 31, 2004. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans was 0.18% at December 31, 2005 compared with 0.24% at December 31, 2004. Non performing loans, defined as non accruing loans and accruing loans delinquent 90 days or more, decreased $2.3 million to $19.3 million at December 31, 2005 from $21.6 million at December 31, 2004, reflecting decreases in delinquencies primarily in our serviced loan portfolio. The ratio of non performing loans to total loans was 0.13% at December 31, 2005 compared with 0.19% at December 31, 2004. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans was 141.84% at December 31, 2005 compared with 126.44% at December 31, 2004. During 2005, we lowered the loss factors used in our analysis of the loan loss allowance for our first mortgage loans to reflect the seasoning of the purchased loan portfolio and the recent favorable charge off experience and delinquency trends. As a result of these trends, we recorded no provision during the second, third and fourth quarters of 2005 and a minimal provision for loan losses in the year 2005 to reflect probable losses resulting from the actual growth in our loan portfolio. We consider the ratio of allowance for loan losses to total loans at December 31, 2005, given our primary lending emphasis and current market conditions, to be adequate. Although we believe that we have established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at adequate levels, additions may be necessary if future economic and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment. Although we use the best information available, the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate that is subject to significant judgment and short term change. See Critical Accounting Policies. Non Interest Income. Total non interest income decreased $8.6 million to $8.0 million for 2005 from $16.6 million for 2004. The decrease in non interest income primarily reflected the decrease in gains on securities transactions, net, as no sales of securities occurred during the second, third or fourth quarters of 2005, and minimal sales occurred in the first quarter of 2005. Non Interest Expense. Total non interest expense increased $9.4 million, or 7.9%, to $127.7 million for 2005 from $118.3 million for 2004. The increase primarily reflected normal salary adjustments, and increases in net occupancy expense, employee compensation and advertising expense due to our branch expansion program. Our efficiency ratio was 22.40% for the year 2005 compared with 23.60% for the year 2004. Our ratio of non interest expense to average total assets for 2005 was 0.53% compared with 0.64% for 2004. The decrease in these ratios reflected our ability to leverage our existing infrastructure to support continuing asset growth while controlling operating expenses, as our average assets grew in excess of 30.0% during 2005. Income Taxes. Income tax expense increased $23.2 million, or 16.2%, to $166.3 million for 2005 from $143.1 million for 2004, reflecting the 15.7% increase in income before income tax expense. Our effective tax rate for the year 2005 was 37.60% compared with 37.43% for 2004. Our effective tax rate may increase approximately 2% in future years related to a change in New Jersey tax regulations regarding the deductibility of dividends received from a real estate investment trust subsidiary. Page 68 Table of Contents Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003 During 2004, our total assets increased $3.12 billion, or 18.3%, to $20.15 billion at December 31, 2004 from $17.03 billion at December 31, 2003. Loans increased $2.56 billion, or 29.1%, to $11.36 billion at December 31, 2004 from $8.80 billion at December 31, 2003. The increase in loans reflected our loan purchase activity, our continued focus on the origination of one to four family first mortgage loans, primarily in New Jersey and the New York metropolitan area, and a significant decline in loan prepayment activity during the period. For 2004, we purchased first mortgage loans of $3.12 billion and originated first mortgage loans of $1.38 billion, compared with purchases of $3.21 billion and originations of $2.17 billion for 2003. The larger volume of purchased mortgage loans, when compared to the amount of mortgage loans originated, allowed us to grow and geographically diversify our mortgage loan portfolio at a relatively low overhead cost while maintaining our traditional thrift business model. We will continue to purchase mortgage loans to grow and diversify our portfolio, as opportunities and funding are available. The lower volume of origination activity was primarily due to a decline in refinancing activity. Our first mortgage loan originations and purchases were exclusively in one to four family mortgage loans and were primarily fixed rate loans. At December 31, 2004, fixed rate mortgage loans accounted for 92.5% of our first mortgage loan portfolio compared with 90.9% at December 31, 2003. This percentage of fixed rate loans to total loans may have an adverse impact on our earnings in a rising rate environment as the interest rate on these loans would not reprice, while our interest bearing deposits and callable borrowed funds would reprice, from time to time, to the higher market interest rates. During 2004, $144.0 million of our loan originations were the result of refinancing of our existing mortgage loans compared with $530.4 million during 2003. The dollar amount of refinancing of existing mortgage loans was included in total loan originations. We allow customers with Hudson City originated loans to modify, for a fee, their existing mortgage loans with the intent of maintaining customer relationships in periods of extensive refinancing due to low long term interest rates. In general, all terms and conditions of the existing mortgage loan remain the same except the adjustment of the interest rate to the currently offered fixed rate product with a similar term to maturity or to a reduced term at the request of the borrower. Modifications of our existing mortgage loans during 2004 were approximately $220.1 million compared with $1.46 billion during 2003. These loan modifications were not reflected in loan origination totals. We feel loan refinancing and modification activity are inversely related to the level of interest rates. The decrease in the refinancing and modification activity, when comparing the 2004 activity to the 2003 activity, was due to the general stability of long term interest rates during 2004 compared to the steeply declining interest rate environment during the first half of 2003 and prior periods. If long term rates increase or remain relatively stable, we expect the amount of loan refinancings and modifications to remain at the 2004 levels or decrease. Investment securities held to maturity increased to $1.33 billion at December 31, 2004 from $1.4 million at December 31, 2003. During 2004, we began to classify certain of our government sponsored agency security purchases as held to maturity. This increase in investment securities held to maturity reflected, in part, the subsequent reinvestment of part of the resulting cash flows from the $649.2 million decrease of investment securities available for sale due to calls of such securities during 2004. The increase in investment securities held to maturity also represented a strategy to shorten the overall final maturity of our interest earning assets, while continuing to grow our balance sheet, by investing a portion of the cash flows from our mortgage related assets into investment securities. Of the agency securities purchased and classified as held to maturity, $621.6 million have step up features, where the interest rate is increased on scheduled future dates. These securities have call options that are generally effective prior to the initial Page 69 Table of Contents rate increase but after an initial non call period of three months to one year. The initial rate for the securities purchased was higher than interest rates on similar agency securities offered at the time of purchase without the step up feature. The rate increases are at least one percent per adjustment and are fixed over the life of the security. Overall, the aggregate balance of the mortgage backed securities portfolio remained relatively stable at $5.38 billion at December 31, 2004 compared with $5.42 billion at December 31, 2003. Payments received on mortgage backed securities were primarily reinvested into fixed rate mortgage backed securities at the prevailing market interest rates. Accrued interest receivable increased $17.3 million, primarily due to increased balances in loans and investments. Fixed assets increased $5.0 million primarily due to our branch expansion. Total liabilities increased $3.04 billion, or 19.4%, to $18.74 billion at December 31, 2004 compared with $15.70 billion at December 31, 2003. Total deposits increased $1.03 billion, or 9.8%, to $11.48 billion at December 31, 2004 from $10.45 billion at December 31, 2003. The increase in total deposits was primarily used to fund our growth initiatives. Interest bearing deposits increased $1.00 billion primarily due to an increase of $1.48 billion in our interest bearing High Value Checking account product, partially offset by a $405.8 million decrease in time deposits. We believe the increase in interest bearing deposits was due primarily to our consistent offering of competitive rates on our interest bearing High Value Checking account product. The balance in the High Value Checking account at December 31, 2004 was $4.19 billion compared with $2.71 billion at December 31, 2003. We believe the decrease in time deposits was due, in part, to transfers to our High Value Checking account and significant competition for deposits in the New York metropolitan area. Borrowed funds increased $2.00 billion, or 38.8%, to $7.15 billion at December 31, 2004 from $5.15 billion at December 31, 2003. The additional borrowed funds were primarily used to fund our asset growth. Borrowed funds were comprised of $5.30 billion of securities sold under agreements to repurchase and $1.85 billion of FHLB advances. Securities pledged as collateral against our securities sold under agreements to repurchase had a market value at December 31, 2004 of approximately $5.63 billion. Advances from the FHLB utilize our mortgage portfolio as collateral. The $3.75 billion in new borrowings, which had initial call dates of predominately two to four years from the date of borrowing, were partially offset by calls and maturities of borrowed funds in an aggregate amount of $1.75 billion. Total stockholders equity increased $73.5 million, or 5.5%, to $1.40 billion at December 31, 2004 from $1.33 billion at December 31, 2003. The increase in stockholders equity was primarily due to net income of $239.3 million for 2004, a $6.5 million increase due to the exercise of 2,886,042 stock options, a $20.9 million permanent tax benefit due to the exercise of stock options and the vesting of employee stock benefit plans, and a $19.5 million increase due to the commitment of shares for our employee stock benefit plans. These increases to stockholders equity were partially offset by repurchases of 14,716,187 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $161.7 million, purchases of 641,200 shares of common stock for our recognition and retention plan at an aggregate cost of $7.3 million, cash dividends declared and paid to common stockholders of $40.5 million and a $3.1 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss primarily due to a decrease in the fair value of our available for sale investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2004 there remained 9,862,365 shares authorized to be purchased under our then current stock repurchase program. The decrease from prior years in the amount of the cash dividend paid to common stockholders reflects the waiver of receipt of the dividend by Hudson City, MHC, the majority stockholder of Hudson City Bancorp in accordance with the regulations and policies of the OTS. Prior to 2004, Hudson City, MHC was subject to the policies of the FDIC, which did not permit dividend waivers. Page 70 Table of Contents At December 31, 2004, the ratio of total stockholders equity to total assets was 6.96% compared with 7.80% at December 31, 2003. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the ratio of average stockholders equity to average assets was 7.29% compared with 8.73% for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease in these ratios was primarily due to our capital management strategy of planned asset growth, and a slower percentage growth in stockholders equity as compared to the percentage growth in assets, due to payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases. Stockholders equity per common share was $7.85 at December 31, 2004 compared with $7.33 at December 31, 2003. Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 General. Net income was $239.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $31.9 million, or 15.4%, compared with net income of $207.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Basic and diluted earnings per common share were $0.41 and $0.40, respectively, for 2004 compared with basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.35 and $0.34, respectively, for 2003. For the year ended December 31, 2004 our return on average stockholders equity was 17.66% compared with 15.38% for 2003. The increase in the return on average stockholders equity was primarily due to the growth of our net income and a slower percentage growth of stockholders equity due to payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases. Our return on average assets for 2004 was 1.29% compared with 1.34% for 2003. The decrease in the return on average assets was primarily due to our overall balance sheet growth in the prevailing interest rate environments of 2003 and 2004. Interest and Dividend Income. Total interest and dividend income increased $137.8 million, or 17.7%, to $915.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared with $777.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in total interest and dividend income was primarily due to a $3.12 billion, or 20.6%, increase in the average balance of total interest earning assets to $18.25 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared with $15.13 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003. The growth in the average balance of total interest earning assets was consistent with the growth initiatives employed by us during recent periods. The impact on interest and dividend income from the increase in the average balance of our total interest earning assets was partially off set by a 13 basis point decrease in the average yield on total interest earning assets to 5.01% for 2004 from 5.14% for 2003, primarily reflecting the growth of our interest earning assets during the prevailing interest rate environments of 2003 and 2004. The $125.6 million increase in interest and fee income on first mortgage loans was primarily due to a $2.79 billion increase in the average balance of first mortgage loans, which reflected our continued emphasis on balance sheet growth in our core business of first mortgage loans. The increase in mortgage loan income due to the increase in the average balance was partially offset by a 41 basis point decrease in the average yield, which reflected the large volume of loan origination and purchase activity during the prevailing long term interest rate environments of 2003 and 2004. The $39.2 million increase in interest and dividends on total investment securities was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of investment securities of $938.0 million, which reflected the subsequent reinvestment of certain of the cash flows from the prepayment activity on our mortgage related assets in 2003 and 2004 into investment securities, and was consistent with the decision to shorten the overall weighted average life of our interest earning assets by investing in callable securities with initial call dates of three months to one year and final maturity dates of five to seven years. The increase in income on total investment securities due to the increase in the average balance was partially offset by a 15 basis Page 71 Table of Contents point decrease in the average yield on our investment securities, which reflected the large volume of purchases made during the prevailing interest rate environments of 2003 and 2004. The $25.9 million decrease in interest income on total mortgage backed securities was primarily due to a $568.9 million decrease in the average balance of total mortgage backed securities, which reflected the high volume of prepayment activity, the sales of mortgage backed securities available for sale, and the subsequent reinvestment of certain of the resulting cash flows into investment securities or purchased mortgage loans. The decrease in interest income on total mortgage backed securities also reflected a 1 basis point decrease in the average yield on mortgage backed securities. The impact on mortgage backed securities interest income of the decline in the average balance and weighted average yield was partially offset by the slowing of the net premium amortization due to the decline in prepayment activity during the second half of 2003 and 2004. Interest Expense. Total interest expense, comprised of interest on deposits and interest on borrowed funds, increased $53.7 million, or 14.3%, to $430.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $376.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily due to a $3.11 billion, or 22.9%, increase in the average balance of total interest bearing liabilities to $16.69 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared with $13.58 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003. The impact of the increase in the average balance of total interest bearing liabilities was offset, in part, by a 19 basis point decrease in the average cost of total interest bearing liabilities to 2.58% for 2004 from 2.77% for 2003. Interest expense on borrowed funds increased $48.3 million primarily due to a $2.01 billion increase in the average balance of borrowed funds to $6.10 billion for 2004, the impact of which was partially offset by a 55 basis point decrease in the average cost of borrowed funds to 3.53% for 2004. The increase in the average balance of borrowed funds was used to fund asset growth. The decrease in the average cost of borrowed funds reflected the continued growth of our borrowed funds in the prevailing interest rate environments that existed during 2003 and 2004. We intend to continue to use borrowed funds as a funding source for our asset growth initiatives, with new borrowings primarily having periods to initial repricing of three to five years. Interest expense on interest bearing deposits increased $5.5 million primarily due to a $1.10 billion increase in the average balance of interest bearing deposits to $10.59 billion for 2004, the impact of which was partially offset by an 18 basis point decrease in the average cost to 2.03%. The increase in the average balance of interest bearing deposits, primarily used to fund asset growth, reflected a $1.61 billion increase in the average balance of interest bearing transaction accounts due to the growth in our High Value Checking account product. We believe the increase in the average balance of interest bearing deposits was primarily due to our consistent offering of competitive rates on our High Value Checking account product. We believe the $487.9 million decrease in the average balance of time deposits was due in part to transfers to our High Value Checking account and significant competition for deposits in the New York metropolitan area. We intend to continue to fund future asset growth using customer deposits as our primary source of funds, by continuing to pay competitive rates and by opening new branch offices, while supplementing the deposit growth with borrowed funds. The 18 basis point decrease in the average cost of interest bearing deposits primarily reflected a 29 basis point decrease in the average cost of our time deposits, a 16 basis point decrease in the average cost of savings accounts and a 14 basis point decrease in the average cost of money market accounts. These decreases were partially offset by a 2 basis point increase in the average cost of interest bearing transaction deposits reflecting the increasing short term interest rate environment of 2004. This decrease Page 72 Table of Contents in the average cost of interest bearing deposits reflected the prevailing interest rate environments experienced during 2003 and 2004. Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased $84.0 million, or 20.9%, to $485.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared with $401.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase primarily reflected our growth initiatives, which resulted in increases in the average balance of both interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, and the net interest rate spread earned on this growth. Our net interest rate spread, determined by subtracting the weighted average cost of total interest bearing liabilities from the weighted average yield on total interest earning assets, increased 6 basis points to 2.43% for 2004 from 2.37% for 2003. Our net interest margin, determined by dividing net interest income by total average interest earning assets, increased 1 basis point to 2.66% for 2004 from 2.65% for 2003. The increases in these ratios reflected the larger decrease in the cost of total interest bearing liabilities compared with the decrease in the yield of total interest earning assets primarily due to the decreased prepayment activity on our mortgage related assets, and the resulting decrease in the amortization of the net premium on these assets. The increase in these ratios also reflected the overall shift in our asset mix towards first mortgage loans, which have a higher yield than our other interest earning assets, the impact of which was partially offset by an overall shift in our liability mix toward borrowed funds, which have a higher average rate than our other interest bearing liabilities. Provision for Loan Losses. Our provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $790,000 compared with $900,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003. Net charge offs for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $18,000 compared with net recoveries of $146,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003. The allowance for loan losses increased $772,000 to $27.3 million at December 31, 2004 from $26.5 million at December 31, 2003. The increase in the allowance for loan losses, through the provision for loan losses, reflected the overall growth of the loan portfolio, increases in non performing loans and low levels of charge offs. Non performing loans, defined as non accruing loans and accruing loans delinquent 90 days or more, increased $1.3 million to $21.6 million at December 31, 2004 from $20.3 million at December 31, 2003, primarily reflecting increases in non accrual loans. The ratio of non performing loans to total loans was 0.19% at December 31, 2004 compared with 0.23% at December 31, 2003. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans was 126.44% at December 31, 2004 compared with 131.09% at December 31, 2003. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans was 0.24% at December 31, 2004 compared with 0.30% at December 31, 2003. During 2004, we lowered the loss factors used in our worksheet on our purchased mortgage loans to reflect the seasoning of the portfolio, and the charge off and delinquency experience. Notwithstanding such decrease, we have maintained a minimal provision for loan losses during 2004 to reflect expected losses resulting from the actual growth in our loan portfolio. We consider the ratio of allowance for loan losses to total loans at December 31, 2004, given our primary lending emphasis and current market conditions, to be at an acceptable level. Furthermore, the increase in the allowance for loan losses during 2004 reflected the growth in the loan portfolio, the low levels of loan charge offs, the stability in the real estate market and the resulting stability in our overall loan quality. Non Interest Income. Total non interest income decreased $13.1 million to $16.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $29.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease in non interest income primarily reflected a $12.9 million decrease in gains on securities transactions, net to $11.4 million for 2004 from $24.3 million for 2003, primarily due to decreases in sales of mortgage Page 73 Table of Contents backed securities. The $11.4 million gain on securities transactions during 2004 resulted from an opportunity to realize gains from the sale of certain available for sale mortgage backed securities prior to interest rate changes, such as seen in the second quarter of 2004, which would have had an adverse impact on their fair market value. The historically low interest rate environment enabled us to realize these gains on the sales of securities, as the lower rates increased the fair value of the fixed rate securities sold. The gains in 2003 resulted from the enhanced opportunities to realize gains due to the declining interest rate environment. The total cash flow from the sales of these securities during 2004 was $510.5 million, which was subsequently reinvested into mortgage loans and investment securities. Non Interest Expense. Total non interest expense increased $15.8 million, or 15.4%, to $118.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $102.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase was primarily due to increases in compensation and employee benefit expense related to our employee stock benefit plans, compensation expense related to staff increases due to our branch expansion program, occupancy expenses due to our branch expansion program and expenses related to internal control evaluation and testing in order to comply with the new certification requirements imposed by the Sarbanes Oxley Act and other regulatory costs. Our efficiency ratio was 23.60% for 2004 compared with 23.81% for 2003. Our ratio of non interest expense to average total assets for 2004 was 0.64% compared with 0.66% for 2003. The relative stability of these ratios reflected our efforts to control costs, notwithstanding the actual increase in non interest expense, as our average assets grew in excess of 20.0% when comparing 2004 to 2003. Income Taxes. Income tax expense increased $23.3 million, or 19.4%, to $143.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $119.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, primarily due to the 16.9% increase in income before income tax expense. Our effective tax rate increased for 2004 to 37.43% from 36.61% for 2003, primarily due to the expense of the employee stock ownership plan, which is not fully deductible for income tax purposes. Liquidity and Capital Resources The term liquidity refers to our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to fund loan originations, loan and security purchases, deposit withdrawals, repayment of borrowings and operating expenses. Our primary sources of funds are scheduled amortization and prepayments of loan principal and mortgage backed securities, deposits, borrowed funds, maturities and calls of investment securities and funds provided by our operations. Our membership in the FHLB provides us access to additional sources of borrowed funds, which is generally limited to approximately twenty times the amount of FHLB stock owned. We also have the ability to access the capital markets from time to time, depending on market conditions. Our investment policy provides that we shall maintain a primary liquidity ratio, which consists of investments in cash, cash in banks, Federal funds sold, securities with remaining maturities of less than five years and adjustable rate mortgage backed securities repricing within one year, in an amount equal to at least 4% of total deposits and short term borrowings. At December 31, 2005, our primary liquidity ratio was 38.0%. Deposit flows, calls of investment securities and borrowed funds, and prepayments of loans and mortgage backed securities are strongly influenced by interest rates, general and local economic conditions and competition in the marketplace. These factors reduce the predictability of the timing of these sources of funds. As mortgage interest rates decline, customer prepayment activity tends to accelerate causing an increase in cash flow from both our mortgage loan and mortgage backed security portfolios. If our pricing is competitive, the demand for mortgage originations also accelerates. When Page 74 Table of Contents mortgage rates increase, the opposite effect on prepayment activity tends to occur and our loan origination and purchase activity becomes increasingly dependent on the strength of our residential real estate market and the volume of home purchases and new construction activity in the markets we serve. The second step conversion provided a significant amount of net available proceeds for investment. We raised approximately $3.93 billion in our second step conversion, which was completed in June 2005. The net $3.80 billion in cash proceeds from the second step conversion reflected the receipt of the $3.93 billion in offering proceeds less the payment of $125.0 million in conversion related expenses. The amount of funds available for investment was $3.57 billion, reflecting a further $229.9 million reduction from the net offering proceeds due to the use of customer deposits to purchase stock. Principal repayments on loans were $2.15 billion during the year 2005 compared with $2.02 billion for the year 2004. The increase in payments on loans reflected the growth of our loan portfolio during this period of relatively stable long term interest rates and prepayment activity. Principal payments received on mortgage backed securities totaled $1.46 billion during 2005 compared with $1.73 billion during 2004. The decrease in payments on mortgage backed securities reflected the decline in the aggregate balance of mortgage backed securities during 2004, and a decline in the prepayment rate. Maturities and calls of investment securities totaled $1.70 billion during 2005, which included the $1.50 billion of maturing agency discount notes purchased with a portion of the net offering proceeds, compared with maturities and calls of $1.42 billion during the corresponding period in 2004. The decrease in maturities and calls, when not including the maturing discount notes, reflected the relatively stable long term interest rate environment during 2005 resulting in a decrease in call activity. Total deposits decreased $94.0 million during the year 2005 compared with an increase of $1.02 billion during the year 2004. Deposit flows, in general, are affected by the level of market interest rates, the interest rates and products offered by competitors, the volatility of equity markets, and other factors. The decrease in deposits during 2005 was due primarily to the consolidation of the $145.8 million deposit of Hudson City, MHC, as part of the second step conversion, which was added to our capital, and the use of approximately $229.9 million of customer deposits to purchase stock during our offering. Time deposit accounts scheduled to mature within one year were $4.98 billion at December 31, 2005. We anticipate that we will have sufficient resources to meet this current funding commitment. Based on our deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy, we anticipate that a significant portion of these time deposits will remain with us as renewed time deposits or transfers to other deposit products. We are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position; therefore we monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis. For the year 2005, we borrowed an additional $5.13 billion compared with new borrowings of $3.75 billion for the year 2004. We made $925.0 million in principal payments on borrowed funds during 2005 compared with $1.75 billion for 2004. The funds borrowed during 2005 all have initial non call periods ranging from one to five years and final maturities of ten years, and were primarily used to fund our asset growth. At December 31, 2005, there were no borrowed funds scheduled to mature within one year. However, we had $4.18 billion in borrowed funds, with a weighted average rate of 3.77%, that have the potential to be called within one year. We anticipate we will have sufficient resources to meet this funding commitment by borrowing new funds at the prevailing market interest rate, or by paying off the borrowed funds as they are called. Our primary investing activities are the origination and purchase of one to four family real estate loans and consumer and other loans, the purchase of mortgage backed securities, and the purchase of investment securities. Of the $3.57 billion in net proceeds from the second step conversion available for investment, approximately $1.50 billion was directly invested into government sponsored agency Page 75 Table of Contents discount notes yielding approximately 3.24%, all of which matured during the second half of 2005. These funds were subsequently reinvested primarily into callable government sponsored agency securities with maturities not exceeding two years, government sponsored agency step up securities. We also directly invested approximately $900.0 million of the offering proceeds into callable government sponsored agency securities with an average yield of 3.94% and approximately $400.0 million into government sponsored agency step up notes with an average yield of 4.00%. The remainder of the proceeds was primarily used to purchase adjustable rate mortgage backed securities and, to a lesser extent, purchase and originate first mortgage loans. We originated total loans of $2.19 billion during the year 2005 compared with $1.46 billion during the year 2004. Of the first mortgage loan originations during 2005, 52.9% were variable rate loans. During the year 2005 we purchased total loans of $3.68 billion compared with $3.12 billion during the year 2004. Of the first mortgage loan purchases during 2005, 25.4% were variable rate loans. The continued larger volume of purchased mortgage loans in 2005, when compared to originated loans, allowed us to grow and geographically diversify our mortgage loan portfolio at a relatively low overhead cost while maintaining our traditional thrift business model. The increase in loan purchases also reflected the asset growth strategies we have employed during recent periods, using borrowed funds as our primary funding source. We will continue to purchase mortgage loans to grow and diversify our portfolio, as opportunities and funding are available. Purchases of mortgage backed securities during the year 2005 were $3.28 billion compared with $2.20 billion during the year 2004. The increase in purchases of mortgage backed securities reflected the shift of security purchases to variable rate mortgage backed securities to assist in our management of interest rate risk and the investment of part of the net proceeds from our second step conversion. Of the mortgage backed securities purchased during 2005, 93.1% were variable rate securities. During the year 2005, we purchased $4.31 billion of investment securities, of which $2.80 billion was invested directly from the net offering proceeds, compared with purchases of $2.11 billion during the year 2004. This decrease in purchases of investment securities, outside the investment of the net offering proceeds, reflected the lower amount of cash flows available for investment in 2005 due to the lower amount of calls of investment securities and the shift of security purchases to variable rate mortgage backed securities. As part of the membership requirements of the FHLB, we are required to hold a certain dollar amount of FHLB common stock based on our asset size or our borrowings from the FHLB. During the year 2005, we increased our amount of FHLB common stock held by $87.0 million due to purchases of $104.2 million exceeding redemptions of $17.2 million, necessitated by increases in our amount of outstanding borrowings with the FHLB and the implementation of a new capital plan by the FHLB. During the year 2004, we redeemed $24.9 million of FHLB stock, decreasing our FHLB common stock held by that amount, due to our declining balance of borrowed funds at the FHLB. The net purchases made during 2005 brought our total investment in FHLB stock to $227.0 million, the amount we are currently required to hold. Cash dividends declared and paid during 2005 were $102.1 million compared with $40.5 million during 2004. In both 2004 and 2005, Hudson City, MHC applied for and was granted approval from the OTS to waive receipt of dividends declared by Hudson City Bancorp. These waivers of dividend payments were effective for the entirety of 2004 and the first six months of 2005. Beginning in the third quarter of 2005, due to the consolidation of Hudson City, MHC into Hudson City Bancorp as part of the second step conversion, dividends were paid on all outstanding shares of Hudson City Bancorp common stock. The dividend pay out ratio using amount per share information, which does not reflect the dividend waiver by Hudson City, MHC in periods prior to the third quarter of 2005, was 54.69% for the year 2005 compared with 53.17% for the year 2004. On January 17, 2006, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash Page 76 Table of Contents dividend of $0.075 per common share. The dividend was paid on March 1, 2006 to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 3, 2006. During 2005, the independent trustee of our Employee Stock Ownership Plan purchased 15,719,223 shares of outstanding common stock at an aggregate cost of $189.3 million. Also during 2005, the trustee of our recognition and retention plan purchased 115,839 shares of common stock for our recognition and retention plan at an aggregate cost of $1.3 million due to awards to employees made during the period. Under our stock repurchase programs, shares of Hudson City Bancorp common stock may be purchased in the open market and through other privately negotiated transactions, from time to time, depending on market conditions. The repurchased shares are held as treasury stock for general corporate use. In October 2005, a sixth stock repurchase plan was approved by the Board of Directors and the OTS to repurchase up to 29,880,000 shares, or approximately five percent of the then outstanding common stock. The fifth stock repurchase program, which had been suspended in late 2004 due to our second step conversion and stock offering, was canceled due to the approval of this sixth plan. During 2005 we purchased 9,119,768 of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $107.5 million, including the purchase of 256,768 shares in April 2005 directly from vesting shares in our recognition and retention plan for payment of income taxes. At December 31, 2005, there remained 21,017,000 shares to be purchased in the sixth plan. During 2004, we purchased 14,716,187 shares at an aggregate cost of $161.7 million under our stock repurchase program. At December 31, 2005, Hudson City Savings exceeded all regulatory capital requirements. Hudson City Savings tangible capital ratio, leverage (core) capital ratio and total risk based capital ratio were 14.68%, 14.68% and 41.31%, respectively. These ratios reflect the $3.00 billion contribution of net offering proceeds from Hudson City Bancorp. The primary source of liquidity for Hudson City Bancorp, the holding company of Hudson City Savings, is capital distributions from the banking subsidiary. During the year 2005, Hudson City Bancorp received $259.3 million in dividend payments from Hudson City Savings, which amounted to approximately 96.4% of Hudson City Savings net income for that period. The primary use of these funds is the payment of dividends to our shareholders, the repurchase of our common stock and the lending of funds to the independent trustee of our ESOP for the purchase of shares. Hudson City Bancorps ability to continue these activities is solely dependent upon capital distributions from Hudson City Savings. Applicable federal law may limit the amount of capital distributions Hudson City Savings may make. (See Item 1 Business Regulation of Hudson City Savings Bank and Hudson City Bancorp Federally Chartered Savings Bank Regulations Limitation on Capital Distributions) Management of Interest Rate Risk As a financial institution, our primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility. Our net income is primarily based on net interest income, and fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact the level of both income and expense recorded on a large portion of our assets and liabilities. Fluctuations in interest rates will also affect the market value of all interest earning assets, other than those that possess a short term to maturity. During 2005, short term interest rates increased to the same levels as intermediate and long term interest rates, resulting in a flat, and occasionally inverted, market yield curve. This interest rate environment had an adverse impact on our net interest income as our interest bearing liabilities generally price off short term interest rates, while our interest earning assets, a majority of which have initial terms to maturity or repricing greater than one year, generally price off long term rates. Page 77 Table of Contents The timing of the placement of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities on our balance sheet, particularly during this rising short term interest rate environment, also had an adverse impact on our net interest income. The impact of interest rate changes on our interest income is generally felt in later periods than the impact on our interest expense due to the timing of the recording on the balance sheet of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. The recording of interest earning assets on the balance sheet generally lags the current market due to normal commitment period of up to three months for the purchase or origination of mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities, while the recording of interest bearing liabilities on the balance sheet is generally concurrent with the current market. Also impacting our net interest income and net interest rate spread is the level of prepayment activity on our mortgage related assets. The actual amount of time before mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities are repaid can be significantly impacted by changes in market interest rates and mortgage prepayment rates. Mortgage prepayment rates will vary due to a number of factors, including the regional economy in the area where the underlying mortgages were originated, seasonal factors, demographic variables and the assumability of the underlying mortgages. However, the major factors affecting prepayment rates are prevailing interest rates, related mortgage refinancing opportunities and competition. Generally, the level of prepayment activity directly affects the yield earned on those assets, as the payments received on the interest earning assets will be reinvested at the prevailing market interest rate. Prepayment rates are generally inversely related to the prevailing market interest rate, thus, as market interest rates increase, prepayment rates tend to decrease. Prepayment activity was relatively stable during 2005 and 2004, when compared to the significant prepayment activity experienced during 2003, as long term market interest rate have been relatively stable during 2005 and 2004, with a slight increase in rates during 2005. The mortgage related assets resulting from this prepayment activity during 2005 and 2004 will tend to not prepay as fast, as their contractual interest rates are relatively low. The slowing of the prepayment activity in turn decreased the amount of related premium amortized on these assets during 2005 and 2004, when compared to the net amortization during 2003. The primary objectives of our interest rate risk management strategy are to: evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in our balance sheet accounts; determine the appropriate level of interest rate risk given our business plan, the current business environment and our capital and liquidity requirements; and manage interest rate risk in a manner consistent with the approved guidelines and policies set by our Board of Directors. We seek to manage our asset/liability mix to help minimize the impact that interest rate fluctuations may have on our earnings. To achieve the objectives of managing interest rate risk, our Asset/Liability Committee meets weekly to discuss and monitor the market interest rate environment compared to interest rates that are offered on our products. This committee consists of the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Operating Officer, the Investment Officer and other senior officers of the institution as required. The Asset/Liability Committee presents periodic reports to the Board of Directors at its regular meetings and, on a quarterly basis, presents a comprehensive report addressing the results of activities and strategies and the effect that changes in interest rates will have on our results of operations and the present value of our equity. Page 78 Table of Contents Historically, our lending activities have emphasized one to four family fixed rate first and second mortgage loans. Our growth in variable rate mortgage loans has helped reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and is expected to benefit our long term profitability, as the rate earned on the mortgage loan will increase as prevailing market rates increase. However, the prevailing interest rate environment, and the desires of our customers, has resulted in a demand for long term hybrid and fixed rate first mortgage loans. This may have an adverse impact on our net interest income, particularly in a rising interest rate environment. During 2005 our investment and mortgage backed security purchases were generally short term in nature in order to give us additional interest rate risk protection and offset the increases in fixed rate first mortgage loan originations and purchases. Our mortgage backed security purchases were primarily variable rate or hybrid instruments, and our investment security purchases were U.S. government sponsored agency securities with final maturities of two years or less or with step up features. At December 31, 2005, approximately 53.6% of our mortgage backed security portfolio was variable rate, which we define as having a contractual rate adjustment during the life of the security, including those securities with a set initial fixed rate period. Approximately $1.72 billion of the government sponsored agency securities held at December 31, 2005 have step up features, where the interest rate is increased on scheduled future dates. These securities have call options that are generally effective prior to the initial rate increase but after an initial non call period of three months to one year. The rate increases are one half of one percent to two percent per adjustment and are fixed over the life of the security. Our primary source of funds has been deposits, consisting primarily of time deposits and the interest bearing High Value Checking account product, which have substantially shorter terms to maturity than our mortgage loan portfolio. We use securities sold under agreements to repurchase and FHLB advances as additional sources of funds. These borrowings are generally long term to maturity, in an effort to offset our short term deposit liabilities and assist in managing our interest rate risk. Certain of these borrowings have call options that could shorten their maturities in a changing interest rate environment. We intend to continue to grow our borrowed funds, as part of our interest rate risk management strategy with new borrowings having maturities of ten years and initial non call periods of one to five years. During 2005 our borrowed funds increased significantly when compared to our deposits due to the use of deposits by our customers to purchase stock in our second step conversion and the significant competition for deposits in the New York metropolitan area. Due to the nature of our operations, we are not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk. Instead, our mortgage loan portfolio, the majority of which is located in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut, is subject to risks associated with the local economy. The purchases of first mortgage loans have allowed us to geographically diversify our mortgage loan portfolio in order to attempt to mitigate this concentration risk. We do not own any trading assets. We did not engage in any hedging transactions that use derivative instruments (such as interest rate swaps and caps) during 2005 and did not have any such hedging transactions in place at December 31, 2005. In the future, we may, with approval of our Board of Directors, engage in hedging transactions utilizing derivative instruments, but we have no current plans to do so. Simulation Model. We use a simulation model as our primary means to calculate and monitor the interest rate risk inherent in our portfolio. This model reports net interest income and the present value of equity in different interest rate environments, assuming an instantaneous and permanent interest rate shock to all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities. We assume maturing or called instruments are reinvested into the same type of product, with the rate earned or paid reset to our currently offered rate for loans and deposits, or the current market rate for securities and borrowed funds. Page 79 Table of Contents Our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are generally reported at the earlier of their maturity date or next rate reset date, subject to prepayment rates, non maturity deposit decay rates, and the call of certain of our investment securities and borrowed funds. In the preparation of the simulation model, we are required to make certain assumptions regarding reporting changes, which are highly subjective to the current interest rate environment. The information presented in the following table is based on the following assumptions: we assumed an annual prepayment rate for fixed rate first mortgage loans of 125% of the FHLMC fixed rate index of moderately seasoned loans and an annual prepayment rate for variable rate first mortgage loans of 125% of the FHLMC 5 year balloon index of new loans; we assumed an annual prepayment rate for our mortgage backed securities using the prepayment index associated with the security type; we reported savings accounts that had no stated maturity using decay rates (the assumed rate at which the balance of existing accounts would decline) of: 5.0% in less than six months, 5.0% in six months to one year, 5.0% in one year to two years, 5.0% in two years to three years, 10.0% in three years to five years, and 70.0% in more than five years; we reported interest bearing transaction accounts that had no stated maturity using decay rates of : 5.0% in less than six months, 5.0% in six months to one year, 10.0% in one to two years, 10.0% in two to three years, 20.0% in three years to five years, and 50.0% in more than five years; we reported money market accounts that had no stated maturity using decay rates of: 2.5% in less than six months, 2.5% in six months to one year, 10.0% in one to two years, 10.0% in two to three years, 20.0% in three years to five years, and 55.0% in more than five years; the model will report callable investment securities and borrowed funds at the earlier of their next call date or maturity date given the rate of the instrument in relation to the current market rate environment and the call option frequency, and the model assumed no calls of investment securities and $3.28 billion of calls of borrowed funds over the next year. The prepayment rate on our first mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities will fluctuate given the current market interest rate environment. We use 125% of the FHLMC index for our first mortgage loans as we hold a high percentage of jumbo loans in our portfolio, which tend to prepay faster than conforming product, and a high percentage of our loans are in the active New York metropolitan market area. Generally, prepayment rates have decreased during 2005 due to the relative stability of intermediate and long term market interest rates over that period. Our determination of deposit decay rates is based on historical experience with the varying non maturity deposit types and an analysis of our current deposit base. The change in the deposit decay rates for regular savings deposits and interest bearing transaction accounts from the decay rate used at December 31, 2004 was due to the decline in those balances during 2005 due to a shift in deposits to time deposits. The deposit decay rate assumptions are examined by a third party for reasonableness. Prepayment rates, deposit decay rates and anticipated calls of investment securities or borrowed funds can have a significant impact on the results of the simulation model. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, actual future deposit decay activity, mortgage and mortgage backed securities prepayments, and the timing of calls of federal agency bonds and borrowings may vary materially from our estimates and assumptions. Significant increases in market interest rates may tend to reduce Page 80 Table of Contents prepayment speeds on our mortgage related assets, as fewer borrowers refinance their loans. At the same time, deposit decay rates may tend to increase in the shorter term periods, as depositors seek higher yielding investments elsewhere. If these trends occur, we could experience larger negative percent changes in our model results in the varying rate shock scenarios. As a primary means of managing interest rate risk, we monitor the impact of interest rate changes on our net interest income over the next twelve month period. This model does not purport to provide estimates of net interest income over the next twelve month period, but attempts to assess the impact of a simultaneous and parallel interest rate change on our net interest income. The following table reports the changes to our net interest income over various interest rate change scenarios. Our internal policy sets a maximum change of 40.0% given a positive or negative 200 basis point interest rate shock. Change in Percent Change in Interest Rates Net Interest Income (Basis points) 200 (8.50 )% 100 (3.66 ) 50 (1.64 ) 0 (50) (0.19 ) (100) (3.13 ) (200) (13.36 ) As indicated in the table, the percent change in our net interest income in the positive 200 basis point shock scenario is negative 8.50% compared with negative 6.80% at December 31, 2004. The percent change in net interest in the negative 100 basis point shock scenario was negative 3.13% at December 31, 2005 compared with negative 5.81% in the negative basis 100 basis point scenario at December 31, 2004. We did not report the change in the negative 200 basis point scenario at December 31, 2004 as the results would not have been meaningful given market interest rates at that time. The negative change to net interest income in the positive change scenarios was primarily due to the expected call, and subsequent reset to higher market interest rates, of our borrowed funds. The negative change to net interest income in the negative change scenarios was primarily due to the expected call of our government sponsored agency securities and the acceleration of the prepayment speeds on our mortgage related assets, and the subsequent reset to lower market interest rates of the reinvested assets. We also monitor our interest rate risk by monitoring changes in the present value of equity in the different rate environments. The present value of equity is the difference between the estimated fair value of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities. The changes in market value of assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates reflect the interest sensitivity of those assets and liabilities as their values are derived from the characteristics of the asset or liability (i.e., fixed rate, adjustable rate, caps, floors) relative to the current interest rate environment. For example, in a rising interest rate environment the fair market value of a fixed rate asset will decline, whereas the fair market value of an adjustable rate asset, depending on its repricing characteristics, may not decline. Increases in the market value of assets will increase the present value of equity whereas decreases in the market value of assets will decrease the present value of equity. Conversely, increases in the market value of liabilities will decrease the present value of equity whereas decreases in the market value of liabilities will increase the present value of equity. The following table presents the estimated present value of equity over a range of interest rate change scenarios at December 31, 2005. The present value ratio shown in the table is the present value of equity Page 81 Table of Contents as a percent of the present value of total assets in each of the different rate environments. Our current policy sets a minimum ratio of the present value of equity to the fair value of assets in the current interest rate environment (no rate shock) of 8.00%, a minimum present value ratio of 6.50% in the plus 200 basis point interest rate shock scenario and a minimum present value ratio of 6.00% in the minus 200 basis point scenario. Present Value of Equity As Percent of Present Present Value of Equity Value of Assets Change in Dollar Dollar Percent Present Change in Interest Rates Amount Change Change Value Ratio Basis Points (Basis points) (Dollars in thousands) 200 $ 4,852,550 $ (1,271,138 ) (20.76 )% 18.71 % (309 ) 100 5,526,081 (597,607 ) (9.76 ) 20.45 (135 ) 50 5,850,832 (272,856 ) (4.46 ) 21.21 (59 ) 0 6,123,688 21.80 (50 ) 6,258,319 134,631 2.20 21.96 16 (100 ) 5,984,036 (139,652 ) (2.28 ) 20.95 (85 ) (200 ) 5,012,180 (1,111,508 ) (18.15 ) 17.57 (423 ) As indicated in the table, our present value ratio in the positive 200 basis point scenario was 18.71% compared with 9.44% at December 31, 2004. The increase in the present value ratio was primarily due to the infusion of capital due to the completion of our second step conversion and stock offering. The change in the present value ratio in the positive 200 basis point scenario was negative 309 basis points at December 31, 2005 compared with negative 307 basis points at December 31, 2004. The decreases in the present value of equity and the present value ratio in the increasing rate scenarios in the December 31, 2005 analysis were primarily due to the high percentage of fixed rate mortgage loans, mortgage backed securities and investment securities in our portfolio. At December 31, 2005, fixed rate interest earning assets were 70.3% of total interest earning assets. This percentage of fixed rate interest earning assets to total interest earning assets may have an adverse impact on our earnings in a rising rate environment, as these assets will not reprice in a rising rate environment. The present value ratio in the negative 100 basis point change was 20.95% at December 31, 2005 compared with 11.02% in the negative 100 basis point change at December 31, 2004. The increase in the present value ratio was primarily due to the infusion of capital due to the completion of our second step conversion and stock offering. The change in the present value ratio in the negative 100 basis point scenario was negative 85 basis points at December 31, 2005 compared with negative 149 basis points in the negative 100 basis point scenario at December 31, 2004. We did not report the change in the negative 200 basis point scenario at December 31, 2004 as the results would not have been meaningful given market interest rates at that time. The decreases in the present value of equity and the present value ratio in the increasing rate scenarios in the December 31, 2005 analysis were primarily due to the growth of our fixed rate borrowed funds with long terms to maturity, which generally do not reprice in a decreasing rate environment. The methods we used in simulation modeling are also inherently imprecise. This type of modeling requires that we make assumptions that may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. For example, we assume the composition of the interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will remain constant over the period being measured and that all interest rate shocks will be uniformly reflected across the yield curve, regardless of the duration to maturity or Page 82 Table of Contents repricing. The table assumes that we will take no action in response to the changes in interest rates. In addition, prepayment estimates and other assumptions within the model are subjective in nature, involve uncertainties, and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Accordingly, although the previous two tables may provide an estimate of our interest rate risk at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in interest rates on our net interest income or present value of equity. Gap Analysis. The matching of the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring a financial institutions interest rate sensitivity gap. An asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period. The interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period. A gap is considered negative when the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a specific time period exceeds the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within that same period. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period exceeds the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period. During a period of rising interest rates, a financial institution with a negative gap position would be expected, absent the effects of other factors, to experience a greater increase in the costs of its interest bearing liabilities relative to the yields of its interest earning assets and thus a decrease in the institutions net interest income. An institution with a positive gap position would be expected, absent the effect of other factors, to experience the opposite result. Conversely, during a period of falling interest rates, a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to reduce net interest income. The following table, referred to as the gap table, presents the amounts of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at December 31, 2005, which we anticipate to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown. Except for prepayment activity and non maturity deposit decay rates, we determined the amounts of assets and liabilities that reprice or mature during a particular period in accordance with the earlier of the term to rate reset or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability. For purposes of this table, assumptions used in decay rates and prepayment activity are similar to those used in the preparation of our simulation model. Borrowed funds are reported at the anticipated call date, for those that are callable within one year, or at their contractual maturity date. We have excluded originated non accrual mortgage loans of $4,312,000 and non accrual other loans of $2,000 from the table.

This represented a cumulative one year interest rate sensitivity gap as a percent of total assets of negative 6.8% at December 31, 2005, compared with negative 5.3% at December 31, 2004. The ratio of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year to interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year was 78.0% at December 31, 2005 compared with 78.2% at December 31, 2004. This negative gap position is expected to have an adverse impact on our net interest income in a rising interest rate environment. The change in these ratios, year to year, was partially due to the larger amount of anticipated calls of borrowed funds in the current year due to the rising interest rate environment and a shift of our customer deposits to time deposit maturities of less than one year, due to internal pricing strategies, from our High Value Checking account product, which had decay rate assumptions primarily in excess of one year. The methods used in the gap table are inherently imprecise. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Certain assets, such as adjustable rate loans and mortgage backed securities, have features that limit changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the loan. If interest rates change, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate from those assumed in calculating the table. Finally, the ability of borrowers to make payments on their adjustable rate loans may decrease if interest rates increase. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Hudson City is a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements, which occur in the normal course of our business, to meet the credit needs of our customers and the growth initiatives of the Bank. These arrangements are primarily commitments to originate and purchase mortgage loans, and to purchase mortgage backed securities. The following table reports the amounts of contractual obligations for Hudson City as of December 31, 2005. Payments Due By Period Less Than 1 Year to 3 Years to More Than Contractual Obligation Total 1 Year 3 Years 5 Years 5 Years (In thousands) First mortgage loan originations $ 260,755 $ 260,755 $ $ $ Mortgage loan purchases 715,445 715,445 Mortgage backed security purchases 452,500 452,500 Operating leases 95,573 5,199 11,238 10,665 68,471 Total $ 1,524,273 $ 1,433,899 $ 11,238 $ 10,665 $ 68,471 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend money to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments to fund first mortgage loans generally have fixed expiration dates of approximately 90 days and other termination clauses. Since some commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Hudson City Savings evaluates each customers credit worthiness on a case by case basis. Additionally, we have available home equity and overdraft lines of credit, which do not have fixed expiration dates, of approximately $82.1 million. We are not obligated to advance further Page 85 Table of Contents amounts on credit lines if the customer is delinquent, or otherwise in violation of the agreement. The commitments to purchase first mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities had a normal period from trade date to settlement date of approximately 60 days. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R) (revised 2004), Share Based Payment. This Statement is a revision of SFAS No. 123(R), Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related implementation guidance. SFAS No. 123(R) (revised 2004) established standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. This Statement requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements. This Statement establishes grant date fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share based payment arrangements and requires all entities to apply a fair value based measurement method in accounting for share based payment transactions with employees, except for equity instruments held by employee share ownership plans. We adopted this Statement effective on January 1, 2006, using the modified prospective method, based upon guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which delayed the original effective date of July 1, 2005. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) (revised 2004) will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, which replaces APB No. 20, Accounting Changes, and SFAS No. 3, Reporting Changes in Interim Financial Statements. SFAS No. 154 changes the accounting for, and reporting of, a change in accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of voluntary changes in accounting principle and changes required by new accounting standards when the standard does not include specific transition provisions, unless it is impracticable to do so. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005 and will only effect Hudson Citys financial statements upon adoption of a voluntary change in accounting principle or upon adoption of a new standard that does not contain transition provisions. Page 86 Table of Contents In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP No. 115 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, which addresses the determination of when an investment is considered impaired, whether the impairment is other than temporary and how to measure an impairment loss. FSP No. 115 1 also addresses accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment on a debt security and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments. FSP No. 115 1 replaces the impairment guidance in Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 03 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, with references to existing authoritative literature concerning other than temporary impairment determinations (principally SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 59, Accounting for Noncurrent Marketable Equity Securities). Under FSP No. 115 1, impairment losses must be recognized in earnings for the entire difference between the securitys cost and its fair value at the financial statement date, without considering partial recoveries subsequent to that date. FSP No. 115 1 also requires that an investor recognize an other than temporary impairment loss when a decision to sell a security has been made and the investor does not expect the fair value of the security to fully recover prior to the expected time of sale. FSP No. 115 1 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005. We do not expect our application of FSP 115 1 to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Page 87 Table of Contents Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices The Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Hudson City Bancorp have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, commonly referred as GAAP. GAAP generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations. Unlike industrial companies, our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature. As a result, changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than do the effects of inflation. Critical Accounting Policies Note 1 to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report contains a summary of our significant accounting policies. We believe our policies with respect to the methodology for our determination of the allowance for loan losses and asset impairment judgments, including other than temporary declines in the value of our securities, involve a higher degree of complexity and require management to make difficult and subjective judgments which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters. Changes in these judgments, assumptions or estimates could cause reported results to differ materially. These critical policies and their application are continually reviewed by management, and are periodically reviewed with the Audit Committee and our Board of Directors. Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses has been determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, under which we are required to maintain adequate allowances for loan losses. We are responsible for the timely and periodic determination of the amount of the allowance required. We believe that our allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover specifically identifiable loan losses, as well as estimated losses inherent in our portfolio for which certain losses are probable but not specifically identifiable. Our primary lending emphasis is the origination and purchase of one to four family first mortgage loans on residential properties and, to a lesser extent, second mortgage loans on one to four family residential properties resulting in a loan concentration in residential first mortgage loans at December 31, 2005. As a result of our lending practices, we also have a concentration of loans secured by real property located in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut. Based on the composition of our loan portfolio and the growth in our loan portfolio, we believe the primary risks inherent in our portfolio are increases in interest rates, a decline in the economy, generally, and a decline in real estate market values. Any one or a combination of these events may adversely affect our loan portfolio resulting in increased delinquencies, loan losses and future levels of provisions. We consider it important to maintain the ratio of our allowance for loan losses to total loans at an acceptable level given current economic conditions, interest rates and the composition of our portfolio. Due to the nature of our loan portfolio, our evaluation of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses is performed on a pooled basis. Each month we prepare a worksheet which categorizes the entire loan portfolio by certain risk characteristics such as loan type (one to four family, multi family, etc.), loan source (originated or purchased) and payment status (i.e., current or number of days delinquent). Loans Page 88 Table of Contents with known potential losses are categorized separately. We assign potential loss factors to the payment status categories on the basis of our assessment of the potential risk inherent in each loan type. These factors are periodically reviewed for appropriateness giving consideration to charge off history and delinquency trends. We use this worksheet, as a tool, together with principal balances and delinquency reports, to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Other key factors we consider in this process are current real estate market conditions in geographic areas where our loans are located, changes in the trend of non performing loans, the current state of the local and national economy and loan portfolio growth. We maintain the allowance for loan losses through provisions for loan losses that we charge to income. We charge losses on loans against the allowance for loan losses when we believe the collection of loan principal is unlikely. We establish the provision for loan losses after considering the results of our review of delinquency and charge off trends, the allowance for loan loss worksheet, the amount of the allowance for loan losses in relation to the total loan balance, loan portfolio growth, U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and regulatory guidance. We have applied this process consistently and we have made minimal changes in the estimation methods and assumptions that we have used. During 2005, we lowered the loss factors used in our worksheet on our first mortgage loans to reflect the seasoning of the portfolio and recent charge off and delinquency experience. We provided a minimal amount for loan losses during the first quarter of 2005, and did not provide for loan losses for the second through fourth quarters of 2005 reflecting recent low levels of charge offs, the stability in the real estate market and the resulting stability in our overall loan quality. At December 31, 2005, the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 0.18%, which, given the primary emphasis of our lending practices and the current market conditions, we consider to be at an acceptable level. The slight increase in the allowance for loan losses during 2005 was due to the minimal provision and net recovery during 2005. We believe that we have established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at adequate levels. Additions may be necessary if future economic and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment. Although management uses the best information available, the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate that is subject to significant judgment and short term change. Asset Impairment Judgments. Certain of our assets are carried in our consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or at the lower of cost or fair value. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to recognize impairment of such assets. We periodically perform analyses to test for impairment of various assets. In addition to our impairment analyses related to loans discussed above, another significant impairment analysis relates to the value of other than temporary declines in the value of our securities. Our available for sale portfolio is carried at estimated fair value, with any unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity. The securities which we have the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and are carried at amortized cost. We conduct a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if the value of any security has declined below its carrying value and whether such decline is other than temporary. If such decline is deemed other than temporary, we would adjust the carrying amount of the security by writing down the security to fair market value through a charge to current period operations. The market values of our securities are significantly affected by changes in interest rates. In general, as interest rates Page 89 Table of Contents rise, the market value of fixed rate securities will decrease; as interest rates fall, the market value of fixed rate securities will increase. With significant changes in interest rates, we evaluate our intent and ability to hold the security to maturity or for a sufficient time to recover the recorded principal balance. Estimated fair values for securities are based on published or securities dealers market values. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Assumptions. Non contributory retirement and post retirement defined benefit plans are maintained for certain employees, including retired employees, hired on or before July 31, 2005 who have met other eligibility requirements of the plans. The measurement date for year end disclosure information is December 31 and the measurement date for net periodic benefit cost is January 1. The expected cost of benefits provided under the qualified and non qualified defined benefit retirement plans is based primarily on years of service, compensation and assumptions regarding interest rates, investment returns and life expectancy. Funding of the qualified retirement plan is actuarially determined on an annual basis. It is our policy to fund the qualified retirement plan sufficiently to meet the minimum requirements set forth in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Our defined pension plan met all minimum funding requirements as of December 31, 2005, based on the actuarial valuation of the plan assets and the benefit obligation. We contributed $160,000 to the plan assets in 2005. We anticipate contributing funds to the plan assets during 2006 to meet any minimum funding requirements that may become payable as a result of the actuarial valuation of plan assets and the benefit obligation in 2006. The expected cost of benefits other than pensions provided for retired employees is actuarially determined and accrued ratably from the date of hire to the date the employee is fully eligible to receive the benefits. Participants generally become eligible for retiree health care and life insurance benefits after ten years of service. During 2005, we enacted changes to the plans in an effort to control expenses related to the maintenance of these plans. First, we discontinued participation in both the defined pension and post retirement health benefit plans for employees hired on or after August 1, 2005. We believe the retirement funding opportunities provided by our employee stock ownership plan and defined contribution plan, both of which generate substantial expenses for the Bank, should allow those new employees not participating in the plans to provide for their own retirement. Second, for employees who retired after December 31, 2005, we capped our contributions associated with the post retirement health benefit plan, for years after 2007, to the contribution made during 2007. These changes had an immaterial impact on the current period expenses associated with the maintenance of these plans, but did decrease the projected and accumulated benefits obligations. We anticipate future periodic expense savings from these plan amendments due to the reduction in the benefit obligations. We provide our actuary with certain rate assumptions used in measuring our benefit obligation. The most significant of these is the discount rate used to calculate the period end present value of the benefit obligations, and the expense to be included in the following years financial statements. A lower discount rate will result in a higher benefit obligation and expense, while a higher discount rate will result in a lower benefit obligation and expense. The discount rate assumption was determined based on a cash flow yield curve model specific to our pension and post retirement plans. We compare this rate to certain market indices, such as long term treasury bonds, or the Moodys or Merrill Lynch bond indices, for reasonableness. A discount rate of 5.75% was selected for the December 31, 2005 measurement date and the 2006 expense calculation. For our pension plan, we also assumed a rate of salary increase of 4.25% for future periods. This rate is comparable to actual salary increases experienced over prior years. We assumed a return on plan assets of Page 90 Table of Contents 8.75% for future periods. We actuarially determine the return on plan assets based on actual plan experience over the previous ten years. The actual return on plan assets was 1.3% for 2005. For our post retirement benefit plan, the assumed health care cost trend rate used to measure the expected cost of other benefits for 2005 was 10.00%. The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 4.75% for 2013 and remain at that level thereafter. Changes to the assumed health care cost trend rate are expected to have an immaterial impact as we capped our obligations to contribute to the premium cost of coverage to the post retirement health benefit plan at the 2007 premium level.
