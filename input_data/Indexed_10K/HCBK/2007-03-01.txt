Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Hudson City Bancorps Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, and the other statistical data provided elsewhere in this document. Executive Summary Our results of operations depend primarily on net interest income, which, in part, is a direct result of the market interest rate environment. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets, primarily mortgage loans, mortgage backed securities and investment securities, and the interest we pay on our interest bearing liabilities, primarily time deposits, interest bearing transaction deposits and borrowed funds. Net interest income is affected by the shape of the market yield curve, the timing of the placement and repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities on our balance sheet, and the prepayment rate on our mortgage related assets. Our results of operations may also be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions, particularly those with respect to changes in market interest rates, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. Our results are also affected by the market price of our stock, as the expense of certain of our employee stock compensation plans is related to the current price of our common stock. The Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve Bank (FOMC) increased the overnight lending rate 17 times from June 2004 through June 2006 to 5.25%, but did not change the rate during the second half of 2006. Short term interest rates increased due to these changes in the overnight lending rate, but did decrease slightly during the second half of 2006 in anticipation of a decrease in the overnight rate. Intermediate term market interest rates, those with maturities of two to five years, and long term market interest rates, in particular the 10 year bond, also increased during 2006, but at a slower pace than the short term interest rates. The result of these market interest rate changes was the inversion of the market yield curve during the second half of 2006. This market rate environment has caused net interest margin to decrease, but we have been able to maintain a slight positive spread on our incremental growth as our primary investment has been in mortgage related products. We have also experienced higher deposit costs due to increases in short term market interest rates during 2006 and the intense competitive pressure for deposits in the New York metropolitan area. During 2006, we grew total assets by $7.43 billion, primarily reflecting balance sheet growth funded primarily by borrowed funds and deposits, and a $1.21 billion increase due to the Acquisition. This growth reflects a $4.03 billion increase in loans and a $2.42 billion increase in total mortgage backed securities. The growth in our loan portfolio was due primarily to residential mortgage loan purchases and originations of $2.71 billion and $2.12 billion, respectively, during 2006. The growth in total mortgage backed securities reflected purchases of variable rate or hybrid instruments. The $5.62 billion growth in total borrowed funds was the result of securing $9.14 billion of new borrowings at a weighted average rate of 4.30%. These new borrowings have final maturities of ten years and initial non call periods of one to three years. In addition, deposits increased $2.03 billion, reflecting in part the $1.06 billion transferred as a result of the Acquisition. Our net income increased 4.5% for 2006 to $288.6 million primarily due to the growth of our interest earning assets due to our second step conversion and stock offering as well as growth funded by deposits and borrowed funds. Basic and diluted earnings per share for 2006 were $0.54 and $0.53, respectively, compared with $0.49 and $0.48, respectively, for 2005. Our return on average stockholders equity was 5.70% for 2006, as compared to 7.52% in 2005. The decrease reflects an increase in stockholders equity Page 55 Table of Contents due to the capital received from our second step conversion and stock offering completed in June 2005. Our return on average assets decreased to 0.91% for 2006, when compared to 1.14 % for 2005, reflecting our internally generated balance sheet growth in this flat to inverted yield curve environment. Net interest income increased 9.1% to $613.2 million due primarily to the overall growth in our balance sheet. Our total average interest earning assets increased 30.3% for the year ended December 31, 2006, while the yields over those same periods increased 25 basis points. Our total average interest bearing liabilities increased 29.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 and the average cost increased 78 basis points. Our net interest margin decreased 39 basis points to 1.96% and our net interest rate spread decreased 53 basis points to 1.31% when comparing 2006 with 2005. Our interest income, in general, reflects movements in long term rates while our interest expense, in general, reflects movements in short term rates, which have increased over the past two years at a faster pace than long term rates. These decreases in the net interest margin and net interest rate spread were also due, in part, to a shift in our interest earning asset mix to shorter term investment securities and variable rate mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities to help manage our interest rate risk. In addition, our interest bearing liabilities reset to the current market interest rates faster than our interest earning assets as changes to interest rates on our interest bearing liabilities generally time movements in market interest rates while changes to interest rates on our interest earning assets generally lag market interest rates due to normal commitment periods of up to 90 days. Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 During 2006, our total assets increased $7.43 billion, or 26.5%, to $35.51 billion at December 31, 2006 from $28.08 billion at December 31, 2005. Loans increased $4.03 billion, or 26.8%, to $19.07 billion at December 31, 2006 from $15.04 billion at December 31, 2005, reflecting internal growth initiatives funded primarily by borrowed funds and the addition of $786.1 million of loans from the Acquisition. The increase in loans reflected our continued purchases of loans as well as our focus on the origination of one to four family first mortgage loans in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut. During 2006, we purchased first mortgage loans of $2.71 billion and originated first mortgage loans of $2.12 billion as compared to purchases of $3.68 billion and originations of $2.07 billion for 2005. The larger volume of purchased mortgage loans in 2006, when compared to the volume of loan originations, allowed us to continue to grow and geographically diversify our mortgage loan portfolio at a relatively low overhead cost while maintaining our traditional thrift business model. We will continue to purchase mortgage loans to grow and diversify our portfolio, as opportunities and funding are available. Our first mortgage loan originations and purchases were substantially in one to four family mortgage loans. Approximately 1.0% of the mortgage loan purchases and 45.0% of the mortgage loan originations were variable rate loans. We purchased a lower percentage of variable rate mortgage loans, when compared to originated mortgage loans, as a large percentage of variable rate loans available for purchase are outside our defined geographic parameters and contain types of variable rate instruments, such as option ARMs, that do not meet our underwriting standards. At December 31, 2006, fixed rate mortgage loans accounted for 81.0% of our first mortgage loan portfolio compared with 82.7% at December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2006, we were committed to purchase and originate $951.0 million and $176.7 million, respectively, of first mortgage loans, which are expected to settle during the first quarter of 2007. Total mortgage backed securities increased $2.42 billion to $9.33 billion at December 31, 2006 from $6.91 billion at December 31, 2005 reflecting internal growth initiatives funded primarily by borrowed funds. This increase in total mortgage backed securities resulted from $3.93 billion in purchases of securities, all of which are issued by a U.S. government agency or U.S. government sponsored enterprise. Of Page 56 Table of Contents these purchases, approximately 98.7% were variable rate (adjustable annually) or hybrid (adjustable annually after fixed periods of three to seven years) instruments. At December 31, 2006, variable rate mortgage backed securities accounted for 69.6% of our portfolio compared with 53.6% at December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2006, we were committed to purchase $846.9 million of U.S. government agency or U.S. government sponsored enterprise variable rate mortgage backed securities, which are expected to settle during the first quarter of 2007. We intend to continue to purchase variable rate securities, such as those mortgage backed securities described above or U.S. government sponsored enterprise step up notes, as well as originate and purchase variable rate mortgage loans in order to grow our fixed rate and variable rate portfolios by equal amounts, as part of our strategy to assist in the management of our interest rate risk. Accrued interest receivable increased $53.5 million, primarily due to increased balances in loans and investments. The $20.1 million increase in other assets included an increase of $11.0 million of bank owned life insurance transferred in connection with the Acquisition. The Acquisition also resulted in the addition of $150.8 million of goodwill and other intangible assets of $13.4 million. Total liabilities increased $7.71 billion, or 33.7%, to $30.58 billion at December 31, 2006 compared with $22.87 billion at December 31, 2005. Borrowed funds increased $5.62 billion, or 49.5%, to $16.97 billion at December 31, 2006 from $11.35 billion at December 31, 2005. The additional borrowed funds were primarily used to fund our asset growth. We believed the cost of the incremental borrowed funds was lower than the cost of new deposits and therefore used borrowings to fund a substantial portion of our asset growth. Borrowed funds were comprised of $8.92 billion of securities repurchase agreements and $8.05 billion of FHLB advances. New borrowings amounted to $9.14 billion and have initial non call periods ranging from one to three years, final maturities of ten years, and a weighted average rate of 4.30%. Total deposits increased $2.03 billion during 2006, due primarily to a $2.92 billion increase in total time deposits, $1.06 billion of deposits from the Acquisition, and a $576.5 million increase in our money market accounts. These increases were partially offset by a $1.52 billion decrease in our interest bearing transaction accounts, due to customers shifting deposits to short term time deposits. We experienced increased competitive pressure and pricing of short term deposits during 2006 in the New York metropolitan area. The increase in time deposits reflected our competitive pricing of these deposits and a shift of our customer preference to short term time deposits. Other liabilities increased to $187.7 million at December 31, 2006 compared with $140.6 million at December 31, 2005. The increase is primarily the result of a $34.5 million increase in the accrued interest payable on borrowed funds and deposits. Total stockholders equity decreased $271.2 million to $4.93 billion at December 31, 2006 from $5.20 billion at December 31, 2005. The decrease was primarily due to repurchases of 33,747,243 shares of outstanding common stock at an aggregate cost of $448.2 million and cash dividends declared and paid to common stockholders of $161.4 million. These decreases to stockholders equity were partially offset by net income of $288.6 million for 2006. As of December 31, 2006, 44,314,000 shares were authorized and yet to be repurchased under our existing stock repurchase programs. At December 31, 2006, our stockholders equity to asset ratio was 13.89% compared with 18.53% at December 31, 2005. The decrease reflected our strategy to grow assets, purchase outstanding common stock and pay dividends. For 2006, the ratio of average stockholders equity to average assets was 16.00% compared with 15.10% for the year 2005. The increase reflected the receipt of the net offering proceeds from our second step conversion and stock offering during 2005. At Page 57 Table of Contents December 31, 2006, our book value per share, using the period end share count of outstanding shares, less purchased but unallocated employee stock ownership plan shares and less purchased but unvested management plan shares, was $9.47 compared with $9.44 at December 31, 2005. Our tangible book value per share, calculated by eliminating goodwill and the core deposit intangible from stockholders equity, was $9.15 at December 31, 2006. Analysis of Net Interest Income Net interest income represents the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets, such as mortgage loans, mortgage backed securities and investment securities, and the expense we pay on interest bearing liabilities, such as time deposits and borrowed funds. Net interest income depends on our volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates we earned or paid on them. Page 58 Table of Contents Average Balance Sheet. The following table presents certain information regarding our financial condition and net interest income for 2006, 2005, and 2004. The table presents the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities for the periods indicated. We derived the yields and costs by dividing income or expense by the average balance of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities, respectively, for the periods shown. We derived average balances from daily balances over the periods indicated. Interest income includes fees that we considered adjustments to yields. Yields on tax exempt obligations were not computed on a tax equivalent basis. Non accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances and therefore have a zero yield. The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred loan origination fees and costs, and purchase premiums and discounts that are amortized or accreted to interest income. Interest income on loans for 2006, 2005, and 2004 has been reduced by the amortization of net deferred loan origination costs of $(374,000), $(2.2) million and $707,000, respectively. Interest income on loans for 2006, 2005, and 2004 has been reduced by amortization of purchase premiums (net of discounts) of $525,000, $8.2 million, and $5.4 million for those same respective years. Interest income on mortgage backed securities has been reduced by amortization of purchase premiums (net of discounts) of $10.7 million, $14.6 million, and $14.1 million for those same respective years.

(2) Determined by subtracting the weighted average cost of average total interest bearing liabilities from the weighted average yield on average total interest earning assets. (3) Determined by dividing net interest income by average total interest earning assets. (4) At December 31, 2006, the weighted average rate on our outstanding interest earning assets, other than our FHLB stock, was as follows: first mortgage loans, 5.78%, consumer and other loans, 6.55%, federal funds sold, 5.25%, mortgage backed securities, 5.21%, investment securities, 4.72%. At December 31, 2006, the weighted average rate on our outstanding interest bearing liabilities was as follows: savings accounts, 0.94%, interest bearing transaction accounts, 3.29%, money market accounts, 3.59%, time deposits, 4.89%, borrowed funds, 4.08%. Page 59 Table of Contents Rate/Volume Analysis. The following table presents the extent to which the changes in interest rates and the changes in volume of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected our interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated. Information is provided in each category with respect to: changes attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate); changes attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume); and the net change. The changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to rate.

Net income was $288.6 million for 2006, reflecting an increase of $12.5 million, or 4.5%, compared with net income of $276.1 million for 2005. Basic and diluted earnings per common share were $0.54 and $0.53, respectively, for 2006 compared with basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.49 and $0.48, respectively, for 2005. Our return on average stockholders equity was 5.70% in 2006, compared with 7.52% for 2005. Our return on average assets for 2006 was 0.91% compared with 1.14% for 2005. The decreases in these ratios were primarily due to the receipt of the net proceeds from our second step conversion and stock offering completed in June 2005, which significantly increased average stockholders equity and average assets. The decrease in the return on average assets also reflected our balance sheet growth during a period of narrowing net interest rate spreads and a flat to inverted market yield curve. Interest and Dividend Income. Total interest and dividend income increased $435.9 million, or 36.9%, to $1.61 billion for 2006 compared with $1.18 billion for 2005. The increase in total interest and dividend income was primarily due to a $7.26 billion, or 30.3%, increase in the average balance of total interest earning assets to $31.23 billion for 2006 compared with $23.97 billion for 2005. The growth in the average balance of total interest earning assets was consistent with the growth initiatives employed by us during recent periods and also reflected the receipt of the net offering proceeds from our second step conversion. The increase in interest and dividend income was also partially due to a 25 basis point increase in the weighted average yield on total interest earning assets to 5.17% for the year 2006 from 4.92% for the year 2005. This increase in the weighted average yield reflected a modest increase in intermediate and long term interest rates experienced during 2006. Interest and fees on mortgage loans increased $243.1 million primarily due to a $4.03 billion increase in the average balance, reflecting increases in our core investment of first mortgage loans. The increase in mortgage loan income was also due to a 14 basis point increase in the weighted average yield, which reflected the large volume of originations and purchases of mortgage loans during this period of rising intermediate and long term interest rates. The $108.9 million increase in interest income on total mortgage backed securities was due to an $1.80 billion increase in the average balance of total mortgage backed securities, due primarily to the purchase of variable rate securities during 2006 to complement our purchases of fixed rate mortgage loans. The increase in was also due to a 37 basis point increase in the weighted average yield to 4.76%, reflecting these purchases during this period of rising interest rates. The $64.6 million increase in interest and dividends on total investment securities was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of total investment securities of $1.19 billion, which reflected the investment into short term securities of part of the net proceeds from the second step conversion and stock offering. The increase in interest and dividends on total investment securities was also due to a 24 basis point increase in the weighted average yield reflecting purchases of securities during this period of rising short term interest rates. Interest Expense. Total interest expense increased $384.8 million, or 62.4%, to $1.00 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $616.8 million for 2005. This increase was primarily due to a $5.89 billion, or 29.4%, increase in the average balance of total interest bearing liabilities to $25.93 billion for 2006 compared with $20.04 billion for 2005. The increase in interest bearing liabilities was used to fund our asset growth. The increase in total interest expense was also due to a 78 basis point increase in the weighted average cost of total interest bearing liabilities to 3.86% for the year 2006 compared with 3.08% Page 61 Table of Contents for the year 2005. The increase in the average cost reflected the growth and re pricing of our interest bearing liabilities during the rising short term interest rate environment experienced 2006. Interest expense on borrowed funds increased $242.5 million primarily due to a $5.37 billion increase in the average balance of borrowed funds and a 34 basis point increase in the weighted average cost of borrowed funds. The increase in the average balance of borrowed funds was used to fund asset growth. The increase in the average cost of borrowed funds reflected the new borrowings with a higher rate than the existing borrowings. The $142.4 million increase in interest expense on interest bearing deposits for the year 2006 was primarily due to an 111 basis point increase in the weighted average cost of interest bearing deposits, reflecting the rising short term interest rate environment, the competitive pricing of our deposit products and a shift by our customers, during 2006 to higher costing short term time deposits from our High Value Checking product. The $156.3 million increase in interest expense on our time deposit accounts reflected a 138 basis point increase in the weighted average cost, due to the rising short term market interest rate environment, and a $1.87 billion increase in the average balance of time deposit accounts. The $15.5 million increase in interest expense on our money market accounts primarily reflected an increase in the weighted average cost of 190 basis points, reflecting increases in short term interest rates and the competitive pricing of this product. The $27.6 million decrease in interest expense on our interest bearing transaction accounts was primarily due to a $1.39 billion decrease in the average balance, reflecting shifts to time deposit products. Time deposits accounted for 63.7% of the average balance of interest bearing deposits compared to 49.9% during 2005. We intend to continue to fund future asset growth using borrowed funds and customer deposits as our primary sources of funds. We intend to grow customer deposits by continuing to pay competitive, but prudent rates and by opening new branch offices. Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased $51.1 million, or 9.1%, to $613.2 million for the year 2006 compared with $562.1 million for the year 2005. This increase primarily reflected the investment of the net offering proceeds from our second step conversion over the course of a full year and our balance sheet growth initiatives. The increase due to our growth was partially offset by an increase in the costs of our interest bearing deposits and borrowed funds. Our net interest rate spread decreased 53 basis points to 1.31% for 2006 from 1.84% for 2005 and our net interest margin decreased 39 basis points to 1.96% for 2006 from 2.35% for 2005. Market interest rates resulted in an inverted U.S. Treasury yield curve during 2006. This market interest rate scenario has had a negative impact on our results of operations and our net interest margin as the yields on our interest earning assets have increased far less than the costs of our interest bearing liabilities. In addition, our interest bearing liabilities will reprice to current market interest rates faster than the yields earned on our interest earning assets. The increase in the cost of our interest bearing liabilities reflected the rising short term interest rate environment, affecting both our deposits and borrowed funds, and the shift within our deposits to higher costing short term time deposits. Our net interest margin is likely to decrease further if the yield curve remains inverted in 2007. Provision for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses amounted to $30.6 million and $27.4 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in the allowance for loan losses was due to the inclusion of Sound Federals allowance for loan losses as a result of the Acquisition. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans was 0.16% at December 31, 2006 compared with 0.18% at December 31, 2005. We did not record a provision for loan losses during 2006. We did record a provision of $65,000 during 2005. Net charge offs for the year 2006 were Page 62 Table of Contents $76,000 compared with net recoveries of $9,000 for 2005. Non performing loans, defined as non accruing and accruing loans delinquent 90 days or more increased to $30.0 million at December 31, 2006 from $19.3 million at December 31, 2005. The increase reflected an increase in the number of non performing loans to 118 loans at December 31, 2006 from 93 loans at December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2006, our largest loan delinquent 90 days or more was a construction loan with a balance of $3.0 million that has become current subsequent to December 31, 2006. The ratio of non performing loans to total loans was 0.16% at December 31, 2006 compared with 0.13% at December 31, 2005. The ratio of allowance for loan losses to total non performing loans was 102.09% at December 31, 2006 compared with 141.84% at December 31, 2005. Although we believe that we have established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at adequate levels, additions may be necessary if future economic and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment. Although we use the best information available, the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate that is subject to significant judgment and short term change. See Critical Accounting Policies. Non Interest Income. Total non interest income decreased $1.7 million to $6.3 million for 2006 from $8.0 million for 2005. The decrease in non interest income primarily reflected the $2.7 million decrease in gains on securities transactions as there were minimal realized gains/losses from sales of securities that occurred during 2006. Non Interest Expense. Total non interest expense increased $31.3 million, or 24.5%, to $159.0 million for 2006 from $127.7 million for 2005. This increase is primarily due to increases of $20.2 million in compensation and employee benefits expense, $4.8 million in net occupancy expense, and $5.9 million in other non interest expense. The increase in compensation and employee benefits expense primarily reflected a $12.7 million increase in the expense related to our employee stock ownership plan, as a result of increases in our stock price. The increase also reflected the expense related to stock options that amounted to $5.5 million during 2006. The increase in net occupancy expense is the result of our branch expansion and the addition of 14 branches from Sound Federal in July 2006. The increases in the other categories of non interest expense are due to an increase in professional services of $2.3 million, operating expenses for new branches and increased costs related to our growth. Our efficiency ratio was 25.66% for 2006 compared with 22.40% for 2005. Our ratio of non interest expense to average total assets for 2006 was 0.50% compared with 0.53% for 2005. Income Taxes. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $172.0 million compared with $166.3 million for 2005. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 37.34% compared with 37.60% for the year 2005. The 3.4% increase in income tax expense reflected the 4.1% increase in income before income tax expense. Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 General. Net income was $276.1 million for the year 2005, reflecting an increase of $36.8 million, or 15.4%, compared with net income of $239.3 million for the year 2004. Basic and diluted earnings per common share were $0.49 and $0.48, respectively, for 2005 compared with basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.41 and $0.40, respectively, for 2004. For the year 2005 our return on average stockholders equity was 7.52% compared with 17.66% for the year 2004. Our return on average assets for 2005 was 1.14% compared with 1.29% for 2004. The decreases in these ratios were primarily due to the receipt of the net proceeds from our second step conversion and stock offering completed in June 2005, which significantly increased average stockholders equity and average assets. The decrease in the return on Page 63 Table of Contents average assets also reflected our balance sheet growth during a period of narrowing net interest rate spreads and a flattening market yield curve. Interest and Dividend Income. Total interest and dividend income increased $263.9 million, or 28.8%, to $1.18 billion for 2005 compared with $915.1 million for 2004. The increase in total interest and dividend income was primarily due to a $5.72 billion, or 31.3%, increase in the average balance of total interest earning assets to $23.97 billion for 2005 compared with $18.25 billion for 2004. The growth in the average balance of total interest earning assets was consistent with the growth initiatives employed by us during recent periods and also reflected the receipt of the net offering proceeds from our second step conversion. The increase in interest and dividend income due to the increase in the average balance was partially offset by a decrease of nine basis points in the weighted average yield on total interest earning assets to 4.92% for the year 2005 from 5.01% for the year 2004. This decrease in the weighted average yield reflected a shift in our interest earning asset mix to shorter term investment securities to help manage our interest rate risk. Investments of this type included the purchase of agency discount notes from the second step conversion net offering proceeds, and the origination and purchase of a larger percentage of variable rate mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities. The $149.4 million increase in interest and fee income on first mortgage loans was primarily due to a $2.88 billion increase in the average balance of first mortgage loans, which reflected our continued emphasis on balance sheet growth in our core investment in first mortgage loans. The increase in mortgage loan income due to the increase in the average balance was partially offset by a seven basis point decrease in the weighted average yield, which reflected the larger volume of originations and purchases of variable rate loans during 2005, which generally have initial yields that are less than fixed rate loans. The $71.9 million increase in interest and dividends on total investment securities was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of total investment securities of $1.83 billion, which reflected the investment of part of the net proceeds from the second step conversion and stock offering, and the investment of certain of the cash flows from the prepayment activity on our mortgage related assets in 2004 into investment securities. The increase in interest and dividends on total investment securities due to the increase in the average balance was partially offset by a 22 basis point decrease in the weighted average yield reflecting purchases of securities with maturity or initial rate reset dates of less than two years, in order to assist in our management of interest rate risk. The $30.8 million increase in interest income on total mortgage backed securities was due to an $838.9 million increase in the average balance of total mortgage backed securities, which primarily reflected the purchase of variable rate securities during 2005 from the investment of part of the net proceeds from the second step offering to assist in our management of interest rate risk. The increase in income due to the increase in the average balance was partially offset by a 11 basis point decrease in the weighted average yield, reflecting the larger volume of purchases of variable rate and hybrid instruments, which generally have initial yields that are less than fixed rate securities. Interest Expense. Total interest expense, comprised of interest on deposits and interest on borrowed funds, increased $186.7 million, or 43.4%, to $616.8 million for the year 2005 from $430.1 million for the year 2004. This increase was primarily due to a $3.35 billion, or 20.1%, increase in the average balance of total interest bearing liabilities to $20.04 billion for 2005 compared with $16.69 billion for 2004. This increase in interest bearing liabilities was primarily used to fund asset growth. The increase in total interest expense was also due to a 50 basis point increase in the weighted average cost of total interest bearing liabilities to 3.08% for the year 2005 compared with 2.58% for the year 2004, which reflected the Page 64 Table of Contents growth of our interest bearing liabilities during the rising short term interest rate environment experienced during 2004 and 2005. Interest expense on borrowed funds increased $107.7 million primarily due to a $2.82 billion increase in the average balance of borrowed funds and, to a lesser extent, a nine basis point increase in the weighted average cost of borrowed funds. The increase in the average balance of borrowed funds was used to fund asset growth. The $5.13 billion of new borrowings incurred during 2005 all had maturity periods of ten years and initial non call periods of one to five years, extending the overall maturity of our liabilities in order to assist in the management of interest rate risk. The new borrowings had a weighted average rate of 3.82%. The increase in the average cost of borrowed funds reflected the continued growth of our borrowed funds in the increasing intermediate and long term interest rate environment that existed during 2004 and 2005. The $78.9 million increase in interest expense on interest bearing deposits for the year 2005 was due to a $526.8 million increase in the average balance of interest bearing deposits and a 61 basis point increase in the weighted average cost of interest bearing deposits. The growth in the average balance of interest bearing deposits was primarily used to fund our growth initiatives and was primarily due to increases in our interest bearing transaction account. The increase in the weighted average cost of interest bearing deposits, experienced principally in interest bearing transaction accounts and time deposits, reflected the rising short term market interest rate environment experienced during 2004 and 2005 and the need to increase rates on these deposit products in the highly competitive deposit market of the New York metropolitan area. The $38.7 million increase in interest expense on our interest bearing transaction accounts reflected an increase in the average balance of interest bearing transaction accounts of $548.9 million, primarily due to the growth of our High Value Checking account product, and a 64 basis point increase in the weighted average cost due to the rising short term market interest rate environment. The $40.3 million increase in interest expense on our time deposit accounts reflected a 70 basis point increase in the weighted average cost, due to the rising short term market interest rate environment, and a $63.8 million increase in the average balance of time deposit accounts. We intend to continue to fund future asset growth using customer deposits as our primary source of funds, by continuing to pay competitive, but prudent rates and by opening new branch offices. We will continue to supplement deposit growth using borrowed funds. Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased $77.1 million, or 15.9%, to $562.1 million for the year 2005 compared with $485.0 million for the year 2004. This increase primarily reflected the investment of the net offering proceeds from our second step conversion and our internally generated growth initiatives, the combination of which resulted in a larger increase in the average balance of total interest earning assets when compared to the increase in the average balance of total interest bearing liabilities. The increase due to our growth was partially offset by an increase in the costs of our interest bearing deposits and borrowed funds. Our net interest rate spread decreased 59 basis points to 1.84% for 2005 from 2.43% for 2004 and our net interest margin decreased 31 basis points to 2.35% for 2005 from 2.66% for 2004. The decrease in these ratios was primarily due to an increase in the weighted average cost of interest bearing liabilities and a decrease in the weighted average yield on interest earning assets. The increase in the cost of our interest bearing liabilities reflected the rising short term interest rate environment and the borrowing of funds with longer terms to initial reprice or maturity than in previous periods. The decrease in the yield on our interest earning assets reflected the shift in our investment portfolio to shorter term interest earning assets, accomplished by purchasing and originating a larger percentage of variable rate instruments and purchasing agency discount notes with part of the proceeds from our second step Page 65 Table of Contents conversion and stock offering. The smaller decrease in our net interest margin, when compared to the decrease in our net interest rate spread, reflected the infusion of capital due to the completion of our second step conversion. Provision for Loan Losses. Our provision for loan losses during 2005 was $65,000 compared with $790,000 during 2004. The decrease in the provision reflected recent favorable charge off trends and strong payment performance by our borrowers during 2005 resulting in a positive delinquency experience. Net recoveries for the year 2005 were $9,000 compared with net charge offs of $18,000 for the year 2004. The allowance for loan losses increased $74,000 to $27.4 million at December 31, 2005 from $27.3 million at December 31, 2004. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans was 0.18% at December 31, 2005 compared with 0.24% at December 31, 2004. Non performing loans, defined as non accruing loans and accruing loans delinquent 90 days or more, decreased $2.3 million to $19.3 million at December 31, 2005 from $21.6 million at December 31, 2004, reflecting decreases in delinquencies primarily in our serviced loan portfolio. The ratio of non performing loans to total loans was 0.13% at December 31, 2005 compared with 0.19% at December 31, 2004. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans was 141.84% at December 31, 2005 compared with 126.44% at December 31, 2004. During 2005, we lowered the loss factors used in our analysis of the loan loss allowance for our first mortgage loans to reflect the seasoning of the purchased loan portfolio and the recent favorable charge off experience and delinquency trends. As a result of these trends, we recorded no provision during the second, third and fourth quarters of 2005 and a minimal provision for loan losses in the year 2005 to reflect probable losses resulting from the actual growth in our loan portfolio. We consider the ratio of allowance for loan losses to total loans at December 31, 2005, given our primary lending emphasis and current market conditions, to be adequate. Although we believe that we have established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at adequate levels, additions may be necessary if future economic and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment. Although we use the best information available, the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate that is subject to significant judgment and short term change. See Critical Accounting Policies. Non Interest Income. Total non interest income decreased $8.6 million to $8.0 million for 2005 from $16.6 million for 2004. The decrease in non interest income primarily reflected the decrease in gains on securities transactions, net, as no sales of securities occurred during the second, third or fourth quarters of 2005, and minimal sales occurred in the first quarter of 2005. Non Interest Expense. Total non interest expense increased $9.4 million, or 7.9%, to $127.7 million for 2005 from $118.3 million for 2004. The increase primarily reflected normal salary adjustments, and increases in net occupancy expense, employee compensation and advertising expense due to our branch expansion program. Our efficiency ratio was 22.40% for the year 2005 compared with 23.60% for the year 2004. Our ratio of non interest expense to average total assets for 2005 was 0.53% compared with 0.64% for 2004. The decrease in these ratios reflected our ability to leverage our existing infrastructure to support continuing asset growth while controlling operating expenses, as our average assets grew in excess of 30.0% during 2005. Income Taxes. Income tax expense increased $23.2 million, or 16.2%, to $166.3 million for 2005 from $143.1 million for 2004, reflecting the 15.7% increase in income before income tax expense. Our effective tax rate for the year 2005 was 37.60% compared with 37.43% for 2004. Page 66 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources The term liquidity refers to our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to fund loan originations, loan and security purchases, deposit withdrawals, repayment of borrowings and operating expenses. Our primary sources of funds are scheduled amortization and prepayments of loan principal and mortgage backed securities, deposits, borrowed funds, maturities and calls of investment securities and funds provided by our operations. Our membership in the FHLB provides us access to additional sources of borrowed funds, which is generally limited to approximately twenty times the amount of FHLB stock owned. We also have the ability to access the capital markets from time to time, depending on market conditions. Our investment policy provides that we shall maintain a primary liquidity ratio, which consists of cash, Federal funds sold, securities with remaining maturities of less than five years and adjustable rate mortgage backed securities repricing within one year, in an amount equal to at least 4% of total deposits and short term borrowings. At December 31, 2006, our primary liquidity ratio was 39.0%. Deposit flows, calls of investment securities and borrowed funds, and prepayments of loans and mortgage backed securities are strongly influenced by interest rates, general and local economic conditions and competition in the marketplace. These factors reduce the predictability of the timing of these sources of funds. As mortgage interest rates decline, customer prepayment activity tends to accelerate causing an increase in cash flow from both our mortgage loan and mortgage backed security portfolios. If our pricing is competitive, the demand for mortgage originations also accelerates. When mortgage rates increase, the opposite effect on prepayment activity tends to occur and our loan origination and purchase activity becomes increasingly dependent on the strength of our residential real estate market and the volume of home purchases and new construction activity in the markets we serve. Principal repayments on loans were $1.75 billion during the year 2006 compared with $2.15 billion for the year 2005. The decrease in payments on loans reflected the slowing prepayment rate on mortgage loans due to the rising interest rate environment during 2006. Principal payments received on mortgage backed securities totaled $1.51 billion during 2006 compared with $1.46 billion during 2005. The increase in payments on mortgage backed securities reflected the growth of our primarily variable rate portfolio and the fact that the prepayment rates on variable rate instruments remained high as customers refinanced to fixed rate instruments. Maturities and calls of investment securities during 2006 were $850.3 million compared with maturities and calls totaling $1.70 billion for 2005. The decrease in maturities and calls reflected the rising interest rate environment resulting in a decrease in call activity. Total deposits increased $2.03 billion during the year 2006 compared with a decrease of $94.0 million during the year 2005. Deposit flows, in general, are affected by the level of market interest rates, the interest rates and products offered by competitors, the volatility of equity markets, and other factors. The increase in deposits during 2006 was primarily due to the Acquisition and increases in short term time deposits and money market accounts, reflecting the competitive pricing of these deposit types. The decrease in deposits during 2005 reflected the use of deposit balances by customers to purchase common stock during our second step conversion and stock offering. Time deposit accounts scheduled to mature within one year were $8.33 billion at December 31, 2006. We anticipate that we will have sufficient resources to meet this current funding commitment. Based on our deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy, we anticipate that a significant portion of these time deposits will remain with us as renewed time deposits or transfers to other deposit products at the prevailing interest rate. We are Page 67 Table of Contents committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position; therefore we monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis. For the year 2006, we borrowed an additional $9.14 billion compared with new borrowings of $5.13 billion for the year 2005. We made $3.53 billion in principal payments on borrowed funds during 2006 compared with $925.0 million for 2005. The funds borrowed during 2006 all have initial non call periods ranging from one to three years and final maturities of ten years, and were primarily used to fund our asset growth. At December 31, 2006 we had $16.97 billion in borrowed funds, with a weighted average rate of 4.08%, which have the potential to be called within one year. We anticipate we will have sufficient resources to meet this funding commitment by borrowing new funds at the prevailing market interest rate, or by paying off the borrowed funds as they are called with internally generated cash. Our primary investing activities are the origination and purchase of one to four family real estate loans and consumer and other loans, the purchase of mortgage backed securities, and the purchase of investment securities. We originated total loans of $2.31 billion during the year 2006 compared with $2.19 billion during the year 2005. Of the first mortgage loan originations during 2006, 45.0% were variable rate loans. During the year 2006 we purchased total loans of $2.71 billion compared with $3.68 billion during the year 2005. These continued strong levels of mortgage loan originations and purchases, which were funded primarily by borrowed funds, reflected the internal growth initiatives we have employed during recent periods. The slight decrease in combined originations and purchases reflected the decrease in loan prepayments due to the rising interest rate environment. The continued larger volume of purchased mortgage loans during 2006, when compared to originated loans, allowed us to grow and geographically diversify our mortgage loan portfolio at a relatively low overhead cost while maintaining our traditional thrift business model. We will continue to purchase mortgage loans to grow and diversify our portfolio, as opportunities and funding are available. Purchases of mortgage backed securities during the year 2006 were $3.93 billion compared with $3.28 billion during the year 2005. Of the mortgage backed securities purchased during 2006, 98.7% were variable rate securities. During 2006, we purchased $1.25 billion of investment securities compared with $4.31 billion during 2005. The decrease in purchases of investment securities reflected the lower amount of cash flows available for investment during 2006 due to the rising interest environment and the reinvestment of cash flows into loan originations and purchases. As part of the membership requirements of the FHLB, we are required to hold a certain dollar amount of FHLB common stock based on our asset size or our borrowings from the FHLB. During the year 2006, we purchased an additional $236.0 million in FHLB common stock compared with purchases of $104.2 million during 2005. The purchases of additional FHLB common stock were necessitated by increases in the amount of our outstanding borrowings with the FHLB. The additional purchases made during 2006 brought our total investment in FHLB stock to $445.0 million, the amount we are currently required to hold. Cash dividends declared and paid during 2006 were $161.4 million compared with $102.1 million during 2005. In 2005, Hudson City, MHC applied for and was granted approval from the OTS to waive receipt of dividends declared by Hudson City Bancorp. These waivers of dividend payments were effective for the first six months of 2005. Beginning in the third quarter of 2005, due to the consolidation of Hudson City, MHC into Hudson City Bancorp as part of the second step conversion, dividends were paid on all outstanding shares of Hudson City Bancorp common stock. The dividend pay out ratio using amount per share information, which does not reflect the dividend waiver by Hudson City, MHC in periods prior to the third quarter of 2005, was 55.56% for the year 2006 compared with 54.69% for the year 2005. On January 23, 2007, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.08 per common share. Page 68 Table of Contents The dividend is payable on March 1, 2007 to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 2, 2007. We anticipate we will have sufficient resources to meet this obligation. Under our stock repurchase programs, shares of Hudson City Bancorp common stock may be purchased in the open market and through other privately negotiated transactions, from time to time, depending on market conditions. The repurchased shares are held as treasury stock for general corporate use. During the year 2006, we purchased 33,747,243 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $448.2 million. During most of the year 2005, our stock repurchase program was suspended pending the completion of our second step conversion and stock offering. We did, however, purchase 256,768 shares, at an aggregate cost of $2.7 million, which were vesting in our recognition and retention plan and were surrendered by plan participants for the payment of income taxes. In June 2006, the Board of Directors approved our seventh stock repurchase program to repurchase up to 56,975,000 shares of common stock. At December 31, 2006, there were 44,314,000 shares authorized and yet to be purchased under our stock repurchase programs. At December 31, 2006, Hudson City Savings exceeded all regulatory capital requirements. Hudson City Savings tangible capital ratio, leverage (core) capital ratio and total risk based capital ratio were 11.30%, 11.30% and 30.99%, respectively. These ratios reflect the $3.00 billion contribution of net offering proceeds from Hudson City Bancorp. The primary source of liquidity for Hudson City Bancorp, the holding company of Hudson City Savings, is capital distributions from the banking subsidiary. During 2006, Hudson City Bancorp received $282.9 million in dividend payments from Hudson City Savings, which amounted to approximately 101.9% of Hudson City Savings net income for that period. The primary use of these funds is the payment of dividends to our shareholders and the repurchase of our common stock. Hudson City Bancorps ability to continue these activities is solely dependent upon capital distributions from Hudson City Savings. Applicable federal law may limit the amount of capital distributions Hudson City Savings may make. (See Item 1 Business Regulation of Hudson City Savings Bank and Hudson City Bancorp Federally Chartered Savings Bank Regulations Limitation on Capital Distributions) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Hudson City is a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements, which occur in the normal course of our business, to meet the credit needs of our customers and the growth initiatives of the Bank. These arrangements are primarily commitments to originate and purchase mortgage loans, and to purchase mortgage backed securities. We are also obligated under a number of non cancelable operating leases. The following table summarizes contractual obligations of Hudson City by contractual payment period, as of December 31, 2006. Payments Due By Period Less Than One Year to Three Years to More Than Contractual Obligation Total One Year Three Years Five Years Five Years (In thousands) Mortgage loan originations $ 176,655 $ 176,655 $ $ $ Mortgage loan purchases 951,000 951,000 Mortgage backed security purchases 846,900 846,900 Operating leases 122,243 7,317 15,111 13,825 85,990 Total $ 2,096,798 $ 1,981,872 $ 15,111 $ 13,825 $ 85,990 Page 69 Table of Contents Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend money to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments to fund first mortgage loans generally have fixed expiration dates of approximately 90 days and other termination clauses. Since some commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Hudson City Savings evaluates each customers credit worthiness on a case by case basis. Additionally, we have available home equity, overdraft and commercial/construction lines of credit, which do not have fixed expiration dates, of approximately $140.5 million, $3.3 million, and $57.6 million. We are not obligated to advance further amounts on credit lines if the customer is delinquent, or otherwise in violation of the agreement. The commitments to purchase first mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities had a normal period from trade date to settlement date of approximately 60 days. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. This interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FASB Interpretation No. 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The application of FASB Interpretation No. 48 is not expected to have an impact on our financial condition or results of operations. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. This statement provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. The FASB believes the standard also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the information used to measure fair value, and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. Statement 157 applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value but does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances. This Statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The application of SFAS No. 157 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 108, which expresses the SEC staffs views regarding the process of quantifying financial statement misstatements. The approaches used in practice to accumulate and quantify misstatements are referred to as the rollover and iron curtain approaches. The rollover approach quantifies a misstatement based on the amount of the error originating in the current year income statement. The iron curtain approach quantifies a misstatement based on the effects of correcting the misstatement existing in the balance sheet at the end of the current year, irrespective of the misstatements year of origination. The staff believes registrants must quantify the impact of correcting all misstatements, including both the carryover and reversing effects of prior year misstatements, on the current year financial statements. This can be accomplished by quantifying an error under both the rollover and iron curtain approaches and by evaluating the error measured under each approach. SAB No. 108 became effective for the Company as of December 31, 2006. The application of SAB No. 108 did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Page 70 Table of Contents Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices The Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Hudson City Bancorp have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, commonly referred as GAAP. GAAP generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations. Unlike industrial companies, our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature. As a result, changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than do the effects of inflation. Critical Accounting Policies We have identified the accounting policies below as critical to understanding our financial results. In addition, Note 1 to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report contains a summary of our significant accounting policies. We believe our policies with respect to the methodology for our determination of the allowance for loan losses and asset impairment judgments, including other than temporary declines in the value of our securities, involve a higher degree of complexity and require management to make difficult and subjective judgments which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters. Changes in these judgments, assumptions or estimates could cause reported results to differ materially. These critical policies and their application are continually reviewed by management, and are periodically reviewed with the Audit Committee and our Board of Directors. Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses has been determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, under which we are required to maintain adequate allowances for loan losses. We are responsible for the timely and periodic determination of the amount of the allowance required. We believe that our allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover specifically identifiable loan losses, as well as estimated losses inherent in our portfolio for which certain losses are probable but not specifically identifiable. Our primary lending emphasis is the origination and purchase of one to four family first mortgage loans on residential properties and, to a lesser extent, second mortgage loans on one to four family residential properties resulting in a loan concentration in residential first mortgage loans at December 31, 2006. As a result of our lending practices, we also have a concentration of loans secured by real property located in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut. Based on the composition of our loan portfolio and the growth in our loan portfolio, we believe the primary risks inherent in our portfolio are increases in interest rates, a decline in the economy, generally, and a decline in real estate market values. Any one or a combination of these events may adversely affect our loan portfolio resulting in increased delinquencies, loan losses and future levels of provisions. We consider it important to maintain the ratio of our allowance for loan losses to total loans at an acceptable level given current economic conditions, interest rates and the composition of our portfolio. Page 71 Table of Contents Due to the nature of our loan portfolio, our evaluation of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses is performed on a pool basis. We evaluated the multi family and commercial mortgage, construction and unsecured commercial loans transferred in the Acquisition in a similar manner as our previously existing portfolio. Each month we categorize the loan portfolio by certain risk characteristics such as loan type (one to four family, multi family, etc.), loan source (originated or purchased) and payment status (i.e., current or number of days delinquent). Loans with known potential losses are categorized separately. We assign potential loss factors to the payment status categories on the basis of our assessment of the potential risk inherent in each loan type. These factors are periodically reviewed for appropriateness giving consideration to charge off history and delinquency trends. We use this analysis, as a tool, together with principal balances and delinquency reports, to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Other key factors we consider in this process are current real estate market conditions in geographic areas where our loans are located, changes in the trend of non performing loans, the current state of the local and national economy and loan portfolio growth. We maintain the allowance for loan losses through provisions for loan losses that we charge to income. We charge losses on loans against the allowance for loan losses when we believe the collection of loan principal is unlikely. We establish the provision for loan losses after considering the results of our review of delinquency and charge off trends, the allowance for loan loss analysis, the amount of the allowance for loan losses in relation to the total loan balance, loan portfolio growth, U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and regulatory guidance. We have applied this process consistently and we have made minimal changes in the estimation methods and assumptions that we have used. Hudson City defines the population of potential impaired loans to be all non accrual commercial real estate and multi family loans. Impaired loans are individually assessed to determine that the loans carrying value is not in excess of the fair value of the collateral or the present value of the loans expected future cash flows. Smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment, such as residential mortgage loans and consumer loans, are specifically excluded from the impaired loan portfolio. We believe that we have established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at adequate levels. Additions may be necessary if future economic and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment. Although management uses the best information available, the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate that is subject to significant judgment and short term change. For additional information, see Item 1 Business Allowance for Loan Losses for a detailed description of how we determine the allowance for loan losses. Asset Impairment Judgments. Certain of our assets are carried in our consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or at the lower of cost or fair value. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to recognize impairment of such assets. We periodically perform analyses to test for impairment of various assets. In addition to our impairment analyses related to loans discussed above, another significant impairment analysis relates to the value of other than temporary declines in the value of our securities. Our available for sale portfolio is carried at estimated fair value, with any unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders equity. The securities which we have the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and are carried at amortized cost. We conduct a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if the value of any security has declined below its carrying value and whether such decline is other than temporary. Page 72 Table of Contents If such decline is deemed other than temporary, we would adjust the carrying amount of the security by writing down the security to fair market value through a charge to current period operations. The market values of our securities are significantly affected by changes in interest rates. In general, as interest rates rise, the market value of fixed rate securities will decrease; as interest rates fall, the market value of fixed rate securities will increase. With significant changes in interest rates, we evaluate our intent and ability to hold the security to maturity or for a sufficient time to recover the recorded principal balance. Estimated fair values for securities are based on published or securities dealers market values. Stock Based Compensation We recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards for all awards granted, modified, repurchased or cancelled after January 1, 2006 in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R). For the portion of outstanding awards for which the requisite service was not rendered as of January 1, 2006, the recognition of the cost of employee services is based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated under SFAS No. 123 for pro forma disclosures. We estimate the per share fair value of option grants on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model using assumptions for the expected dividend yield, expected stock price volatility, risk free interest rate and expected option term. These assumptions are based on our analysis of our historical option exercise experience and our judgments regarding future option exercise experience and market conditions. These assumptions are subjective in nature, involve uncertainties and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. The Black Scholes option pricing model also contains certain inherent limitations when applied to options that are not traded on public markets. The per share fair value of options is highly sensitive to changes in assumptions. In general, the per share fair value of options will move in the same direction as changes in the expected stock price volatility, risk free interest rate and expected option term, and in the opposite direction as changes in the expected dividend yield. For example, the per share fair value of options will generally increase as expected stock price volatility increases, risk free interest rate increases, expected option term increases and expected dividend yield decreases. The use of different assumptions or different option pricing models could result in materially different per share fair values of options. Goodwill Goodwill is presumed to have an indefinite useful life and is tested, at least annually, for impairment at the reporting unit level. Impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. At December 31, 2006, the carrying amount of our goodwill totaled $150.8 million. When performing the impairment test, if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired. We will test our goodwill for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting unit below its carrying amount. The identification of additional reporting units or the use of other valuation techniques could result in materially different evaluations of impairment. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Assumptions. Non contributory retirement and post retirement defined benefit plans are maintained for certain employees, including certain retired employees. We adopted SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans An Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132R as of December Page 73 Table of Contents 31, 2006. This statement requires an employer to: (a) recognize in its statement of financial condition an asset for a plans overfunded status or a liability for a plans underfunded status; (b) measure a plans assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employers fiscal year; and (c) recognize, in comprehensive income, changes in the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in the year in which the changes occur. The requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employers fiscal year end statement of financial position is effective for the Company as of December 31, 2008. We provide our actuary with certain rate assumptions used in measuring our benefit obligation. The most significant of these is the discount rate used to calculate the period end present value of the benefit obligations, and the expense to be included in the following years financial statements. A lower discount rate will result in a higher benefit obligation and expense, while a higher discount rate will result in a lower benefit obligation and expense. The discount rate assumption was determined based on a cash flow yield curve model specific to our pension and post retirement plans. We compare this rate to certain market indices, such as long term treasury bonds, or the Moodys or Merrill Lynch bond indices, for reasonableness. A discount rate of 6.0% was selected for the December 31, 2006 measurement date and the 2006 expense calculation. For our pension plan, we also assumed a rate of salary increase of 4.25% for future periods. This rate is comparable to actual salary increases experienced over prior years. We assumed a return on plan assets of 8.75% for future periods. We actuarially determine the return on plan assets based on actual plan experience over the previous ten years. The actual return on plan assets was 11.47% for 2006. For our post retirement benefit plan, the assumed health care cost trend rate used to measure the expected cost of other benefits for 2006 was 9.25%. The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 4.75% for 2013 and remain at that level thereafter. Changes to the assumed health care cost trend rate are expected to have an immaterial impact as we capped our obligations to contribute to the premium cost of coverage to the post retirement health benefit plan at the 2007 premium level. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Management of Interest Rate Risk As a financial institution, our primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility. Our net income is primarily based on net interest income, and fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact the level of both income and expense recorded on a large portion of our assets and liabilities. Fluctuations in interest rates will also affect the market value of all interest earning assets, other than those that possess a short term to maturity. During 2006, the market yield curve inverted, primarily due to increases in short term market interest rates. This interest rate environment had an adverse impact on our net interest income as our interest bearing liabilities generally reflect movements in short term rates, while our interest earning assets, a majority of which have initial terms to maturity or repricing greater than one year, generally reflect movements in long term interest rates. The impact of interest rate changes on our interest income is generally felt in later periods than the impact on our interest expense due to differences in the timing of the maturities, repayments and repricing of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. The timing of the placement of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities on our balance sheet, also had an adverse impact on our net interest income as our interest bearing liabilities generally time market rate movements while our interest earning assets lag market rates due to commitment periods. Page 74 Table of Contents Also impacting our net interest income and net interest rate spread is the level of prepayment activity on our mortgage related assets. The actual amount of time before mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities are repaid can be significantly impacted by changes in market interest rates and mortgage prepayment rates. Mortgage prepayment rates will vary due to a number of factors, including the regional economy in the area where the underlying mortgages were originated, seasonal factors, demographic variables and the assumability of the underlying mortgages. However, the major factors affecting prepayment rates are prevailing interest rates, related mortgage refinancing opportunities and competition. Generally, the level of prepayment activity directly affects the yield earned on those assets, as the payments received on the interest earning assets will be reinvested at the prevailing market interest rate. Prepayment rates are generally inversely related to the prevailing market interest rate, thus, as market interest rates increase, prepayment rates tend to decrease. The primary objectives of our interest rate risk management strategy are to: evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in our balance sheet accounts; determine the appropriate level of interest rate risk given our business plan, the current business environment and our capital and liquidity requirements; and manage interest rate risk in a manner consistent with the approved guidelines and policies set by our Board of Directors. We seek to manage our asset/liability mix to help minimize the impact that interest rate fluctuations may have on our earnings. To achieve the objectives of managing interest rate risk, our Asset/Liability Committee meets weekly to discuss and monitor the market interest rate environment compared to interest rates that are offered on our products. This committee consists of the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Operating Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and other senior officers of the institution as required. The Asset/Liability Committee presents periodic reports to the Board of Directors at its regular meetings and, on a quarterly basis, presents a comprehensive report addressing the results of activities and strategies and the effect that changes in interest rates will have on our results of operations and the present value of our equity. Historically, our lending activities have emphasized one to four family fixed rate first and second mortgage loans. Our growth in variable rate mortgage related assets has helped reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and is expected to benefit our long term profitability, as the rate earned on the mortgage loan will increase as prevailing market rates increase. However, the prevailing interest rate environment, and the desires of our customers, has resulted in a demand for long term hybrid and fixed rate first mortgage loans. This may have an adverse impact on our net interest income, particularly in a rising interest rate environment. In the past several years, we have been originating a larger percentage of variable rate assets in order to better manage our interest rate risk. Included in variable rate loans and securities are loans or securities with a contractual annual rate adjustment after an initial fixed rate period of one to ten years. These variable rate instruments are more rate sensitive, given the potential interest rate adjustment, than the long term fixed rate investments we currently hold in our portfolio. Variable rate products constituted 45.0% of loan originations, 1.0% of loan purchases and 98.7% of mortgage backed security purchases made during the year 2006. In aggregate, 55.4% of our mortgage related asset originations and purchases had variable rates. Of the growth in our total mortgage related assets, 59.6% was due to growth in our variable rate products. Page 75 Table of Contents The strategy to originate and purchase a larger percentage of variable rate assets, has lowered our percentage of fixed rate interest earning assets to total interest earning assets to 60.8% at December 31, 2006 from 70.2% at December 31, 2005. Notwithstanding the decrease in the percentage of fixed rate interest earning assets to total interest earning assets, our fixed rate interest earning assets may have an adverse impact on our earnings in a rising rate environment as the interest rate on these interest earning assets would not reprice to current market interest rates as fast as the interest rates on our interest bearing deposits and callable borrowed funds. The strategy to originate a higher percentage of variable rate instruments may also have an adverse impact on our net interest income and net interest margin as variable rate interest earning assets generally have initial interest rates lower than alternative fixed rate investments. In 2007, we intend to originate and purchase similar percentages to 2006 of variable rate mortgage related assets. Our primary source of funds has been deposits, consisting primarily of time deposits and interest bearing demand accounts and borrowings. Our deposits have substantially shorter terms to maturity than our mortgage loan portfolio and borrowed funds. The borrowings are generally long term to maturity, in an effort to offset our short term deposit liabilities and assist in managing our interest rate risk. These long term borrowings have call options that could shorten their maturities in a changing interest rate environment. We intend to continue to grow our borrowed funds, as part of our interest rate risk management strategy with new borrowings having maturities of ten years and initial non call periods of one to five years. Due to the nature of our operations, we are not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk. Our real estate loan portfolio, the majority of which is located in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut, is subject to risks associated with the local economy. We do not own any trading assets. We did not engage in any hedging transactions that use derivative instruments (such as interest rate swaps and caps) during the year 2006 and did not have any such hedging transactions in place at December 31, 2006. Simulation Model. We use a simulation model as our primary means to calculate and monitor the interest rate risk inherent in our portfolio. This model reports net interest income and the present value of equity in different interest rate environments, assuming an instantaneous and permanent interest rate shock to all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities. We assume maturing or called instruments are reinvested into the same type of product, with the rate earned or paid reset to our currently offered rate for loans and deposits, or the current market rate for securities and borrowed funds. Our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are generally reported at the earlier of their maturity date or next rate reset date, subject to assumptions regarding prepayment rates, non maturity deposit decay rates, and the call of certain of our investment securities and borrowed funds. Assumptions regarding prepayment and deposit decay rates can have a significant impact on the simulation model. While we believe our assumptions are reasonable, there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment and decay rates will approximate actual future prepayment and withdrawal activity. Significant increases in market interest rates may tend to reduce prepayment speeds on our mortgage related assets, as fewer borrowers refinance their loans. At the same time, deposit decay rates may tend to increase in the shorter term periods, as depositors seek higher yielding investments elsewhere. If these trends occur, we could experience larger negative percent changes in our model results in the varying rate shock scenarios. The information presented in the table below is based on the following assumptions: Page 76 Table of Contents we assumed an annual prepayment rate for fixed rate first mortgage loans of 125% of the FHLMC fixed rate index of moderately seasoned loans and an annual prepayment rate for variable rate first mortgage loans of 125% of the FHLMC 5 year balloon index of new loans; we assumed an annual prepayment rate for our mortgage backed securities using the prepayment rate associated with the security type; for savings accounts that had no stated maturity, we used decay rates (the assumed rate at which the balance of existing accounts would decline) of: 5.0% in less than six months, 5.0% in six months to one year, 5.0% in one year to two years, 5.0% in two years to three years, 10.0% in three years to five years, and 70.0% in more than five years; for our High Value Checking product, which is included in interest bearing transaction accounts, we used decay rates of : 10.0% in less than six months, 10.0% in six months to one year, 15% in one to two years, 15% in two to three years, 25% in three to five years, and 25% in more than five years; for other interest bearing transaction accounts that had no stated maturity, we used decay rates of : 2.5% in less than six months, 2.5% in six months to one year, 10.0% in one to two years, 10.0% in two to three years, 20.0% in three years to five years, and 55.0% in more than five years; for money market accounts that had no stated maturity, we used decay rates of: 2.5% in less than six months, 2.5% in six months to one year, 10.0% in one to two years, 10.0% in two to three years, 20.0% in three years to five years, and 55.0% in more than five years; and callable investment securities and borrowed funds are shown at the earlier of their probable call date or maturity date given the rate of the instrument in relation to the current market rate environment and the call option frequency, the model assumed no calls of investment securities and $3.56 billion of calls of borrowed funds over the next year in the current (zero basis point) change scenario. As a primary means of managing interest rate risk, we monitor the impact of interest rate changes on our net interest income over the next twelve month period. This model does not purport to provide estimates of net interest income over the next twelve month period, but attempts to assess the impact of a simultaneous and parallel interest rate change on our net interest income. The following table reports the changes to our net interest income over various interest rate change scenarios. Our internal policy sets a maximum change of 40.0% given a positive or negative 200 basis point interest rate shock. Change in Percent Change in Interest Rates Net Interest Income (Basis points) 200 (11.76 )% 100 (5.12 ) 50 (1.91 ) (50 ) 1.19 (100 ) (1.45 ) (200 ) (10.09 ) Page 77 Table of Contents The negative change to net interest income in the positive change scenarios was primarily due to the expected calls, and subsequent reset to higher market interest rates, of our borrowed funds. The negative change to net interest income in the negative change scenarios was primarily due to the expected calls of our government sponsored agency securities and the acceleration of the prepayment speeds on our mortgage related assets, and the subsequent reset to lower market interest rates of the reinvested assets. We also monitor our interest rate risk by monitoring changes in the present value of equity in the different rate environments. The present value of equity is the difference between the estimated fair value of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities. The changes in market value of assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates reflect the interest sensitivity of those assets and liabilities as their values are derived from the characteristics of the asset or liability (i.e., fixed rate, adjustable rate, caps, floors) relative to the current interest rate environment. For example, in a rising interest rate environment the fair market value of a fixed rate asset will decline, whereas the fair market value of an adjustable rate asset, depending on its repricing characteristics, may not decline. Increases in the market value of assets will increase the present value of equity whereas decreases in the market value of assets will decrease the present value of equity. Conversely, increases in the market value of liabilities will decrease the present value of equity whereas decreases in the market value of liabilities will increase the present value of equity. The following table presents the estimated present value of equity over a range of interest rate change scenarios at December 31, 2006. The present value ratio shown in the table is the present value of equity as a percent of the present value of total assets in each of the different rate environments. Our current policy sets a minimum ratio of the present value of equity to the fair value of assets in the current interest rate environment (no rate shock) of 8.00%, a minimum present value ratio of 6.50% in the plus 200 basis point interest rate shock scenario and a minimum present value ratio of 6.00% in the minus 200 basis point scenario. Present Value of Equity As Percent of Present Present Value of Equity Value of Assets Change in Dollar Dollar Percent Present Basis Point Interest Rates Amount Change Change Value Ratio Change (Basis points) (Dollars in thousands) 200 $ 3,893,098 $ (1,588,208 ) (28.97 )% 11.79 % (364 ) 100 4,776,023 (705,283 ) (12.87 ) 13.92 (151 ) 50 5,204,666 (276,640 ) (5.05 ) 14.89 (54 ) 5,481,306 15.43 (50 ) 5,366,967 (114,339 ) (2.09 ) 14.92 (51 ) (100 ) 4,795,263 (686,043 ) (12.52 ) 13.29 (214 ) (200 ) 3,217,799 (2,263,507 ) (41.30 ) 8.93 (650 ) The decreases in the present value of equity and the present value ratio in the increasing rate scenarios analysis were primarily due to the high percentage of fixed rate mortgage loans, mortgage backed securities and investment securities in our portfolio. At December 31, 2006, fixed rate interest earning assets were 60.8% of total interest earning assets. This percentage of fixed rate interest earning assets to total interest earning assets may have an adverse impact on our earnings in a rising rate environment, as these assets will not reprice in a rising rate environment. Page 78 Table of Contents The decreases in the present value of equity and the present value ratio in the decreasing rate scenarios in the December 31, 2006 analysis were primarily due to the growth of our fixed rate borrowed funds with long terms to maturity, which generally do not reprice in a decreasing rate environment. The methods we used in simulation modeling are inherently imprecise. This type of modeling requires that we make assumptions that may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. For example, we assume the composition of the interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will remain constant over the period being measured and that all interest rate shocks will be uniformly reflected across the yield curve, regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing. The table assumes that we will take no action in response to the changes in interest rates. In addition, prepayment estimates and other assumptions within the model are subjective in nature, involve uncertainties, and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Accordingly, although the previous two tables may provide an estimate of our interest rate risk at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in interest rates on our net interest income or present value of equity. Gap Analysis. The matching of the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring a financial institutions interest rate sensitivity gap. An asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period. The interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period. A gap is considered negative when the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a specific time period exceeds the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within that same period. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period exceeds the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period. During a period of rising interest rates, a financial institution with a negative gap position would be expected, absent the effects of other factors, to experience a greater increase in the costs of its interest bearing liabilities relative to the yields of its interest earning assets and thus a decrease in the institutions net interest income. An institution with a positive gap position would be expected, absent the effect of other factors, to experience the opposite result. Conversely, during a period of falling interest rates, a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to reduce net interest income. Page 79 Table of Contents The following table, presents the amounts of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at December 31, 2006, which we anticipate to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown. Except for prepayment activity and non maturity deposit decay rates, we determined the amounts of assets and liabilities that reprice or mature during a particular period in accordance with the earlier of the term to rate reset or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability. For purposes of this table, assumptions used in decay rates and prepayment activity are similar to those used in the preparation of our simulation model. Borrowed funds are reported at the anticipated call date, for those that are callable within one year, or at their contractual maturity date.

This represented a cumulative one year interest rate sensitivity gap as a percent of total assets of negative 14.2% at December 31, 2006, compared with negative 6.8% at December 31, 2005. The change in these ratios, year to year, was partially due to the larger amount of anticipated calls of borrowed funds in the current year and a shift of our customer deposits to time deposit maturities of less than one year, due to internal pricing strategies. The methods used in the gap table are inherently imprecise. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Certain assets, such as adjustable rate loans and mortgage backed securities, have features that limit changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the loan. If interest rates change, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate from those assumed in calculating the table. Finally, the ability of borrowers to make payments on their adjustable rate loans may decrease if interest rates increase. Page 80 Table of Contents
