Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Hudson City Bancorps Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, and the other statistical data provided elsewhere in this document. Executive Summary We continue to focus on our traditional thrift business model by growing our franchise through the origination and purchase of one to four family mortgage loans and funding this loan production with increased borrowings and growth in deposit accounts. We opened eight new branches during 2007, increasing our total footprint to 119 branches. In addition, we have plans to open three branches in Fairfield County, Connecticut, three branches in New York in Suffolk County and Richmond County and two branches in New Jersey in Ocean County and Middlesex County. We expect to open these branches in 2008. Our results of operations depend primarily on net interest income, which, in part, is a direct result of the market interest rate environment. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets, primarily mortgage loans, mortgage backed securities and investment securities, and the interest we pay on our interest bearing liabilities, primarily time deposits, interest bearing transaction deposits and borrowed funds. Net interest income is affected by the shape of the market yield curve, the timing of the placement and repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities on our balance sheet, and the prepayment rates on our mortgage related assets. Our results of operations may also be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions, particularly those with respect to changes in market interest rates, credit quality, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. Our results are also affected by the market price of our stock, as the expense of certain of our employee stock compensation plans is related to the current price of our common stock. The Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve Bank (FOMC) decreased the overnight lending rate by 100 basis points to 4.25% during the second half of 2007 and continued to decrease the rate by an additional 125 basis points during the first quarter of 2008. As a result, short term market interest rates decreased. Longer term market interest rates also decreased, but at a slower pace than the short term interest rates and, as a result, the yield curve steepened. However, competitive pricing pressures prevented us from lowering our deposit costs to the same extent as the decreases in the yield curve. As a result, our net interest rate spread and net interest margin decreased during 2007. Net income increased 2.5% for 2007 to $295.9 million as compared to $288.6 million for 2006. Basic and diluted earnings per share for 2007 were $0.59 and $0.58, respectively, compared with $0.54 and $0.53, respectively, for 2006. Our return on average stockholders equity was 6.23% for 2007, as compared to 5.70% in 2006. The increase in the return on average equity is due primarily to decreases in average stockholders equity due primarily to our stock repurchase program and cash dividend payments. Our return on average assets for 2007 was 0.74% as compared to 0.91% for 2006. The decrease in the return on average assets reflected our balance sheet growth during a period of narrowing net interest rate spreads during 2007. Net interest income increased 5.5% to $647.2 million due primarily to the overall growth in our balance sheet. Our total average interest earning assets increased 25.6% for the year ended December 31, 2007, while the yields over those same periods increased 25 basis points. Our total average interest bearing Page 56 Table of Contents liabilities increased 32.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 and the average cost increased 45 basis points. The provision for loan losses amounted to $4.8 million for 2007. We did not record a provision for loan losses during 2006. The 2007 provision for loan losses reflects the risks inherent in our loan portfolio due to decreases in real estate values in our lending markets, the increase in non performing loans and the overall growth of our loan portfolio. The ratio of non performing loans to total loans was 0.33% at December 31, 2007 as compared to 0.16% at December 31, 2006. Total non interest expense increased $8.9 million, or 5.6%, to $167.9 million for 2007 from $159.0 million for 2006. The increase is primarily due to a $4.6 million increase in net occupancy expense and a $3.2 million increase in compensation and benefits expense. We have been able to grow our assets by 25.1% to $44.42 billion at December 31, 2007 from $35.51 billion at December 31, 2006, by originating and purchasing mortgage loans and purchasing mortgage backed securities. Loans increased $5.13 billion to $24.20 billion at December 31, 2007 from $19.07 billion at December 31, 2006. This increase is a result of our continued loan purchase activity as well as our focus on the origination of one to four family mortgage loans in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut. During 2007, we purchased $3.97 billion of loans and originated $3.35 billion of loans. We have been able to increase our origination of loans as a result of the acquisition of Sound Federal and the expansion of our mortgage broker network. The acquisition of Sound Federal has given us a presence in Westchester County, New York and Fairfield County, Connecticut. The Connecticut market in particular has provided strong loan growth and is our second largest county for loan production. Total securities increased $3.50 billion to $18.74 billion at December 31, 2007 from $15.24 billion at December 31, 2006. The increase in securities was primarily due to purchases of mortgage backed securities of $6.83 billion, partially offset by principal collections on mortgage backed securities $1.91 billion. The increase in our total assets was funded primarily by an increase in borrowings as well as by customer deposits. Borrowed funds increased $7.17 billion to $24.14 billion at December 31, 2007 from $16.97 billion at December 31, 2006. During 2007, many of our competitors sought to raise liquidity by offering customers premium rates on deposits even as market interest rates decreased, making time deposits a more expensive method of raising funds. As a result, we increased our level of borrowed funds, which we believed to be a more cost effective alternative in the current interest rate environment. Deposits increased $1.73 billion to $15.15 billion at December 31, 2007 from $13.42 billion at December 31, 2006. The increase in deposits was attributable to growth in our time deposits and money market accounts. The increase in these accounts was a result of our competitive pricing strategies that focused on attracting these types of deposits as well as customer preferences for time deposits rather than other types of deposit accounts. Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006 During 2007, our total assets increased $8.91 billion, or 25.1%, to $44.42 billion at December 31, 2007 from $35.51 billion at December 31, 2006. Loans increased $5.13 billion, or 26.9%, to $24.20 billion at December 31, 2007 from $19.07 billion at December 31, 2006 due to continued loan purchase activity as well as our focus on the origination of one to four family first mortgage loans in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut. For 2007, we purchased one to four family first mortgage loans of $3.97 billion and originated mortgage loans and other loans of $3.35 billion, compared with purchases of $2.71 billion and originations of $2.31 billion for 2006. The purchases of mortgage loans during 2007 allowed us to Page 57 Table of Contents continue to grow and geographically diversify our mortgage loan portfolio at a relatively low overhead cost while maintaining our traditional thrift business model. Our first mortgage loan originations and purchases were substantially in one to four family mortgage loans. Approximately 47.0% of mortgage loan originations were variable rate loans. Substantially all purchased mortgage loans were fixed rate loans since variable rate loans available for purchase are typically outside of our defined geographic parameters and include features, such as option ARMs, that do not meet our underwriting standards. At December 31, 2007, fixed rate mortgage loans accounted for 80.5% of our first mortgage loan portfolio compared with 81.0% at December 31, 2006. Total mortgage backed securities increased $5.24 billion to $14.57 billion at December 31, 2007 from $9.33 billion at December 31, 2006. This increase was due primarily to purchases of $6.83 billion, all of which are mortgage backed securities issued by a U.S. government agency or U.S. government sponsored enterprise and substantially all of which were variable rate instruments. At December 31, 2007, variable rate mortgage backed securities accounted for 82.3% of our portfolio compared with 69.6% at December 31, 2006. The purchase of variable rate mortgage backed securities is a component of our interest rate risk management strategy. Since our primary lending activities are the origination and purchase of fixed rate mortgage loans, the purchase of variable rate mortgage backed securities provides us with an asset that reduces our exposure to interest rate fluctuations while providing a source of cash flow from monthly principal and interest payments. Federal funds sold increased $49.7 million to $106.3 million at December 31, 2007 as compared to $56.6 million at December 31, 2006. This increase was due to liquidity that was made available to fund asset purchases entered into at the end of 2007 with January 2008 settlement dates. Accrued interest receivable increased by $50.9 million to $245.1 million at December 31, 2007 as compared to $194.2 million at December 31, 2006. This increase was due primarily to increased balances in loans and investments. The $51.9 million decrease in other assets was primarily due to a decrease of $42.4 million in deferred tax assets. Total liabilities increased $9.23 billion, or 30.2%, to $39.81 billion at December 31, 2007 compared with $30.58 billion at December 31, 2006. Borrowed funds increased $7.17 billion, or 42.3%, to $24.14 billion at December 31, 2007 from $16.97 billion at December 31, 2006. The increase in borrowed funds was the result of $10.73 billion of new borrowings at a weighted average rate of 4.22%, partially offset by repayments of $3.56 billion with a weighted average rate of 3.57%. The new borrowings have final maturities of ten years and initial reprice dates ranging from one to five years. The additional borrowed funds were utilized as a more cost effective alternative to time deposits, which had become a relatively expensive method of raising funds in the current interest rate environment, as many of our competitors sought to raise liquidity by offering customers premium rates on deposits even as market interest rates decreased. These borrowed funds were used primarily to fund our asset growth. Borrowed funds at December 31, 2007 were comprised of $12.02 billion of securities sold under agreements to repurchase and $12.13 billion of Federal Home Loan Bank advances. Total deposits increased $1.73 billion, or 13.0%, during 2007, due primarily to a $1.64 billion increase in total time deposits, and a $656.6 million increase in our money market accounts. These increases were partially offset by a $555.5 million decrease in our interest bearing transaction accounts and savings accounts, due primarily to customers shifting deposits to short term time deposits. We experienced significant competitive pressure during 2007 with respect to the pricing of short term deposits in the New York metropolitan area. The increase in time deposits reflects our competitive pricing of these deposits and customer preference for short term time deposits. Page 58 Table of Contents Other liabilities increased to $236.4 million at December 31, 2007 as compared to $187.7 million at December 31, 2006. The increase is the result of an increase in accrued interest payable on our deposits and borrowings of $35.5 million and an increase in accrued taxes of $27.4 million, partially offset by a decrease in accrued expenses of $13.7 million. At December 31, 2007, due to brokers amounted to $281.9 million and represented securities purchased in 2007 with settlement dates in 2008. Total stockholders equity decreased $318.9 million to $4.61 billion at December 31, 2007 from $4.93 billion at December 31, 2006. The decrease was primarily due to repurchases of 40,578,954 shares of our outstanding common stock at an aggregate cost of $550.2 million and cash dividends paid to common stockholders of $165.4 million. These decreases to stockholders equity were partially offset by net income of $295.9 million and a $66.2 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2007. The accumulated other comprehensive income of $16.6 million at December 31, 2007 includes a $19.6 million after tax net unrealized gain on securities available for sale ($33.2 million pre tax). We invest primarily in mortgage backed securities issued by GinnieMae, FannieMae and FreddieMac, as well as U.S. Government and Agency securities. These securities account for 99.9% of total securities. The Company does not purchase unrated or private label mortgage backed securities or other higher risk securities such as those backed by sub prime loans. Certain securities in the available for sale and held to maturity portfolios had unrealized losses. These unrealized losses were caused by increases in market yields subsequent to purchase and are not attributable to credit quality concerns. There were no debt securities past due or securities for which the Company currently believes it is not probable that it will collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the security. Because the Company has the intent and the ability to hold securities with unrealized losses until a market price recovery (which, for debt securities may be until maturity), the Company did not consider these securities to be other than temporarily impaired at December 31, 2007. The accumulated other comprehensive income of $16.6 million at December 31, 2007 represented an improvement from the accumulated other comprehensive loss of $49.6 million at December 31, 2006 reflecting a net unrealized gain on securities available for sale as compared to a net unrealized loss at December 31, 2006, as a result of lower market interest rates. As of December 31, 2007, 55,173,550 shares were available for repurchase under our existing stock repurchase programs. At December 31, 2007, our stockholders equity to asset ratio was 10.38% compared with 13.89% at December 31, 2006. For 2007, the ratio of average stockholders equity to average assets was 11.93% compared with 16.00% for the year 2006. The lower equity to assets ratios reflect our strategy to grow assets, repurchase our common stock and pay dividends. Our book value per share, using the period end number of outstanding shares, less purchased but unallocated employee stock ownership plan shares and less purchased but unvested recognition and retention plan shares, was $9.55 at December 31, 2007 and $9.47 at December 31, 2006. Our tangible book value per share, calculated by deducting goodwill and the core deposit intangible from stockholders equity, was $9.22 as of December 31, 2007 and $9.15 at December 31, 2006. Analysis of Net Interest Income Net interest income represents the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets, such as mortgage loans, mortgage backed securities and investment securities, and the expense we pay on interest bearing liabilities, such as time deposits and borrowed funds. Net interest income depends on our volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates we earned or paid on them. Page 59 Table of Contents Average Balance Sheet. The following table presents certain information regarding our financial condition and net interest income for 2007, 2006, and 2005. The table presents the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities for the periods indicated. We derived the yields and costs by dividing income or expense by the average balance of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities, respectively, for the periods shown. We derived average balances from daily balances over the periods indicated. Interest income includes fees that we considered adjustments to yields. Yields on tax exempt obligations were not computed on a tax equivalent basis. Non accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances and therefore have a zero yield. The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred loan origination fees and costs, and purchase premiums and discounts that are amortized or accreted to interest income.

(3) Determined by dividing net interest income by average total interest earning assets. Page 60 Table of Contents Rate/Volume Analysis. The following table presents the extent to which the changes in interest rates and the changes in volume of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected our interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated. Information is provided in each category with respect to: changes attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate); changes attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume); and the net change. The changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to rate. 2007 Compared to 2006 2006 Compared to 2005 Increase (Decrease) Due To Increase (Decrease) Due To Volume Rate Net Volume Rate Net (In thousands) Interest earning assets: First mortgage loans, net $ 257,608 $ 15,303 $ 272,911 $ 224,965 $ 18,150 $ 243,115 Consumer and other loans 7,455 1,094 8,549 8,125 787 8,912 Federal funds sold 4,101 (50 ) 4,051 (1,872 ) 5,101 3,229 Mortgage backed securities 171,579 34,331 205,910 84,409 24,523 108,932 Federal Home Loan Bank stock 14,412 8,573 22,985 8,559 (1,446 ) 7,113 Investment securities (15,627 ) 13,883 (1,744 ) 53,286 11,348 64,634 Total 439,528 73,134 512,662 377,472 58,463 435,935 Interest bearing liabilities: Savings accounts (199 ) (1,322 ) (1,521 ) (1,858 ) (1,858 ) Interest bearing transaction accounts (31,110 ) 815 (30,295 ) (44,411 ) 16,817 (27,594 ) Money market accounts 17,968 8,534 26,502 3,298 12,200 15,498 Time deposits 122,066 54,088 176,154 64,721 91,593 156,314 Repurchase agreements 81,563 34,845 116,408 69,693 19,842 89,535 FHLB Advances 184,706 6,758 191,464 145,564 7,377 152,941 Total 374,994 103,718 478,712 237,007 147,829 384,836 Net change in net interest income $ 64,534 $ (30,584 ) $ 33,950 $ 140,465 $ (89,366 ) $ 51,099 Page 61 Table of Contents Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 General. Net income was $295.9 million for 2007, an increase of $7.3 million, or 2.5%, compared with net income of $288.6 million for 2006. Basic and diluted earnings per common share were $0.59 and $0.58, respectively, for 2007 compared with $0.54 and $0.53, respectively, for 2006. For 2007, our return on average stockholders equity was 6.23%, compared with 5.70% for 2006. Our return on average assets for 2007 was 0.74% as compared to 0.91% for 2006. The decrease in the return on average assets reflected our balance sheet growth during a period of narrowing net interest rate spreads during 2007. The increase in the return on average equity is due primarily to a $310.1 million decrease in average stockholders equity due primarily to an increase in treasury stock as a result of our stock repurchase program. Interest and Dividend Income. Total interest and dividend income increased $512.7 million, or 31.8%, to $2.13 billion for 2007 as compared to $1.61 billion for 2006. The increase in total interest and dividend income was primarily due to a $7.99 billion, or 25.6%, increase in the average balance of total interest earning assets to $39.22 billion for 2007 as compared to $31.23 billion for 2006. The increase in interest and dividend income was also partially due to an increase of 25 basis points in the weighted average yield on total interest earning assets to 5.42% for 2007 from 5.17% for the comparable period in 2006. Interest and fees on first mortgage loans increased $272.9 million to $1.21 billion for 2007 as compared to $932.6 million for 2006. This increase was primarily due to a $4.52 billion increase in the average balance of first mortgage loans to $21.21 billion for 2007 as compared to $16.69 billion for 2006, which reflected our continued emphasis on the growth of our mortgage loan portfolio. The increase in mortgage loan income was also due to a nine basis point increase in the weighted average yield to 5.68%, reflecting the origination and purchase of mortgage loans during the period of slightly rising intermediate and long term market interest rates during the first half of 2007. Interest income on consumer and other loans increased $8.5 million to $28.2 million for 2007 as compared to $19.7 million for 2006, primarily due to a $114.6 million increase in the average balance of consumer and other loans to $431.5 million and an increase of 33 basis points in the weighted average yield to 6.55%. Interest income on mortgage backed securities increased $205.9 million to $587.9 million for 2007 as compared to $382.0 million for 2006. This increase was due primarily to a $3.37 billion increase in the average balance of total mortgage backed securities to $11.39 billion. The increase in income was also due to a 40 basis point increase in the weighted average yield to 5.16% for 2007 as compared to 4.76% for 2006. The increase in the average balance of mortgage backed securities was due to purchases of variable rate mortgage backed securities as part of our interest rate risk management strategy. Since our primary lending activities are the origination and purchase of fixed rate mortgage loans, the purchase of variable rate mortgage backed securities provides us with an asset that reduces our exposure to interest rate fluctuations while providing a source of cash flow from monthly principal and interest payments. The increase in the weighted average yields on mortgage backed securities is a result of the purchase of new securities at higher rates than the existing portfolio as well as the repricing of securities in the existing portfolio. Dividends on FHLB stock increased $23.0 million to $39.5 million for 2007 as compared to $16.5 million for 2006. This increase was due to a $240.2 million increase in the average balance of FHLB stock to $586.0 million and a 197 basis point increase in the average dividend yield to 6.74% for 2007 as compared to 4.77% for 2006. Page 62 Table of Contents Interest on investment securities decreased $1.8 million to $254.1 million during 2007 as compared to $255.9 million for 2006. This decrease was due to a $339.4 million decrease in the average balance of investment securities to $5.36 billion. The decrease in interest on investment securities was partially offset by a 25 basis point increase in the weighted average yield to 4.74%. Interest Expense. Total interest expense increased $478.7 million, or 47.9%, to $1.48 billion for 2007 from $1.00 billion for 2006. This increase was due primarily to an $8.43 billion, or 32.5%, increase in the average balance of total interest bearing liabilities to $34.36 billion for 2007 compared with $25.93 billion for 2006. The increase in total interest expense was also due to a 45 basis point increase in the weighted average cost of total interest bearing liabilities to 4.31% for 2007 as compared to 3.86% for 2006. This increase in total interest bearing liabilities was used to fund asset growth. The increase in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities for the 2007 reflected a very competitive environment for deposits and a shift within our deposits to higher costing short term time deposits as well as the growth and re pricing of our deposits and borrowings during the higher short term interest rate environment experienced during the second half of 2006 and first half of 2007. Interest expense on our time deposit accounts increased $176.2 million to $492.8 million for 2007 as compared to $316.6 million for 2006. This increase was due to a 66 basis point increase in the weighted average cost to 4.93% and a $2.59 billion increase in the average balance of time deposit accounts to $10.01 billion as compared to $7.42 billion for 2006. Interest expense on money market accounts increased $26.5 million due to a 101 basis point increase in the weighted average cost to 4.01%, reflecting increases in short term interest rates and the competitive pricing of this product, and a $487.9 million increase in the average balance to $1.18 billion. The increases in the average balance of time deposits and money market accounts reflects our growth strategy and includes deposits from the 29 branches added to our network during 2006 and 2007 as well as deposit growth in existing branches. Interest expense on our interest bearing transaction accounts decreased $30.3 million to $60.6 million for 2007 as compared to $90.9 million for 2006 primarily due to a $928.6 million decrease in the average balance to $1.81 billion from $2.73 billion. This decrease was due primarily to customer preferences for short term time deposit products. Interest expense on borrowed funds increased $307.9 million to $873.4 million for 2007 as compared to $565.5 million for 2006. This increase was primarily due to a $6.30 billion increase in the average balance of borrowed funds to $20.59 billion and a 28 basis point increase in the weighted average cost of borrowed funds to 4.24% for 2007 as compared to 3.96% for 2006. We faced significant competition for time deposits from many of our competitors who, during the second half of 2007, sought to raise liquidity by offering customers premium rates on deposits even as market interest rates decreased. As a result, we increased our level of borrowed funds, which we believed to be a more cost effective alternative in the current interest rate environment. The increase in borrowed funds was used to fund the growth in interest earning assets. The increase in the average cost of borrowed funds reflected new borrowings with higher interest rates than existing borrowings that were called. Substantially all of our borrowings are callable at the discretion of the issuer. As a result, as interest rates decrease, these borrowings will probably not be called and therefore will not reprice until maturity or until market interest rates increase. As interest rates increase, these borrowings would likely be called at their next call date and our cost to replace these borrowings would be at higher rates than the called borrowing. These call features are generally quarterly, after an initial non call period of three months to five years from the date of borrowing. Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased $34.0 million, or 5.5%, to $647.2 million for 2007 compared with $613.2 million for 2006. Our net interest rate spread decreased 20 basis points to 1.11% for Page 63 Table of Contents 2007 from 1.31% for 2006. Our net interest margin decreased 31 basis points to 1.65% from 1.96% for the same respective periods. The decrease in our net interest rate margin and net interest rate spread was primarily due to the larger increase in the weighted average cost of interest bearing liabilities compared with the increase in the weighted average yield on interest earning assets. Changes in market interest rates during 2007 resulted in a return to a positively sloped yield curve. However, competitive pricing pressures due in part to the liquidity crisis in the credit markets, prevented us from lowering our deposit costs to the same extent as the decreases in the yield curve and the shift within our deposits to higher costing short term time deposits also contributed to the increase in the average cost of deposits. In addition, while market interest rates decreased, our callable borrowings were not called and therefore did not reprice to lower rates. Provision for Loan Losses. The provision for loan losses amounted to $4.8 million for the year 2007. We did not record a provision for loan losses for the same period in 2006. The allowance for loan losses amounted to $34.7 million and $30.6 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We recorded our provision for loan losses during 2007 based on our allowance for loan losses methodology that considers a number of quantitative and qualitative factors, including the amount of non performing loans, which increased to $79.4 million at December 31, 2007 as compared to $30.0 million at December 31, 2006. See "Critical Accounting Policies Allowance for Loan Loses." Due to the nature of our homogenous loan portfolio, our evaluation of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses is performed substantially on a pooled basis. A component of our methodology includes assigning potential loss factors to the payment status of multiple residential loan categories with the objective of assessing the potential risk inherent in each loan type. We also consider growth in the loan portfolio in our determination of the allowance for loan losses. These factors are periodically reviewed for appropriateness giving consideration to charge off history, delinquency trends, the results of our foreclosed property transactions and market conditions. We use this systematic methodology, as a tool, together with qualitative analysis performed by our Asset Quality Committee to estimate the allowance for loan losses. Other key factors we consider in this process are current real estate market conditions in geographic areas where our loans are located, changes in the trend of non performing loans, the current state of the local and national economy, changes in interest rates, the results of our foreclosed property transactions and loan portfolio growth. Any one or a combination of these events may adversely affect our loan portfolio resulting in increased delinquencies, loan losses and future levels of provisions. Our primary lending emphasis is the origination and purchase of one to four family first mortgage loans on residential properties and, to a lesser extent, second mortgage loans on one to four family residential properties. Our loan growth was primarily concentrated in one to four family mortgage loans with loan to value ratios of less than 80%. The value of the property used as collateral for our loans is dependent upon local market conditions. As part of our estimation of the allowance for loan losses, we monitor changes in the values of homes in each market using indices published by various organizations. Based on our analysis of the data for 2007, we concluded that home values in the Northeast quadrant of the United States, where most of our lending activity occurs, have deteriorated since 2006 as evidenced by reduced levels of sales, increasing inventories of houses on the market, declining house prices and an increase in the length of time houses remain on the market. In addition, general economic conditions in the United States have also worsened as evidenced by slower economic growth. However, the decline in the economic and housing conditions in the New York metropolitan area has not been as severe as the rest of the country. Approximately 67% of our total loans are in the New York metropolitan area and 33% are located throughout the remaining states in the northeast quadrant of the United States. With respect to our non performing loans, approximately 63% are in the New York metropolitan area and 37% are located throughout the remaining states in the Northeast quadrant of the United States. We considered these trends Page 64 Table of Contents in market conditions in determining the provision for loan losses also taking into account the continued growth of our loan portfolio. The second half of 2007 has been highlighted by significant disruption and volatility in the financial and capital marketplaces. This turbulence has been attributable to a variety of factors, including the fallout associated with the sub prime mortgage market. One aspect of this fallout has been significant deterioration in the activity of the secondary residential mortgage market and the lack of available liquidity that previously existed through securitization transactions. The disruptions have been exacerbated by the acceleration of the decline of the real estate and housing market. We continue to closely monitor the local and national real estate markets and other factors related to risks inherent in our loan portfolio. Sub prime mortgage lending, which has been the riskiest sector of the residential housing market, is not a market in which we participate. We continue to adhere to prudent underwriting standards. However, based on our evaluation of the foregoing factors, and in recognition of the recent increases in non performing loans and net loan charge offs, our analyses indicated that a provision for loan losses was warranted during 2007. At December 31, 2007, first mortgage loans secured by one to four family properties accounted for 97.95% of total loans. Fixed rate mortgage loans represent 80.5% of our first mortgage loans. Fixed rate loans possess less inherent credit risk since loan payments do not change in response to changes in interest rates. In addition, we do not originate or purchase loans with payment options, negative amortization loans or sub prime loans. We determined that a provision for loan losses was not required for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 based on our allowance for loan losses methodology that considered a number of quantitative and qualitative factors, including low levels of charge offs. See Critical Accounting Policies Allowance for Loan Losses for a description of this methodology. Net charge offs amounted to $76,000 during 2006. Charge offs were at very low levels as a result of our lending practices and the concentration of one to four family first mortgage loans in our portfolio. As a result of our underwriting policies, our borrowers typically have a significant amount of equity in the underlying real estate that we use as collateral for our loans. When a loan becomes delinquent, the borrower will usually sell the property to satisfy the loan rather than go to foreclosure. Since substantially all of our non performing loans are secured by residential real estate with adequate collateral, we determined that the ratio of the allowance to non performing loans was appropriate. At December 31, 2006, first mortgage loans secured by one to four family properties accounted for 97.4% of total loans. Fixed rate mortgage loans represented 81.0% of our first mortgage loans. The value of the property used as collateral for our loans is dependent upon local market conditions. During 2006, we monitored changes in the values of homes in each market using indices published by various organizations. Based on our analysis of the data for 2006, we concluded that the values of homes in our market areas were stable. As a result, we believe that our loans were adequately collateralized, especially given the loan to value ratios that our underwriting guidelines require at origination. Non performing loans amounted to $79.4 million at December 31, 2007 as compared to $30.0 million at December 31, 2006. Non performing loans at December 31, 2007 included $77.8 million of one to four family first mortgage loans as compared to $25.7 million at December 31, 2006. The ratio of non performing loans to total loans was 0.33% at December 31, 2007 compared with 0.16% at December 31, 2006. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans was 43.75% at December 31, 2007 compared with 102.09% at December 31, 2006. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans was 0.14% at December 31, 2007 compared with 0.16% at December 31, 2006. As a result of our underwriting policies, our borrowers typically have a significant amount of equity, at the time of origination, in the underlying real estate that we use as collateral for our loans. At December 31, 2007, our non performing mortgage loans had an average loan to value ratio of approximately 69% based on the appraised value at the time of origination. It has been our experience that when a loan becomes Page 65 Table of Contents delinquent, the borrower will usually sell the property to satisfy the loan rather than go to foreclosure. Since substantially all of our non performing loans are secured by residential real estate with adequate collateral at the time of origination, we determined that the ratio of the allowance to non performing loans was adequate. Net charge offs amounted to $684,000 for 2007 as compared to $76,000 for 2006. The increase in charge offs was related to non performing residential loans for which appraised values indicated declines in the value of the underlying collateral. See Item 1 Business Asset Quality. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, loans evaluated for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan amounted to $3.5 million and $3.1 million, respectively. Based on this evaluation, we established an allowance for loan losses of $268,000 for loans classified as impaired at December 31, 2007. We had no allowance for loan losses for impaired loans at December 31, 2006. Although we believe that we have established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at adequate levels, additions may be necessary if future economic and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment. Although we use the best information available, the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate that is subject to significant judgment and short term change. See Critical Accounting Policies. Non Interest Income. Total non interest income was $7.3 million for 2007 compared with $6.3 million for 2006. The increase in non interest income is primarily due to an increase in service charges on deposits as a result of deposit account growth. Non Interest Expense. Total non interest expense increased $8.9 million, or 5.6%, to $167.9 million for 2007 from $159.0 million for 2006. The increase is primarily due to a $4.6 million increase in net occupancy expense and a $3.2 million increase in compensation and benefits expense. The increase in compensation and benefits expense was due to an increase of $5.7 million in salary expense, a $5.6 million increase in stock benefit plan expense and a $8.4 million decrease in expense related to the ESOP Restoration Plan. The increase in salary expense was due primarily to an increase in the number of employees to staff our new branches as well as normal salary increases. The increase in stock benefit plan expense was primarily due to stock option grants which were made during 2007 and the 2006 option grants which were made in July 2006. During 2007, two former executives ceased to participate in the ESOP Restoration Plan, resulting in the decreased expense related to the plan. The increase in net occupancy expense and other non interest expense is primarily the result of our branch expansion, including the addition of 14 branches from the Sound Federal acquisition in July 2006 as well as growth in the existing franchise. Our efficiency ratio was 25.66% for each of the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. Our ratio of non interest expense to average total assets for 2007 was 0.42% as compared to 0.50% for 2006. Income Taxes. Income tax expense increased $13.9 million to $185.9 million for 2007, from $172.0 million for 2006. Our effective tax rate for 2007 was 38.59% compared with 37.34% for 2006. The increase in the effective tax rate was due primarily to a change in the New Jersey tax code that eliminated the dividends received deduction for dividends paid by our real estate investment trust subsidiary to its parent company. Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 General. Net income was $288.6 million for 2006, reflecting an increase of $12.5 million, or 4.5%, compared with net income of $276.1 million for 2005. Basic and diluted earnings per common share were $0.54 and $0.53, respectively, for 2006 compared with basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.49 and $0.48, respectively, for 2005. Our return on average stockholders equity was 5.70% in 2006, compared Page 66 Table of Contents with 7.52% for 2005. Our return on average assets for 2006 was 0.91% compared with 1.14% for 2005. The decreases in these ratios were primarily due to the receipt of the net proceeds from our second step conversion and stock offering completed in June 2005, which significantly increased average stockholders equity and average assets. The decrease in the return on average assets also reflected our balance sheet growth during a period of narrowing net interest rate spreads and a flat to inverted market yield curve. Interest and Dividend Income. Total interest and dividend income increased $435.9 million, or 36.9%, to $1.61 billion for 2006 compared with $1.18 billion for 2005. The increase in total interest and dividend income was primarily due to a $7.26 billion, or 30.3%, increase in the average balance of total interest earning assets to $31.23 billion for 2006 compared with $23.97 billion for 2005. The growth in the average balance of total interest earning assets was consistent with the growth initiatives employed by us during recent periods and also reflected the receipt of the net offering proceeds from our second step conversion. The increase in interest and dividend income was also partially due to a 25 basis point increase in the weighted average yield on total interest earning assets to 5.17% for the year 2006 from 4.92% for the year 2005. This increase in the weighted average yield reflected a modest increase in intermediate and long term interest rates experienced during 2006. Interest and fees on mortgage loans increased $243.1 million primarily due to a $4.03 billion increase in the average balance, reflecting increases in our core investment of first mortgage loans. The increase in mortgage loan income was also due to a 14 basis point increase in the weighted average yield, which reflected the large volume of originations and purchases of mortgage loans during this period of rising intermediate and long term interest rates. The $108.9 million increase in interest income on total mortgage backed securities was due to a $1.80 billion increase in the average balance of total mortgage backed securities, due primarily to the purchase of variable rate securities during 2006 to complement our purchases of fixed rate mortgage loans. The increase in was also due to a 37 basis point increase in the weighted average yield to 4.76%, reflecting these purchases during this period of rising interest rates. The $64.6 million increase in interest and dividends on total investment securities was primarily due to an increase in the average balance of total investment securities of $1.19 billion, which reflected the investment into short term securities of part of the net proceeds from the second step conversion and stock offering. The increase in interest and dividends on total investment securities was also due to a 24 basis point increase in the weighted average yield reflecting purchases of securities during this period of rising short term interest rates. Interest Expense. Total interest expense increased $384.8 million, or 62.4%, to $1.00 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $616.8 million for 2005. This increase was primarily due to a $5.89 billion, or 29.4%, increase in the average balance of total interest bearing liabilities to $25.93 billion for 2006 compared with $20.04 billion for 2005. The increase in interest bearing liabilities was used to fund our asset growth. The increase in total interest expense was also due to a 78 basis point increase in the weighted average cost of total interest bearing liabilities to 3.86% for the year 2006 compared with 3.08% for the year 2005. The increase in the average cost reflected the growth and re pricing of our interest bearing liabilities during the rising short term interest rate environment experienced in 2006. Interest expense on borrowed funds increased $242.5 million primarily due to a $5.37 billion increase in the average balance of borrowed funds and a 34 basis point increase in the weighted average cost of borrowed funds. The increase in the average balance of borrowed funds was used to fund asset growth. The increase in the average cost of borrowed funds reflected the new borrowings with a higher rate than the existing borrowings. Page 67 Table of Contents The $142.4 million increase in interest expense on interest bearing deposits for the year 2006 was primarily due to an 111 basis point increase in the weighted average cost of interest bearing deposits, reflecting the rising short term interest rate environment, the competitive pricing of our deposit products and a shift by our customers, during 2006 to higher costing short term time deposits from our High Value Checking product. The $156.3 million increase in interest expense on our time deposit accounts reflected a 138 basis point increase in the weighted average cost, due to the rising short term market interest rate environment, and a $1.87 billion increase in the average balance of time deposit accounts. The $15.5 million increase in interest expense on our money market accounts primarily reflected an increase in the weighted average cost of 190 basis points, reflecting increases in short term interest rates and the competitive pricing of this product. The $27.6 million decrease in interest expense on our interest bearing transaction accounts was primarily due to a $1.39 billion decrease in the average balance, reflecting shifts to time deposit products. Time deposits accounted for 63.7% of the average balance of interest bearing deposits compared to 49.9% during 2005. We intend to continue to fund future asset growth using borrowed funds and customer deposits as our primary sources of funds. We intend to grow customer deposits by continuing to pay competitive, but prudent rates and by opening new branch offices. Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased $51.1 million, or 9.1%, to $613.2 million for the year 2006 compared with $562.1 million for the year 2005. This increase primarily reflected the investment of the net offering proceeds from our second step conversion over the course of a full year and our balance sheet growth initiatives. The increase due to our growth was partially offset by an increase in the costs of our interest bearing deposits and borrowed funds. Our net interest rate spread decreased 53 basis points to 1.31% for 2006 from 1.84% for 2005 and our net interest margin decreased 39 basis points to 1.96% for 2006 from 2.35% for 2005. Market interest rates resulted in an inverted U.S. Treasury yield curve during 2006. This market interest rate scenario has had a negative impact on our results of operations and our net interest margin as the yields on our interest earning assets have increased far less than the costs of our interest bearing liabilities. In addition, our interest bearing liabilities will reprice to current market interest rates faster than the yields earned on our interest earning assets. The increase in the cost of our interest bearing liabilities reflected the rising short term interest rate environment, affecting both our deposits and borrowed funds, and the shift within our deposits to higher costing short term time deposits. Our net interest margin is likely to decrease further if the yield curve remains inverted in 2007. Provision for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses amounted to $30.6 million and $27.4 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in the allowance for loan losses was due to the inclusion of Sound Federals allowance for loan losses as a result of the Acquisition. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans was 0.16% at December 31, 2006 compared with 0.18% at December 31, 2005. We did not record a provision for loan losses during 2006. We did record a provision of $65,000 during 2005. Net charge offs for the year 2006 were $76,000 compared with net recoveries of $9,000 for 2005. Non performing loans, defined as non accruing and accruing loans delinquent 90 days or more increased to $30.0 million at December 31, 2006 from $19.3 million at December 31, 2005. The increase reflected an increase in the number of non performing loans to 118 loans at December 31, 2006 from 93 loans at December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2006, our largest loan delinquent 90 days or more was a construction loan with a balance of $3.0 million that has become current subsequent to December 31, 2006. The ratio of non performing loans to total loans was 0.16% at December 31, 2006 compared with 0.13% at December 31, 2005. The ratio of allowance for loan losses to total non performing loans was 102.09% at December 31, 2006 compared with 141.84% at December 31, 2005. Page 68 Table of Contents Although we believe that we have established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at adequate levels, additions may be necessary if future economic and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment. Although we use the best information available, the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate that is subject to significant judgment and short term change. See Critical Accounting Policies. Non Interest Income. Total non interest income decreased $1.7 million to $6.3 million for 2006 from $8.0 million for 2005. The decrease in non interest income primarily reflected the $2.7 million decrease in gains on securities transactions as there were minimal realized gains/losses from sales of securities that occurred during 2006. Non Interest Expense. Total non interest expense increased $31.3 million, or 24.5%, to $159.0 million for 2006 from $127.7 million for 2005. This increase is primarily due to increases of $20.2 million in compensation and employee benefits expense, $4.8 million in net occupancy expense, and $5.9 million in other non interest expense. The increase in compensation and employee benefits expense primarily reflected a $12.7 million increase in the expense related to our employee stock ownership plan, as a result of increases in our stock price. The increase also reflected the expense related to stock options that amounted to $5.5 million during 2006. The increase in net occupancy expense is the result of our branch expansion and the addition of 14 branches from Sound Federal in July 2006. The increases in the other categories of non interest expense are due to an increase in professional services of $2.3 million, operating expenses for new branches and increased costs related to our growth. Our efficiency ratio was 25.66% for 2006 compared with 22.40% for 2005. Our ratio of non interest expense to average total assets for 2006 was 0.50% compared with 0.53% for 2005. Income Taxes. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $172.0 million compared with $166.3 million for 2005. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 37.34% compared with 37.60% for the year 2005. The 3.4% increase in income tax expense reflected the 4.1% increase in income before income tax expense. Liquidity and Capital Resources The term liquidity refers to our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to fund loan originations, loan and security purchases, deposit withdrawals, repayment of borrowings and operating expenses. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, borrowings, the proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans and mortgage backed securities, the maturities and calls of investment securities and funds provided by our operations. Deposit flows, calls of investment securities and borrowed funds, and prepayments of loans and mortgage backed securities are strongly influenced by interest rates, general and local economic conditions and competition in the marketplace. These factors reduce the predictability of the receipt of these sources of funds. Our membership in the FHLB provides us with access to additional sources of borrowed funds, which is generally limited to approximately twenty times the amount of FHLB stock owned. We also have the ability to access the capital markets from time to time, depending on market conditions. Our ability to access liquidity, as well as our capital levels, has allowed us to pursue our growth strategy. Our investment policy provides that we shall maintain a primary liquidity ratio, which consists of investments in cash, cash in banks, Federal funds sold, securities with remaining maturities of less than five years and adjustable rate mortgage backed securities repricing within one year, in an amount equal to at least 4% of total deposits and short term borrowings. At December 31, 2007, our primary liquidity ratio was 23.4% compared with 39.0% at December 31, 2006. Page 69 Table of Contents Our primary investing activities are the origination and purchase of one to four family real estate loans and consumer and other loans, the purchase of mortgage backed securities, and the purchase of investment securities. These activities are funded primarily by borrowings, deposit growth and principal and interest payments on loans, mortgage backed securities and investment securities. We originated $3.35 billion and purchased $3.97 billion of loans during 2007 as compared to originations of $2.31 billion and purchases of $2.71 billion during 2006. Purchases of mortgage backed securities during 2007 were $6.83 billion as compared to $3.93 billion during 2006. The increase in mortgage loan purchases and originations and the purchases of mortgage backed securities reflected the growth initiatives we have employed in recent periods. During 2007, principal repayments on loans totaled $2.19 billion as compared to $1.75 billion for 2006. Principal payments on mortgage backed securities amounted to $1.91 billion and $1.51 billion for those same respective periods. These increases in principal repayments were due primarily to the growth of the loan and mortgage backed securities portfolios. Maturities and calls of investment securities amounted to $3.83 billion during 2007 compared with maturities and calls totaling $850.3 million during 2006. The increase in the maturities and calls of investment securities reflected slightly lower short and intermediate term market interest rates during 2007 that resulted in an increase in call activity. As part of the membership requirements of the FHLB, we are required to hold a certain dollar amount of FHLB common stock based on our asset size or our borrowings from the FHLB. During 2007, we purchased a net additional $259.7 million of FHLB common stock compared with $236.0 million during 2006. Our primary financing activities consist of gathering deposits, engaging in wholesale borrowings, repurchases of our common stock and the payment of dividends. Total deposits increased $1.73 billion during 2007 as compared to $2.03 billion for 2006. This increase reflects our growth strategy including 14 branch offices added as part of the Sound Federal acquisition as well as growth in the existing franchise. Deposit flows are typically affected by the level of market interest rates, the interest rates and products offered by competitors, the volatility of equity markets, and other factors. Time deposits scheduled to mature within one year were $10.24 billion at December 31, 2007. We anticipate that we will have sufficient resources to meet this current funding commitment. Based on our deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy, we anticipate that a significant portion of these time deposits will remain with us as renewed time deposits or transfers to other deposit products at the prevailing interest rate. We also used wholesale borrowings to fund our investing and financing activities. New borrowings totaled $10.73 billion, partially offset by $3.56 billion in principal repayments of borrowed funds. At December 31, 2007, we had $14.97 billion of callable borrowed funds that have contractual call dates within one year and with a weighted average rate of 4.27%. We anticipate that $350.0 million of these borrowings are likely to be called based on current market interest rates. We anticipate we will have sufficient resources to meet this funding commitment by borrowing new funds at the prevailing market interest rate, or using funds generated by deposit growth. Cash dividends paid during 2007 were $165.4 million. During 2007, we purchased 40,578,954 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $550.2 million. At December 31, 2007, there remained 55,473,550 shares to be purchased under existing stock repurchase programs. Page 70 Table of Contents The primary source of liquidity for Hudson City Bancorp, the holding company of Hudson City Savings, is capital distributions from Hudson City Savings. During 2007, Hudson City Bancorp received $278.2 million in dividend payments from Hudson City Savings, substantially all of Hudson City Savings net income for that period. The primary use of these funds is the payment of dividends to our shareholders and the repurchase of our outstanding common stock. Hudson City Bancorps ability to continue these activities is dependent upon capital distributions from Hudson City Savings. Applicable federal law may limit the amount of capital distributions Hudson City Savings may make. At December 31, 2007, Hudson City Bancorp had total cash of $140.5 million in a checking account at Hudson City Savings. At December 31, 2007, Hudson City Savings exceeded all regulatory capital requirements. Hudson City Savings tangible capital ratio, leverage (core) capital ratio and total risk based capital ratio were 9.16%, 9.16% and 24.83%, respectively. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Hudson City is a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements, which occur in the normal course of our business, to meet the credit needs of our customers and the growth initiatives of the Bank. These arrangements are primarily commitments to originate and purchase mortgage loans, and to purchase mortgage backed securities. We are also obligated under a number of non cancelable operating leases. The following table summarizes contractual obligations of Hudson City by contractual payment period, as of December 31, 2007. Payments Due By Period Less Than One Year to Three Years to More Than Contractual Obligation Total One Year Three Years Five Years Five Years (In thousands) Mortgage loan originations $ 198,336 $ 198,336 $ $ $ Mortgage loan purchases 669,000 669,000 Mortgage backed security purchases 520,000 520,000 Operating leases 137,556 7,533 15,312 14,596 100,115 Total $ 1,524,892 $ 1,394,869 $ 15,312 $ 14,596 $ 100,115 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend money to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments to fund first mortgage loans generally have fixed expiration dates of approximately 90 days and other termination clauses. Since some commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Hudson City Savings evaluates each customers credit worthiness on a case by case basis. Additionally, we have available home equity, overdraft and commercial/construction lines of credit, which do not have fixed expiration dates, of approximately $134.8 million, $3.2 million, and $27.1 million. We are not obligated to advance further amounts on credit lines if the customer is delinquent, or otherwise in violation of the agreement. The commitments to purchase first mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities had a normal period from trade date to settlement date of approximately 60 days. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2007, the FASB issued Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 06 11, Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on Share Based Payment Awards. EITF Issue No. 06 11 addresses a Page 71 Table of Contents companys recognition of an income tax benefit received on dividends that are (a) paid to employees holding equity classified non vested shares, equity classified non vested share units, or equity classified outstanding share options and (b) charged to retained earnings under SFAS No. 123(R). The EITF reached a consensus that a realized income tax benefit from dividends or dividend equivalents that are charged to retained earnings and are paid to employees for equity classified nonvested equity shares, nonvested equity share units, and outstanding equity share options should be recognized as an increase to additional paid in capital. The amount recognized in additional paid in capital for the realized income tax benefit from dividends on those awards should be included in the pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies on share based payment awards. Unrealized income tax benefits from dividends on equity classified employee share based payment awards should be excluded from the pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb potential future tax deficiencies. The accounting treatment of the income tax benefits from these dividends would be applied on a prospective basis. EITF Issue No. 06 11 is effective for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2007. We do not expect that EITF Issue No. 06 11 will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 155, which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. At the effective date, an entity may elect the fair value option for eligible items that exist at that date and report the effect of the first remeasurement to fair value as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. Subsequent to the effective date, unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are to be reported in earnings. If the fair value option is elected for any available for sale or held to maturity securities at the effective date, cumulative unrealized gains and losses at that date are included in the cumulative effect adjustment and those securities are to be reported as trading securities under SFAS No. 115, but the accounting for a transfer to the trading category under SFAS No. 115 does not apply. Electing the fair value option for an existing held to maturity security will not call into question the intent of an entity to hold other debt securities to maturity in the future. SFAS No. 159 also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that chose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 159 does not affect any existing accounting literature that requires certain assets and liabilities to be carried at fair value and does not eliminate disclosure requirements included in other accounting standards. SFAS No. 159 is effective as of the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. Early adoption was permitted; however, we did not early adopt SFAS No.159 and, therefore, adopted the standard as of January 1, 2008. Upon adoption, we did not elect the fair value option for eligible items that existed as of January 1, 2008. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The expanded disclosures include a requirement to disclose fair value measurements according to a hierarchy, segregating measurements using (1) quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, (2) significant other observable inputs and (3) significant unobservable inputs. SFAS No. 157 applies only to fair value measurements already required or permitted by other accounting standards and does not impose requirements for additional fair value measures. SFAS No. 157 was issued to increase consistency and comparability in reporting fair values. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The provisions are to be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the statement is initially applied, with certain exceptions. A transition adjustment, measured as the difference between the carrying amounts and the fair values of certain specific financial instruments at the date SFAS No. 157 is initially applied, is to be recognized as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for the fiscal year in which SFAS No. 157 is initially applied. SFAS No. 157 will affect certain of our fair value disclosures, but is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. The portion of our assets and liabilities with fair values based on unobservable inputs is not significant. Page 72 Table of Contents Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices The Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Hudson City Bancorp have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, commonly referred as GAAP. GAAP generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations. Unlike industrial companies, our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature. As a result, changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than do the effects of inflation. Critical Accounting Policies We have identified the accounting policies below as critical to understanding our financial results. In addition, Note 1 to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report contains a summary of our significant accounting policies. We believe our policies with respect to the methodology for our determination of the allowance for loan losses, the measurement of stock based compensation expense and the measurement of the funded status and cost of our pension and other post retirement benefit plans involve a higher degree of complexity and require management to make difficult and subjective judgments which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters. Changes in these judgments, assumptions or estimates could cause reported results to differ materially. These critical policies and their application are continually reviewed by management, and are periodically reviewed with the Audit Committee and our Board of Directors. Allowance for Loan Losses The allowance for loan losses has been determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, under which we are required to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2007. We are responsible for the timely and periodic determination of the amount of the allowance required. We believe that our allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover specifically identifiable loan losses, as well as estimated losses inherent in our portfolio for which certain losses are probable but not specifically identifiable. Our primary lending emphasis is the origination and purchase of one to four family first mortgage loans on residential properties and, to a lesser extent, second mortgage loans on one to four family residential properties resulting in a loan concentration in residential first mortgage loans at December 31, 2007. As a result of our lending practices, we also have a concentration of loans secured by real property located primarily in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut. Based on the composition of our loan portfolio and the growth in our loan portfolio, we believe the primary risks inherent in our portfolio are increases in interest rates, a decline in the economy, generally, and a decline in real estate market values. Any one or a combination of these events may adversely affect our loan portfolio resulting in increased delinquencies, loan losses and future levels of loan loss provisions. We consider these trends in market conditions in determining the allowance for loan losses. We consider it important to maintain the ratio of our allowance for loan losses to total loans at a level of probable and estimable losses given current economic conditions, interest rates and the composition of our portfolio. Page 73 Table of Contents Due to the nature of our loan portfolio, our evaluation of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses is performed primarily on a pooled basis. Each month we categorize the entire loan portfolio by certain risk characteristics such as loan type (one to four family, multi family, commercial, etc.), loan source (originated or purchased) and payment status (i.e., current or number of days delinquent). Loans with known potential losses are categorized separately. We assign potential loss factors to the payment status categories on the basis of our assessment of the potential risk inherent in each loan type. These factors are periodically reviewed for appropriateness giving consideration to charge off history, delinquency trends, portfolio growth and the status of the regional economy and housing market, in order to ascertain that the loss factors cover probable and estimable losses inherent in the portfolio. We use this analysis, as a tool, together with principal balances and delinquency reports, to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Other key factors we consider in this process are current real estate market conditions in geographic areas where our loans are located, changes in the trend of non performing loans, the results of our foreclosed property transactions, the current state of the local and national economy, changes in interest rates and loan portfolio growth. We maintain the allowance for loan losses through provisions for loan losses that we charge to income. We charge losses on loans against the allowance for loan losses when we believe the collection of loan principal is unlikely. We establish the provision for loan losses after considering the results of our review of delinquency and charge off trends, the allowance for loan loss analysis, the amount of the allowance for loan losses in relation to the total loan balance, loan portfolio growth, U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and regulatory guidance. We apply this process and methodology in a consistent manner and we reassess and modify the estimation methods and assumptions used in response to changing conditions. Hudson City defines the population of potential impaired loans to be all non accrual construction, commercial real estate and multi family loans. Impaired loans are individually assessed to determine that the loans carrying value is not in excess of the fair value of the collateral or the present value of the loans expected future cash flows. Smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment, such as residential mortgage loans and consumer loans, are specifically excluded from the impaired loan portfolio. We believe that we have established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at adequate levels. Additions may be necessary if future economic and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment. Although management uses the best information available, the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate that is subject to significant judgment and short term change. Stock Based Compensation We recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards for all awards granted, modified, repurchased or cancelled after January 1, 2006 in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R). For the portion of outstanding awards for which the requisite service was not rendered as of January 1, 2006, the recognition of the cost of employee services is based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated under SFAS No. 123 for pro forma disclosures. We granted performance based stock options in 2006 and 2007 that vest if certain financial performance measures are met. In accordance with SFAS No. 123(R), we assess the probability of achieving these financial performance measures and recognize the cost of these performance based grants if it is probable that the financial performance measures will be met. This probability assessment is subjective in nature and may change over the assessment period for the performance measures. We estimate the per share fair value of option grants on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model using assumptions for the expected dividend yield, expected stock price volatility, risk free Page 74 Table of Contents interest rate and expected option term. These assumptions are based on our analysis of our historical option exercise experience and our judgments regarding future option exercise experience and market conditions. These assumptions are subjective in nature, involve uncertainties and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. The Black Scholes option pricing model also contains certain inherent limitations when applied to options that are not traded on public markets. The per share fair value of options is highly sensitive to changes in assumptions. In general, the per share fair value of options will move in the same direction as changes in the expected stock price volatility, risk free interest rate and expected option term, and in the opposite direction of changes in the expected dividend yield. For example, the per share fair value of options will generally increase as expected stock price volatility increases, risk free interest rate increases, expected option term increases and expected dividend yield decreases. The use of different assumptions or different option pricing models could result in materially different per share fair values of options. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Assumptions Non contributory retirement and post retirement defined benefit plans are maintained for certain employees, including retired employees hired on or before July 31, 2005 who have met other eligibility requirements of the plans. We adopted SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans An Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132R as of December 31, 2006. This statement requires an employer to: (a) recognize in its statement of financial condition an asset for a plans overfunded status or a liability for a plans underfunded status; (b) measure a plans assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employers fiscal year; and (c) recognize, in comprehensive income, changes in the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in the year in which the changes occur. The requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employers fiscal year end statement of financial condition will be effective for the Company as of December 31, 2008. The Companys measurement date will not change at this effective date. We provide our actuary with certain rate assumptions used in measuring our benefit obligation. The most significant of these is the discount rate used to calculate the period end present value of the benefit obligations, and the expense to be included in the following years financial statements. A lower discount rate will result in a higher benefit obligation and expense, while a higher discount rate will result in a lower benefit obligation and expense. The discount rate assumption was determined based on a cash flow yield curve model specific to our pension and post retirement plans. We compare this rate to certain market indices, such as long term treasury bonds, or the Moodys or Merrill Lynch bond indices, for reasonableness. A discount rate of 6.00% was selected for the December 31, 2007 measurement date and the 2008 expense calculation. For our pension plan, we also assumed a rate of salary increase of 4.25% for future periods. This rate is comparable to actual salary increases experienced over prior years. We assumed a return on plan assets of 8.25% for future periods. We actuarially determine the return on plan assets based on actual plan experience over the previous ten years. The actual return on plan assets was 6.01% for 2007. For our post retirement benefit plan, the assumed health care cost trend rate used to measure the expected cost of other benefits for 2006 was 8.50%. The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 4.75% for 2013 and remain at that level thereafter. Changes to the assumed health care cost trend rate are expected to have an immaterial impact as we capped our obligations to contribute to the premium cost of coverage to the post retirement health benefit plan at the 2007 premium level. We monitor these rates in relation to the current market interest rate environment and update our actuarial analysis accordingly. Page 75 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. General As a financial institution, our primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility. Our net income is primarily based on net interest income, and fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact the level of both income and expense recorded on a large portion of our assets and liabilities. Fluctuations in interest rates will also affect the market value of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, other than those that possess a short term to maturity. The difference between rates on the yield curve, or the shape of the yield curve, impacts our net interest income. During the second half of 2007, short term interest rates decreased at a faster pace than intermediate and long term market interest rates resulting in a return to a positively sloped yield curve during the second half of 2007. Due to our investment and financing decisions, the more positive the slope of the yield curve, that is the greater the increase in the interest rates in the longer maturity periods, the more favorable the environment is for our ability to generate net interest income. Our interest bearing liabilities generally reflect movements in short and intermediate term rates, while our interest earning assets, a majority of which has initial terms to maturity or repricing greater than one year, generally reflect movements in intermediate and long term interest rates. A positive slope to the yield curve allows us to invest in interest earning assets at a wider spread to interest bearing liabilities. The impact of interest rate changes on our interest income is generally felt in later periods than the impact on our interest expense due to differences in the timing of the placement of items on our balance sheet. The timing of the placement of interest earning assets on our balance sheet generally lag the current market rates by 60 to 90 days due to normal commitments periods to settlement date. In contrast, the placement of interest bearing liabilities on our balance sheet generally time market interest rates as we generally fund purchases at the time of settlement. During a period of decreasing interest rates, as was experienced during the second half of 2007, this timing difference should have a positive impact on our net interest income in future periods. Also impacting our net interest income and net interest rate spread is the level of prepayment and call activity on our interest sensitive assets. The actual amount of time before mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities are repaid can be significantly impacted by changes in market interest rates and mortgage prepayment rates. Mortgage prepayment rates will vary due to a number of factors, including the regional economy in the area where the underlying mortgages were originated, availability of credit, seasonal factors, demographic variables and the assumability of the underlying mortgages. However, the major factors affecting prepayment rates are prevailing interest rates, related mortgage refinancing opportunities and competition. Generally, the level of prepayment activity directly affects the yield earned on those assets, as the payments received on the interest earning assets will be reinvested at the prevailing market interest rate. Prepayment rates are generally inversely related to the prevailing market interest rate, thus, as market interest rates increase, prepayment rates tend to decrease. Prepayment rates on our mortage related assets have been relatively stable during 2007, even during the last quarter of 2007 when market interest rates decreased. We believe the lack of acceleration of the prepayment rate on these assets reflected the limited availability of credit during this time. Calls of investment securities and borrowed funds are also impacted by the level of market interest rates. Calls of investment securities are generally inversely related to the prevailing market interest rate, meaning as rates decrease the likelihood of a security being called would increase. The level of call activity generally affects the yield earned on these assets, as the payment received on the security would be Page 76 Table of Contents reinvested at the prevailing lower market interest rate. During the last quarter of 2007 we saw an increase in call activity on our investment securities as market interest rates decreased. The likelihood of a borrowed funds being called is directly related to the current market interest rates, meaning the higher the rates go the more likely the borrowing would be called. The level of call activity generally affects the cost of our borrowed funds, as the call of a borrowing would necessitate the re borrowing of the funds at the higher current market interest rate. During the last quarter of 2007 we experienced a decrease in calls of our borrowings as market interest rates decreased. Management of Interest Rate Risk The primary objectives of our interest rate risk management strategy are to: evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in our balance sheet accounts; determine the appropriate level of interest rate risk given our business plan, the current business environment and our capital and liquidity requirements; and manage interest rate risk in a manner consistent with the approved guidelines and policies set by our Board of Directors. We seek to manage our asset/liability mix to help minimize the impact that interest rate fluctuations may have on our earnings. To achieve the objectives of managing interest rate risk, our Asset/Liability Committee meets weekly to discuss and monitor the market interest rate environment compared to interest rates that are offered on our products. This committee consists of the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Operating Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and other senior officers of the institution as required. The Asset/Liability Committee presents periodic reports to the Board of Directors at its regular meetings and, on a quarterly basis, presents a comprehensive report addressing the results of activities and strategies and the effect that changes in interest rates will have on our results of operations and the present value of our equity. Historically, our lending activities have emphasized one to four family fixed rate first and second mortgage loans. Our growth in variable rate mortgage related assets has helped reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and is expected to benefit our long term profitability, as the rate earned on the mortgage loan will increase as prevailing market rates increase. However, the prevailing interest rate environment, and the desires of our customers, has resulted in a demand for long term hybrid and fixed rate first mortgage loans. This may have an adverse impact on our net interest income, particularly in a rising interest rate environment. In the past several years, we have been originating a larger percentage of variable rate assets in order to better manage our interest rate risk. Included in variable rate loans and securities are loans or securities with a contractual annual rate adjustment after an initial fixed rate period of one to ten years. These variable rate instruments are more rate sensitive, given the potential interest rate adjustment, than the long term fixed rate investments that we have traditionally held in our portfolio. Variable rate products constituted 46.6% of loan originations, 0.4% of loan purchases and 98.9% of mortgage backed security purchases made during the year 2007. In aggregate, 58.9% of our mortgage related asset originations and purchases had variable rates. Of the growth in our total mortgage related assets, 62.0% was due to growth in our variable rate products. Page 77 Table of Contents The strategy to originate and purchase a larger percentage of variable rate assets has lowered our percentage of fixed rate interest earning assets to total interest earning assets to 54.1% at December 31, 2007 from 60.8% at December 31, 2006. Notwithstanding the decrease in the percentage of fixed rate interest earning assets to total interest earning assets, our fixed rate interest earning assets may have an adverse impact on our earnings in a rising rate environment as the interest rate on these interest earning assets would not reprice to current market interest rates as fast as the interest rates on our interest bearing deposits and callable borrowed funds. The strategy to originate a higher percentage of variable rate instruments may also have an adverse impact on our net interest income and net interest margin as variable rate interest earning assets generally have initial interest rates lower than alternative fixed rate investments. In 2008, we intend to originate and purchase similar percentages to 2007 of variable rate mortgage related assets. Our primary source of funds has traditionally been deposits, consisting primarily of time deposits and interest bearing demand accounts and borrowings. Our deposits have substantially shorter terms to maturity than our mortgage loan portfolio and borrowed funds. The borrowings are generally long term to maturity, in an effort to offset our short term deposit liabilities and assist in managing our interest rate risk. These long term borrowings have call options that could shorten their maturities in a changing interest rate environment. We intend to continue to grow our borrowed funds, as part of our interest rate risk management strategy with new borrowings having maturities of ten years and initial non call periods of one to five years. Further, over the past year, we increased our level of borrowed funds, which we believe to be a more cost effective alternative to time deposits in the prevailing interest rate environment. If we experience a significant rising interest rate environment where interest rates increase above the interest rate for the borrowings, these borrowings will likely be called at their next call date and our cost to replace these borrowings would likely increase. Due to the nature of our operations, we are not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk. Our real estate loan portfolio, the majority of which is located in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut, is subject to risks associated with the local economy. We do not own any trading assets. We did not engage in any hedging transactions that use derivative instruments (such as interest rate swaps and caps) during the year 2007 and did not have any such hedging transactions in place at December 31, 2007. Cash Flow Determination. In preparing the following analyses, we were required to estimate the future cash flows of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. These items are generally reported at their maturity date, subject to assumptions regarding prepayment rates, non maturity deposit decay rates, and the call of certain of our investment securities and borrowed funds. These assumptions can have a significant impact on the simulation model. While we believe our assumptions are reasonable, there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rate, assumed calls of securities and borrowed funds, and deposit decay rates will approximate actual future cash flows. Increases in market interest rates may tend to reduce prepayment speeds on our mortgage related assets, as fewer borrowers refinance their loans, and reduce the anticipated calls of our investment securities. At the same time, deposit decay rates and calls of our borrowed funds may tend to increase. If these trends occur, we could experience larger negative percent changes in our model results in the varying rate shock scenarios. The information presented in the following tables is based on the following assumptions: we assumed an annual prepayment rate for fixed rate first mortgage loans of 115% of the FHLMC fixed rate index of moderately seasoned loans and an annual prepayment rate for variable rate first mortgage loans of 115% of the FHLMC five year balloon index of new loans; we assumed an annual prepayment rate for our mortgage backed securities using the prepayment rate associated with the security type; Page 78 Table of Contents for savings accounts that had no stated maturity, we used decay rates (the assumed rate at which the balance of existing accounts would decline) of: 7.5% in less than six months, 7.5% in six months to one year, 10.0% in one year to two years, 10.0% in two years to three years, 25.0% in three years to five years, and 40.0% in more than five years; for our High Value Checking product, which is included in interest bearing transaction accounts, we used decay rates of: 10.0% in less than six months, 10.0% in six months to one year, 15% in one to two years, 15% in two to three years, 25% in three to five years, and 25% in more than five years; for other interest bearing transaction accounts that had no stated maturity, we used decay rates of : 7.5% in less than six months, 7.5% in six months to one year, 10.0% in one to two years, 10.0% in two to three years, 25.0% in three years to five years, and 40.0% in more than five years; for money market accounts that had no stated maturity, we used decay rates of: 10.0% in less than six months, 10.0% in six months to one year, 20.0% in one to two years, 20.0% in two to three years, 35.0% in three years to five years, and 5.0% in more than five years; and callable investment securities and borrowed funds are shown at the earlier of their probable call date or maturity date given the rate of the instrument in relation to the current market rate environment and the call option frequency, the model assumed calls of investment securities of $1.10 billion and calls of borrowed funds of $350.0 million over the next year in the current (zero basis point) change scenario. Simulation Model. We use a simulation model as our primary means to calculate and monitor the interest rate risk inherent in our portfolio. This model reports net interest income and the present value of equity in different interest rate environments, assuming an instantaneous and permanent interest rate shock to all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities. We assume maturing or called instruments are reinvested into the same type of product, with the rate earned or paid reset to our currently offered rate for loans and deposits, or the current market rate for securities and borrowed funds. We have not reported the minus 200 basis point interest rate shock scenarios in either of our simulation model analyses, as we believe, given the current interest rate environment and historical interest rate levels, the resulting information would not be meaningful. As a primary means of managing interest rate risk, we monitor the impact of interest rate changes on our net interest income over the next twelve month period. This model does not purport to provide estimates of net interest income over the next twelve month period, but attempts to assess the impact of a simultaneous and parallel interest rate change on our net interest income. The following table reports the changes to our net interest income over various interest rate change scenarios. Our internal policy sets a maximum change of 40.0% given a positive or negative 200 basis point interest rate shock. Change in Percent Change in Interest Rates Net Interest Income (Basis points) 200 (11.01 )% 100 0.96 (100) (0.74 ) Page 79 Table of Contents The preceding table indicates that at December 31, 2007, in the event of a 200 basis point increase in interest rates, we would expect to experience an 11.01% decrease in net interest income as compared to an 11.76% decrease at December 31, 2006. The negative change to net interest income in the positive rate change scenarios was primarily due to the anticipated calls of borrowed funds and the increased expense of our short term time deposits in the increasing interest rate environment scenario. The preceding table also indicates that at December 31, 2007, in the event of a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates, we would expect to experience a 0.74% decrease in net interest income as compared to a 1.45% decrease at December 31, 2006. The slight negative change to net interest income in the minus 100 basis point rate change scenario reflects the low current market interest rate environment. We also monitor our interest rate risk by monitoring changes in the present value of equity in the different rate environments. The present value of equity is the difference between the estimated fair value of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities. The changes in market value of assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates reflect the interest sensitivity of those assets and liabilities as their values are derived from the characteristics of the asset or liability (i.e., fixed rate, adjustable rate, caps, floors) relative to the current interest rate environment. For example, in a rising interest rate environment the fair market value of a fixed rate asset will decline, whereas the fair market value of an adjustable rate asset, depending on its repricing characteristics, may not decline. Increases in the market value of assets will increase the present value of equity whereas decreases in the market value of assets will decrease the present value of equity. Conversely, increases in the market value of liabilities will decrease the present value of equity whereas decreases in the market value of liabilities will increase the present value of equity. The following table presents the estimated present value of equity over a range of interest rate change scenarios at December 31, 2007. The present value ratio shown in the table is the present value of equity as a percent of the present value of total assets in each of the different rate environments. Our current policy sets a minimum ratio of the present value of equity to the fair value of assets in the current interest rate environment (no rate shock) of 8.00%, a minimum present value ratio of 6.50% in the plus 200 basis point interest rate shock scenario and a minimum present value ratio of 7.00% in the minus 100 basis point scenario. Present Value of Equity As Percent of Present Value of Assets Change in Present Basis Point Interest Rates Value Ratio Change (Basis points) 200 6.55 % (290 ) 100 8.55 (90 ) 0 9.45 (100) 8.10 (135 ) In the 200 basis point increase scenario, the present value ratio was 6.55% at December 31, 2007 as compared to 11.79% at December 31, 2006. The change in the present value ratio was negative 290 basis points at December 31, 2007 as compared to a negative 364 basis points at December 31, 2006. The decrease in the present value ratio, year over year, partially reflects the decrease in our equity to asset ratio to 10.38% from 13.89% over the same time periods. The decrease in the sensitivity reflects the lower current market interest rate environment resulting in less anticipated calls of our borrowed funds. Page 80 Table of Contents In the 100 basis point decrease scenario, the present value ratio was 8.10% at December 31, 2007 as compared to 13.29% at December 31, 2006. The change in the present value ratio was negative 135 basis points at December 31, 2007 as compared to a negative 214 basis points at December 31, 2006. The decrease in the present value ratio, year over year, reflects the decrease in our equity to asset ratio over the same time periods. The slight decrease in the sensitivity in the minus 100 basis point rate change scenario reflects the low current market interest rate environment. The methods we used in simulation modeling are inherently imprecise. This type of modeling requires that we make assumptions that may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. For example, we assume the composition of the interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will remain constant over the period being measured and that all interest rate shocks will be uniformly reflected across the yield curve, regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing. The table assumes that we will take no action in response to the changes in interest rates. In addition, prepayment estimates and other assumptions within the model are subjective in nature, involve uncertainties, and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Accordingly, although the previous two tables may provide an estimate of our interest rate risk at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in interest rates on our net interest income or present value of equity. Gap Analysis. The matching of the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring a financial institutions interest rate sensitivity gap. An asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period. The interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period. A gap is considered negative when the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a specific time period exceeds the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within that same period. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period exceeds the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period. During a period of rising interest rates, a financial institution with a negative gap position would be expected, absent the effects of other factors, to experience a greater increase in the costs of its interest bearing liabilities relative to the yields of its interest earning assets and thus a decrease in the institutions net interest income. An institution with a positive gap position would be expected, absent the effect of other factors, to experience the opposite result. Conversely, during a period of falling interest rates, a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to reduce net interest income. The following table presents the amounts of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at December 31, 2007, which we anticipate to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown. Except for prepayment activity and non maturity deposit decay rates, we determined the amounts of assets and liabilities that reprice or mature during a particular period in accordance with the earlier of the term to rate reset or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability. For purposes of this table, assumptions used in decay rates and prepayment activity are similar to those used in the preparation of our simulation model. Callable investment securities and borrowed funds are reported at the anticipated call date, for those that are callable within one year, or at their contractual maturity date. We reported $1.1 billion of investment securities and $350.0 million of borrowings at their anticipated call date. We have excluded non accrual mortgage loans of $73.8 million and non accrual other loans of $956,000 from the table.

The lower negative cumulative one year gap primarily reflects the decrease in the amounts of borrowed funds we anticipate to be called within the next twelve months and an increase in the amount of investment securities we anticipate to be called within the next twelve month period. The methods used in the gap table are also inherently imprecise. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Certain assets, such as adjustable rate loans and mortgage backed securities, have features that limit changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the loan. If interest rates change, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate from those assumed in calculating the table. Finally, the ability of borrowers to make payments on their adjustable rate loans may decrease if interest rates increase. Page 82 Table of Contents
