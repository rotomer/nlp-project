Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Hudson City Bancorps Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, and the other statistical data provided elsewhere in this document. Executive Summary We continue to focus on our traditional thrift business model by growing our franchise through the origination and purchase of one to four family mortgage loans and funding this loan production with borrowings and growth in deposit accounts. Our results of operations depend primarily on net interest income, which, in part, is a direct result of the market interest rate environment. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets, primarily mortgage loans, mortgage backed securities and investment securities, and the interest we pay on our interest bearing liabilities, primarily time deposits, interest bearing transaction accounts and borrowed funds. Net interest income is affected by the shape of the market yield curve, the timing of the placement and repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities on our balance sheet, the prepayment rate on our mortgage related assets and the calls of our borrowings. Our results of operations may also be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions, particularly those with respect to changes in market interest rates, credit quality, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. Our results are also affected by the market price of our stock, as the expense of our employee stock ownership plan is related to the current price of our common stock. During 2008, the national economy continued to falter with particular emphasis on the deterioration of the housing and real estate markets. During 2008, it became widely accepted that the United States economy had entered a recession by the first quarter of 2008. The faltering economy has been marked by contractions in the availability of business and consumer credit, increases in borrowing rates, falling home prices and increasing levels of home foreclosures and unemployment. In response, the FOMC decreased the overnight lending rate by 400 to 425 basis points during 2008 to a target rate of 0.00% to 0.25%. This unprecedented decrease in the overnight lending rate was in response to the continued liquidity crisis in the credit markets as well as an attempt to stimulate the housing markets and the overall economy. As a result, short term market interest rates decreased during 2008. The sharp decline in short term interest rates during 2008 lowered our deposit and borrowing costs. Longer term market interest rates also decreased during 2008, but at a slower pace than short term interest rates and, as a result, the yield curve continued to steepen. Notwithstanding the decrease in long term market interest rates noted above, mortgage rates maintained a wider credit spread relative to U.S. Treasury securities resulting in higher yields on our mortgage loans. As a result, our net interest rate spread and net interest margin increased as compared to both the fourth quarter and full year 2007. Recent actions by the Federal Reserve to purchase securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have resulted in a decrease in mortgage rates late in the fourth quarter of 2008 and continuing into January 2009. The disruption and volatility in the financial and capital markets over the past year has recently reached a crisis level as national and global credit markets ceased to function effectively. Financial entities across the spectrum have been affected by the lack of liquidity and continued credit deterioration. The difficulties in the financial services market have been marked by the failure, near failure or sale at depressed valuations of some of the nations largest institutions such as Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch and Wachovia. Concern for the stability of the banking and financial systems reached a magnitude which has resulted in unprecedented government intervention on a global scale. At a domestic level, on Page 60 Table of Contents October 3, 2008, the EESA was signed into law providing for, among other things, $700 billion in funding to the U.S. Treasury to purchase troubled assets from financial institutions. Then, on October 14, 2008, the Treasury, the FRB, and the FDIC issued a joint statement announcing additional steps aimed at stabilizing the financial markets. First, the Treasury announced the CPP which allows qualifying financial institutions to sell preferred shares to the Treasury. Second, the FDIC announced the TLGP, enabling the FDIC to temporarily guarantee the senior debt of all FDIC insured institutions and certain holding companies, as well as fully insure all deposits in non interest bearing transaction accounts. Third, to further increase access to funding for businesses in all sectors of the economy, the FRB announced further details of the CPFF, which provides a broad backstop for the commercial paper market. These actions were intended to restore confidence in the banking system, ease liquidity concerns and stabilize the rapidly deteriorating economy. Eligible institutions were covered under the TLGP at no cost for the first 30 days. Institutions that did not want to continue to participate in one or both parts of the TLGP had to notify the FDIC of their election to opt out on or before December 5, 2008. Institutions that did not opt out will be subject to a fee of 50 to 100 basis points per annum based on the length of maturity of senior unsecured debt issued and a 10 basis point surcharge will be added to the institutions current insurance assessment for balances in non interest bearing transaction accounts that exceed the existing deposit insurance limit of $250,000. We participated in the TLGP to fully insure all non interest bearing transaction accounts. We did not participate in any of the other TLGP programs. Congress has held hearings on implementation of the CPP and the use of funds and may adopt further legislation impacting financial institutions that obtain funding under the CPP or changing lending practices that legislators believe led to the current economic situation. On January 21, 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives approved legislation amending the TARP provisions of EESA to include quarterly reporting requirements with respect to lending activities, examinations by an institutions primary federal regulator of use of funds and compliance with program requirements, restrictions on acquisitions by depository institutions receiving TARP funds, authorization for U.S. Treasury to have an observer at board meetings of recipient institutions, and stricter executive compensation limitations, among other things. Although it is unclear whether this legislation will be enacted into law, its provisions, or similar ones, may be imposed administratively by the U.S. Treasury. Such provisions could affect our lending or increase governmental oversight of our businesses and our corporate governance practices. On February 10, 2009, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner in a statement to the Senate Banking Committee Hearing outlined a Financial Stability Plan to restore stability to the U.S. financial system. In the address, Secretary Geithner discussed the Obama Administrations strategy to strengthen the U.S. economy by getting credit flowing again to families and businesses, while imposing new measures and conditions to strengthen accountability, oversight and transparency in how taxpayer dollars are spent. The Financial Stability Plan includes: (i) the creation of a public/private partnership to purchase non performing, illiquid legacy assets from financial institutions; (ii) the creation of a forward looking supervisory regime, including a financial stress test to assist institutions in managing their balance sheets and ensuring adequate capitalization; (iii) the creation of a comprehensive housing program to forestall foreclosures and stabilize the residential mortgage market; (iv) the expansion of the Term Asset Backed Securities Lending Facility; and (v) the creation of a small business and community lending initiative. However, many of the details of the Financial Stability Plan still have to be developed. On February 11, 2009, the OTS urged OTS regulated institutions to suspend foreclosures on owner occupied homes until the Financial Stability Plans home loan modification program is finalized in the next few weeks. On January 27, 2008, the House Judiciary Committee approved the Bankruptcy Legislation. The Bankruptcy Legislation would grant a judge the ability to modify the terms of a mortgage for a homeowner in chapter 13 bankruptcy. Under the proposed Bankruptcy Legislation, borrowers would be eligible to have a bankruptcy judge reduce the principal balance on their home loan. If any such borrower resells their home within five years, the borrower will have to share the proceeds with their lender. Page 61 Table of Contents We are currently well capitalized and continue to lend in our markets. We did not participate in any of the new programs noted above other than the provisions of the TLGP to fully insure all non interest bearing customer transaction accounts. Net income amounted to $445.6 million for 2008, as compared to $295.9 million for 2007. For the year ended December 31, 2008, our return on average assets and average stockholders equity were 0.91% and 9.36%, respectively, as compared to 0.74% and 6.23% for 2007. The increases in our return on average equity and average assets are due primarily to the increase in our net income during 2008 as compared to 2007. Net interest income increased $294.8 million, or 45.6%, to $942.0 million for the 2008 as compared to $647.2 million for 2007. During 2008, our net interest rate spread increased 46 basis points to 1.57% and our net interest margin increased 31 basis points to 1.96% as compared to 2007. The increases in our net interest rate spread and net interest margin were due to a steeper yield curve which allowed us to reduce deposit costs while mortgage yields remained stable. The provision for loan losses amounted to $19.5 million for 2008 as compared to $4.8 million for 2007. The increase in the provision for loan losses reflects the risks inherent in our loan portfolio due to decreases in real estate values in our lending markets, the increase in non performing loans, the increase in loan charge offs, increasing unemployment rates, the current economic conditions and the overall growth of our loan portfolio. Non performing loans were $217.6 million or 0.74% of total loans at December 31, 2008 as compared to $79.4 million or 0.33% of total loans at December 31, 2007. The increase in non performing loans reflects the economic recession coupled with the continued deterioration of the housing market. The conditions in the housing market are evidenced by declining house prices, reduced levels of home sales, increasing inventories of houses on the market, and an increase in the length of time houses remain on the market. Total non interest expense increased $30.2 million, or 18.0%, to $198.1 million for 2008 from $167.9 million for 2007. The increase is primarily due to a $20.6 million increase in compensation and employee benefits expense and a $5.9 million increase in other non interest expense. The increases in non interest expenses were due primarily to various operating expenses related to the growth of our branch network and our increased retail loan production. At December 31, 2008 we had 127 branches as compared to 119 at December 31, 2007. We have been able to grow our assets by 21.9% to $54.15 billion at December 31, 2008 from $44.42 billion at December 31, 2007, by originating and purchasing mortgage loans and purchasing mortgage backed securities. Loans increased $5.24 billion to $29.44 billion at December 31, 2008 from $24.20 billion at December 31, 2007. While the residential real estate markets have weakened considerably during the past year, our competitive rates and the decreased lending competition have resulted in increased origination activity. Total securities increased $4.21 billion to $22.95 billion at December 31, 2008 from $18.74 billion at December 31, 2007. The increase in securities was primarily due to purchases of mortgage backed and investment securities of $7.18 billion and $2.10 billion, respectively, partially offset by principal collections on mortgage backed securities of $2.31 billion and calls of investment securities of $2.81 billion. The increase in our total assets was funded primarily by an increase in borrowings and customer deposits. Borrowed funds increased $6.09 billion to $30.23 billion at December 31, 2008 from $24.14 billion at December 31, 2007. Deposits increased $3.31 billion to $18.46 billion at December 31, 2008 from $15.15 Page 62 Table of Contents billion at December 31, 2007. The additional borrowed funds were used primarily to fund our asset growth. The increase in deposits was attributable to growth in our time deposits and money market accounts. The increase in these accounts was a result of our competitive pricing strategies that focused on attracting these types of deposits as well as customer preferences for time deposits rather than other types of deposit accounts. In addition, we believe the turmoil in the credit and equity markets has made deposit products in strong financial institutions desirable for many customers. Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 During 2008, our total assets increased $9.73 billion, or 21.9%, to $54.15 billion at December 31, 2008 from $44.42 billion at December 31, 2007. Loans increased $5.24 billion, or 21.7%, to $29.44 billion at December 31, 2008 from $24.20 billion at December 31, 2007 due primarily to the origination of one to four family first mortgage loans in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut and our continued loan purchase activity. For 2008, we originated $5.04 billion and purchased $3.06 billion of loans, compared to originations of $3.35 billion and purchases of $3.97 billion for 2007. The origination and purchases of loans were partially offset by principal repayments of $2.82 billion in 2008 as compared to $2.19 billion for 2007. While the residential real estate markets have deteriorated during the past year, our competitive rates and the decreased mortgage lending competition have resulted in increased retail origination activity for 2008. The overall decrease in the purchase of mortgage loans was due primarily to the continued reduction of activity in the secondary residential mortgage market as a result of the disruption and volatility in the financial and capital marketplaces. Our first mortgage loan originations and purchases during 2008 were substantially all in one to four family mortgage loans. Approximately 58.0% of mortgage loan originations for 2008 were variable rate loans as compared to approximately 47.0% for 2007. Substantially all purchased mortgage loans during the year ended December 31, 2008 were fixed rate loans since variable rate loans available for purchase are typically outside of our defined geographic parameters and include features, such as option ARMs, that do not meet our underwriting standards. Fixed rate mortgage loans accounted for 75.7% of our first mortgage loan portfolio at December 31, 2008 and 80.5% at December 31, 2007. Total mortgage backed securities increased $4.92 billion to $19.49 billion at December 31, 2008 from $14.57 billion at December 31, 2007. This increase in total mortgage backed securities resulted from the purchase of $7.18 billion of mortgage backed securities, all of which were issued by U.S. government sponsored enterprises. The increase was partially offset by repayments of $2.31 billion. At December 31, 2008, variable rate mortgage backed securities accounted for 83.5% of our portfolio compared with 82.3% at December 31, 2007. The purchase of variable rate mortgage backed securities is a component of our interest rate risk management strategy. Since a substantial portion of our loan production consists of fixed rate mortgage loans, the purchase of variable rate mortgage backed securities provides us with an asset that reduces our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Total investment securities decreased $710.3 million to $3.46 billion at December 31, 2008 as compared to $4.17 billion at December 31, 2007. Investment securities held to maturity decreased $1.36 billion partially offset by a $648.1 million increase in investment securities available for sale. The decrease in total investment securities was the result of calls of held to maturity and available for sale investment securities of $1.36 billion and $1.45 billion, respectively. The calls were partially offset by purchases of investment securities available for sale of $2.10 billion for 2008. Page 63 Table of Contents Total cash and cash equivalents increased $44.3 million to $261.8 million at December 31, 2008 as compared to $217.5 million at December 31, 2007. Accrued interest receivable increased $53.9 million, primarily due to increased balances in loans and investments. Total liabilities increased $9.40 billion, or 23.6%, to $49.21 billion at December 31, 2008 from $39.81 billion at December 31, 2007. The increase in total liabilities primarily reflected a $6.09 billion increase in borrowed funds and a $3.31 billion increase in deposits. Total deposits amounted to $18.46 billion at December 31, 2008 as compared to $15.15 billion at December 31, 2007. The increase in total deposits reflected a $2.21 billion increase in our time deposits and a $1.14 billion increase in our money market checking accounts. The increase in our time deposits and money market checking accounts reflects our competitive pricing, our branch expansion and customer preference for these types of deposits. At December 31, 2008 we had 127 branches as compared to 119 at December 31, 2007. In addition, we believe that the turmoil in the credit and equity markets has made deposit products in strong financial institutions desirable for many customers. Borrowings amounted to $30.23 billion at December 31, 2008 as compared to $24.14 billion at December 31, 2007. The increase in borrowed funds was the result of $6.65 billion of new borrowings at a weighted average rate of 2.99%, partially offset by repayments of $566.0 million with a weighted average rate of 3.05%. The new borrowings primarily have final maturities of ten years and initial reprice dates of one to three years. In addition, we also borrowed $600.0 million with maturities of less than one year. The additional borrowed funds were used primarily to fund our asset growth. Borrowed funds at December 31, 2008 were comprised of $15.13 billion of FHLB advances and $15.10 billion of securities sold under agreements to repurchase. Substantially all of our borrowed funds are callable at the discretion of the issuer after an initial non call period. As a result, if interest rates were to decrease, these borrowings would probably not be called and our average cost of existing borrowings would not decrease even as market interest rates decrease. Conversely, if interest rates increase above the market interest rate for similar borrowings, these borrowings would likely be called at their next call date and our cost to replace these borrowings would increase. These call features are generally quarterly, after an initial non call period of three months to five years from the date of borrowing. Our callable borrowings typically have a final maturity of ten years and may not be called for an initial period of one to five years. We use this type of borrowing primarily to fund our loan growth because they have a longer duration than shorter term non callable borrowings and have a slightly lower cost than a non callable borrowing with a maturity date similar to the first call date of the callable borrowing. During the current period of credit instability we may not be able to borrow in this manner. We believe that we will continue to be able to borrow from the same institutions as in the past, but structured callable borrowings may not be available. In order to fund our growth and provide for our liquidity we may need to borrow short term, that is, borrowings with three to six month maturities. These borrowings are typically at lower interest rates than longer term callable borrowings and, as a result, may decrease our borrowing costs. However, using short term borrowings may increase our interest rate risk, especially if market interest rates were to increase. While we will utilize these short term borrowings while the current conditions exist in the credit markets, we intend to use structured callable borrowings when these types of borrowings become available. The Company has two collateralized borrowings in the form of repurchase agreements totaling $100.0 million with Lehman Brothers, Inc. Lehman Brothers, Inc. is currently in liquidation under the Securities Industry Protection Act. Mortgage backed securities with an amortized cost of approximately $114.5 Page 64 Table of Contents million are pledged as collateral for these borrowings. We intend to pursue full recovery of the pledged collateral in accordance with the contractual terms of the repurchase agreements. If full recovery of the collateral does not occur, we will be pursuing a customer claim against the Lehman Brothers, Inc. estate for the $14.5 million difference between the amortized cost of the securities and the amount of the underlying borrowings. There can be no assurances that the final settlement of this transaction will result in the full recovery of the collateral or the full amount of the claim. We have not recognized a loss in our financial statements related to these repurchase agreements. Due to brokers amounted to $239.1 million at December 31, 2008 as compared to $281.9 million at December 31, 2007. Due to brokers at December 31, 2008 represents securities purchased in the fourth quarter of 2008 with settlement dates in the first quarter of 2009. Other liabilities increased to $278.4 million at December 31, 2008 as compared to $236.4 million at December 31, 2007. The increase is primarily the result of an increase in accrued expenses of $39.5 million and accrued interest payable on borrowings of $23.3 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in accrued taxes of $20.3 million. The increase in accrued expenses is due primarily to a $25.4 million increase in accrued pension liabilities that resulted from a decrease in the plans funded status primarily as a result of a decrease in the market value of the plans assets. Total shareholders equity increased $327.5 million to $4.94 billion at December 31, 2008 from $4.61 billion at December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily due to net income of $445.6 million and a $31.0 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income, partially offset by cash dividends paid to common shareholders of $218.0 million. As of December 31, 2008, 54,073,550 shares were available for repurchase under our existing stock repurchase programs. During 2008, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of our outstanding common stock at a total cost of $17.0 million as compared to 40.6 million shares repurchased during 2007 at a total cost of $550.2 million. We repurchased fewer shares in 2008 because we were able to leverage our capital more effectively by growing our balance sheet as the yield curve became steeper. The accumulated other comprehensive income of $47.7 million at December 31, 2008 includes a $74.6 million after tax net unrealized gain on securities available for sale ($126.1 million pre tax) partially offset by a $27.0 million after tax accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the funded status of our employee benefit plans. We invest primarily in mortgage backed securities issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as other securities issued by U.S. government sponsored enterprises. We do not purchase unrated or private label mortgage backed securities or other higher risk securities such as those backed by sub prime loans. In addition, we do not own any common or preferred stock issued by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. There were no debt securities past due or securities for which the Company currently believes it is not probable that it will collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the security. At December 31, 2008, our stockholders equity to asset ratio was 9.12% compared with 10.38% at December 31, 2007. For 2008, the ratio of average stockholders equity to average assets was 9.74% compared with 11.93% for the year 2007. The lower equity to assets ratios reflect our strategy to grow assets and pay dividends. Our book value per share, using the period end number of outstanding shares, less purchased but unallocated employee stock ownership plan shares and less purchased but unvested recognition and retention plan shares, was $10.10 at December 31, 2008 and $9.55 at December 31, 2007. Our tangible book value per share, calculated by deducting goodwill and the core deposit intangible from stockholders equity, was $9.77 as of December 31, 2008 and $9.22 at December 31, 2007. Page 65 Table of Contents Analysis of Net Interest Income Net interest income represents the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets, such as mortgage loans, mortgage backed securities and investment securities, and the expense we pay on interest bearing liabilities, such as time deposits and borrowed funds. Net interest income depends on our volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates we earned or paid on them. Page 66 Table of Contents Average Balance Sheet. The following table presents certain information regarding our financial condition and net interest income for 2008, 2007, and 2006. The table presents the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities for the periods indicated. We derived the yields and costs by dividing income or expense by the average balance of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities, respectively, for the periods shown. We derived average balances from daily balances over the periods indicated. Interest income includes fees that we considered adjustments to yields. Yields on tax exempt obligations were not computed on a tax equivalent basis. Non accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances and therefore have a zero yield. The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred loan origination fees and costs, and purchase premiums and discounts that are amortized or accreted to interest income.

(3) Determined by dividing net interest income by average total interest earning assets. Page 67 Table of Contents Rate/Volume Analysis. The following table presents the extent to which the changes in interest rates and the changes in volume of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected our interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated. Information is provided in each category with respect to: changes attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate); changes attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume); and the net change. The changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to rate. 2008 Compared to 2007 2007 Compared to 2006 Increase (Decrease) Due To Increase (Decrease) Due To Volume Rate Net Volume Rate Net (In thousands) Interest earning assets: First mortgage loans, net $ 296,643 $ 21,417 $ 318,060 $ 257,608 $ 15,303 $ 272,911 Consumer and other loans (597 ) (1,466 ) (2,063 ) 7,455 1,094 8,549 Federal funds sold (1,677 ) (6,321 ) (7,998 ) 4,101 (50 ) 4,051 Mortgage backed securities 277,849 9,254 287,103 171,579 34,331 205,910 Federal Home Loan Bank stock 12,737 (4,220 ) 8,517 14,412 8,573 22,985 Investment securities (85,698 ) 7,799 (77,899 ) (15,627 ) 13,883 (1,744 ) Total 499,257 26,463 525,720 439,528 73,134 512,662 Interest bearing liabilities: Savings accounts (400 ) (445 ) (845 ) (199 ) (1,322 ) (1,521 ) Interest bearing transaction accounts (7,241 ) (4,956 ) (12,197 ) (31,110 ) 815 (30,295 ) Money market accounts 35,760 (9,752 ) 26,008 17,968 8,534 26,502 Time deposits 69,745 (108,290 ) (38,545 ) 122,066 54,088 176,154 Repurchase agreements 131,568 (3,119 ) 128,449 81,563 34,845 116,408 FHLB advances 142,921 (14,865 ) 128,056 184,706 6,758 191,464 Total 372,353 (141,427 ) 230,926 374,994 103,718 478,712 Net change in net interest income $ 126,904 $ 167,890 $ 294,794 $ 64,534 $ (30,584 ) $ 33,950 Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 General. Net income was $445.6 million for 2008, an increase of $149.7 million, or 50.6%, as compared to $295.9 million for 2007. Basic and diluted earnings per common share were $0.92 and $0.90, respectively, for 2008, as compared to $0.59 and $0.58, respectively, for 2007. For 2008, our return on average shareholders equity was 9.36%, compared with 6.23% for 2007. Our return on average assets for 2008 was 0.91% as compared to 0.74% for 2007. The increase in the return on average equity and assets is primarily due to the increase in net income during 2008. Interest and Dividend Income. Total interest and dividend income for 2008 increased $525.7 million, or 24.7%, to $2.65 billion as compared to $2.13 billion for 2007. The increase in total interest and dividend income was primarily due to an $8.88 billion, or 22.6%, increase in the average balance of total interest Page 68 Table of Contents earning assets to $48.10 billion for 2008 as compared to $39.22 billion for 2007. The increase in interest and dividend income was also partially due to an increase of 10 basis points in the weighted average yield on total interest earning assets to 5.52% for 2008 from 5.42% for 2007. Interest on first mortgage loans increased $318.1 million to $1.52 billion for 2008 as compared to $1.21 billion for 2007. This was primarily due to a $5.17 billion increase in the average balance of first mortgage loans to $26.38 billion for 2008 as compared to $21.21 billion for 2007. This increase reflected our continued emphasis on the growth of our mortgage loan portfolio. The increase in first mortgage loan interest income was also due to a 10 basis point increase in the weighted average yield to 5.78%. Notwithstanding the decrease in long term market interest rates noted above, mortgage rates have remained at a wider spread relative to U.S. Treasury securities resulting in higher yields on mortgage loans. Interest on consumer and other loans decreased $2.0 million to $26.2 million for 2008 as compared to $28.2 million for 2007. The average balance of consumer and other loans decreased $9.4 million to $422.1 million for 2008 as compared to $431.5 million for 2007 and the average yield earned decreased 35 basis points to 6.20% as compared to 6.55% for the same periods. Interest on mortgage backed securities increased $287.1 million to $875.0 million for 2008 as compared to $587.9 million for 2007. This increase was due primarily to a $5.30 billion increase in the average balance of mortgage backed securities to $16.69 billion during 2008 as compared to $11.39 billion for 2007, and an 8 basis point increase in the weighted average yield to 5.24%. The increases in the average balances of mortgage backed securities were due to purchases of variable rate mortgage backed securities as part of our interest rate risk management strategy. Since a substantial portion of our loan production consists of fixed rate mortgage loans, the purchase of variable rate mortgage backed securities provides us with an asset that reduces our exposure to interest rate fluctuations while providing a source of cash flow from monthly principal and interest payments. The increase in the weighted average yields for 2008 on mortgage backed securities is a result of the purchase of new securities during the second half of 2007 and the first half of 2008 when market interest rates were higher than the yield earned on the existing portfolio. Interest on investment securities decreased $77.9 million to $176.2 million during 2008 as compared to $254.1 million for 2007. This decrease was due primarily to a $1.76 billion decrease in the average balance of investment securities to $3.60 billion for 2008 as compared to $5.36 billion for 2007. The decrease in the average balance of investment securities was due to increased call activity as a result of the decrease in market rates of securities with a shorter duration during 2008. The average yield on investment securities increased 15 basis points to 4.89% during 2008. Dividends on FHLB stock increased $8.5 million, or 21.5%, to $48.0 million for 2008 as compared to $39.5 million for 2007. This increase was due to a $204.3 million increase in the average balance to $790.3 million for 2008 as compared to $586.0 million for 2007. The increase was partially offset by a 67 basis point decrease in the average yield to 6.07% as compared to 6.74% for 2007. In January 2009, the FHLB declared a regular quarterly dividend of 1.09% as compared to a 3.50% dividend in the fourth quarter of 2008. As a result of the reduced dividend yield, we recorded dividend income on FHLB stock of $2.3 million in January 2009 as compared to $7.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2008. In January 2009, the FHLB announced that it might declare a supplemental dividend of 1.9% later in the first quarter of 2009. This supplemental dividend was subsequently declared on February 26, 2009. At the present time, we cannot predict the future amount of dividends that the FHLB will pay, the timing of any changes in the dividend yield or whether the FHLB will continue to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. Page 69 Table of Contents Interest Expense. Total interest expense for 2008 increased $230.9 million, or 15.6%, to $1.71 billion as compared to $1.48 billion for 2007. This increase was primarily due to an $8.92 billion, or 26.0%, increase in the average balance of total interest bearing liabilities to $43.28 billion for 2008 compared with $34.36 billion for 2007. The increase in the average balance of total interest bearing liabilities was partially offset by a 36 basis point decrease in the weighted average cost of total interest bearing liabilities to 3.95% for 2008 compared with 4.31% for 2007. Interest expense on our time deposit accounts decreased $38.6 million to $454.2 million for 2008 as compared to $492.8 million for 2007. This decrease was due primarily to a decrease of 100 basis points in the weighted average cost to 3.93%. This decrease was partially offset by a $1.54 billion increase in the average balance of time deposit accounts to $11.55 billion for 2008 from $10.01 billion for 2007. Interest expense on money market accounts increased $26.0 million to $73.2 million for 2008 as compared to $47.2 million for 2007. This increase was due to a $1.05 billion increase in the average balance to $2.23 billion, partially offset by a 72 basis point decrease in the weighted average cost to 3.29%. The increase in our time deposits and money market checking accounts reflects our competitive pricing, our branch expansion and customer preference for short term deposit products. In addition, the turmoil in the credit and equity markets has made deposit products in strong financial institutions desirable for many customers. Interest expense on our interest bearing transaction accounts decreased $12.2 million to $48.4 million for 2008 as compared to $60.6 million for 2007. This decrease was primarily due to a $227.8 million decrease in the average balance to $1.58 billion and a 29 basis point decrease in the average cost to 3.07%. The decrease in the average balance reflects customer preferences for short term time and money market deposit products. Interest expense on borrowed funds increased $256.5 million to $1.13 billion as compared to $873.4 million for 2007 primarily due to a $6.61 billion increase in the average balance of borrowed funds to $27.20 billion as compared to $20.59 billion for 2007. The weighted average cost of borrowed funds decreased 9 basis points to 4.15% for 2008 as compared to 4.24% for 2007. Borrowed funds were used to fund a significant portion of the growth in interest earning assets. The decrease in the average cost of borrowings during 2008 reflected new borrowings in 2008, when market interest rates were lower than existing borrowings and borrowings that were called. Substantially all of our borrowings are callable quarterly at the discretion of the lender after an initial non call period of one to five years with a final maturity of ten years. We anticipate that none of the borrowings will be called in 2009 assuming that market interest rates remain at current levels. Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased $294.8 million, or 45.6%, to $942.0 million for 2008 as compared with $647.2 million for 2007. Our net interest rate spread increased 46 basis points to 1.57% for 2008 from 1.11% for 2007. Our net interest margin increased 31 basis points to 1.96% from 1.65% for the same respective periods. The increase in our net interest margin and net interest rate spread was primarily due to the increase in the weighted average yield on interest earning assets and a decrease in the weighted average cost of interest bearing liabilities. The decreases in market interest rates that began during the second half of 2007 and continued through 2008 allowed us to lower the cost of our deposits while the yields on our mortgage related assets remained stable. As a result, our net interest rate margin and net interest rate spread increased during 2008. Page 70 Table of Contents Provision for Loan Losses. The provision for loan losses amounted to $19.5 million for 2008 as compared to $4.8 million for 2007. The allowance for loan losses amounted to $49.8 million and $34.7 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We recorded our provision for loan losses during 2008 based on our allowance for loan losses methodology that considers a number of quantitative and qualitative factors, including the amount of non performing loans, which increased to $217.6 million at December 31, 2008 as compared to $79.4 million at December 31, 2007. The higher provision for loan losses during 2008 reflects the risks inherent in our loan portfolio due to weakening real estate markets, the increases in non performing loans and net charge offs and the overall growth in the loan portfolio. See Critical Accounting Policies Allowance for Loan Losses. Due to the homogeneous nature of our loan portfolio, our evaluation of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses is performed substantially on a pooled basis. A component of our methodology includes assigning potential loss factors to the payment status of multiple residential loan categories with the objective of assessing the potential risk inherent in each loan type. We also consider growth in the loan portfolio in our determination of the allowance for loan losses. These factors are periodically reviewed for appropriateness giving consideration to charge off history, delinquency trends, the results of our foreclosed property transactions and market conditions. We use this systematic methodology as a tool, together with qualitative analysis performed by our Asset Quality Committee to estimate the allowance for loan losses. Other key factors we consider in this process are current real estate market conditions in geographic areas where our loans are located, changes in the trend of non performing loans, the current state of the local and national economy, changes in interest rates, the results of our foreclosed property transactions and loan portfolio growth. Any one or a combination of these events may adversely affect our loan portfolio resulting in increased delinquencies, loan losses and future levels of provisions. Our primary lending emphasis is the origination and purchase of one to four family first mortgage loans on residential properties and, to a lesser extent, second mortgage loans on one to four family residential properties. Our loan growth was primarily concentrated in one to four family mortgage loans with original loan to value ratios of less than 80%. The average loan to value ratio of our 2008 first mortgage loan originations and our total first mortgage loan portfolio was 60% and 61%, respectively using the appraised value at the time of origination. The value of the property used as collateral for our loans is dependent upon local market conditions. As part of our estimation of the allowance for loan losses, we monitor changes in the values of homes in each market using indices published by various organizations. Based on our analysis of the data for 2008, we concluded that home values in the Northeast quadrant of the United States, where most of our lending activity occurs, deteriorated during 2007 and 2008 as evidenced by reduced levels of sales, increasing inventories of houses on the market, declining house prices and an increase in the length of time houses remain on the market. In addition, general economic conditions in the United States have also worsened and entered a recession by the first quarter of 2008. We considered these trends in economic and market conditions in determining the provision for loan losses also taking into account the continued growth of our loan portfolio. We define the Northeast quadrant of the country generally as those states that are east of the Mississippi River and as far south as South Carolina. At December 31, 2008, approximately 69.7% of our total loans are in the New York metropolitan area. Additionally, the states of Virginia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Michigan and Pennsylvania accounted for 5.5%, 4.3%, 4.2%, 3.0%, 1.8%, 1.7% and 1.5%, respectively of total loans. The remaining 8.3% of the loan portfolio is secured by real estate primarily in the remainder of the Northeast quadrant of the United States. With respect to our non performing loans, approximately 65.3% are in the New York metropolitan area and 4.2%, 3.5%, 5.4%, 2.7%, 3.8%, 3.7% and 1.5% are located in the states of Virginia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Michigan and Pennsylvania, Page 71 Table of Contents respectively. The remaining 9.9% of our non performing loans are secured by real estate primarily in the remainder of the Northeast quadrant of the United States. During 2008, the fallout from the sub prime mortgage market continued and the national economy entered a recession with particular emphasis on the deterioration of the housing and real estate markets. The faltering economy has been marked by contractions in the availability of business and consumer credit, increases in corporate borrowing rates, falling home prices, increasing home foreclosures and unemployment. As a result, the financial, capital and credit markets are experiencing significant adverse conditions. These conditions have caused significant deterioration in the activity of the secondary residential mortgage market and a lack of available liquidity. The disruptions have been exacerbated by the acceleration of the decline of the real estate and housing market. We continue to closely monitor the local and national real estate markets and other factors related to risks inherent in our loan portfolio. We determined the provision for loan losses for 2008 based on our evaluation of the foregoing factors, the growth of the loan portfolio, the recent increases in non performing loans and net loan charge offs and expected growth in non performing loans. As always, we continue to adhere to prudent underwriting standards. At December 31, 2008, first mortgage loans secured by one to four family properties accounted for 98.4% of total loans. Fixed rate mortgage loans represent 75.7% of our first mortgage loans. Compared to adjustable rate loans, fixed rate loans possess less inherent credit risk since loan payments do not change in response to changes in interest rates. In addition, we do not originate or purchase loans with payment options, negative amortization loans or sub prime loans. Non performing loans amounted to $217.6 million at December 31, 2008 as compared to $79.4 million at December 31, 2007. Non performing loans at December 31, 2008 included $207.0 million of one to four family first mortgage loans as compared to $75.8 million at December 31, 2007. The ratio of non performing loans to total loans was 0.74% at December 31, 2008 compared with 0.33% at December 31, 2007. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans and non performing loans was 0.17% and 22.89%, respectively at December 31, 2008 as compared to 0.14% and 43.75%, respectively at December 31, 2007. Loans delinquent 60 to 89 days amounted to $104.7 million at December 31, 2008 as compared to $40.6 million at December 31, 2007. Foreclosed real estate amounted to $15.5 million at December 31, 2008 as compared to $4.1 million at December 31, 2007. As a result of our underwriting policies, our borrowers typically have a significant amount of equity, at the time of origination, in the underlying real estate that we use as collateral for our loans. At December 31, 2008, our non performing mortgage loans had an average loan to value ratio of approximately 68.3% based on the appraised value at the time of origination. Due to the steady deterioration of real estate values, the loan to value ratios based on appraisals obtained at time of origination do not necessarily indicate the extent to which we may incur a loss on any given loan that may go into foreclosure. In January 2009, our non performing loans increased by $37.0 million to $254.6 million. Net charge offs amounted to $4.4 million for 2008 as compared to net charge offs of $684,000 for 2007. The increase in charge offs was primarily related to non performing residential loans for which current appraised values indicated declines in the value of the underlying collateral. Our charge offs on non performing loans have historically been low due to the amount of underlying equity in the properties collateralizing our first mortgage loans. Typically, as a non performing loan approaches foreclosure, the borrower will sell the underlying property or, if there is a subordinated lien eliminating the borrowers equity, the subordinated lien holder would purchase the property to protect its interest resulting in the full payment of principal and interest to Hudson City Savings. In normal markets this process takes 6 to 12 months. However, due to the unprecedented level of foreclosures and the desire by most states to slow the foreclosure process, we are now experiencing a time frame to repayment or foreclosure ranging from 18 to Page 72 Table of Contents 24 months from the initial non performing period. As real estate prices continue to decline, this extended time may result in further charge offs. In addition, current conditions in the housing market have made it more difficult for borrowers to sell homes to satisfy the mortgage and second lien holders are less likely to repay our loan if the value of the property is not enough to satisfy their loan. We continue to monitor closely the property values underlying our non performing loans during this timeframe and take appropriate charge offs when the loan balances exceed the underlying property values. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, commercial and construction loans evaluated for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan amounted to $9.5 million and $3.5 million, respectively. Based on this evaluation, we established an allowance for loan losses of $818,000 for loans classified as impaired at December 31, 2008 compared to $268,000 at December 31, 2007. Although we believe that we have established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at adequate levels, additions may be necessary if future economic and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment. However, the markets in which we lend have experienced significant declines in real estate values which we have taken into account in evaluating our allowance for loan losses. No assurance can be given in any particular case that our loan to value ratios will provide full protection in the event of borrower default. Although we use the best information available, the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate that is subject to significant judgment and short term change. See Critical Accounting Policies. Non Interest Income. Total non interest income was $8.5 million for 2008 compared with $7.3 million for 2007. The increase in non interest income is primarily due to an increase in service charges on deposits as a result of deposit account growth. Non Interest Expense. Total non interest expense increased $30.2 million, or 18.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2008 to $198.1 million compared with $167.9 million during 2007. The increase is primarily due to a $20.6 million increase in compensation and employee benefits expense, a $2.6 million increase in Federal deposit insurance expense and a $5.9 million increase in other non interest expense. The increase in compensation and employee benefits expense included an $8.4 million increase in expense related to our employee stock ownership plan primarily as a result of increases in our stock price, a $6.3 million increase in compensation costs, due primarily to normal increases in salary and additional full time employees for our new branches, and a $2.3 million increase in stock option plan expense. The increase in the Federal deposit insurance expense is the result of an assessment credit that was used to offset 100% of our 2007 deposit insurance assessment of $7.3 million. During 2008, we used the remaining assessment credit of $5.1 million to offset a portion of our 2008 deposit insurance. Included in other non interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 were write downs on foreclosed real estate and net losses on the sale of foreclosed real estate, of $1.3 million as compared to $112,000 for 2007. The FDIC has adopted a final rule increasing risk based assessment rates uniformly by 7 basis points (annualized) for the first quarter of 2009. The FDIC has also proposed changes to take effect beginning in the second quarter of 2009, resulting is an insurance assessment at $2.1 million for the first quarter of 2009. Under the proposed plan the initial base assessment rates will range from 10 to 45 basis points depending on an institutions risk category, with adjustments resulting in increased assessment rates for institutions with a significant reliance on secured liabilities and brokered deposits. For Hudson City Savings Bank, our total assessment rate would be 18 basis points based on the proposed rule. The increased deposit insurance premiums will result in a significant increase in our non interest expense. See Regulation of Hudson City Savings Bank and Hudson City Bancorp. Page 73 Table of Contents Our efficiency ratio was 20.84% for 2008 as compared to 25.66% for the year ended December 31, 2007. Our ratio of non interest expense to average total assets for 2008 was 0.41% as compared to 0.42% for 2007. Income Taxes. Income tax expense amounted to $287.3 million for 2008 compared with $185.9 million for 2007. Our effective tax rate for 2008 was 39.21% compared with 38.59% for 2007. Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 General. Net income was $295.9 million for 2007, an increase of $7.3 million, or 2.5%, compared with net income of $288.6 million for 2006. Basic and diluted earnings per common share were $0.59 and $0.58, respectively, for 2007 compared with $0.54 and $0.53, respectively, for 2006. For 2007, our return on average stockholders equity was 6.23%, compared with 5.70% for 2006. Our return on average assets for 2007 was 0.74% as compared to 0.91% for 2006. The decrease in the return on average assets reflected our balance sheet growth during a period of narrowing net interest rate spreads during 2007. The increase in the return on average equity is due primarily to a $310.1 million decrease in average stockholders equity due primarily to an increase in treasury stock as a result of our stock repurchase program. Interest and Dividend Income. Total interest and dividend income increased $512.7 million, or 31.8%, to $2.13 billion for 2007 as compared to $1.61 billion for 2006. The increase in total interest and dividend income was primarily due to a $7.99 billion, or 25.6%, increase in the average balance of total interest earning assets to $39.22 billion for 2007 as compared to $31.23 billion for 2006. The increase in interest and dividend income was also partially due to an increase of 25 basis points in the weighted average yield on total interest earning assets to 5.42% for 2007 from 5.17% for the comparable period in 2006. Interest and fees on first mortgage loans increased $272.9 million to $1.21 billion for 2007 as compared to $932.6 million for 2006. This increase was primarily due to a $4.52 billion increase in the average balance of first mortgage loans to $21.21 billion for 2007 as compared to $16.69 billion for 2006, which reflected our continued emphasis on the growth of our mortgage loan portfolio. The increase in mortgage loan income was also due to a nine basis point increase in the weighted average yield to 5.68%, reflecting the origination and purchase of mortgage loans during the period of slightly rising intermediate and long term market interest rates during the first half of 2007. Interest income on consumer and other loans increased $8.5 million to $28.2 million for 2007 as compared to $19.7 million for 2006, primarily due to a $114.6 million increase in the average balance of consumer and other loans to $431.5 million and an increase of 33 basis points in the weighted average yield to 6.55%. Interest income on mortgage backed securities increased $205.9 million to $587.9 million for 2007 as compared to $382.0 million for 2006. This increase was due primarily to a $3.37 billion increase in the average balance of total mortgage backed securities to $11.39 billion. The increase in income was also due to a 40 basis point increase in the weighted average yield to 5.16% for 2007 as compared to 4.76% for 2006. The increase in the average balance of mortgage backed securities was due to purchases of variable rate mortgage backed securities as part of our interest rate risk management strategy. Since our primary lending activities are the origination and purchase of fixed rate mortgage loans, the purchase of variable rate mortgage backed securities provides us with an asset that reduces our exposure to interest rate fluctuations while providing a source of cash flow from monthly principal and interest payments. The increase in the weighted average yields on mortgage backed securities is a result of the purchase of new Page 74 Table of Contents securities at higher rates than the existing portfolio as well as the repricing of securities in the existing portfolio. Dividends on FHLB stock increased $23.0 million to $39.5 million for 2007 as compared to $16.5 million for 2006. This increase was due to a $240.2 million increase in the average balance of FHLB stock to $586.0 million and a 197 basis point increase in the average dividend yield to 6.74% for 2007 as compared to 4.77% for 2006. Interest on investment securities decreased $1.8 million to $254.1 million during 2007 as compared to $255.9 million for 2006. This decrease was due to a $339.4 million decrease in the average balance of investment securities to $5.36 billion. The decrease in interest on investment securities was partially offset by a 25 basis point increase in the weighted average yield to 4.74%. Interest Expense. Total interest expense increased $478.7 million, or 47.9%, to $1.48 billion for 2007 from $1.00 billion for 2006. This increase was due primarily to an $8.43 billion, or 32.5%, increase in the average balance of total interest bearing liabilities to $34.36 billion for 2007 compared with $25.93 billion for 2006. The increase in total interest expense was also due to a 45 basis point increase in the weighted average cost of total interest bearing liabilities to 4.31% for 2007 as compared to 3.86% for 2006. This increase in total interest bearing liabilities was used to fund asset growth. The increase in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities for the 2007 reflected a very competitive environment for deposits and a shift within our deposits to higher costing short term time deposits as well as the growth and re pricing of our deposits and borrowings during the higher short term interest rate environment experienced during the second half of 2006 and first half of 2007. Interest expense on our time deposit accounts increased $176.2 million to $492.8 million for 2007 as compared to $316.6 million for 2006. This increase was due to a 66 basis point increase in the weighted average cost to 4.93% and a $2.59 billion increase in the average balance of time deposit accounts to $10.01 billion as compared to $7.42 billion for 2006. Interest expense on money market accounts increased $26.5 million due to a 101 basis point increase in the weighted average cost to 4.01%, reflecting increases in short term interest rates and the competitive pricing of this product, and a $487.9 million increase in the average balance to $1.18 billion. The increases in the average balance of time deposits and money market accounts reflects our growth strategy and includes deposits from the 29 branches added to our network during 2006 and 2007 as well as deposit growth in existing branches. Interest expense on our interest bearing transaction accounts decreased $30.3 million to $60.6 million for 2007 as compared to $90.9 million for 2006 primarily due to a $928.6 million decrease in the average balance to $1.81 billion from $2.73 billion. This decrease was due primarily to customer preferences for short term time deposit products. Interest expense on borrowed funds increased $307.9 million to $873.4 million for 2007 as compared to $565.5 million for 2006. This increase was primarily due to a $6.30 billion increase in the average balance of borrowed funds to $20.59 billion and a 28 basis point increase in the weighted average cost of borrowed funds to 4.24% for 2007 as compared to 3.96% for 2006. We faced significant competition for time deposits from many of our competitors who, during the second half of 2007, sought to raise liquidity by offering customers premium rates on deposits even as market interest rates decreased. As a result, we increased our level of borrowed funds, which we believed to be a more cost effective alternative in the current interest rate environment. The increase in borrowed funds was used to fund the growth in interest earning assets. The increase in the average cost of borrowed funds reflected new borrowings with higher interest rates than existing borrowings that were called. Substantially all of our borrowings are callable at the discretion of the issuer. As a result, as interest rates decrease, these borrowings will probably not be Page 75 Table of Contents called and therefore will not reprice until maturity or until market interest rates increase. As interest rates increase, these borrowings would likely be called at their next call date and our cost to replace these borrowings would be at higher rates than the called borrowing. These call features are generally quarterly, after an initial non call period of three months to five years from the date of borrowing. Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased $34.0 million, or 5.5%, to $647.2 million for 2007 compared with $613.2 million for 2006. Our net interest rate spread decreased 20 basis points to 1.11% for 2007 from 1.31% for 2006. Our net interest margin decreased 31 basis points to 1.65% from 1.96% for the same respective periods. The decrease in our net interest rate margin and net interest rate spread was primarily due to the larger increase in the weighted average cost of interest bearing liabilities compared with the increase in the weighted average yield on interest earning assets. Changes in market interest rates during 2007 resulted in a return to a positively sloped yield curve. However, competitive pricing pressures due in part to the liquidity crisis in the credit markets, prevented us from lowering our deposit costs to the same extent as the decreases in the yield curve and the shift within our deposits to higher costing short term time deposits also contributed to the increase in the average cost of deposits. In addition, while market interest rates decreased, our callable borrowings were not called and therefore did not reprice to lower rates. Provision for Loan Losses. The provision for loan losses amounted to $4.8 million for the year 2007. We did not record a provision for loan losses for 2006. The allowance for loan losses amounted to $34.7 million and $30.6 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We recorded our provision for loan losses during 2007 based on our allowance for loan losses methodology that considers a number of quantitative and qualitative factors, including the amount of non performing loans, which increased to $79.4 million at December 31, 2007 as compared to $30.0 million at December 31, 2006. See Critical Accounting Policies Allowance for Loan Losses. At December 31, 2007, first mortgage loans secured by one to four family properties accounted for 97.95% of total loans. Fixed rate mortgage loans represent 80.5% of our first mortgage loans. Fixed rate loans possess less inherent credit risk since loan payments do not change in response to changes in interest rates. In addition, we do not originate or purchase loans with payment options, negative amortization loans or sub prime loans. We determined that a provision for loan losses was not required for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 based on our allowance for loan losses methodology that considered a number of quantitative and qualitative factors, including low levels of charge offs. See Critical Accounting Policies Allowance for Loan Losses for a description of this methodology. Net charge offs amounted to $76,000 during 2006. Charge offs were at very low levels as a result of our lending practices and the concentration of one to four family first mortgage loans in our portfolio. As a result of our underwriting policies, our borrowers typically have a significant amount of equity in the underlying real estate that we use as collateral for our loans. When a loan becomes delinquent, the borrower will usually sell the property to satisfy the loan rather than go to foreclosure. Since substantially all of our non performing loans are secured by residential real estate with adequate collateral, we determined that the ratio of the allowance to non performing loans was appropriate. At December 31, 2006, first mortgage loans secured by one to four family properties accounted for 97.4% of total loans. Fixed rate mortgage loans represented 81.0% of our first mortgage loans. The value of the property used as collateral for our loans is dependent upon local market conditions. During 2006, we monitored changes in the values of homes in each market using indices published by various organizations. Based on our analysis of the data for 2006, we concluded that the values of homes in our market areas were stable. As a result, we believe that our loans were adequately collateralized, especially given the loan to value ratios that our underwriting guidelines require at origination. Page 76 Table of Contents Non performing loans amounted to $79.4 million at December 31, 2007 as compared to $30.0 million at December 31, 2006. Non performing loans at December 31, 2007 included $77.8 million of one to four family first mortgage loans as compared to $25.7 million at December 31, 2006. The ratio of non performing loans to total loans was 0.33% at December 31, 2007 compared with 0.16% at December 31, 2006. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans was 43.75% at December 31, 2007 compared with 102.09% at December 31, 2006. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans was 0.14% at December 31, 2007 compared with 0.16% at December 31, 2006. Net charge offs amounted to $684,000 for 2007 as compared to $76,000 for 2006. The increase in charge offs was related to non performing residential loans for which appraised values indicated declines in the value of the underlying collateral. See Item 1 Business Asset Quality. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, loans evaluated for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan amounted to $3.5 million and $3.1 million, respectively. Based on this evaluation, we established an allowance for loan losses of $268,000 for loans classified as impaired at December 31, 2007. We had no allowance for loan losses for impaired loans at December 31, 2006. Non Interest Income. Total non interest income was $7.3 million for 2007 compared with $6.3 million for 2006. The increase in non interest income is primarily due to an increase in service charges on deposits as a result of deposit account growth. Non Interest Expense. Total non interest expense increased $8.9 million, or 5.6%, to $167.9 million for 2007 from $159.0 million for 2006. The increase is primarily due to a $4.6 million increase in net occupancy expense and a $3.2 million increase in compensation and benefits expense. The increase in compensation and benefits expense was due to an increase of $5.7 million in salary expense, a $5.6 million increase in stock benefit plan expense and an $8.4 million decrease in expense related to the ESOP Restoration Plan. The increase in salary expense was due primarily to an increase in the number of employees to staff our new branches as well as normal salary increases. The increase in stock benefit plan expense was primarily due to stock option grants which were made during 2007 and the 2006 option grants which were made in July 2006. During 2007, two former executives ceased to participate in the ESOP Restoration Plan, resulting in the decreased expense related to the plan. The increase in net occupancy expense and other non interest expense is primarily the result of our branch expansion, including the addition of 14 branches from the Sound Federal acquisition in July 2006 as well as growth in the existing franchise. Our efficiency ratio was 25.66% for each of the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. Our ratio of non interest expense to average total assets for 2007 was 0.42% as compared to 0.50% for 2006. Income Taxes. Income tax expense increased $13.9 million to $185.9 million for 2007, from $172.0 million for 2006. Our effective tax rate for 2007 was 38.59% compared with 37.34% for 2006. The increase in the effective tax rate was due primarily to a change in the New Jersey tax code that eliminated the dividends received deduction for dividends paid by our real estate investment trust subsidiary to its parent company. Liquidity and Capital Resources The term liquidity refers to our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to fund loan originations, loan and security purchases, deposit withdrawals, repayment of borrowings and operating expenses. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, borrowings, the proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans and mortgage backed securities, the maturities and calls of investment securities and funds provided by our operations. Deposit flows, calls of investment securities and borrowed funds, and prepayments of Page 77 Table of Contents loans and mortgage backed securities are strongly influenced by interest rates, general and local economic conditions and competition in the marketplace. These factors reduce the predictability of the receipt of these sources of funds. Our membership in the FHLB provides us access to additional sources of borrowed funds, which is generally limited to approximately twenty times the amount of FHLB stock owned. We also have the ability to access the capital markets from time to time, depending on market conditions. Our primary investing activities are the origination and purchase of one to four family real estate loans and consumer and other loans, the purchase of mortgage backed securities, and the purchase of investment securities. These activities are funded primarily by borrowings, deposit growth and principal and interest payments on loans, mortgage backed securities and investment securities. We originated $5.04 billion and purchased $3.06 billion of loans during 2008 as compared to $3.35 billion and $3.97 billion during 2007. While the residential real estate markets have slowed during the past year, our competitive rates and the decreased mortgage lending competition have resulted in increased origination production for 2008. The decrease in the purchases of mortgage loans during 2008 was due primarily to the continued reduction of activity in the secondary residential mortgage market as a result of the disruption and volatility in the financial and capital marketplaces. At December 31, 2008, commitments to originate and purchase mortgage loans amounted to $337.6 million and $219.1 million, respectively as compared to $198.3 million and $669.0 million, respectively at December 31, 2007. Purchases of mortgage backed securities during 2008 were $7.18 billion as compared to $6.83 billion during 2007. The increase in the purchases of mortgage backed securities reflects the growth initiatives we have employed in recent periods as well as our interest rate risk management strategy. We purchased $2.10 billion of investment securities during 2008 as compared to $2.15 billion during 2007. Proceeds from the calls of investment securities amounted to $2.81 billion during 2008 as compared to $3.95 billion for in 2007. During 2008, principal repayments on loans totaled $2.82 billion as compared to $2.19 billion for the 2007. Principal payments on mortgage backed securities amounted to $2.31 billion and $1.91 billion for those same respective periods. These increases in principal repayments were due primarily to the growth of the loan and mortgage backed securities portfolios. As part of the membership requirements of the FHLB, we are required to hold a certain dollar amount of FHLB common stock based on our mortgage related assets and borrowings from the FHLB. During 2008, we purchased a net additional $170.2 million of FHLB common stock compared with net purchases of $250.3 million during 2007. Our primary financing activities consist of gathering deposits, engaging in wholesale borrowings, repurchases of our common stock and the payment of dividends. Total deposits increased $3.31 billion during 2008 as compared to an increase of $1.73 billion for 2007. These increases reflect our growth strategy and competitive pricing. Deposit flows are typically affected by the level of market interest rates, the interest rates and products offered by competitors, the volatility of equity markets, and other factors. We believe the turmoil in the credit and equity markets during 2008 has made deposit products in strong financial institutions desirable for many customers. Time deposits scheduled to mature within one year were $12.48 billion at December 31, 2008. These time deposits have a weighted average rate of 3.61%. We anticipate that we will have sufficient resources to meet this current funding commitment. Based on our deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy, we anticipate that a significant portion of these time deposits will remain with us as renewed time deposits or as transfers to other deposit products at the prevailing interest rate. Page 78 Table of Contents We also used wholesale borrowings to fund our investing and financing activities. New borrowings totaled $6.65 billion, partially offset by $566.0 million in principal repayments of borrowed funds. At December 31, 2008, we had $21.13 billion of borrowed funds with a weighted average rate of 4.17% and with call dates within one year. We anticipate that none of these borrowings will be called assuming current market interest rates remain stable. However, in the event borrowings are called, we anticipate that we will have sufficient resources to meet this funding commitment by borrowing new funds at the prevailing market interest rate, or using funds generated by deposit growth. In addition, we had $600.0 million of borrowings with a weighted average rate of 2.02% that are scheduled to mature within one year. Our borrowings have traditionally consisted of structured callable borrowings with ten year final maturities and initial non call periods of one to five years. During the current period of credit instability we may not be able to borrow in this manner. We believe that we will continue to be able to borrow from the same institutions as in the past, but structured callable borrowings may not be available. In order to fund our growth and provide for our liquidity we may need to borrow short term, that is, borrowings with three to six month maturities. These borrowings are typically at lower interest rates than longer term callable borrowings and, as a result, may decrease our borrowing costs. However, using short term borrowings may increase our interest rate risk, especially if market interest rates were to increase. While we will utilize these short term borrowings while the current conditions exist in the credit markets, we intend to use structured callable borrowings when these types of borrowings become available. We have elected not to participate in the FDICs Debt Guarantee Program which permits the FDIC to guarantee certain newly issued senior unsecured debt prior to June 30, 2009. The FDIC announced that it will soon propose rule changes to the TLGP to extend the maturity of the guarantee from three to up to 10 years where the debt is supported by collateral and the issuance supports new consumer lending. Until the details of this extended program are finalized and published, we cannot determine to what extent, if any, we would participate in this program. The FDIC guaranty would be backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America. We have no plans to issue senior debt; however, the availability of the FDIC guaranty would be expected to enhance our ability to generate additional liquidity should we decide to issue senior debt in the future. Additionally, we have elected not to participate in the CPP. Cash dividends paid during 2008 were $218.0 million. During 2008, we purchased 1,124,262 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $17.0 million. At December 31, 2008, there remained 54,073,550 shares available for purchase under existing stock repurchase programs. The primary source of liquidity for Hudson City Bancorp, the holding company of Hudson City Savings, is capital distributions from Hudson City Savings. During 2008, Hudson City Bancorp received $288.4 million in dividend payments from Hudson City Savings. The primary use of these funds is the payment of dividends to our shareholders and, when appropriate as part of our capital management strategy, the repurchase of our outstanding common stock. Hudson City Bancorps ability to continue these activities is dependent upon capital distributions from Hudson City Savings. Applicable federal law may limit the amount of capital distributions Hudson City Savings may make. At December 31, 2008, Hudson City Bancorp had total cash and due from banks of $205.8 million. At December 31, 2008, Hudson City Savings exceeded all regulatory capital requirements. Hudson City Savings tangible capital ratio, leverage (core) capital ratio and total risk based capital ratio were 7.99%, 7.99% and 21.52%, respectively. Page 79 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Hudson City is a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements, which occur in the normal course of our business, to meet the credit needs of our customers and the growth initiatives of the Bank. These arrangements are primarily commitments to originate and purchase mortgage loans, and to purchase mortgage backed securities. We are also obligated under a number of non cancelable operating leases. The following table summarizes contractual obligations of Hudson City by contractual payment period, as of December 31, 2008. Payments Due By Period Less Than One Year to Three Years to More Than Contractual Obligation Total One Year Three Years Five Years Five Years (In thousands) Mortgage loan originations $ 337,590 $ 337,590 $ $ $ Mortgage loan purchases 219,117 219,117 Mortgage backed security purchases 516,000 516,000 Operating leases 149,776 8,404 17,311 16,925 107,136 Total $ 1,222,483 $ 1,081,111 $ 17,311 $ 16,925 $ 107,136 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend money to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments to fund first mortgage loans generally have fixed expiration dates of approximately 90 days and other termination clauses. Since some commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Hudson City Savings evaluates each customers credit worthiness on a case by case basis. Additionally, we have available home equity, overdraft and commercial/construction lines of credit, which do not have fixed expiration dates, of approximately $134.4 million, $3.0 million, and $15.2 million. We are not obligated to advance further amounts on credit lines if the customer is delinquent, or otherwise in violation of the agreement. The commitments to purchase first mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities had a normal period from trade date to settlement date of approximately 60 days. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions are Participating Securities, which addresses whether such instruments are participating securities prior to vesting and, therefore, need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share (EPS) under the two class method described in SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share. The FSP concluded that unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of EPS pursuant to the two class method. Our restricted stock awards are considered participating securities. FSP No. EITF 03 6 1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those years. All prior period EPS data presented shall be adjusted retrospectively to conform with the provisions of the FSP. Early application is not permitted. FSP No. EITF 03 6 1 is not expected to have a material impact on our computation of EPS. Page 80 Table of Contents In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, which identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We do not expect SFAS No. 162 will have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or financial statement disclosures. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133, which requires enhanced disclosures about an entitys derivative and hedging activities and thereby improves the transparency of financial reporting. SFAS No. 161 requires entities to provide enhanced disclosures about (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS No. 133 and its related interpretations, and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. SFAS No. 161 also requires that objectives for using derivative instruments be disclosed in terms of underlying risk and accounting designation. SFAS No. 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, with early application encouraged. We do not expect SFAS No. 161 will have a material impact on our financial statement disclosures. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Non controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for the non controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS No. 160 clarifies that a non controlling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 160 requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. A parent deconsolidates a subsidiary as of the date the parent ceases to have a controlling financial interest in the subsidiary. If a parent retains a non controlling equity investment in the former subsidiary, that investment is measured at its fair value. The gain or loss on the deconsolidation of the subsidiary is measured using the fair value of the non controlling equity investment. SFAS No. 160 requires expanded disclosures in the consolidated financial statements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interest of the parents owners and the interests of the non controlling owners of a subsidiary. This includes a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the equity attributable to the parent and the non controlling owners and a schedule showing the effects of changes in a parents ownership interest in a subsidiary on the equity attributable to the parent. SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008 (that is, January 1, 2009, for Hudson City Bancorp). Earlier adoption is prohibited. SFAS No. 160 shall be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which this statement is initially applied, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements. The presentation and disclosure requirements shall be applied retrospectively for all periods. We do not expect SFAS No. 160 will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), (as amended), Business Combinations. SFAS No. 141(R) applies to all transactions or other events in which an entity (the acquirer) obtains control of one or more businesses (the acquiree), including those sometimes referred to as true mergers or mergers of equals and combinations achieved without the transfer of consideration, for example, by contract alone or through the lapse of minority veto rights. SFAS No. 141(R) replaces SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations. This Statement retains the fundamental requirements in SFAS No. 141 that the acquisition method of accounting (which SFAS No. 141 called the purchase method) be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination. SFAS No. 141(R) defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control of one or more businesses in the business combination and establishes the acquisition date as the date that the acquirer achieves control. The scope of SFAS No. Page 81 Table of Contents 141(R) is broader than that of SFAS No. 141, which applied only to business combinations in which control was obtained by transferring consideration. SFAS No. 141(R) retains the guidance in SFAS No. 141 for identifying and recognizing intangible assets separately from goodwill. SFAS No. 141(R) requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at their fair values as of that date, with limited exceptions. This replaces SFAS No. 141s cost allocation process, which required the cost of an acquisition to be allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. SFAS No. 141s guidance resulted in not recognizing some assets and liabilities at the acquisition date, and it also resulted in measuring some assets and liabilities at amounts other than their fair values at the acquisition date. For example, SFAS No. 141 required the acquirer to include the costs incurred to effect the acquisition (acquisition related costs) in the cost of the acquisition that was allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. SFAS No. 141(R) requires those costs to be recognized separately from the acquisition. In addition, in accordance with SFAS No. 141, restructuring costs that the acquirer expected but was not obligated to incur were recognized as if they were a liability assumed at the acquisition date. SFAS No. 141(R) requires the acquirer to recognize those costs separately from the business combination. SFAS No. 141(R) applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. An entity may not apply it before that date. The effective date of SFAS No. 141(R) is the same as that of SFAS No. 160. SFAS No. 141(R) may have a significant impact on our accounting for any business combinations closing after the adoption date. In January 2009, the FASB issued FSP No. EITF 99 20 1 which amends the guidance in Issue No. 99 20 Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased Beneficial Interests and Beneficial Interests That Continue to Be Held by a Transferor in Securitized Financial Assets, to achieve more consistent determination of whether an other than temporary impairment has occurred. This FSP retains and emphasizes the other than temporary impairment assessment guidance and required disclosures in SFAS No. 115, FSP FAS 115 1 and FAS 124 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) Topic 5M, Other Than Temporary Impairment of Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and other related literature. This FSP was effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2008, and should be applied prospectively. Retrospective application to a prior interim or annual reporting period was not permitted. FSP No. EITF 99 20 1 did not have any affect on our financial condition, results of operations or financial statement disclosures. In January 2009, the FASB proposed Staff Position, or FSP FAS 107 b and APB 28 a. This proposed FSP would amend the disclosure requirements in SFAS No.107, Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments", to require disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in interim financial statements as well as in annual financial statements. This FSP would also amend APB No. 28, Interim Financial Reporting, to require such disclosures in all interim financial statements. The proposed FSP would require an entity to disclose in the body or in the accompanying notes of its interim financial statements and its annual financial statements the fair value of all financial instruments, whether recognized or not recognized in the statements of financial position, as required by SFAS No. 107. Fair value information disclosed in the interim period notes would be presented together with the related carrying amount in a form that makes it clear whether the fair value and carrying amount represent assets or liabilities and how the carrying amount relates to what is reported in the statements of financial position. An entity would also disclose the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments. FSP FAS 107 b and APB 28 a would be effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after March 15, 2009. Page 82 Table of Contents Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices The Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Hudson City Bancorp have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, commonly referred as GAAP. GAAP generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations. Unlike industrial companies, our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature. As a result, changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than do the effects of inflation. Critical Accounting Policies We have identified the accounting policies below as critical to understanding our financial results. In addition, Note 1 to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report contains a summary of our significant accounting policies. We believe our policies with respect to the methodology for our determination of the allowance for loan losses, the measurement of stock based compensation expense and the measurement of the funded status and cost of our pension and other post retirement benefit plans involve a higher degree of complexity and require management to make difficult and subjective judgments which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters. Changes in these judgments, assumptions or estimates could causereported results to differ materially. These critical policies and their application are continually reviewed by management, and are periodically reviewed with the Audit Committee and our Board of Directors. Allowance for Loan Losses The allowance for loan losses has been determined in accordance with GAAP, under which we are required to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2008. We are responsible for the timely and periodic determination of the amount of the allowance required. We believe that our allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover specifically identifiable loan losses, as well as estimated losses inherent in our portfolio for which certain losses are probable but not specifically identifiable. Our primary lending emphasis is the origination and purchase of one to four family first mortgage loans on residential properties and, to a lesser extent, second mortgage loans on one to four family residential properties resulting in a loan concentration in residential first mortgage loans at December 31, 2008. As a result of our lending practices, we also have a concentration of loans secured by real property located primarily in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut. At December 31, 2008, approximately 69.7% of our total loans are in the New York metropolitan area. Additionally, the states of Virginia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Michigan and Pennsylvania accounted for 5.5%, 4.3%, 4.2%, 3.0%, 1.8%, 1.7%, and 1.5%, respectively of total loans. The remaining 8.3% of the loan portfolio is secured by real estate primarily in the remainder of the Northeast quadrant of the United States. Based on the composition of our loan portfolio and the growth in our loan portfolio, we believe the primary risks inherent in our portfolio are the depth of the U.S. recession, unemployment, interest rates in the markets we lend and a continuing decline in real estate market values. Any one or a combination of these events may adversely affect our loan portfolio resulting in increased delinquencies, non performing assets, loan losses and future levels of loan loss provisions. We consider these trends in market conditions in determining the allowance for loan losses. Page 83 Table of Contents Due to the nature of our loan portfolio, our evaluation of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses is performed primarily on a pooled basis. Each month we prepare an analysis which categorizes the entire loan portfolio by certain risk characteristics such as loan type (one to four family, multi family, commercial, construction, etc.), loan source (originated or purchased) and payment status (i.e., current or number of days delinquent). Loans with known potential losses are categorized separately. We assign potential loss factors to the payment status categories on the basis of our assessment of the potential risk inherent in each loan type. These factors are periodically reviewed for appropriateness giving consideration to charge off history, delinquency trends, portfolio growth and the status of the regional economy and housing market, in order to ascertain that the loss factors cover probable and estimable losses inherent in the portfolio. We use this analysis, as a tool, together with principal balances and delinquency reports, to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Other key factors we consider in this process are current real estate market conditions in geographic areas where our loans are located, changes in the trend of non performing loans, the results of our foreclosed property transactions, the current state of the local and national economy, changes in interest rates and loan portfolio growth. Any one or a combination of these events may adversely affect our loan portfolio resulting in increased delinquencies, loan losses and future levels of provisions. We maintain the allowance for loan losses through provisions for loan losses that we charge to income. We charge losses on loans against the allowance for loan losses when we believe the collection of loan principal is unlikely. We establish the provision for loan losses after considering the results of our review as described above. We apply this process and methodology in a consistent manner and we reassess and modify the estimation methods and assumptions used in response to changing conditions. Such changes, if any, are approved by our Asset Quality Committee each quarter. Hudson City Savings defines the population of potential impaired loans to be all non accrual construction, commercial real estate and multi family loans. Impaired loans are individually assessed to determine that the loans carrying value is not in excess of the fair value of the collateral or the present value of the loans expected future cash flows. Smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment, such as residential mortgage loans and consumer loans, are specifically excluded from the impaired loan analysis. We believe that we have established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at adequate levels. Additions may be necessary if future economic and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment. Although management uses the best information available, the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate that is subject to significant judgment and short term change. See Risk Factors The Geographic Concentration Of Our Loan Portfolio And Lending Activities Makes Us Vulnerable To A Downturn in The Economy. Stock Based Compensation We recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value for all awards granted, modified, repurchased or cancelled after January 1, 2006 and for the portion of outstanding awards for which the requisite service was not rendered as of January 1, 2006, in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R). We granted performance based stock options in 2006, 2007 and 2008 that vest if certain financial performance measures are met. In accordance with SFAS No. 123(R), we assess the probability of achieving these financial performance measures and recognize the cost of these performance based grants if it is probable that the financial performance measures will be met. This probability assessment is subjective in nature and may change over the assessment period for the performance measures. Page 84 Table of Contents We estimate the per share fair value of option grants on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model using assumptions for the expected dividend yield, expected stock price volatility, risk free interest rate and expected option term. These assumptions are based on our analysis of our historical option exercise experience and our judgments regarding future option exercise experience and market conditions. These assumptions are subjective in nature, involve uncertainties and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. The Black Scholes option pricing model also contains certain inherent limitations when applied to options that are not traded on public markets. The per share fair value of options is highly sensitive to changes in assumptions. In general, the per share fair value of options will move in the same direction as changes in the expected stock price volatility, risk free interest rate and expected option term, and in the opposite direction of changes in the expected dividend yield. For example, the per share fair value of options will generally increase as expected stock price volatility increases, risk free interest rate increases, expected option term increases and expected dividend yield decreases. The use of different assumptions or different option pricing models could result in materially different per share fair values of options. Pension and Other Post retirement Benefit Assumptions Non contributory retirement and post retirement defined benefit plans are maintained for certain employees, including retired employees hired on or before July 31, 2005 who have met other eligibility requirements of the plans. We adopted SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Post retirement Plans An Amendment of FASB Statements Nos. 87, 88, 106, and 132R as of December 31, 2006. This statement requires an employer to: (a) recognize in its statement of financial condition an asset for a plans overfunded status or a liability for a plans underfunded status; (b) measure a plans assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employers fiscal year; and (c) recognize, in comprehensive income, changes in the funded status of a defined benefit post retirement plan in the year in which the changes occur. The requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employers fiscal year end statement of financial condition became effective for the Company on December 31, 2008. We have historically used our fiscal year end as the measurement date for plan assets and benefit obligations and therefore the measurement date provisions of SFAS No. 158 did not affect us. We provide our actuary with certain rate assumptions used in measuring our benefit obligation. We monitor these rates in relation to the current market interest rate environment and update our actuarial analysis accordingly. The most significant of these is the discount rate used to calculate the period end present value of the benefit obligations, and the expense to be included in the following years financial statements. A lower discount rate will result in a higher benefit obligation and expense, while a higher discount rate will result in a lower benefit obligation and expense. The discount rate assumption was determined based on a cash flow yield curve model specific to our pension and post retirement plans. We compare this rate to certain market indices, such as long term treasury bonds, or the Moodys bond indices, for reasonableness. A discount rate of 5.75% was selected for the December 31, 2008 measurement date and the 2009 expense calculation. For our pension plan, we also assumed a rate of salary increase of 4.00% for future periods. This rate is comparable to actual salary increases experienced over prior years. We assumed a return on plan assets of 8.25% for future periods. We actuarially determine the return on plan assets based on actual plan experience over the previous ten years. The actual return on plan assets was a net loss of 28.2% for 2008. The assumed return on plan assets of 8.25% is based on expected returns in future periods. Our net loss on plan assets during 2008 is a result of the current economic recession and conditions in the equity and credit markets. There can be no assurances with respect to actual return on plan assets in the future. We Page 85 Table of Contents continually review and evaluate all actuarial assumptions affecting the pension plan, including assumed return on assets. For our post retirement benefit plan, the assumed health care cost trend rate used to measure the expected cost of other benefits for 2008 was 9.00%. The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 4.75% for 2016 and remain at that level thereafter. Changes to the assumed health care cost trend rate are expected to have an immaterial impact as we capped our obligations to contribute to the premium cost of coverage to the post retirement health benefit plan at the 2007 premium level. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. General As a financial institution, our primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility. Our net income is primarily based on net interest income, and fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact the level of both income and expense recorded on a large portion of our assets and liabilities. Fluctuations in interest rates will also affect the market value of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, other than those that possess a short term to maturity. The difference between rates on the yield curve, or the shape of the yield curve, impacts our net interest income. During 2008, the national economy continued to falter with particular emphasis on the deterioration of the housing and real estate markets. During the fourth quarter of 2008, it became widely accepted that the United States economy had entered a recession by the first quarter of 2008. The faltering economy has been marked by contractions in the availability of business and consumer credit, increases in borrowing rates, falling home prices and increasing levels of home foreclosures and unemployment. In response, the FOMC decreased the overnight lending rate by 400 to 425 basis points during 2008 to a target rate of 0.00% to 0.25%. This unprecedented decrease in the overnight lending rate was in response to the continued liquidity crisis in the credit markets as well as an attempt to stimulate the housing markets and the overall economy. As a result, short term market interest rates decreased during 2008. The sharp decline in short term interest rates during 2008 lowered our deposit and borrowing costs. Longer term market interest rates also decreased during 2008, but at a slower pace than short term interest rates and, as a result, the yield curve continued to steepen. Notwithstanding the decrease in long term market interest rates noted above, mortgage rates maintained a wider credit spread relative to U.S. Treasury securities resulting in higher yields on our mortgage loans. As a result, our net interest rate spread and net interest margin increased as compared to both the fourth quarter and full year 2007. Recent actions by the Federal Reserve to purchase securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have resulted in a decrease in mortgage rates late in the fourth quarter of 2008 and continuing into January 2009. Due to our investment and financing decisions, the more positive the slope of the yield curve the more favorable the environment is for our ability to generate net interest income. Our interest bearing liabilities generally reflect movements in short and intermediate term rates, while our interest earning assets, a majority of which have initial terms to maturity or repricing greater than one year, generally reflect movements in intermediate and long term interest rates. A positive slope of the yield curve allows us to invest in interest earning assets at a wider spread to the cost of interest bearing liabilities. The impact of interest rate changes on our interest income is generally felt in later periods than the impact on our interest expense due to differences in the timing of the recognition of items on our balance sheet. The timing of the recognition of interest earning assets on our balance sheet generally lags the current market rates by 60 to 90 days due to the normal time period between commitment and settlement dates. In contrast, the recognition of interest bearing liabilities on our balance sheet generally reflects current market Page 86 Table of Contents interest rates as we generally fund purchases at the time of settlement. During a period of decreasing short term interest rates, as was experienced during these past 12 months, this timing difference had a positive impact on our net interest income as our interest bearing liabilities reset to the current lower interest rates. If short term interest rates were to increase, the cost of our interest bearing liabilities would also increase and have an adverse impact on our net interest income. Our borrowings have traditionally consisted of structured callable borrowings with ten year final maturities and initial non call periods of one to five years. During the current period of credit instability we have not been able to borrow in this manner. We believe that we will continue to be able to borrow from the same institutions as in the past, but structured callable borrowings may not be as readily available as they were. In order to fund our growth and provide for our liquidity we may need to borrow short term, that is, borrowings with three to twelve month maturities. These borrowings are typically at lower interest rates than longer term callable borrowings and, as a result, may decrease our borrowing costs. However, using short term borrowings may increase our interest rate risk, especially if market interest rates were to increase. While we will utilize these short term borrowings while the current conditions exist in the credit markets, we intend to use structured callable borrowings when these types of borrowings become available. Also impacting our net interest income and net interest rate spread is the level of prepayment activity on our interest sensitive assets. The actual amount of time before mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities are repaid can be significantly impacted by changes in market interest rates and mortgage prepayment rates. Mortgage prepayment rates will vary due to a number of factors, including the regional economy in the area where the underlying mortgages were originated, availability of credit, seasonal factors and demographic variables. However, the major factors affecting prepayment rates are prevailing interest rates, related mortgage refinancing opportunities and competition. Generally, the level of prepayment activity directly affects the yield earned on those assets, as the payments received on the interest earning assets will be reinvested at the prevailing market interest rate. Prepayment rates are generally inversely related to the prevailing market interest rate, thus, as market interest rates increase, prepayment rates tend to decrease. Prepayment rates on our mortgage related assets have been relatively stable during 2008 despite the decreases in market interest rates. We believe the lack of acceleration of the prepayment rate on these assets reflected the limited availability of credit during this time. Calls of investment securities and borrowed funds are also impacted by the level of market interest rates. The level of calls of investment securities are generally inversely related to the prevailing market interest rate, meaning as rates decrease the likelihood of a security being called would increase. The level of call activity generally affects the yield earned on these assets, as the payment received on the security would be reinvested at the prevailing lower market interest rate. During the first three months of 2008 we saw an increase in call activity on our investment securities as market interest rates decreased. This call activity decreased during the last nine months of 2008 as rates began to stabilize and substantially all of the securities held by us were not callable during this time period. The securities purchased during the first quarter of 2008 to replace those securities that were called were reinvested at similar interest rates by purchasing securities with longer maturities and initial non call periods. The likelihood of a borrowing being called is directly related to the current market interest rates, meaning the higher that interest rates move, the more likely the borrowing would be called. The level of call activity generally affects the cost of our borrowed funds, as the call of a borrowing would generally necessitate the re borrowing of the funds at the higher current market interest rate. During 2008 we experienced limited call activity due to the decrease of market interest rates. Page 87 Table of Contents Management of Interest Rate Risk The primary objectives of our interest rate risk management strategy are to: evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in our balance sheet accounts; determine the appropriate level of interest rate risk given our business plan, the current business environment and our capital and liquidity requirements; and manage interest rate risk in a manner consistent with the approved guidelines and policies set by our Board of Directors. We seek to manage our asset/liability mix to help minimize the impact that interest rate fluctuations may have on our earnings. To achieve the objectives of managing interest rate risk, our Asset/Liability Committee meets weekly to discuss and monitor the market interest rate environment compared to interest rates that are offered on our products. This committee consists of the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Operating Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and other senior officers of the institution as required. The Asset/Liability Committee presents periodic reports to the Board of Directors at its regular meetings and, on a quarterly basis, presents a comprehensive report addressing the results of activities and strategies and the effect that changes in interest rates will have on our results of operations and the present value of our equity. Historically, our lending activities have emphasized one to four family fixed rate first and second mortgage loans, while purchasing variable rate or hybrid mortgage backed securities to offset our predominantly fixed rate loan portfolio. In the past several years, we have originated and purchased a larger percentage of variable rate mortgage related assets in order to better manage our interest rate risk. Variable rate mortgage related assets include those loans or securities with a contractual annual rate adjustment after an initial fixed rate period of one to ten years. These variable rate instruments are more rate sensitive, given the potential interest rate adjustment, than the long term fixed rate loans that we have traditionally held in our portfolio. This growth in variable rate mortgage related assets has helped reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and is expected to benefit our long term profitability, as the rate earned on the mortgage loan will increase as prevailing market rates increase. However, this strategy to originate a higher percentage of variable rate instruments may have an adverse impact on our net interest income and net interest margin in the short term, as variable rate interest earning assets generally have initial interest rates lower than alternative fixed rate investments. Variable rate products constituted 58.3% of loan originations, 9.5% of loan purchases and 87.4% of mortgage backed security purchases made during 2008. In aggregate, 62.1% of our mortgage related asset originations and purchases had variable rates. Of the growth in our total mortgage related assets, 66.2% was due to growth in our variable rate products. In 2009, we intend to originate and purchase similar percentages to 2008 of variable rate mortgage related assets. The strategy to originate and purchase a larger percentage of variable rate assets has lowered our percentage of fixed rate interest earning assets to total interest earning assets to 48.2% at December 31, 2008 from 54.1% at December 31, 2007. Notwithstanding the decrease in the percentage of fixed rate interest earning assets to total interest earning assets, our fixed rate interest earning assets may have an adverse impact on our earnings in a rising rate environment as the interest rate on these interest earning assets would not reprice to current market interest rates as fast as the interest rates on our interest bearing deposits and callable borrowed funds. The current prevailing interest rate environment and the desires of our customers have resulted in a demand for long term hybrid and Page 88 Table of Contents fixed rate mortgage loans. The origination and purchase of these types of mortgage loans may have an adverse impact on our net interest income, particularly in a rising interest rate environment. Our primary sources of funds have traditionally been deposits, consisting primarily of time deposits and interest bearing demand accounts, and borrowings. Our deposits have substantially shorter terms to maturity than our mortgage loan portfolio and borrowed funds. The borrowings have been generally long term to maturity, in an effort to offset our short term deposit liabilities and assist in managing our interest rate risk. These long term borrowings have call options that could shorten their maturities in a changing interest rate environment. If we experience a significant rising interest rate environment where interest rates increase above the interest rate for the borrowings, these borrowings will likely be called at their next call date and our cost to replace these borrowings would likely increase. Of our borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2008, $29.63 billion were structured callable borrowings. Of these, $21.73 billion with a weighted average rate of 4.17% have the contractual right to be called within the next twelve months. Given the current market rate environment, we believe none of these borrowings will be called during the next twelve months. In the current market environment we have borrowed for shorter terms, generally for periods of three to twelve months. These shorter term borrowings are typically at lower interest rates than the longer term callable borrowings and, as a result, may decrease our borrowing costs. However, using short term borrowings may increase our interest rate risk, especially if market interest rates were to increase. While we will utilize these short term borrowings while the current conditions exist in the credit markets, we intend to use structured callable borrowings when these types of borrowings become more readily available. As of December 31, 2008, we had $600.0 million of borrowings with terms to maturity of less than one year. Due to the nature of our operations, we are not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk. Our real estate loan portfolio, the majority of which is located in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut, is subject to risks associated with the local economy. We do not own any trading assets. We did not engage in any hedging transactions that use derivative instruments (such as interest rate swaps and caps) during the year 2008 and did not have any such hedging transactions in place at December 31, 2008. Cash Flow Determination. In preparing the following analyses, we were required to estimate the future cash flows of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. These items are generally reported at their maturity date, subject to assumptions regarding prepayment rates, non maturity deposit decay rates, and the call of certain of our investment securities and borrowed funds. These assumptions can have a significant impact on the simulation model. While we believe our assumptions are reasonable, there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates, assumed calls of securities and borrowed funds, and deposit decay rates will approximate actual future cash flows. Increases in market interest rates may tend to reduce prepayment speeds on our mortgage related assets, as fewer borrowers refinance their loans, and reduce the anticipated calls of our investment securities. At the same time, deposit decay rates and calls of our borrowed funds may tend to increase. If these trends occur, we could experience larger negative percent changes in our model results in the varying rate shock scenarios. The information presented in the following tables is based on the following assumptions: we assumed an annual prepayment rate for fixed rate first mortgage loans using the FHLMC fixed rate index of moderately seasoned loans and an annual prepayment rate for variable rate first mortgage loans using the FHLMC five year balloon index of new loans; Page 89 Table of Contents we assumed an annual prepayment rate for our mortgage backed securities using the prepayment rate associated with the security type; for savings accounts that had no stated maturity, we used decay rates (the assumed rate at which the balance of existing accounts would decline) of: 7.5% in less than six months, 7.5% in six months to one year, 10.0% in one year to two years, 10.0% in two years to three years, 25.0% in three years to five years, and 40.0% in more than five years; for our High Value Checking product, which is included in interest bearing transaction accounts, we used decay rates of: 10.0% in less than six months, 10.0% in six months to one year, 15% in one to two years, 15% in two to three years, 25% in three to five years, and 25% in more than five years; for other interest bearing transaction accounts that had no stated maturity, we used decay rates of : 7.5% in less than six months, 7.5% in six months to one year, 10.0% in one to two years, 10.0% in two to three years, 25.0% in three years to five years, and 40.0% in more than five years; for money market accounts that had no stated maturity, we used decay rates of: 10.0% in less than six months, 10.0% in six months to one year, 20.0% in one to two years, 20.0% in two to three years, 35.0% in three years to five years, and 5.0% in more than five years; callable investment securities are shown at the earlier of their probable call date, maturity date or the next rate adjustment date (step up securities); the model assumed calls of investment securities of $975.0 million over the next year in the current (zero basis point) change scenario; we currently hold $3.25 billion of step up bonds, of which $950.0 million were reported at their next call date; and borrowed funds are shown at the earlier of their probable call date or maturity date given the rate of the instrument in relation to the current market rate environment and the call option frequency; the model assumed there were no calls of borrowed funds over the next year in the current (zero basis point) change scenario. Simulation Model. We use a simulation model as our primary means to calculate and monitor the interest rate risk inherent in our portfolio. This model reports net interest income and the present value of equity in different interest rate environments, assuming an instantaneous and permanent interest rate shock to all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities. We assume maturing or called instruments are reinvested into the same type of product, with the rate earned or paid reset to our currently offered rate for loans and deposits, or the current market rate for securities and borrowed funds. We have not reported the minus 200 basis point or minus 100 basis point interest rate shock scenarios in either of our simulation model analyses, as we believe, given the current interest rate environment and historical interest rate levels, the resulting information would not be meaningful. Net Interest Income. As a primary means of managing interest rate risk, we monitor the impact of interest rate changes on our net interest income over the next twelve month period. This model does not purport to provide estimates of net interest income over the next twelve month period, but attempts to assess the impact of a simultaneous and parallel interest rate change on our net interest income. Page 90 Table of Contents The following table reports the changes to our net interest income assuming 100 and 200 basis point increases in interest rates. Our internal policy sets a maximum change of 40.0% given a positive 200 basis point interest rate shock. Change in Percent Change in Interest Rates Net Interest Income (Basis points) 200 (2.83 )% 100 0.98 The preceding table indicates that at December 31, 2008, in the event of a 200 basis point increase in interest rates, we would expect to experience a 2.83% decrease in net interest income as compared to an 11.01% decrease at December 31, 2007. This 2.83% decrease to net interest income reflects the anticipated calls of borrowed funds in the 200 basis point increase scenario and an increase in expense on our short term time deposits in both increasing interest rate scenarios. Present Value of Equity. We also monitor our interest rate risk by monitoring changes in the present value of equity in the different rate environments. The present value of equity is the difference between the estimated fair value of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities. The changes in market value of assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates reflect the interest sensitivity of those assets and liabilities as their values are derived from the characteristics of the asset or liability (i.e., fixed rate, adjustable rate, caps, floors) relative to the current interest rate environment. For example, in a rising interest rate environment the fair market value of a fixed rate asset will decline, whereas the fair market value of an adjustable rate asset, depending on its repricing characteristics, may not decline. Increases in the market value of assets will increase the present value of equity whereas decreases in the market value of assets will decrease the present value of equity. Conversely, increases in the market value of liabilities will decrease the present value of equity whereas decreases in the market value of liabilities will increase the present value of equity. The following table presents the estimated present value of equity over a range of interest rate change scenarios at December 31, 2008. The present value ratio shown in the table is the present value of equity as a percent of the present value of total assets in each of the different rate environments. Our current policy sets a minimum ratio of the present value of equity to the fair value of assets in the current interest rate environment (no rate shock) of 6.00% and a minimum present value ratio of 4.00% in the plus 200 basis point interest rate shock scenario. Additionally, our current policy sets a maximum basis point change in the plus 200 basis point change scenario of 400 basis points. Present Value of Equity As Percent of Present Value of Assets Change in Present Basis Point Interest Rates Value Ratio Change (Basis points) 200 3.84 % 8 100 4.74 98 0 3.76 Page 91 Table of Contents In the 200 basis point increase scenario, the present value ratio was 3.84% at December 31, 2008 as compared to 6.55% at December 31, 2007. The change in the present value ratio was positive 8 basis points at December 31, 2008 as compared to a negative 290 basis points at December 31, 2007. The current low market interest rate environment has caused an increase in the estimated prepayment speeds and calls on our assets, while extending our callable borrowings to near maturity in the base case. The slight increase of the present value ratio in the 200 basis point increase scenario of 8 basis points from the 3.76% present value ratio in the base case scenario reflects this low market interest rate environment and the extent to which market rates can increase without significant change to our present value of equity. At December 31, 2008 the present value of equity is below our Board established limit, due primarily to the extraordinarily low market interest rates that existed at that time. The methods we used in simulation modeling are inherently imprecise. This type of modeling requires that we make assumptions that may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. For example, we assume the composition of the interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will remain constant over the period being measured and that all interest rate shocks will be uniformly reflected across the yield curve, regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing. The table assumes that we will take no action in response to the changes in interest rates. In addition, prepayment estimates and other assumptions within the model are subjective in nature, involve uncertainties, and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Accordingly, although the previous two tables may provide an estimate of our interest rate risk at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in interest rates on our net interest income or present value of equity. Gap Analysis. The matching of the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring a financial institutions interest rate sensitivity gap. An asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period. The interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period. A gap is considered negative when the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a specific time period exceeds the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within that same period. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period exceeds the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period. During a period of rising interest rates, a financial institution with a negative gap position would be expected, absent the effects of other factors, to experience a greater increase in the costs of its interest bearing liabilities relative to the yields of its interest earning assets and thus a decrease in the institutions net interest income. An institution with a positive gap position would be expected, absent the effect of other factors, to experience the opposite result. Conversely, during a period of falling interest rates, a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to reduce net interest income. The following table presents the amounts of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at December 31, 2008, which we anticipate to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown. Except for prepayment activity and non maturity deposit decay rates, we determined the amounts of assets and liabilities that reprice or mature during a particular period in accordance with the earlier of the term to rate reset or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability. For purposes of this table, assumptions used in decay rates and prepayment activity are similar to those used in the preparation of our simulation model. Callable investment securities and borrowed funds are reported at the anticipated call Page 92 Table of Contents date, for those that are callable within one year, or at their contractual maturity or rate reset date. We reported $975.0 million of investment securities at their anticipated call date. We did not report any of our callable borrowed funds at their next call date. We have excluded non accrual mortgage loans of $210.1 million and non accrual other loans of $626,000 from the table.

The slightly higher negative cumulative one year gap primarily reflects the increase in short term time deposits and short term borrowings placed on our balance sheet during the fourth quarter of 2008. The methods used in the gap table are also inherently imprecise. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Certain assets, such as adjustable rate loans and mortgage backed securities, have features that limit changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the loan. If interest rates change, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate from those assumed in calculating the table. Finally, the ability of borrowers to make payments on their adjustable rate loans may decrease if interest rates increase. Page 93 Table of Contents
