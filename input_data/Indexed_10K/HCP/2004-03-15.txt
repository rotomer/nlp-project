Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Cautionary Language Regarding Forward Looking Statements Statements in this Annual Report that are not historical factual statements are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The statements include, among other things, statements regarding the intent, belief or expectations of Health Care Property Investors, Inc. and its officers and can be identified by the use of terminology such as may, will, expect, believe, intend, plan, estimate, should and other comparable terms or the negative thereof. In addition, we, through our senior management, from time to time make forward looking oral and written public statements concerning our expected future operations and other developments. Readers are cautioned that, while forward looking statements reflect our good faith belief and best judgment based upon current information, they are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from the expectations contained in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors. In addition to the factors set forth under Risk Factors in this Annual Report, readers should consider the following: (a) Legislative, regulatory, or other changes in the health care industry at the local, state or federal level which increase the costs of or otherwise affect the operations of our tenants; (b) Changes in the reimbursement available to our tenants and mortgagors by governmental or private payors, including changes in Medicare and Medicaid payment levels and the availability and cost of third party insurance coverage; (c) Competition for tenants and mortgagors, including with respect to new leases and mortgages and the renewal or rollover of existing leases; (d) Availability of suitable health care facilities to acquire at a favorable cost of capital and the competition for such acquisition and financing of health care facilities; (e) The ability of our tenants and mortgagors to operate our properties in a manner sufficient to maintain or increase revenues and to generate sufficient income to make rent and loan payments; (f) The financial weakness of operators in the long term care and assisted living sectors, including the bankruptcies of certain of our tenants, which results in uncertainties in our ability to continue to realize the full benefit of such operators leases; (g) Changes in tax laws; (h) Changes in national or regional economic conditions, including changes in interest rates and the availability and cost of capital; and (i) The risk that we will not be able to sell or lease facilities that are currently vacant. General Health Care Property Investors, Inc., including its wholly owned subsidiaries and affiliated joint ventures (HCP), generally acquires health care facilities and leases them on a long term basis to health care providers. We also lease medical office space to providers and physicians on a shorter term basis. In addition, we provide mortgage financing on health care facilities. As of December 31, 2003, our portfolio of properties, including those invested in through joint ventures and mortgage loans, consisted of 554 facilities located in 44 states. These facilities are comprised of 31 hospitals, 173 long term care facilities, 124 assisted living and retirement living facilities, 196 medical office buildings and 30 other health care facilities. Our investment in these properties, which represents the historical cost of our real estate investments and the net book value of our unconsolidated joint ventures and secured loans receivable, was approximately $3.4 billion at December 31, 2003. Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates The following are our significant accounting policies and estimates: Revenue Recognition Rental revenue from our tenants is our principal source of revenue. We recognize revenue in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements (SAB 101), as amended. We recognize base rental income on a straight line basis over the term of the related lease when collectibility is deemed probable. Additional rental income based on a percentage of a tenants increased revenue over a specified base period revenue is deferred until the annual (rather than quarterly) base period revenue is exceeded. If we overestimate the collectibility of rental and other income, our financial condition and results of operations could be significantly affected. 26 Table of Contents Allowance For Doubtful Accounts We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants on an ongoing basis. Based on these reviews, we have established provisions and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the possible inability of our tenants to make required rent payments. An allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded as required as a charge to operations in our consolidated statements of operations. The total amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts, which represents the cumulative provisions less writeoffs of uncollectible rent, is recorded against tenant and other receivables on our consolidated balance sheets. If we underestimate the required allowances for doubtful accounts our financial condition and results of operations could be significantly affected. Real Estate Investments We record the acquisition of real estate at cost and allocate the cost of the acquisition to the acquired tangible assets and intangible assets that arise from contractual or other legal rights, including in place leases, based on their respective fair values. The fair value for land and buildings is typically based on appraised value and replacement cost as if vacant, respectively. The fair value of in place leases is determined based on the present value of above or below market rents, tenant origination costs and the net lease income from in place leases over a reasonable lease up period. We compute depreciation on our properties using the straight line method based on an estimated useful life ranging up to 45 years. We compute depreciation on equipment, tenant improvements and lease costs using the straight line method and an estimated useful life ranging up to 10 years or the lease term, whichever is appropriate. If the allocation to building or estimates of useful life of our properties changes, depreciation and amortization expense may change which may impact our results of operations. Investments in Joint Ventures We have adopted Interpretation No. 46 Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities on Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 (FIN 46) for variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003 and consolidate variable interest entities in which we absorb a majority of the entitys expected losses, receive a majority of the entitys expected residual returns, or both, as a result of ownership, contractual or other financial interests in the entity. For entities that do not qualify as variable interest entities, we consolidate those entities that are majority owned and controlled. Since we have not adopted FIN 46 for variable interest entities created before February 1, 2003, we continue to consolidate the accounts of all majority owned and controlled subsidiaries and certain general and limited partnerships created prior to that date. For investments in certain general partnerships and joint ventures created before February 1, 2003 in which we may serve as the general partner or managing member where the other members in these joint ventures have significant voting rights relative to acquisition, sale and refinancing of assets as well as approval rights with respect to budgets, we continue to account for these investments using the equity method of accounting. The accounting policies of these joint ventures are substantially consistent with ours. We are currently evaluating the effects on us, if any, of the adoption of FIN 46 for variable interest entities created before February 1, 2003. Impairment of Long Lived Assets We periodically review long lived assets (primarily real estate, investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and notes receivable) for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The recoverability and determination of the fair value of long lived assets involves significant judgment and is based on an analysis of the future operating results or projected rents for each long lived asset. Properties to be sold are recorded at the lower of cost or expected sales price less costs to sell. Our ability to accurately predict future cash flows may impact the determination of fair value which may significantly impact our results of operations. Discontinued Operations We have reclassified certain facilities operations as Discontinued Operations in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (Statement 144) which was issued in August 2001. Statement 144 established accounting and reporting standards requiring that long lived assets to be disposed of be reported as Discontinued Operations if management has committed to a plan to sell the asset under usual and customary terms within one year of establishing the plan to sell. 27 Table of Contents Stock Options On January 1, 2002, we adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (Statement 123), as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. We adopted the fair value provisions of Statement 123 prospectively so that the fair value of all stock options granted on or after January 1, 2002 is recognized as compensation expense. Since only new grants are accounted for under the fair value method, stock based compensation expense is less than which would have been recognized if the fair value method had been applied to all awards. Our 2001 operating results were not impacted by the adoption of the fair value method. We use the Black Scholes model for calculating the fair value of option grants which requires us to make certain estimates including the expected stock volatility, risk free interest rate, dividend yield and the term of the option. Changes in our estimates could significantly impact our results of operations. Stock Split On January 22, 2004, we announced a 2 for 1 stock split in the form of a stock dividend for each outstanding share of common stock on February 4, 2004. The stock split has been reflected in all periods presented. Results of Operations During the year ended December 31, 2003 we had the following significant developments: We acquired 11 properties for an aggregate purchase price of $189,400,000 in 2003. These properties have an average annual lease rate of 9.7%, based on our cost of the properties. The properties consist of nine assisted and retirement living facilities, one medical office building and one other health care facility. On October 2, 2003, together with HCP Medical Office Portfolio, LLC (HCP MOP), a joint venture that we formed in June 2003 with GE Commercial Finance, we completed the $575,000,000 acquisition of MedCap Properties, LLC, which includes ownership interests in 113 medical office buildings. We are the managing member of HCP MOP and have a 33% economic interest therein. Eight of the acquired medical office buildings, with a cost of $48,181,000, were contributed to a joint venture between us and senior MedCap management. The joint venture issued 1,064,539 units valued at $45.26 each, which are redeemable for cash, or, at our option, common stock beginning October 2, 2004. We sold 27 facilities for an aggregate net sales price of $56,110,000 and a net gain on sale of $12,136,000. We issued 4,000,000 shares of 7.25% Series E and 7,820,000 shares of 7.1% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock at $25.00 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $295,500,000. We redeemed all of our outstanding 7.875% Series A, 8.7% Series B, 8.6% and Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock for an aggregate of $293,040,000. We issued 2,800,000 shares of common stock at a net offering price of $20.75 per share and issued 6,187,800 shares at an average price per share of $19.94 under our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (DRIP), for gross proceeds totaling $181,479,000. We issued $200,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 6.00% Senior Notes due 2015. Interest on these notes is payable semi annually in March and September. Year Ended December 31, 2003 as Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002 Net Income applicable to common shares for the year ended December 31, 2003 totaled $121,849,000 or $0.97 per share on a diluted basis on revenue of $400,183,000. This compares to Net Income applicable to common shares of $112,480,000 or $0.96 per share on a diluted basis on revenue of $349,116,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002. Included in Net Income applicable to common shares for the year ended December 31, 2003 are preferred stock redemption charges of $18,553,000, or $0.15 per share on a diluted basis, a net gain on real estate dispositions of $12,136,000, or $0.10 per share on a diluted basis and property impairments of $13,992,000, or $0.11 per share on a diluted basis. Included in Net Income applicable to common shares for the year ended December 31, 2002, is a net loss on real estate dispositions of $1,129,000, or $0.01 per share on a diluted basis, and property impairments of $9,200,000, or $0.08 per share on a diluted basis. Rental Income attributable to our properties, excluding Medical Office Buildings, for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased 6.7%, or $15,685,000, to $248,773,000. The increase is primarily the result of facility acquisitions made during 2003 and 2002. Medical Office Building Rental Income for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased 12.2%, or $10,869,000, to $99,876,000 with a related increase in Operating Expenses from Medical Office Buildings of 23.4%, or $7,336,000, to $38,694,000. These increases were generated primarily from 2003 and 2002 acquisition and construction activity. Interest and 28 Table of Contents Other Income for the year ended December 31, 2003, increased 86.4%, or $22,544,000 to $48,645,000 as a result of higher interest income levels from the September 2002 loan to ARC as well as a partial prepayment of that loan in September 2003. Equity Income from Unconsolidated Joint Ventures for the year ended December 31, 2003, increased $1,969,000 to $2,889,000 due to the equity income generated from our investment in HCP MOP. Tenet, ARC, Emeritus, Kindred and HealthSouth accounted for 16%, 9%, 5%, 5% and 5% of our 2003 Revenue Less Operating Expenses, respectively. No other single tenant or operator accounts for more than 5% of our Revenue Less Operating Expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003. Interest Expense for the year ended December 31, 2003, increased 17.2%, or $13,331,000, to $90,749,000. The increase is primarily due to the issuance of $200,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 6% long term debt in February 2003 and $250,000,000 of 6.45% long term debt in June 2002. Our investments are primarily financed with fixed rate debt. Changes in interest rates will not have a significant impact to interest expense until our debt matures and must be financed. Real Estate Depreciation from continuing operations increased 7.7%, or $5,640,000, to $79,095,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003 as a result of acquisitions in 2003 and 2002. General and Administrative Expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased 32.0%, or $5,998,000, to $24,731,000. The increase is primarily the result of costs related to vacant properties, an increase in troubled properties, temporary duplicate asset management functions resulting from the acquisition and transition of MedCap Properties, LLC and increased compensation costs. Year Ended December 31, 2002 as Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2001 Net Income applicable to common shares for the year ended December 31, 2002 totaled $112,480,000 or $0.96 per share on a diluted basis on revenue of $349,116,000. This compares to Net Income applicable to common shares of $96,266,000 or $0.89 per share on a diluted basis on revenue of $317,484,000 for 2001. Included in Net Income applicable to common shares for the year ended December 31, 2002, is a net loss on real estate dispositions of $1,129,000, or $0.01 per share on a diluted basis, and property impairments of $9,200,000, or $0.08 per share on a diluted basis. Included in Net Income applicable to common shares for the year ended December 31, 2001 is a net loss on real estate dispositions of $6,248,000 or 0.06 per share on a diluted basis, and property impairments of $6,160,000, or $0.06 per share on a diluted basis, related to the disposal of seven facilities. Rental Income attributable to our properties, other than Medical Office Buildings, for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased 9.0%, or $19,333,000, to $233,088,000. The increase is primarily the result of acquisitions made during 2001 and 2002 which resulted in the addition of 39 facilities. Medical Office Building Rental Income for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased 8.7% or $7,107,000, to $89,007,000 with a related increase in Operating Expenses for Medical Office Buildings of 8.9%, or $2,555,000, to $31,358,000. These increases were generated primarily from 2001 and 2002 acquisition and construction activity which resulted in the addition of 17 facilities. Interest and Other Income for the year ended December 31, 2002, increased 19.6%, or $4,279,000, to $26,101,000 as a result of the new loan to American Retirement Corporation and a loan prepayment fee we collected in the fourth quarter of 2002. Tenet, Emeritus, Kindred and HealthSouth accounted for 18%, 5%, 5% and 5% of our 2002 Revenue Less Operating Expenses, respectively. No other single tenant or operator accounts for more than 5% of our Revenue Less Operating Expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002. Interest Expense for the year ended December 31, 2002, decreased $589,000 to $77,418,000. The decrease is primarily due to the refinancing of approximately $125,000,000 of long term debt with lower rate short term and long term debt. Real Estate Depreciation from continuing operations increased 9.5% or $6,384,000 to $73,455,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002 as a result of the 2002 and 2001 acquisitions. General and Administrative Expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased 42.2%, or $5,558,000, to $18,733,000. The increase is primarily the result of costs related to vacant and troubled properties and increased compensation costs. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flows from operating activities represent the primary source of liquidity to fund distributions. In order to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we must distribute at least 90% of our taxable income to our shareholders. Accordingly, we intend to continue to make regular quarterly distributions to holders of our common and preferred stock. During 2003, we issued dividends totaling $206,166,000 and $18,183,000 to holders of our common and preferred stock, respectively. We believe that our liquidity and sources of capital are adequate to finance our operations for the foreseeable future. Our cash flows from operations are dependent upon the occupancy level of multi tenant buildings and the rental rates on our leases. Material changes in either of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 29 Table of Contents The following reflects the annual impact by year in terms of 2003 Revenues Less Operating Expenses resulting from lease expirations and mortgage loan maturities (Dollar amounts in thousands): Year Revenue(1) Operating Expenses Revenue LessOperatingExpenses (2) Percentage ofRevenue LessOperatingExpenses (2) 2004 $ 14,512 $ 5,627 $ 8,885 2.5 % 2005 21,553 3,619 17,934 5.0 2006 24,707 3,633 21,074 5.8 2007 29,748 3,516 26,232 7.3 2008 51,660 5,305 46,355 12.8 Thereafter 248,196 16,994 231,202 64.0 (1) Table excludes non property specific revenue of $5,622 and equity income and acquisition and management fees earned from HCP MOP of $4,185. (2) Since the tenant is responsible for operating expenses under a triple net lease, management believes revenues are not comparable between property types without deducting our operating expenses for properties leased under gross or modified gross leases. Debt Since our anticipated distributions will not allow us to retain sufficient cash to repay all of our debt as it comes due using only cash flows provided by operating activities, we intend to repay maturing debt with proceeds from debt and or equity offerings. In addition, we anticipate making future investments in facilities, which will be dependent on the availability of cost effective sources of capital. Since the completion of our initial public offering in 1985, we have used the public debt and equity markets as our principle source of financing. Our senior debt is rated BBB+ by both Standard & Poors and Fitch and Baa2 by Moodys and has been rated medium investment grade continuously since 1986, when we first received a bond rating. As of December 31, 2003, we have the following outstanding debt: Revolving Line of Credit We have a revolving line of credit totaling $490,000,000 which expires October 2005. Borrowings under the line of credit were $198,000,000 at December 31, 2003. The weighted average annual interest rate for 2003 was 2.1%. Mortgage Notes Payable At December 31, 2003, we had a total of approximately $158,808,000 in Mortgage Notes Payable secured by 32 health care facilities with a net book value of approximately $272,359,000. Interest rates on the Mortgage Notes ranged from 2.75% to 10.63% with a weighted average rate of 7.9%. Senior Notes At December 31, 2003, we had a total of $1,054,421,000 in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes outstanding. Interest rates on the notes ranged from 6.13% to 9.10% with a weighted average rate of 6.89% in 2003. During 2003, we issued $200,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 6% Senior Notes due 2015, repaid $31,000,000 of maturing long term debt with an average interest rate of 7.09% and redeemed $5,000,000 in Medium Term Notes due March 10, 2015, which carried an interest rate of 9.00%. These payments were initially financed with funds available under our revolving line of credit. 30 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our debt maturities by year, at December 31, 2003 (Amounts in thousands): Year Amount 2004 $ 105,475 2005 445,014 2006 142,378 2007 144,100 2008 19,788 Thereafter 554,474 Grand Total $ 1,411,229 At December 31, 2003, stockholders equity totaled $1,440,617,000 and our equity securities had a market value of $3,462,704,000. Total debt represents 27.2% and 49.4% of our total market and book capitalization, respectively. Preferred Stock At December 31, 2003, we have outstanding 4,000,000 shares of 7.25% Series E cumulative redeemable preferred stock and 7,820,000 shares of 7.10% Series F cumulative redeemable preferred stock, both of which were issued during the year for gross proceeds totaling $295,500,000. During 2003, we redeemed all of our outstanding 7.875% Series A, 8.7% Series B and 8.6% Series C cumulative redeemable preferred stock. As a result of redeeming the cumulative redeemable preferred stock at an amount higher than its carrying amount, we recorded preferred stock redemption charges totaling $18,553,000 during 2003. Equity On July 10, 2003, we issued 2,800,000 shares of our common stock at an offering price, net of underwriting discounts and commissions, of $20.75 per share. We received gross proceeds from the offering of $58,100,000. During 2003, we issued and sold 6,187,800 shares of our common stock under our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan at an average price per share of $19.94 for an aggregate of $123,379,000. Recent optional investment activity in the DRIP has declined significantly from previous levels due to the exclusion of certain participants who were managing multiple accounts and engaging in short term trading activities. The optional investment in December 2003 was $243,000 as compared with average monthly optional investments during the first 11 months of 2003 of $8,964,000. Also, beginning January 1, 2004, the Company reduced the discount on its shares of common stock purchased through the DRIP from 2% to 1%. As of December 31, 2003, there were a total of 2,643,508 non managing member units outstanding in four limited liability companies of which we are the managing member: HCPI/Tennessee, LLC; HCPI/Utah, LLC; HCPI/Utah II, LLC; and HCPI/Indiana, LLC. The non managing member units of HCPI/Utah, LLC, HCPI/Utah II, LLC and HCPI/Indiana, LLC are convertible into our common stock on a one unit for two shares basis. Each non managing member unit of HCPI/Tennessee, LLC is redeemable after October 2, 2004 for an amount of cash approximating the then current market value of two shares of our common stock or, at our option, two shares of our common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we issued 1,064,539 non managing member units of HCPI/Tennessee, LLC as part of the MedCap Properties, LLC acquisition described earlier. Shelf Registrations As of December 31, 2003, we had $1,500,000,000 available for future issuances of debt and equity securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These securities may be issued from time to time in the future based on our needs and the then existing market conditions. 31 Table of Contents Letters of Credit and Depositor Accounts At December 31, 2003, we held approximately $13,514,000 in depository accounts and $40,020,000 in irrevocable letters of credit from commercial banks to secure a number of tenants lease obligations and borrowers loan obligations. We may draw upon the letters of credit or depository accounts if there are defaults under the related leases or loans. Amounts available under letters of credit could change based upon facility operating conditions and other factors and such changes may be material. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements HCP Medical Office Portfolio, LLC On October 2, 2003, together with HCP Medical Office Portfolio, LLC (HCP MOP), a joint venture that we formed in June 2003 with GE Commercial Finance, we completed the $575 million acquisition of MedCap Properties, LLC, which includes ownership interests in 113 medical office buildings. HCP MOP acquired 100 of the medical office buildings at an acquisition price of $460 million. We are the managing member of HCP MOP and have a 33% interest therein. In addition to our indirect ownership interest in the medical office buildings through our joint venture interest, we will earn acquisition and management fees and an additional return if certain investment hurdles are achieved with respect to these properties. At the time of the acquisition, HCP MOP assumed $26 million in mortgage debt at an interest rate of approximately 7%. Summarized financial information as of December 31, 2003, and for the period from October 2, 2003 to December 31, 2003 of the unconsolidated joint venture follows (Amounts in thousands): Real Estate Investments, Net $ 465,639 Other Assets 11,193 Total Assets $ 476,832 Mortgage Notes Payable $ 25,423 Other Liabilities 13,372 Other Partners Capital 293,485 Investments From HCP 144,552 Total Liabilities and Partners Capital $ 476,832 Rental and Interest Income $ 20,610 Net Income $ 5,134 HCPs Equity Income $ 1,694 Distributions to HCP $ Acquisition and Management Fees Earned By HCP $ 2,491 Five of the acquired medical office buildings are construction projects we acquired with scheduled completion dates in 2004 and an expected total cost of $67,000,000. As of December 31, 2003, these assets had a carrying amount of $37,199,000. It is expected HCP MOP will acquire these assets after completion of construction. On January 20, 2004, HCP MOP completed $288,000,000 of mortgage financings of which $254,000,000 is at a weighted average fixed rate of 5.57% and the balance is at a floating rate based on LIBOR plus 1.75%. The Company received $92,000,000 of net proceeds from the financing. Our Revenue from HCP MOP, including fees earned by us, represented approximately 1% of our Revenue Less Operating Expenses during 2003. Tenant improvements, lease acquisition costs and operating expenses are funded through property operations. The Company may be required to provide additional funding if the joint venture does not have sufficient funds to cover these expenditures. 32 Table of Contents Other Joint Ventures As of December 31, 2003, we had an 80% interest in each of five joint ventures that own six long term care facilities, a 45% 50% interest in four joint ventures that each own an assisted living facility and a 9.8% interest in five joint ventures that own five retirement living communities. The five joint ventures that own five retirement living communities are subsidiaries of American Retirement Corporation. Summarized financial information at December 31, 2003, and for the year then ended, of the unconsolidated joint ventures follows (Amounts in thousands): Real Estate Investments, Net $ 175,796 Other Assets 3,002 Total Assets $ 178,798 Notes Payable to Third Parties $ 15,636 Mortgage Notes Payable to Third Parties ARC 55,532 Accounts Payable 1,846 Other Partners Capital 77,490 Investments and Advances from HCP, Net 28,294 Total Liabilities and Partners Capital $ 178,798 Rental and Interest Income $ 12,894 Net Income $ 1,992 HCPs Equity Income $ 548 Distributions to HCP $ 1,445 As of December 31, 2003, we had guaranteed approximately $7,100,000 on notes payable obligations for four of these joint ventures. As of December 31, 2003, the five retirement living communities owned by the five joint ventures in which we have a 9.8% interest secured $55,532,000 of first mortgages with fixed and variable interest rates ranging from 2.54% to 9.5% and maturity dates ranging from January 2004 to June 2025. Included in Other Partners Capital above are the proceeds from a loan of $76,228,000 as of December 31, 2003 from HCP to a subsidiary of American Retirement Corporation. Our Revenue from those joint ventures represented less than 1% of our Revenue Less Operating Expenses. During 2003, we acquired four retirement living facilities for $163,500,000 in which we previously owned a 9.8% equity interest. Additionally we closed a $7,000,000 secured loan to ARC. Three of the properties are leased to ARC and the fourth to a third party that has contracted with ARC to manage the facility. ARC used $52,000,000 of the proceeds from the transaction to repay a portion of an outstanding loan to us including accrued interest. Our maximum exposure to losses for our joint ventures at December 31, 2003 is the carrying value of the joint venture investments, including advances to and our investment in the HCP MOP development properties, of $210,045,000 and an additional $7,100,000 resulting from the guarantee of notes payable discussed above, which represents 7% of our consolidated assets and 15% of our consolidated stockholders equity. Our exposure may increase if we are required to provide any additional funding to HCP MOP. Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2003, our contractual payment obligations were as follows (amounts in thousands): Less Than One Year 2005 2006 2007 2008 More thanFive Years Total Contractual Obligations: Long Term Debt $ 105,587 $ 389,757 $ 164,307 $ 553,578 $ 1,213,229 Line of Credit 198,000 198,000 Acquisition and construction commitments 145,000 145,000 $ 250,587 $ 587,757 $ 164,307 $ 553,578 $ 1,556,229 As of December 31, 2003, the company had no significant contingent liabilities. 33 Table of Contents Item 7a. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our investments are financed by the sale of common and preferred stock, long term and medium term debt, internally generated cash flows, and some short term bank debt. We generally have fixed base rent on our leases; in addition, there can be additional rent based on a percentage of increased revenue over specified base period revenue of the properties and or increases based on inflation indices or other factors. Financing costs are comprised of dividends on common and preferred stock, interest on long term and medium term debt and short term interest on bank debt. On a more limited basis, we have provided mortgage loans to operators of health care facilities in the normal course of business. All of the mortgage loans receivable have fixed interest rates or interest rates with periodic fixed increases. Therefore, the mortgage loans receivable are all considered to be fixed rate loans, and the current interest rate (the lowest rate) is used in the computation of market risk provided in the following table if material. We may assume existing mortgage notes payable as part of an acquisition transaction. Currently we have two mortgage notes payable with variable interest rates and the remaining mortgage notes payable have fixed interest rates or interest rates with fixed periodic increases. Our Senior Notes are at fixed rates, with one exception for a $25,000,000 variable rate senior note for which management has fixed the interest rate by means of a swap contract. The variable rate loans are at interest rates below the current prime rate of 4.00%, and fluctuations are tied to the prime rate or to a rate currently below the prime rate. At December 31, 2003, we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on $4,075,000 of variable rate mortgage notes payable and $198,000,000 of variable rate bank debt on our total investment in our properties of $3.4 billion. Fluctuation in the interest rate environment will not affect our future earnings and cash flows on our fixed rate debt until that debt matures and must be replaced or refinanced. Interest rate changes will affect the fair value of the fixed rate instruments. Conversely, changes in interest rates on variable rate debt would change our future earnings and cash flows, but not affect the fair value on those instruments. Assuming a one percentage point increase in the interest rate related to the variable rate debt including the mortgage notes payable and the bank lines of credit, and assuming no change in the outstanding balance as of year end, interest expense for 2003 would increase by approximately $2,021,000, or $0.02 per common share on a diluted basis. The principal amount and the average interest rates for the mortgage loans receivable and debt categorized by the final maturity dates is presented in the following table. The fair value estimates for the mortgage loans receivable are based on the estimates of management and on rates currently prevailing for comparable loans. The fair market value estimates for debt securities are based on discounting future cash flows utilizing current rates offered to us for debt of the same type and remaining maturity.

New Accounting Pronouncements In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 (Interpretation No. 46) effective immediately for all variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003 and for the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003 for variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that is acquired before February 1, 2003. During October 2003, and again in December 2003, the FASB met and agreed to defer the effective date of Interpretation No. 46 for variable interests acquired before February 1, 2003. The deferral will require public companies to adopt the provisions of Interpretation No. 46 for such variable interests in periods ending after March 15, 2004 (that is, the quarter ending March 31, 2004 for the Company). We have adopted Interpretation No. 46 for variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003. Interpretation No. 46 requires the consolidation of variable interest entities in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns, or both, as a result of ownership, contractual or other financial interests in the entity. For entities that do not qualify as variable interest entities, we consolidate those entities that are majority owned and controlled. Since we have not adopted Interpretation No. 46 for variable interest entities created before February 1, 2003, we continue to consolidate the accounts of all majority owned and controlled subsidiaries and certain general and limited partnerships created prior to that date. For investments in certain general partnerships and joint ventures created before February 1, 2003 in which we may serve as the general partner or managing member where the other members in these joint ventures have significant voting rights relative to acquisition, sale and refinancing of assets as well as approval rights with respect to budgets, we continue to account for these investments using the equity method of accounting. The accounting policies of these joint ventures are substantially consistent with ours. We are currently evaluating the effects on us, if any, of the adoption of Interpretation No. 46 for variable interest entities created before February 1, 2003. In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150 Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity (Statement 150). Statement 150 requires that mandatorily redeemable financial instruments be classified as a liability and recorded at settlement value as of the balance sheet date. As a result, consolidated partnerships with a limited life are considered mandatorily redeemable. On October 29, 2003, the FASB met and voted to defer implementation of the provisions of Statement 150 that require the valuation and establishment of a liability for limited life entities. Statement 150 would have applied to seven limited life partnerships. Effective October 2003, we amended the agreement for one of these partnerships to remove the limited life provision. The minority interest in this partnership is not mandatorily redeemable and is not subject to the disclosure provisions of Statement 150. As of December 31, 2003, we have estimated the settlement value of the minority interests in the remaining six partnerships to be approximately $4,500,000, which is approximately $2,500,000 more than the carrying amount of such minority interests.
