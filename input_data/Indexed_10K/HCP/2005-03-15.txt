We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Executive Summary We are a real estate investment trust (REIT) that invests in health care related properties located throughout the United States. We develop, acquire and manage health care real estate, and provide mortgage financing to health care providers. We invest directly, often structuring sale leaseback transactions, and through joint ventures. At December 31, 2004, our real estate portfolio, including those held through joint ventures and mortgage loans, consisted of interests in 527 facilities located in 43 states. 27 Table of Contents The current operating environment presents many business challenges including (i) the prospect of rising interest rates, (ii) unprecedented state and federal budget deficits that are likely to dampen government reimbursement to the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the years to come, and (iii) a healthcare system in the United States that is projected to increase from 15.3% of gross domestic product (GDP) to 17.7% of GDP by 2012, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Furthermore, health care real estate valuations are at unprecedented high levels driven, in part, by the emergence of new well capitalized entrants into the health care real estate marketplace. Our business strategy is based on three principles: (i) opportunistic investing, (ii) portfolio diversification, and (iii) conservative financing. We actively redeploy capital from investments with lower return potential into assets with higher return potential, and recycle capital from shorter term to longer term investments. We make investments where the expected risk adjusted return exceeds our cost of capital and strive to leverage our operator and other business relationships. Our strategy contemplates acquiring and developing properties on favorable terms. We attempt to structure transactions that are tax advantaged and mitigate risks in our underwriting process. Generally, we prefer larger, more complex negotiated transactions that leverage our management teams experience and infrastructure. During 2004, we made gross investments of $538 million, including $70 million of MOB development properties placed into service mid year. These investments had an average first year yield on cost of just over 9% and allowed us to recycle $100 million of capital with two operators ARC and Emeritus from shorter term loans into long term leases. Our 2004 net investments of $438 million were allocated among the following healthcare sectors: (i) 23% assisted living facilities and CCRCs, (ii) 19% skilled nursing facilities, (iii) 49% MOBs, and (iv) 9% life sciences properties. We follow a disciplined approach to enhancing the value of our existing portfolio, including the ongoing evaluation of properties for potential disposition that no longer fit our strategy. We sold 32 properties during 2004 for $170 million and had 12 properties with a carrying amount of $13.0 million as held for sale at year end. We primarily generate revenue by leasing health care related properties under long term operating leases. Most of our rents are received under triple net leases; however, MOB rents are typically structured as gross or modified gross leases. Accordingly, for MOBs we incur certain property operating expenses, such as real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance, property management fees, utilities and insurance. Our growth depends, in part, on our ability to (i) increase rental income by increasing occupancy levels and rental rates, (ii) maximize tenant recoveries, and (iii) control operating and other expenses. Our operations are impacted by property specific, market specific, general economic and other conditions. Access to external capital on favorable terms is critical to the success of our strategy. We attempt to match the long term duration of our leases with long term fixed rate financing. At December 31, 2004, 23% of our consolidated debt is at variable interest rates. We intend to maintain an investment grade rating on our fixed income securities and manage various capital ratios and amounts within appropriate parameters. Our senior debt is rated BBB+ by both Standard & Poors and Fitch Ratings and Baa2 by Moodys Investors Service. Capital market access impacts our cost of capital and our ability to refinance existing indebtedness as it matures, as well as to fund future acquisitions and development through the issuance of additional securities. Our ability to access capital on favorable terms is dependent on various factors, including general market conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our securities, perception of our potential future earnings and cash distributions, and the market price of our capital stock. 28 Table of Contents 2004 Overview Real Estate Transactions On January 16, 2004, we acquired a health care laboratory and biotech research facility located in San Diego, California for a purchase price of approximately $40 million. On February 27, 2004, we sold a portfolio of seven MOBs and ten other health care facilities for $127.6 million and used a portion of the proceeds to retire $31.3 million of related mortgage debt at an average interest rate of 7.67%. On April 30 and June 1, 2004, we acquired nine skilled nursing facilities with a total of 934 beds for approximately $63 million in related transactions. The nine facilities, leased to the same operator, have an initial lease term of five years with three five year renewal options. The first year annual lease rate is approximately 9.3%. On June 10, 2004, we acquired a 79,000 square foot MOB located in Las Vegas, Nevada, for a purchase price of approximately $22 million. On July 15, 2004, we acquired substantially all of American Retirement Corporations (ARC) interest in three CCRCs and one assisted living facility for $113 million. The transaction was structured as a sale leaseback with an initial lease term of ten years and three ten year renewal options. The first year lease rate is 9% with additional rents contingent on facility revenue exceeding certain thresholds. ARC used a portion of the proceeds to repay its existing $82.6 million secured loan and interest thereon to us. Additionally, we provided ARC with a new $5.7 million mortgage loan at 9%, which was repaid in 2005. On July 28, 2004, we acquired eleven assisted living facilities from Emeritus Corporation for $84 million, including $56 million of assumed debt, through a sale leaseback transaction. These facilities have an initial lease term of 15 years, with two ten year renewal options. The initial annual lease rate is approximately 9.25% with Consumer Price Index (CPI) based escalators not exceeding 3% annually. Emeritus used $17 million of the proceeds to repay existing debt owed to us. The $56 million of assumed debt was subsequently repaid by us in December 2004. On December 17, 2004, we acquired three MOBs, a 42% condominium interest in a fourth MOB and one retail/garage building for $111 million from Swedish Medical Center in Seattle, Washington. These properties include approximately 481,000 rentable square feet and nearly 2,000 parking spaces. Swedish Medical Center occupies 20% of the rentable square feet and the properties were 96% occupied when acquired. In mid 2004, we placed into service $70 million of MOB development properties. During 2004, we sold properties valued at approximately $170 million, including $127.6 million of properties sold on February 27, 2004 as noted above, principally comprised of MOBs. Financing Transactions In January 2004, we received $92 million of net proceeds in connection with the completion of $288 million of non recourse mortgage financings by HCP Medical Office Portfolio, LLC (HCP MOP), a joint venture between us and an affiliate of General Electric (GE). The weighted average fixed interest rate on $254 million of such indebtedness was 5.57% with the balance at variable interest rates based on LIBOR plus 1.75%. On June 3, 2004 we issued $25 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.00% senior notes due 2014 and $25 million in aggregate principal amount of variable rate senior notes due 2014. On July 13, 2004, we issued $37 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.00% senior notes due 2014. 29 Table of Contents On October 26, 2004, we closed a new $500 million, three year, unsecured revolving credit facility which replaced our previous $490 million line of credit. The new agreement is priced, based upon our current credit rating, at 65 basis points over LIBOR with a 15 basis point facility fee. Other Events On January 22, 2004, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a 2 for 1 stock split effective March 2, 2004. On October 15, 2004, we and GE authorized the expansion of our HCP MOP joint venture from $600 million to $1.1 billion of total capitalization. Dividends paid were $1.67 per share for 2004 and are expected to be $1.68 per share in 2005. Our Board of Directors has determined to continue the policy established in 2003 of considering dividend increases on an annual rather than quarterly basis. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base estimates on our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different, it is possible that different accounting would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. From time to time, we re evaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Revenue Recognition Rental income from tenants is our principal source of revenue and is recognized in accordance with GAAP, including Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition (SAB 104). For leases with minimum scheduled rent increases, we recognize income on a straight line basis over the lease term when collectibility is reasonably assured. Recognizing rental income on a straight line basis for leases results in recognized revenue exceeding amounts contractually due from the tenant. Such cumulative excess amounts are included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. In the event we determine that collectibility of amounts for straight line rents is not reasonably assured, we limit future recognition to amounts contractually owed and, where appropriate, we establish an allowance for estimated losses. We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants and borrowers on an ongoing basis. Our evaluation considers industry and economic conditions, property performance, security deposits and guarantees, and other matters. We establish provisions and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the possible inability of our tenants and borrowers to make payments sufficient to recover recognized assets. For straight line rent amounts, our assessment is based on income recoverable over the term of the lease. Our ability to assess the collectibility potential of amounts to be received from tenants and borrowers directly affects our reported financial position and results of operations. Real Estate Real estate, consisting of land, buildings, and improvements, is recorded at cost. We allocate the cost of the acquisition to the acquired tangible and identified intangible assets and liabilities, primarily lease related 30 Table of Contents intangibles, based on their estimated fair values in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141, Business Combinations. We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and or capitalization rates, as well as available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. We record acquired above and below market leases at their fair value, using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired, equal to the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in place lease and (ii) managements estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below market fixed rate renewal options for below market leases. Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenants lease. Factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods, market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods, depending on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, we consider leasing commissions, legal and other related costs. Real estate assets are periodically reviewed for potential impairment by comparing the carrying amount to the expected undiscounted future cash flows to be generated from the assets. If the sum of the expected future net undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the property, we will recognize an impairment loss by adjusting the assets carrying amount to its estimated fair value. Fair value for properties to be held and used is based on the present value of the future cash flows expected to be generated from the asset. Properties held for sale are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to dispose. Our ability to accurately predict future cash flows impacts the determination of fair value, which may significantly impact our reported results of operations. Consolidation and Investments in Joint Ventures Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Health Care Property Investors, Inc., its wholly owned subsidiaries and its controlled, through voting rights or other means, joint ventures. We adopted Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting Research bulletin No. 51 (FIN 46) effective January 1, 2004 for variable interest entities created before February 1, 2003, and effective January 1, 2003 for variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003. FIN 46 provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights (variable interest entities or VIEs) and the determination of which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. Application of FIN 46 requires complex judgments and estimates. Our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity affects our reported financial condition and results of operations. A variable interest entity is broadly defined as an entity where either (i) the equity investors as a group, if any, do not have a controlling financial interest or (ii) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entitys activities without additional financial support. We consolidate investments in VIEs when we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The adoption of FIN 46 resulted in the consolidation of five joint ventures effective January 1, 2004, that were previously accounted for under the equity method. The consolidation of these joint ventures did not have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements or results of operations. Investments in entities in which we do not consolidate but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are reported under the equity method. Generally, under the equity method of accounting, our share of the investees earnings or loss is included in our operating results. 31 Table of Contents Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2004 as Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Rental income. Triple net rental income increased 17% to $280.1 million primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2004. We also recognized $5.7 million of rental income during the fourth quarter of 2004 resulting from a change in estimate related to the collectibility of straight line rental income from ARC. The consolidation of five joint ventures upon the adoption of FIN 46 effective January 2004 increased reported triple net rental income by approximately $2.8 million. Medical office building rental income increased 28% to $108.6 million in 2004. The increase is primarily related to 13 properties purchased from MedCap in October 2003, including four development properties we placed in service in mid 2004, and other MOB acquisition activities. Equity income. Equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures reflects a full year of operations from HCP MOP in 2004 versus three months in 2003. This was offset by higher HCP MOP interest expense following HCP MOP obtaining $288 million of non recourse mortgage debt in early 2004. During 2004 and 2003, we recognized $1.5 million and $1.7 million of equity income from HCP MOP, respectively. At December 31, 2004, 100 properties were held by unconsolidated joint ventures, including HCP MOP, compared to 115 properties at December 31, 2003. Interest and other income. Interest and other income for 2004 was $37.9 million representing a decline of 22%. The change reflects the net effects of (i) $4.6 million of revenue from the recognition of ARC related interest income upon the repayment during 2004 to us by ARC of $83 million of debt and accrued interest thereon, and (ii) a reduced level of loans receivable following the aforementioned repayment from ARC and a $17 million repayment from Emeritus. During 2004 and 2003, we also recognized management and other fees from HCP MOP of $3.1 million and $2.5 million, respectively. Other income in 2003 includes a $3.4 million tax related accrual reversal related to our 1999 acquisition of American Health Properties. Interest expense. Interest expense increased slightly over 2003. The increase was due to the net effects of (i) the assumption of $81 million of mortgage debt in conjunction with the ARC and Emeritus transactions in July 2004, (ii) the retirement of $31 million of mortgage debt in the first quarter of 2004 in connection with the sale of $127 million of MOB and other health care properties, and (iii) other changes in average borrowings levels. Interest expense in 2004 also included $0.8 million of previously unamortized deferred financing costs that were written off in connection with the refinancing of our revolving credit agreement. Operating costs and expenses. Operating costs were $43.3 million during 2004 representing an increase of 33%. Operating costs are predominately related to MOB properties that are leased under gross or modified gross lease agreements where we share certain costs with tenants. Additionally, we contract with third party property managers on most of our MOB properties. Accordingly, the number of properties in our MOB portfolio directly impacts operating costs. The increases were primarily attributable to the acquisition of 13 properties from MedCap in October 2003, including four development properties we placed in service in mid 2004. In the fourth quarter of 2004, we increased our allowance for loan losses by $1.6 million on certain unsecured loans. The provision resulted from one operator who defaulted on the payment of two of four unsecured notes upon their maturity and our recent credit assessment of another operator. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses were $36.0 million in 2004 compared to $24.4 million in 2003, primarily reflecting higher employee compensation costs. Also contributing to the increase was $0.7 million in expenses associated with the move of our corporate offices to Long Beach, CA, $1.5 million in income tax expense on income from certain assets held in a TRS, and a charge of $1.6 million related to the settlement of a lawsuit filed against us by our former Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, during 2004 we implemented a new information 32 Table of Contents technology system to enhance our reporting and asset management activities and expended considerable resources towards compliance with recent regulatory requirements, principally the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. Depreciation and amortization. Real estate depreciation and amortization increased primarily due to the acquisition and construction of properties aggregating approximately $538 million during 2004 and $239 million during 2003. Impairments. Impairment losses on real estate were $17.1 million in 2004 and $14.0 million in 2003. Included in continuing operations were impairments of $3.2 million and $2.1 million for 2004 and 2003, respectively, which relate to two and one properties, respectively. Discontinued operations. Income from discontinued operations for 2004 and 2003 were $11.2 million and $12.6 million, respectively. The decrease is due to a decline in operating income from discontinued operations of $8.4 million to $4.0 million for 2004 partially offset by a net gain on real estate dispositions and impairments of $7.2 million in 2004 compared to a net gain on real estate dispositions and impairments of $0.2 million in 2003. Year Ended December 31, 2003 as Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002 Rental income. Triple net related income increased 6% to $240.2 million during 2003, primarily attributable to acquisitions. MOB rental income for 2003 increased 17% primarily due to acquisition and development activity. Equity income. Equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures was $2.9 million for 2003 compared to $0.9 million in 2002 reflecting our investment in HCP MOP in October 2003. During 2003, we recognized $1.7 million of equity income from HCP MOP. At December 31, 2003, 115 properties were held by unconsolidated joint ventures, including HCP MOP, compared to 19 properties at December 31, 2002. Interest and other income. Interest and other income increased primarily due to the September 2002 loan to ARC, as well as a partial prepayment of that loan in September 2003. Other income in 2003 includes a $3.4 million tax related accrual reversal related to our 1999 acquisition of American Health Properties. Interest expense. Interest expense was higher in 2003 due to the issuance of $200 million principal amount of 6% long term debt in February 2003 and $250 million principal amount of 6.45% long term debt in June 2002. Operating cost and expenses. Operating costs were $32.5 million for 2003 representing an increase of 28%. The increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of 13 properties from MedCap in October 2003. General and administrative. General and administrative expenses increased 31% to $24.4 million for 2003. Higher general and administrative expenses were caused by costs related to vacant properties, an increase in troubled operators, duplicate asset management functions resulting from the acquisition and transition of MedCap, and higher employee compensation costs. Depreciation and amortization. Real estate depreciation and amortization increased 8% to $73.3 million as a result of the acquisition of properties totaling approximately $239 million during 2003 and $233 million in 2002. Impairments. Impairment losses included in continuing operations were $2.1 million and zero for the 2003 and 2002, respectively. Impairment losses included in continuing operations during 2003 relate to one property. 33 Table of Contents Preferred stock redemptions. Preferred stock redemption charges were $18.6 million in 2003 and relate to the repurchase of outstanding preferred stock at an amount in excess of the carrying amount. Discontinued operations. The increase in income from discontinued operations for 2003 is due to a net gain on real estate dispositions and impairments of $0.2 million compared to a net loss on real estate dispositions and impairments of $10.3 million in 2002, partially offset by a decline in operating income from discontinued operations of $5.0 million to $12.4 million for 2003 from $17.4 million in 2002. Discontinued operations include impairment charges of $11.9 million and $11.0 million for 2003 and 2002, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal liquidity needs are to (i) fund normal operating expenses, (ii) meet debt service requirements, (iii) fund capital expenditures including tenant improvements and leasing costs, (iv) fund acquisition and development activities, and (v) make minimum distributions required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code, as amended. We believe these needs will be satisfied using cash flows generated by operations and provided by financing activities. We intend to repay maturing debt with proceeds from future debt and or equity offerings and anticipate making future investments dependent on the availability of cost effective sources of capital. We use the public debt and equity markets as our principal source of financing. As of December 31, 2004, our senior debt is rated BBB+ by both Standard & Poors Ratings Group and Fitch Ratings and Baa2 by Moodys Investors Service. Net cash provided by operating activities was $272.5 million and $263.6 million for 2004 and 2003, respectively. Cash flow from operations reflects increased revenues offset by higher costs and expenses, and changes in receivables, payables, accruals, and deferred revenue. Our cash flows from operations are dependent upon the occupancy level of multi tenant buildings, rental rates on leases, our tenants performance on their lease obligations, the level of operating expenses, and other factors. See Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations. Net cash used in investing activities was $82.0 million during 2004 and principally reflects the net effect of: (i) $127.6 million received from the sale of seven medical office buildings and 10 other health care related facilities in the first quarter, (ii) $340.9 million principally used to fund acquisitions, (iii) $92.0 million received from HCP MOP upon the completion of $288 million of non recourse mortgage financing, and (iv) $25.6 million in principal repayments received on loans. The ARC and Emeritus transactions retired approximately $100 million of aggregate loans owed to us simultaneously with the related property acquisitions. Accordingly, this portion of these transactions has been considered a non cash activity. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2004 and 2003, we used $3.4 million and $6.5 million to fund lease commissions and tenant and capital improvements, respectively. Net cash used in financing activities was $187.8 million for 2004 and includes: (i) the repayment of approximately $92.0 million of senior notes, (ii) payment of common and preferred dividends aggregating $243.3 million, and (iii) repayments on mortgage debt of $69.4 million, including $56.6 million of debt we assumed in connection with the Emeritus transaction. These uses were partially offset by proceeds of $42.6 million from common stock issuances, $87.0 million from senior note issuances, and $102.1 million from net proceeds on our line of credit. In order to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we must distribute at least 90% of our taxable income to our shareholders. Accordingly, we intend to continue to make regular quarterly distributions to holders of our common and preferred stock. At December 31, 2004, we held approximately $16.9 million in deposits and $27.6 million in irrevocable letters of credit from commercial banks securing tenants lease obligations and borrowers loan obligations. We may draw upon the letters of credit or depository accounts if there are defaults under the related leases or loans. Amounts available under letters of credit could change based upon facility operating conditions and other factors and such changes may be material. 34 Table of Contents Debt At December 31, 2004, we have the following outstanding debt: Revolving line of credit. Borrowings under the line of credit were $300 million at December 31, 2004 with a weighted average interest rate of 3.14%. On October 26, 2004, we closed a new $500 million three year unsecured revolving credit facility. The facility accrues interest, based on our current credit ratings, at 65 basis points over LIBOR with a 15 basis point facility fee. In addition, a competitive bid option, whereby the lenders participating in the credit facility bid on the interest to be charged which may result in a reduced interest rate, is available for up to 50% of borrowings. The credit facility also contains an accordion feature allowing borrowings to be increased by $100 million in certain conditions. The new credit agreement contains certain financial restrictions and requirements customary in transactions of this type. The more significant covenants, using terms defined in the agreements, limit (i) Consolidated Total Indebtedness to Consolidated Total Asset Value to 60%, (ii) Secured Debt to Consolidated Total Asset Value to 30% and (iii) Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Unencumbered Asset Value to 60%. We must also maintain (i) a Fixed Charge Coverage ratio, as defined, of 1.75 times and (ii) a formula determined Minimum Tangible Net Worth. As of December 31, 2004 we were in compliance with each of these restrictions and requirements. Mortgage debt. At December 31, 2004, we had $139.4 million in mortgage debt secured by 28 health care facilities with a carrying amount of $268.4 million. Interest rates on the mortgage notes ranged from 1.07% to 9.32% with a weighted average rate of 7.86% at December 31, 2004. The instruments encumbering the properties restrict title transfer of the respective properties subject to the terms of the mortgage, prohibit additional liens, require payment of real estate taxes, maintenance of the properties in good condition, maintenance of insurance on the properties and include a requirement to obtain lender consent to enter into material tenant leases. Senior unsecured notes. At December 31, 2004 we had $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding. Interest rates on the notes ranged from 3.39% to 7.875% with a weighted average rate of 6.55% at December 31, 2004. Senior unsecured notes include $200 million principal amount of 6.875% Mandatory Par Put Remarketed Securities (MOPPRS) due June 8, 2015. The MOPPRS contain an option (the MOPPRS Option) exercisable by the Remarketing Dealer, an investment bank affiliate, which derives its value from the yield on ten year U.S. Treasury rates relative to a fixed strike rate of 5.565%. Generally, the value of the option to the Remarketing Dealer increases as ten year Treasury rates decline and the options value to the Remarketing Dealer decreases as ten year Treasury rates rise. The ten year U.S. Treasury rate at December 31, 2004 was 4.24%. The value of this option to the Remarketing Dealer approximated $20 million at December 31, 2004. Conversely, such amount represents a potential unrecognized loss to us. On June 8, 2005, if the ten year Treasury rate is less than 5.565%, we expect that the Remarketing Dealer will exercise the MOPPRS Option, redeem the securities from the holders at par plus accrued interest, and reissue the senior notes as ten year notes at a premium based on a fixed coupon interest rate set at our applicable credit spread plus 5.565%. However, if the ten year Treasury rate is above 5.565%, we expect that the Remarketing Dealer will redeem the outstanding senior notes and we will be required to repurchase the outstanding MOPPRS at par plus accrued interest. 35 Table of Contents Debt Maturities The following table summarizes our stated debt maturities and scheduled principal repayments at December 31, 2004 (in thousands): Year Amount 2005 $ 247,198 2006 142,391 2007 444,161 2008 7,178 2009 4,605 Thereafter 643,404 $ 1,488,937 Equity At December 31, 2004, we have outstanding 4,000,000 shares of 7.25% Series E cumulative redeemable preferred stock, 7,820,000 shares of 7.10% Series F cumulative redeemable preferred stock, and 133.7 million shares of common stock. During 2004, we issued approximately 853,000 shares of our common stock under our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan at an average price per share of $25.37 for an aggregate amount of $21.7 million. We also received $21.1 million in proceeds from stock option exercises. At December 31, 2004, stockholders equity totaled $1.4 billion and our equity securities had a market value of $4.1 billion. As of December 31, 2004, there were a total of 2.5 million non managing member units outstanding in four limited liability companies of which we are the managing member: HCPI/Tennessee, LLC; HCPI/Utah, LLC; HCPI/Utah II, LLC; and HCPI/Indiana, LLC. The non managing member units are exchangeable for an amount of cash approximating the then current market value of two shares of our common stock or, at our option, two shares of our common stock (subject to certain adjustments, such as stock splits and reclassifications). During the year ended December 31, 2004, we issued 20,287 non managing member units. As of December 31, 2004, we had $1.5 billion available for future issuances of debt and equity securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the SEC. These securities may be issued from time to time in the future based on our needs and the then existing market conditions. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We own interests in certain unconsolidated joint ventures, including HCP MOP, as described under Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Except in limited circumstances, our risk of loss is limited to our investment carrying amount and any outstanding loans receivable. See Liquidity and Capital Resources Debt for a discussion of the MOPPRS Option related to our senior unsecured notes. We have no other material off balance sheet arrangements that we expect to materially effect our liquidity and capital resources except these described under Contractual Obligations. 36 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations Following are our material contractual payment obligations and commitments at December 31, 2004 (in thousands): Less thanOne Year 2006 2007 2008 2009 More thanFive Years Total Unsecured senior notes and mortgage debt $ 247,198 $ 286,452 $ 11,783 $ 643,404 $ 1,188,837 Revolving line of credit 300,100 300,100 Acquisition and construction commitments 5,028 5,028 Operating leases 1,037 2,138 2,227 95,725 101,127 Interest expense 70,628 95,667 81,521 130,518 378,334 Total $ 323,891 $ 684,357 $ 95,531 $ 869,647 $ 1,973,426 See Liquidity and Capital Resources Debt for a discussion of the MOPPRS Option related to our senior unsecured notes. Inflation Our leases often provide for either fixed increases in base rents or indexed escalators, based on the Consumer Price Index or other measures, and or additional rent based on increases in our tenants facility revenue. Substantially all of our MOB leases require the tenant to pay a share of property operating costs such as real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, etc. We believe that inflationary increases in expenses will be offset, in part, by the tenant expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases described above. New Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the impact of new accounting standards. ITEM 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk At December 31, 2004, we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on $11.9 million of variable rate mortgage notes payable, $300.1 million of variable rate bank debt and $25 million of variable senior notes. Of our consolidated debt of $1.5 billion at year end 2004, approximately 23% is at variable interest rates with the balance at fixed interest rates. Fluctuation in the interest rate environment will not affect our future earnings and cash flows on our fixed rate debt until that debt must be replaced or refinanced. However, interest rate changes will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments. Conversely, changes in interest rates on variable rate debt would change our future earnings and cash flows, but not affect the fair value of those instruments. Assuming a one percentage point increase in the interest rate related to the variable rate debt including the mortgage notes payable, the bank line of credit and senior notes, and assuming no change in the outstanding balance as of December 31, 2004, interest expense for 2004 would increase by approximately $3.4 million, or $0.03 per common share on a diluted basis. 37 Table of Contents The principal amount and the average interest rates for our mortgage loans receivable and debt categorized by maturity dates is presented in the table below. The fair value estimates for the mortgage loans receivable are based on the estimates of management and on rates currently prevailing for comparable loans. The fair market value estimates for debt securities are based on discounting future cash flows utilizing current rates offered to us for debt of the same type and remaining maturity.
