Executive Summary We are a real estate investment trust (REIT) that invests in healthcare related properties located throughout the United States. We develop, acquire and manage healthcare real estate, and provide mortgage financing to healthcare providers. We invest directly, often structuring sale leaseback 31 transactions, and through joint ventures. At December 31, 2005, our real estate portfolio, including assets held through joint ventures and mortgage loans, consisted of interests in 527 facilities located in 42 states. Our business strategy is based on three principles: (i) opportunistic investing, (ii) portfolio diversification, and (iii) conservative financing. We actively redeploy capital from investments with lower return potential into assets with higher return potential, and recycle capital from shorter term to longer term investments. We make investments where the expected risk adjusted return exceeds our cost of capital and strive to leverage our operator and other business relationships. Our strategy contemplates acquiring and developing properties on favorable terms. We attempt to structure transactions that are tax advantaged and mitigate risks in our underwriting process. Generally, we prefer larger, more complex private transactions that leverage our management teams experience and our infrastructure. During 2005, we made gross investments of $647 million. These investments had an average first year yield on cost of just over 7.67%. Our 2005 investments of were allocated among the following healthcare sectors: (i) 62% senior housing facilities; (ii) 32% MOBs; and (iii) 6% hospitals. We follow a disciplined approach to enhancing the value of our existing portfolio, including the ongoing evaluation of properties for potential disposition that no longer fit our strategy. We sold interests in 20 properties during 2005 for $71 million and had seven properties with a carrying amount of $5 million classified as held for sale at year end. We primarily generate revenue by leasing healthcare related properties under long term operating leases. Most of our rents are received under triple net leases; however, Medical Office Building (MOB) rents are typically structured as gross or modified gross leases. Accordingly, for MOBs we incur certain property operating expenses, such as real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance, property management fees, utilities and insurance. Our growth depends, in part, on our ability to (i) increase rental income by increasing occupancy levels and rental rates, (ii) maximize tenant recoveries given underlying lease structures, and (iii) control operating and other expenses. Our operations are impacted by property specific, market specific, general economic and other conditions. Access to external capital on favorable terms is critical to the success of our strategy. We attempt to match the long term duration of our leases with long term fixed rate financing. At December 31, 2005, 15% of our consolidated debt is at variable interest rates. We intend to maintain an investment grade rating on our fixed income securities and manage various capital ratios and amounts within appropriate parameters. As of December 31, 2005, our senior debt is rated BBB+ by both Standard & Poors and Fitch Ratings and Baa2 by Moodys Investors Service. Capital market access impacts our cost of capital and our ability to refinance existing indebtedness as it matures, as well as to fund future acquisitions and development through the issuance of additional securities. Our ability to access capital on favorable terms is dependent on various factors, including general market conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our securities, perception of our potential future earnings and cash distributions, and the market price of our capital stock. 2005 Overview Real Estate Transactions During 2005, the Company acquired interests in properties and made secured loans aggregating $647 million with an average yield of 7.7%. Our 2005 investments were made in the following healthcare sectors: (i) 62% senior housing facilities; (ii) 32% medical office buildings; and (iii) 6% hospitals. 2005 investments included the following: On April 20, 2005, we acquired five assisted living facilities for $58 million through a sale leaseback transaction. These facilities have an initial lease term of 15 years, with two ten year renewal options. 32 The initial annual lease rate is 9.0% with annual escalators based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) that have a floor of 2.75%. These properties are included in a master lease that has 21 properties leased to the operator. On April 28, 2005, we acquired five medical office buildings for $81 million, including assumed debt valued at $29 million. The initial yield is 7.0%, with two properties currently in lease up. The yield following lease up is expected to be 8.2%. The medical office buildings include approximately 537,000 rentable square feet. On July 1, 2005, we acquired an assisted living facility for $16 million through a sale leaseback transaction. The facility has an initial lease term of 15 years, with two ten year renewal options. The initial annual lease rate is 8.75% with annual CPI based escalators that have a floor of 2.75%. On July 22, 2005, we acquired twelve independent and assisted living facilities for approximately $252 million, including assumed debt and non managing member LLC units (DownREIT units) valued at $52 million and $19 million, respectively, through a sale leaseback transaction. These facilities have an initial lease term of 15 years, with three ten year renewal options. The initial annual lease rate is 7.1% with annual CPI based escalators that have a floor of 3%. On August 31, 2005, we acquired five assisted living facilities for $41 million through a sale leaseback transaction. These facilities have an initial lease term of 15 years, with two ten year renewal options. The initial annual lease rate is 8.5% with annual CPI based escalators that have a floor of 2.75%. These properties are included in a master lease that has 21 properties leased to the operator. On October 19, 2005, we acquired seven medical office buildings for $51 million, including assumed debt and DownREIT units valued at $24 million and $11 million, respectively. The medical office buildings include approximately 351,000 rentable square feet and have an initial yield of 8.2%. On December 22, 2005, we acquired two independent and assisted living facilities for $18 million through a sale leaseback transaction. The facilities have an initial lease term of 15 years, with two ten year renewal options. The initial annual lease rate is 8.5% with annual CPI based escalators that have a floor of 2.75%. These properties are included in a master lease that has 21 properties leased to the operator. On December 23, 2005, we acquired two medical office buildings for $25 million. The medical office buildings include approximately 152,000 rentable square feet and have an initial yield of 7.4%. On December 28, 2005, we closed a $40 million loan secured by a hospital in Texas. The note bears interest at 8.75% per annum. Subject to certain performance conditions, we may fund an additional $10 million under the existing loan agreement. During 2005, we sold interests in 20 properties for $71 million and recognized gains of $10 million. Capital Markets Transactions On April 27, 2005, we issued $250 million of 5.625% senior unsecured notes due 2017. The notes were priced at 99.585% of the principal amount with an effective yield of 5.673%. We received proceeds of $247 million, which were used to repay outstanding indebtedness and for general corporate purposes. On September 16, 2005, we issued $200 million of 4.875% senior unsecured notes due 2010. The notes were priced at 99.567% of the principal amount with an effective yield of 4.974%. We received net proceeds of $198 million, which were used to repay outstanding indebtedness and for general corporate purposes. 33 During the year ended December 31, 2005, we issued approximately 878,000 shares of our common stock under our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan at an average price per share of $25.80 for proceeds of $23 million. Other Events Quarterly dividends paid during 2005 aggregated to $1.68 per share. On February 6, 2006, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly common stock cash dividend of $0.425 per share. The common stock dividend will be paid on February 23, 2006, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 13, 2006. This dividend equals $1.70 per share on an annualized basis. Our Board of Directors has determined to continue its policy of considering dividend increases on an annual rather than quarterly basis. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. Our judgments are based on our experience, interpretation of the facts and circumstances, and on various other estimates and assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different, it is possible that different accounting would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. From time to time, we re evaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Use of Estimates Management is required to make estimates and assumptions in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ. Principles of Consolidation Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of HCP, its wholly owned subsidiaries and its controlled, through voting rights or other means, joint ventures. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. We have adopted Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, as revised (FIN 46R), effective January 1, 2004 for variable interest entities created before February 1, 2003 and effective in fiscal year 2003 for variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003. FIN 46R provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights (variable interest entities or VIEs) and the determination of which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. A variable interest entity is broadly defined as an entity where either (i) the equity investors as a group, if any, do not have a controlling financial interest or (ii) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entitys activities without additional financial support. We consolidate investments in VIEs when it is determined that we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE at either the creation of the variable interest entity or upon the occurrence of a reconsideration event. The adoption of 34 FIN 46R resulted in the consolidation of five joint ventures with aggregate assets of $18.5 million, effective January 1, 2004, that were previously accounted for under the equity method. The consolidation of these joint ventures did not have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements or results of operations. We adopted Emerging Issues Task Force Issue (EITF) 04 5, Investors Accounting for an Investment in a Limited Partnership When the Investor is the Sole General Partner and the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights (EITF 04 5), effective June 2005. The issue concludes as to what rights held by the limited partner(s) preclude consolidation in circumstances in which the sole general partner would otherwise consolidate the limited partnership in accordance with GAAP. The assessment of limited partners rights and their impact on the presumption of control of the limited partnership by the sole general partner should be made when an investor becomes the sole general partner and should be reassessed if (i) there is a change to the terms or in the exercisability of the rights of the limited partners, (ii) the sole general partner increases or decreases its ownership of limited partnership interests, or (iii) there is an increase or decrease in the number of outstanding limited partnership interests. This EITF also applies to managing members in limited liability companies. The adoption of EITF 04 5 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Investments in entities which we do not consolidate but for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are reported under the equity method. Generally, under the equity method of accounting, our share of the investees earnings or loss is included in our operating results. Revenue Recognition Rental income from tenants is recognized in accordance with GAAP, including Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition (SAB 104). For leases with minimum scheduled rent increases, we recognize income on a straight line basis over the lease term when collectibility is reasonably assured. Recognizing rental income on a straight line basis for leases results in recognized revenue exceeding amounts contractually due from tenants. Such cumulative excess amounts are included in other assets and were $18.4 million and $11.0 million, net of allowances, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In the event we determine that collectibility of straight line rents is not reasonably assured, we limit future recognition to amounts contractually owed, and, where appropriate, we establish an allowance for estimated losses. Certain leases provide for additional rents based upon a percentage of the facilitys revenue in excess of specified base periods or other thresholds. Such revenue is deferred until the related thresholds are achieved. We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants and borrowers on an ongoing basis. This evaluation considers industry and economic conditions, property performance, security deposits and guarantees, and other matters. We establish provisions and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the possible inability of its tenants and borrowers to make payments sufficient to recover recognized assets. For straight line rent amounts, our assessment is based on income recoverable over the term of the lease. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had an allowance of $21.6 million and $15.8 million, respectively, included in other assets, as a result of our determination that collectibility is not reasonably assured for certain straight line rent amounts. Real Estate Real estate, consisting of land, buildings, and improvements, is recorded at cost. We allocate the cost of the acquisition to the acquired tangible and identified intangible assets and liabilities, primarily lease related intangibles, based on their estimated fair values in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141, Business Combinations. 35 We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and or capitalization rates, third party appraisals, and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. We record acquired above and below market leases at their fair value, using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired, equal to the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in place lease and (ii) managements estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below market fixed rate renewal options for below market leases. Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenants lease. Factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods, market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods, depending on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, we consider leasing commissions, legal and other related costs. Real estate assets are periodically reviewed for potential impairment by comparing the carrying amount to the expected undiscounted future cash flows to be generated from the assets. If the sum of the expected future net undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the property, we will recognize an impairment loss by adjusting the assets carrying amount to its estimated fair value. Fair value for properties to be held and used is based on the present value of the future cash flows expected to be generated from the asset. Properties held for sale are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to dispose. Our ability to accurately predict future cash flows impacts the determination of fair value, which may significantly impact our reported results of operations. Results of Operations Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2005 to the year ended December 31, 2004 Rental and other revenue. MOB rental revenue increased 35% to $126.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in MOB rental revenue of $33.2 million primarily relates to the additive effect of our acquisitions in 2005 and 2004, which contributed $26.7 million to rental revenues year over year. Triple net lease rental revenues increased 13% to $325.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in triple net lease rental revenue of $37.7 million primarily relates to the additive effect of our acquisitions in 2005 and 2004, as detailed below: Triple net lease rental revenue resulting from acquisitions for the year ended December 31, Property Type 2005 2004 Change (in thousands) Senior housing facilities $44,980 $14,183 $30,797 Other healthcare facilities 6,091 5,566 525 Total $51,071 $19,749 $31,322 36 We also recognized $5.7 million of rental income during the fourth quarter of 2004 resulting from a change in estimate related to the collectibility of straight line rental income from ARC. Additionally, included in triple net lease rental revenues are facility level operating revenues for five senior housing properties that were previously leased on a net basis. Periodically tenants default on their leases, which cause us to take temporary possession of the operations of the facility. We contract with third party managers to manage these properties until a replacement tenant can be identified or the property can be sold. The operating revenues and expenses for these properties are included in triple net lease rental revenues and operating expenses, respectively. The increase in reported revenues for these facilities of $3.6 million to $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, was primarily due to us taking possession of two of these properties in 2005 and increases in overall occupancy of such properties. Equity income (loss). Equity income decreased to a loss of $1.1 million primarily due to our investment in HCP MOP, for which we recorded equity losses of $1.4 million and equity income of $1.5 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, HCP MOP revised its purchase price allocation and attributed more of the purchase price of the properties acquired from MedCap Properties, LLC to below market lease intangibles and other intangibles from real estate assets. Lease intangibles generally amortize over a shorter period of time relative to tangible real estate assets. The decrease in the equity income from our investment in HCP MOP was primarily due to the revisions to the purchase price allocations referred to above. Additionally, HCP MOP incurred repairs and other related expenses for damages caused by hurricanes Katrina and Rita of $1.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2005. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on HCP MOP. Interest and other income. Interest and other income decreased 27% to $26.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The change reflects a reduced level of loans receivable following an $83 million repayment from ARC and a $17 million repayment from Emeritus during the third quarter of 2004. The decrease in interest and other income was partially offset by gains from the sale of various investments of $4.5 million in 2005. The gains from these investments were primarily the result of the sale of securities in 2005, which were acquired in conjunction with real estate and or leasing transactions we completed in previous years. During the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we also recognized management and other fees from HCP MOP of $3.1 million in each period. 37 Interest expense. Interest expense increased 22% to $107.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was due to the issuance of $450 million of senior notes payable in April and September of 2005, and the assumption of $113.5 million of mortgage notes payable in connection with the acquisitions of real estate properties, which resulted in increased borrowing levels, and an overall increase in short term variable rates. The table below sets forth information with respect to our debt as of December 31, 2005 and 2004: As of December 31, 2005 2004 (dollars in thousands) Balance: Fixed rate $1,663,166 $1,153,012 Variable rate 295,265 337,010 Total $1,958,431 $1,490,022 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate 85 % 77 % Variable rate 15 % 23 % Total 100 % 100 % Weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 6.33 % 6.76 % Variable rate 4.95 % 3.09 % Total weighted average rates 6.14 % 5.93 % Depreciation and amortization. Real estate depreciation and amortization increased 26% to $106.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in depreciation and amortization of $21.8 million primarily relates to the additive effect of our acquisitions in 2005 and 2004, as detailed below: Depreciation and amortization resulting from acquisitions for the year ended December 31, Property Type 2005 2004 Change (in thousands) Senior housing facilities $15,697 $5,258 $10,439 Medical office buildings 10,981 651 10,330 Other healthcare facilities 810 766 44 Total $27,488 $6,675 $20,813 Operating expenses. Operating costs increased 39% to $59.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Operating costs are predominantly related to MOB properties that are leased under gross or modified gross lease agreements where we share certain costs with tenants. Additionally, we contract with third party property managers for most of our MOB properties. Accordingly, the number of properties in our MOB portfolio directly impacts operating costs. The increase in operating expenses of $16.5 million primarily relates to the effect of our acquisitions in 2005 and 2004, as detailed below: Operating expenses resulting from acquisitions for the year ended December 31, Property Type 2005 2004 Change (in thousands) Medical office buildings $11,796 $ 662 $11,134 Other healthcare facilities 2,187 2,064 123 Total $13,983 $ 2,726 $11,257 38 Additionally, included in operating expenses are facility level operating expenses for five senior housing properties that were previously leased on a net basis. Periodically tenants default on their leases which cause us to take temporary possession of the operations of the facility. We contract with third party managers to manage these properties until a replacement tenant can be identified or the property can be sold. The revenues and expenses for these properties are included in triple net lease rental revenues and operating expenses, respectively. The increase in reported operating expenses for these facilities of $3.6 million to $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, was primarily due to us taking possession of two of these properties in 2005 and an increase in the overall occupancy of such properties. The presentation of expenses between general and administrative and operating expenses is based on the underlying nature of the expense. Periodically, we review the classification of expenses between categories and make revisions based on changes in the underlying nature of the expense. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased 13% to $32.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The decrease was due to higher costs in 2004 primarily resulting from $1.5 million of income tax expense on income from certain assets held in a taxable REIT subsidiary, the implementation of a new information system, considerable resources that were expended towards initial compliance with certain regulatory requirements, principally Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, $0.7 million in expenses associated with the relocation of our corporate offices to Long Beach, California in 2004 and a charge of $1.6 million related to the settlement of a lawsuit filed against us by our former Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Offsetting the decrease from 2004 was an increase in compensation related expenses due to an increase in full time employees from 74 at December 31, 2004, to 83 at December 31, 2005. Discontinued operations. Income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $13.9 million compared to $14.9 million for the comparable period in the prior year. The change is due to a decline in the carrying value of assets disposed from $151 million in 2004 to $54 million in 2005, and resulted in a decrease in the year over year gains on sale of real estate of $10.9 million and a related decline of operating income of $5.8 million associated with discontinued operations. The changes in net gain on sale and operating income were predominantly offset by a year over year reduction of impairment charges of $15.8 million. Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2004 to the year ended December 31, 2003 Rental and other revenue. MOB rental revenue increased 22% to $93.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in MOB rental revenue of $17.2 million primarily relates to the additive effect of our acquisitions in 2004 and 2003, which contributed $14.7 million to rental revenues year over year. Triple net lease rental revenues increased 19% to $287.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in triple net lease rental revenue of $46.1 million primarily relates to the additive effect of our acquisitions in 2004 and 2003, as detailed below: Triple net lease rental revenue resulting from acquisitions for the year ended December 31, Property Type 2004 2003 Change (in thousands) Senior housing facilities $34,672 $6,016 $28,656 Other healthcare facilities 5,931 252 5,679 Total $40,603 $6,268 $34,335 We also recognized $5.7 million of rental income during the fourth quarter of 2004 resulting from a change in estimate related to the collectibility of straight line rental income from ARC. The consolidation 39 of five joint ventures upon the adoption of FIN 46R, effective January 2004, increased reported triple net lease rental income by approximately $2.8 million. Equity income (loss). Equity income decreased 25% to $2.2 million primarily due to our acquisition of four retirement living facilities in September 2003 which were accounted for under the equity method. This was offset by higher HCP MOP interest expense following HCP MOP obtaining $288 million of non recourse mortgage debt in early 2004. During 2004 and 2003, we recognized $1.5 million and $1.7 million of equity income from HCP MOP, respectively. At December 31, 2004, 100 properties were held by unconsolidated joint ventures, including HCP MOP, compared to 115 properties at December 31, 2003. Interest and other income. Interest and other income decreased 25% to $36.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The change reflects the net effects of (i) $4.6 million of revenue from the recognition of ARC interest income upon the repayment by ARC during 2004 of $83 million of debt and accrued interest thereon, and (ii) a reduced level of loans receivable following the aforementioned repayment from ARC and a $17 million repayment from Emeritus. During 2004 and 2003, we also recognized management and other fees from HCP MOP of $3.1 million and $2.5 million, respectively. Other income in 2003 includes a $3.4 million tax related accrual reversal related to our 1999 acquisition of American Health Properties. Interest expense. Interest expense decreased 1% to $87.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The change was due to a decrease in overall interest rates, offset by minor increases in borrowing levels. The table below sets forth information with respect to our debt as of December 31, 2004 and 2003: As of December 31, 2004 2003 (dollars in thousands) Balance: Fixed rate $1,153,012 $1,209,154 Variable rate 337,010 202,075 Total $1,490,022 $1,411,229 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate 77 % 86 % Variable rate 23 % 14 % Total 100 % 100 % Weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 6.76 % 7.07 % Variable rate 3.09 % 2.07 % Total weighted average rates 5.93 % 6.35 % Depreciation and amortization. Real estate depreciation and amortization increased 19% to $85.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in depreciation and amortization of $13.5 million primarily relates to our acquisitions in 2004 and 2003, as detailed below: Depreciation and amortization resulting from acquisitions for the year ended December 31, Property Type 2004 2003 Change (in thousands) Senior housing facilities $11,055 $1,892 $9,163 Medical office buildings 4,221 913 3,308 Other healthcare facilities 894 96 798 Total $16,170 $2,901 $13,269 40 Operating expenses. Operating costs increased 24% to $42.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Operating costs are predominantly related to MOB properties that are leased under gross or modified gross lease agreements where we share certain costs with tenants. Additionally, we contract with third party property managers for most of our MOB properties. Accordingly, the number of properties in our MOB portfolio directly impacts operating costs. The increase in operating expenses of $8.2 million primarily relates to the effect of our acquisitions in 2004 and 2003, as detailed below: Operating expenses resulting from acquisitions for the year ended December 31, Property Type 2004 2003 Change (in thousands) Medical office buildings $6,107 $864 $5,243 Other healthcare facilities 2,064 2,064 Total $8,171 $864 $7,307 The presentation of expenses between general and administrative and operating expenses is based on the underlying nature of the expense. Periodically, we review the classification of expenses between categories and make revisions based on changes in the underlying nature of the expense. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased 63% to $36.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was due to higher costs in 2004 primarily resulting from income tax expense of $1.5 million on income from certain assets held in a taxable REIT subsidiary and the implementation of a new information system and considerable resources that were expended towards initial compliance with certain regulatory requirements, principally Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. Also contributing to the increase was $0.7 million in expenses associated with the move of our corporate offices to Long Beach, California and a charge of $1.6 million related to the settlement of a lawsuit filed against us by our former Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Discontinued operations. Income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2004, was $14.9 million compared to $18.3 million for the comparable period in the prior year. The change is primarily due to an increase in impairment charges of $3.9 million year over year. The year over year increase in gains on sale of $8.9 million was predominantly offset by comparable period decrease in operating income of $8.5 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal liquidity needs are to (i) fund normal operating expenses, (ii) meet debt service requirements, (iii) fund capital expenditures including tenant improvements and leasing costs, (iv) fund acquisition and development activities, and (v) make minimum distributions required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code, as amended. We believe these needs will be satisfied using cash flows generated by operations and provided by financing activities. We intend to repay maturing debt with proceeds from future debt and or equity offerings and anticipate making future investments dependent on the availability of cost effective sources of capital. We use the public debt and equity markets as our principal source of financing. As of December 31, 2005, our senior debt is rated BBB+ by both Standard & Poors Ratings Group and Fitch Ratings and Baa2 by Moodys Investors Service. Net cash provided by operating activities was $282.1 million and $272.5 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively. Cash flow from operations reflects increased revenues offset by higher costs and expenses, and changes in receivables, payables, accruals, and deferred revenue. Our cash flows from operations are dependent upon the occupancy level of multi tenant buildings, rental rates on leases, our tenants performance on their lease obligations, the level of operating expenses, and other factors. 41 Net cash used in investing activities was $414.8 million during 2005 and principally reflects the net effect of: (i) $64.6 million received from the sale of several facilities, (ii) $447.2 million principally used to fund acquisitions and construction of real estate, (iii) $53.3 million used to fund investments in loans receivable and (iv) $19.1 million in principal repayments received on loans. During 2005 and 2004, we used $7.1 million and $3.4 million to fund lease commissions and tenant and capital improvements, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities was $137.1 million for 2005 and includes proceeds of $45.2 million from common stock issuances, and $445.5 million from senior note issuances. These proceeds were partially offset by: (i) the repayment of $31.0 million of senior notes, (ii) net repayment of $41.5 million of our line of credit, (iii) payment of common and preferred dividends aggregating $248.4 million, and (iv) repayments on mortgage debt of $17.9 million. In order to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we must distribute at least 90% of our taxable income to our shareholders. Accordingly, we intend to continue to make regular quarterly distributions to holders of our common and preferred stock. At December 31, 2005, we held approximately $11.9 million in deposits and $44.2 million in irrevocable letters of credit from commercial banks securing tenants lease obligations and borrowers loan obligations. We may draw upon the letters of credit or depository accounts if there are defaults under the related leases or loans. Amounts available under letters of credit could change based upon facility operating conditions and other factors and such changes may be material. Bank Line of Credit, Mortgage Debt and Senior Unsecured Notes At December 31, 2005, we had the following outstanding debt: Bank line of credit. Borrowings under our $500 million three year bank line of credit were $258.6 million with an interest rate of 5.01% at December 31, 2005. Borrowings under the bank line of credit accrue interest at 65 basis points over the London Inter Bank Offering Rate (LIBOR) with a 15 basis point facility fee. In addition, a negotiated rate option, whereby the lenders participating in the credit facility bid on the interest to be charged and which may result in a reduced interest rate, is available for up to 50% of borrowings. The credit facility also contains an accordion feature allowing borrowings to be increased by $100 million in certain conditions. The credit agreement contains certain financial restrictions and requirements customary in transactions of this type. The more significant covenants, using terms defined in the agreement, limit the ratios of (i) Consolidated Total Indebtedness to Consolidated Total Asset Value to 60%, (ii) Secured Debt to Consolidated Total Asset Value to 30% and (iii) Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Unencumbered Asset Value to 60%. We must also maintain (i) a Fixed Charge Coverage ratio, as defined, of 1.75 times and (ii) a formula determined Minimum Tangible Net Worth. As of December 31, 2005, we were in compliance with each of these restrictions and requirements. Mortgage debt. At December 31, 2005, we had $236.1 million in mortgage debt secured by 38 healthcare facilities with a carrying amount of $384.5 million. Interest rates on the mortgage notes ranged from 2.75% to 9.32% with a weighted average rate of 7.05% at December 31, 2005. The instruments encumbering the properties restrict title transfer of the respective properties subject to the terms of the mortgage, prohibit additional liens, require payment of real estate taxes, maintenance of the properties in good condition and maintenance of insurance on the properties and include a requirement to obtain lender consent to enter into material tenant leases. Senior unsecured notes. At December 31, 2005 we had $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding. Interest rates on the notes ranged from 4.875% to 7.875% with a weighted average rate of 6.23% at December 31, 2005. 42 On April 27, 2005, we issued $250 million of 5.625% senior unsecured notes due in 2017. The notes were priced at 99.585% of the principal amount with an effective yield of 5.673%. We received proceeds of $247 million, which were used to repay outstanding indebtedness and for general corporate purposes. Senior unsecured notes at December 31, 2004, included $200 million principal amount of Mandatory Par Put Remarketed Securities (MOPPRS), due June 8, 2015. The MOPPRS contained an option (the MOPPRS Option) exercisable by the Remarketing Dealer, an investment bank affiliate, which derived its value from the yield on ten year U.S. Treasury rates relative to a fixed strike rate of 5.565%. Generally, the value of the option to the Remarketing Dealer increased as ten year Treasury rates declined and the options value to the Remarketing Dealer decreased as ten year Treasury rates increased. On June 3, 2005, the Remarketing Dealer exercised its option to redeem our $200 million principal amount of 6.875% MOPPRS. The Remarketing Dealer redeemed the securities from the holders at par plus accrued interest, and reissued ten year senior notes with a coupon of 7.072%. The reissued notes are at an effective interest rate which is higher than what would otherwise have been available if we had issued new ten year notes at par value. On September 16, 2005, we issued $200 million of 4.875% senior unsecured notes due in 2010. The notes were priced at 99.567% of the principal amount with an effective yield of 4.974%. We received net proceeds of $198 million, which were used to repay outstanding indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we repaid $31 million of maturing senior unsecured notes which accrued interest at a rate of 7.5%. These notes were repaid with funds available under our bank line of credit. Debt Maturities The following table summarizes our stated debt maturities and scheduled principal repayments at December 31, 2005 (in thousands): Year Amount 2006 $ 140,228 2007 409,362 2008 19,922 2009 10,814 2010 271,595 Thereafter 1,106,510 $ 1,958,431 Equity At December 31, 2005, we had outstanding 4,000,000 shares of 7.25% Series E cumulative redeemable preferred stock, 7,820,000 shares of 7.10% Series F cumulative redeemable preferred stock, and 136 million shares of common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we issued approximately 878,000 shares of our common stock under our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan at an average price per share of $25.80 for proceeds of $22.6 million. We also received $22.9 million in proceeds from stock option exercises. At December 31, 2005, stockholders equity totaled $1.4 billion and our equity securities had a market value of $3.9 billion. As of December 31, 2005, there were a total of 3.4 million DownREIT units outstanding in five limited liability companies in which we are the managing member (i) HCPI/Tennessee, LLC; 43 (ii) HCPI/Utah, LLC; (iii) HCPI/Utah II, LLC; (iv) HCPI/Indiana, LLC; and (v) HCP DR California, LLC. The DownREIT units are exchangeable for an amount of cash approximating the then current market value of shares of our common stock or, at our option, shares of our common stock (subject to certain adjustments, such as stock splits and reclassifications). The 3.4 million DownREIT units outstanding at December 31, 2005, are convertible into 6.0 million shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2005, we had $1.06 billion available for future issuances of debt and equity securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These securities may be issued from time to time in the future based on our needs and the then existing market conditions Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We own interests in certain unconsolidated joint ventures, including HCP MOP, as described under Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Except in limited circumstances, our risk of loss is limited to our investment carrying amount and any outstanding loans receivable. We have no other material off balance sheet arrangements that we expect to materially affect our liquidity and capital resources except these described under Contractual Obligations. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our material contractual payment obligations and commitments at December 31, 2005 (in thousands): One Year or Less 2007 2008 2009 2010 More than Five Years Total Unsecured senior notes and mortgage debt $ 140,228 $ 170,684 $ 282,409 $ 1,106,510 $ 1,699,831 Revolving line of credit 258,600 258,600 Acquisition and construction commitments 32,561 32,561 Operating leases 1,353 2,777 2,874 117,760 124,764 Interest payments 98,954 173,439 163,837 319,820 756,050 Total $ 273,096 $ 605,500 $ 449,120 $ 1,544,090 $ 2,871,806 Inflation Our leases often provide for either fixed increases in base rents or indexed escalators, based on the Consumer Price Index or other measures, and or additional rent based on increases in the tenants revenue from the facility. Substantially all of our MOB leases require the tenant to pay a share of property operating costs such as real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, etc. We believe that inflationary increases in expenses will be offset, in part, by the tenant expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases described above. New Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the impact of new accounting standards. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk At December 31, 2005, we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on $57.3 million of variable rate mortgage notes payable, $258.6 million of variable rate bank debt and $25.0 million of variable rate senior unsecured notes. Of the $57.3 million of variable rate mortgage notes payable 44 outstanding, $45.6 million has been hedged through interest rate swap contracts. We do not have any, and do not plan to enter into, derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Of our consolidated debt of $2.0 billion at December 31, 2005, excluding the $45.6 million of variable rate debt where the rates have been hedged to fixed rates, approximately 15% is at variable interest rates. Fluctuation in the interest rate environment will not affect our future earnings and cash flows on our fixed rate debt until that debt must be replaced or refinanced. However, interest rate changes will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments and our hedge contracts. Conversely, changes in interest rates on variable rate debt would change our future earnings and cash flows, but not affect the fair value of those instruments. Assuming a one percentage point increase in the interest rate related to the variable rate debt and related swap contracts, and assuming no change in the outstanding balance as of December 31, 2005, interest expense for 2005 would increase by approximately $3 million, or $0.02 per common share on a diluted basis. The principal amount and the average interest rates for our mortgage loans receivable and debt categorized by maturity dates is presented in the table below. The fair value estimates for the mortgage loans receivable are based on the estimates of management and on rates currently prevailing for comparable loans. The fair market value estimates for debt securities are based on discounting future cash flows utilizing current rates offered to us for debt of the same type and remaining maturity.
