We develop, acquire and manage healthcare real estate and provide mortgage financing to healthcare providers. We invest directly, often structuring sale leaseback transactions, and through joint ventures. At December 31, 2006, our real estate portfolio, excluding assets held for sale but including assets held through joint ventures and mortgage loans, consisted of interests in 731 facilities. Our business strategy is based on three principles: (i) opportunistic investing, (ii) portfolio diversification and (iii) conservative financing. We actively redeploy capital from investments with lower return potential into assets with higher return potential, and recycle capital from shorter term to longer term investments. We make investments where the expected risk adjusted return exceeds our cost of capital and strive to leverage our operator and other business relationships. Our strategy contemplates acquiring and developing properties on favorable terms. We attempt to structure transactions that are tax advantaged and mitigate risks in our underwriting process. Generally, we prefer larger, more complex private transactions that leverage our management teams experience and our infrastructure. In addition, we follow a disciplined approach to enhancing the value of our existing portfolio, including the ongoing evaluation of properties that no longer fit our strategy for potential disposition. We primarily generate revenue by leasing healthcare related properties under long term leases. Most of our rents and other earned income from leases are received under triple net leases; however, MOB rents are typically structured as gross or modified gross leases. Accordingly, for MOBs we incur certain property operating expenses, such as real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance, property management fees, utilities and insurance. Our growth depends, in part, on our ability to (i) increase rental income and other earned income from leases by increasing occupancy levels and rental rates, (ii) maximize tenant recoveries given underlying lease structures, and (iii) control operating and other expenses. Our operations are impacted by property specific, market specific, general economic and other conditions. Access to external capital on favorable terms is critical to the success of our strategy. We attempt to match the long term duration of our leases with long term fixed rate financing. At December 31, 2006, 27% of our consolidated debt is at variable interest rates, which includes a $0.5 billion term loan that was used to pay the cash consideration of our merger with CRP. We repaid the remaining balance of the term loan with proceeds from our January 2007 capital market transactions, which further reduced our variable interest rate exposure. We intend to maintain an investment grade rating on our fixed income securities and manage various capital ratios and amounts within appropriate parameters. As of December 31, 2006, our senior debt is rated BBB by Standard & Poors Ratings Group, BBB by Fitch Ratings and Baa3 by Moodys Investors Service. Capital market access impacts our cost of capital and our ability to refinance existing indebtedness as it matures, as well as to fund future acquisitions and development through the issuance of additional securities. Our ability to access capital on favorable terms is dependent on various factors, including general market conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our securities, perception of our potential future earnings and cash distributions, and the market price of our capital stock. Transaction Overview Mergers with CNL Retirement Properties, Inc. and CNL Retirement Corp. On October 5, 2006, we closed our merger with CNL Retirement Properties, Inc. (CRP) for aggregate consideration of approximately $5.3 billion. In the CRP merger, we paid an aggregate of $2.9 billion of cash, issued 22.8 million shares of our common stock, and we either assumed or refinanced 39 approximately $1.7 billion of CRPs outstanding debt. We initially financed the cash consideration paid to CRP stockholders and the expenses related to the transaction through an offering of senior notes, a draw down under new term and bridge loan facilities and a new three year revolving credit facility. Our results of operations for 2006 include the results of the combined company beginning on October 5, 2006. For more information about the CRP merger, see Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Simultaneous with the closing of the merger with CRP, we also merged with CNL Retirement Corp. (CRC) for aggregate consideration of approximately $120 million, which included the issuance of 4.4 million shares of our common stock. Investment Transactions During 2006, including the CRP merger discussed above, we acquired interests in properties aggregating $5.9 billion with an average yield of 6.9%. Our 2006 investments were made in the following healthcare sectors: (i) 77% senior housing facilities; (ii) 19% MOBs; (iii) 3% hospitals; and (iv) 1% other healthcare facilities. Our 2006 real estate investments included the following: During the three months ended March 31, 2006, we acquired 13 medical office buildings for $138 million, including non managing member LLC units (DownREIT units) valued at $6 million, in related transactions. The 13 buildings, with 730,000 rentable square feet, have an initial yield of 7.3%. On May 31, 2006, we acquired nine assisted living and independent living facilities for $99 million, including assumed debt valued at $61 million, through a sale leaseback transaction. These facilities have an initial lease term of ten years, with two ten year renewal options. The initial annual lease rate is approximately 8.0% with annual CPI based escalators. On November 30, 2006, we acquired four assisted living and independent living facilities for $51 million, through a sale leaseback transaction. These facilities have an initial lease term of ten years, with two ten year renewal options. The initial annual lease rate is approximately 8.0% with annual escalators based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI). During 2006, we sold 83 properties for $512 million and recognized gains of approximately $275 million. These sales included 69 SNFs sold on December 1, 2006, for $392 million with gains of approximately $226 million. On or before December 1, 2006, tenants for nine SNFs exercised rights of first refusal to acquire such facilities. The sales of the nine SNFs for $52 million are expected to be completed by June 30, 2007. On November 17, 2006, we purchased $300 million senior secured notes issued by a HCA Inc. These notes accrue interest at 9.625%, mature on November 15, 2016, and are secured by second priority liens on the HCAs and its subsidiary guarantors assets. On January 31, 2007, we acquired three long term acute care hospitals and received proceeds of $36 million in exchange for 11 skilled nursing facilities valued at approximately $77 million. The three acquired properties have an initial lease term of ten years with two ten year renewal options, and initial contractual yield of 12% with escalators based on the lessees revenue growth. The acquired properties are included in a new master lease that contains 14 properties leased to the same operator. On February 9, 2007, we acquired the Medical City Dallas campus, which includes two hospital towers, six medical office buildings, and three parking garages, for approximately $347 million, including non managing member LLC units (DownREIT units) valued at $174 million. The initial yield on this campus is approximately 7.3%. 40 Joint Venture Transactions On October 27, 2006, we formed an MOB joint venture with an institutional capital partner. The joint venture includes 13 properties valued at $140 million and encumbered by $92 million of mortgage debt. Upon formation, we received approximately $36 million in proceeds, including a one time acquisition fee of $0.7 million. We retained an effective 26% interest in the venture, will act as the managing member, and will receive ongoing asset management fees. On November 30, 2006, we acquired the interest held by an affiliate of General Electric Company (GE) in HCP Medical Office Portfolio, LLC (HCP MOP), for $141 million. We are now the sole owner of the venture and its 59 MOBs, which have approximately four million rentable square feet. At closing, $251 million of mortgage debt encumbered these MOBs. On January 5, 2007, we formed a senior housing joint venture with an institutional capital partner. The joint venture includes 25 properties valued at $1.1 billion and encumbered by a $686 million secured debt facility. Upon formation, we received approximately $280 million in proceeds, including a one time acquisition fee of $5.4 million. Including the $446 million recently received from the secured debt facility with Fannie Mae discussed below, we received $726 million in total proceeds. We retained a 35% interest in the venture, will act as the managing member, and will receive ongoing asset management fees. Capital Market Transactions During 2006, in addition to the mortgage debt issued under the Fannie Mae facility discussed below, we obtained $165 million of ten year mortgage financing with a weighted average effective yield of 6.36% in five separate transactions. We received net proceeds of $162 million, which were used to repay outstanding indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes. On February 27, 2006, we issued $150 million of 5.625% senior unsecured notes due in 2013. The notes were priced at 99.071% of the principal amount for an effective yield of 5.788%. We received net proceeds of $149 million, which were used to repay outstanding indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes. On September 19, 2006, we issued $1 billion of senior unsecured notes, which consisted of $300 million of floating rate notes due in 2008, $300 million of 5.95% notes due in 2011, and $400 million of 6.30% notes due in 2016. We received net proceeds of $994 million, which together with cash on hand and borrowings under the new credit facilities were used to repay our then existing credit facility and to finance the CRP merger. On October 5, 2006, in connection with the CRP merger, we entered into credit agreements with a syndicate of banks providing for aggregate borrowings of $3.4 billion. The credit facilities included a $0.7 billion bridge loan, a $1.7 billion two year term loan, and a $1.0 billion three year revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2006, we had repaid the bridge loan and borrowings under the term loan were reduced to $0.5 billion. In addition, through our capital market transactions in January 2007, we fully repaid the balance outstanding under the term loan. On November 10, 2006, we issued 33.5 million shares of common stock. We received net proceeds of approximately $960 million, which were used to repay our bridge loan facility and borrowings under our term loan and revolving credit facilities. On December 4, 2006, we issued $400 million of 5.65% senior unsecured notes due in 2013. The notes were priced at 99.768% of the principal amount for an effective yield of 5.69%. We received net proceeds of $396 million, which were used to repay borrowings under our term loan facility. On December 21, 2006, in anticipation of our senior housing joint venture that closed on January 5, 2007, we expanded an existing secured debt facility with Fannie Mae to $686 million, receiving $446 million 41 in proceeds. The Fannie Mae facility bears interest at a weighted average rate of 5.66%. The funds from the expanded debt facility were used to repay borrowings under our term loan facility. On January 19, 2007, we issued 6.8 million shares of common stock. We received net proceeds of approximately $261 million, which were used to repay borrowings under our term loan facility. On January 22, 2007, we issued $500 million of 6.00% senior unsecured notes due in 2017. The notes were priced at 99.323% of the principal amount for an effective yield of 6.09%. We received net proceeds of $493 million, which were used to repay borrowings under our term loan and revolving credit facilities. Other Events During the year ended December 31, 2006, we issued approximately 797,000 shares of our common stock under our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan at an average price per share of $28.68 for proceeds of $22.9 million. Quarterly dividends paid during 2006 aggregated $1.70 per share. On January 29, 2007, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly common stock cash dividend of $0.445 per share. The common stock dividend will be paid on February 21, 2007, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 5, 2007. The annualized rate of distribution for 2007 is $1.78, compared with $1.70 for 2006, which represents a 4.7% increase. Our Board of Directors has determined to continue its policy of considering dividend increases on an annual rather than quarterly basis. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base estimates on our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different, it is possible that different accounting would have been applied, resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. From time to time, we re evaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Principles of Consolidation Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of HCP, its wholly owned subsidiaries and its controlled, through voting rights or other means, joint ventures. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. We have adopted Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, as revised (FIN 46R), effective January 1, 2004 for variable interest entities created before February 1, 2003 and effective in fiscal year 2003 for variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003. FIN 46R provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights (variable interest entities or VIEs) and the determination of which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. A variable interest entity is broadly defined as an entity where either (i) the equity investors as a group, if any, do not have a controlling financial interest or (ii) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entitys activities without additional subordinated financial support. We consolidate investments in VIEs when it is determined that we are the primary beneficiary of 42 the VIE at either the creation of the variable interest entity or upon the occurrence of a reconsideration event. The adoption of FIN 46R resulted in the consolidation of five joint ventures with aggregate assets of $18.5 million, effective January 1, 2004, that were previously accounted for under the equity method. The consolidation of these joint ventures did not have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements or results of operations. We lease 76 properties to a total of 9 tenants that have been identified as VIEs. We acquired these leases (variable interests) on October 5, 2006 in our acquisition of CRP. CRP determined they were not the primary beneficiary of the VIEs, and we are generally required to carry forward CRPs accounting conclusions after the acqusition relative to their primary beneficiary assessment. We may need to reassess whether we are the primary beneficiary in the future upon the occurrence of a reconsideration event, as defined by FIN 46R. If we determine that we are the primary beneficiary in the future and consolidate the tenant, our financial statements would reflect the tenants facility level revenues and expenses rather than lease revenue. Our maximum exposure to losses resulting from our involvement in these VIEs is limited to the future minimum lease payments to be received from these leases, which totaled $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2006. If we are required to consolidate any VIE in the future, we will depend on the VIE to provide us timely financial information, and we will rely on the internal controls of the VIE. If the VIE does not provide us with timely financial information, or has deficiencies in its financial reporting internal controls, this may adversely impact our financial reporting and our internal controls over financial reporting. We adopted Emerging Issues Task Force Issue (EITF) 04 5, Investors Accounting for an Investment in a Limited Partnership When the Investor is the Sole General Partner and the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights (EITF 04 5), effective June 2005. The issue concludes as to what rights held by the limited partner(s) preclude consolidation in circumstances in which the sole general partner would otherwise consolidate the limited partnership in accordance with GAAP. The assessment of limited partners rights and their impact on the presumption of control of the limited partnership by the sole general partner should be made when an investor becomes the sole general partner and should be reassessed if (i) there is a change to the terms or in the exercisability of the rights of the limited partners, (ii) the sole general partner increases or decreases its ownership of limited partnership interests, or (iii) there is an increase or decrease in the number of outstanding limited partnership interests. This EITF also applies to managing members in limited liability companies. The adoption of EITF 04 5 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Investments in entities which we do not consolidate but for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are reported under the equity method. Generally, under the equity method of accounting, our share of the investees earnings or loss is included in our operating results. Revenue Recognition Rental income from tenants is recognized in accordance with GAAP, including Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition (SAB 104). For leases with minimum scheduled rent increases, we recognize income on a straight line basis over the lease term when collectibility is reasonably assured. Recognizing rental income on a straight line basis for leases results in recognized revenue exceeding amounts contractually due from tenants. Such cumulative excess amounts are included in other assets and were $35.6 million and $18.4 million, net of allowances, at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In the event we determine that collectibility of straight line rents is not reasonably assured, we limit future recognition to amounts contractually owed, and, where appropriate, we establish an allowance for estimated losses. Certain leases provide for additional rents based upon a percentage of the facilitys revenue in excess of specified base periods or other thresholds. Such revenue is deferred until the related thresholds are achieved. 43 We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants and borrowers on an ongoing basis. This evaluation considers industry and economic conditions, property performance, security deposits and guarantees, and other matters. We establish provisions and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the possible inability of our tenants and borrowers to make payments sufficient to recover recognized assets. For straight line rent amounts, our assessment is based on income recoverable over the term of the lease. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had an allowance of $29.7 million and $21.6 million, respectively, included in other assets, as a result of our determination that collectibility is not reasonably assured for certain straight line rent amounts. Real Estate Real estate, consisting of land, buildings, and improvements, is recorded at cost. We allocate the cost of the acquisition to the acquired tangible and identified intangible assets and liabilities, primarily lease related intangibles, based on their estimated fair values in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141, Business Combinations. We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and or capitalization rates, third party appraisals, and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. We record acquired above and below market leases at their fair value, using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired, equal to the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in place lease and (ii) managements estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below market fixed rate renewal options for below market leases. Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenants lease. Factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods, market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, we include estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods, depending on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, we consider leasing commissions, legal and other related costs. Impairment of Long Lived Assets We assess the carrying value of our long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable and, with respect to goodwill, at least annually applying a fair value based test. If the sum of the expected future net undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the long lived asset, an impairment loss will be recognized by adjusting the assets carrying amount to its estimated fair value. The determination of the fair value of long lived assets, including goodwill, involves significant judgment. This judgment is based on our analysis and estimates of the future operating results and resulting cash flows of each long lived asset. Our ability to accurately predict future operating results and cash flows impacts the determination of fair value. Net Investment in Direct Financing Leases We use the direct finance method of accounting to record income from direct financing leases. For leases accounted for as direct financing leases, future minimum lease payments are recorded as a receivable. The difference between the rents receivable and the estimated residual values less the cost of the properties is recorded as unearned income. Unearned income is deferred and amortized to income over the lease terms to provide a constant rate of return. Investments in direct financing leases are presented net of unamortized unearned income. Direct financing leases have initial terms that range from 44 5 to 35 years and provide for minimum annual rent. Certain leases contain provisions that allow the tenants to elect to purchase the properties during or at the end of the lease terms for the aggregate initial investment amount plus adjustments, if any, as defined in the lease agreements. Certain leases also permit the Company to require the tenants to purchase the properties at the end of the lease terms. Results of Operations Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2006 to the year ended December 31, 2005 On October 5, 2006, we completed our merger with CRP. On November 30, 2006, we acquired the interest held by an affiliate of GE in HCP MOP, which resulted in the consolidation of HCP MOP beginning on that date. The impact on various income statement line items from our merger with CRP and consolidation of HCP MOP are discussed below. Rental and related revenue. MOB rental revenue increased 49.5% or $62.8 million to $189.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Approximately $23.4 million of the increase relates to MOBs acquired in the CRP merger and $5.9 million relates to the consolidation of HCP MOP. The remaining increase in MOB rental income primarily relates to the additive effect or our MOB acquisitions in 2006 and 2005. Triple net leased rental revenues increased 36.1% or $97.4 million to $367.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Approximately $56.5 million of the increase relates to properties acquired in the CRP merger. The remaining increase in triple net lease rental revenue of $40.9 million primarily relates to rent escalations and resets, and the additive effect of our other acquisitions in 2006 and 2005, as detailed below: Triple net lease rental revenue resulting from acquisitions for the year ended December 31, Property Type 2006 2005 Change (in thousands) Senior housing $ 44,322 $ 15,313 $ 29,009 Hospital 710 710 Other healthcare 3,002 117 2,885 Total $ 48,034 $ 15,430 $ 32,604 Additionally, included in triple net lease rental revenues are facility level operating revenues for five senior housing properties that were previously leased on a triple net basis. Periodically tenants default on their leases, which cause us to take temporary possession of the operations of the facility. We contract with third party managers to manage these properties until a replacement tenant can be identified or the property can be sold. The operating revenues and expenses for these properties are included in triple net lease rental revenues and operating expenses, respectively. The increase in reported revenues for these facilities of $1.9 million to $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, was primarily due to us taking possession of two of these properties in 2005 and an increase in overall occupancy of such properties. Earned income from direct financing leases. Earned income from direct financing leases of $15 million relates to 32 leased properties acquired from CRP which are accounted for using the direct financing method. At December 31, 2006, these leased properties had a carrying value of $678 million and accrue interest at a weighted average rate of 9.0%. Equity income. Equity income increased by $9.5 million to $8.3 million primarily due to our investment in HCP MOP, for which we recorded equity income of $7.8 million and equity losses of $1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. During the year ended 45 December 31, 2006, HCP MOP sold 34 MOBs for approximately $100.7 million, net of transaction costs, and recognized aggregate gains of $19.7 million. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on HCP MOP. On November 30, 2006, we acquired the interest held by an affiliate of GE in HCP MOP, which resulted in us becoming the sole owner of HCP MOP and consolidating its results of operations beginning on that date. On October 27, 2006, we formed HCP Ventures III, LLC (HCP Ventures III), a joint venture with an institutional capital partner, with 13 of our previously 85% owned properties. Beginning on October 27, 2006, HCP Ventures III, in which we retained an effective 26% interest, has been accounted for as an equity method investment. Investment management fee income. Management and other fee income increased by $0.7 million to $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase is primarily due to the acquisition fee earned from HCP Ventures III of $0.7 million on October 27, 2006. Interest and other income. Interest and other income increased by $11.9 million to $34.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily related to $3.5 million of interest income from a $300 million investment in senior secured notes receivable purchased on November 17, 2006, which accrue interest at a rate of 9.625%. In addition, we recognized income of $7.3 million in connection with a prepayment premium we received in the second quarter of 2006, upon the early repayment of a secured loan receivable of $30.0 million with an original maturity of May 1, 2010 and an interest rate of 11.4%. Interest expense. Interest expense increased $106.1 million to $213.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Approximately $42.1 million of the increase was due to the assumption of $1.3 billion of CRPs outstanding debt and interest related to our term and bridge loans which were used to fund the CRP merger. In addition, we wrote off the unamortized balance of deferred financing fees from the refinancing of our previous revolving line of credit and the early repayment of our bridge loan and portions of our term loan which in the aggregate resulted in interest expense of $9.0 million. The remaining increase was due to increased borrowing levels resulting from the issuance of senior notes, issuance of additional mortgages, and increased borrowing levels on our existing revolving credit facility. This higher interest expense was offset by the repayment of an aggregate of $255 million of senior notes in February and October 2006. As of December 31, 2006, we had repaid the bridge loan and borrowings under the term loan were reduced to $0.5 billion. In addition, through our capital market transactions in January 2007, we fully repaid the balance outstanding under the term loan. The table below sets forth information with respect to our debt: As of December 31, 2006 2005 (dollars in thousands) Balance: Fixed rate $ 4,541,237 $ 1,663,166 Variable rate 1,669,031 295,265 Total $ 6,210,268 $ 1,958,431 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate 73 % 85 % Variable rate 27 % 15 % Total 100 % 100 % Weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 5.91 % 6.33 % Variable rate 6.13 % 4.95 % Total weighted average rate 5.97 % 6.14 % 46 Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 52% or $49.4 million to $144.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Approximately $29.0 million of the increase relates to properties acquired in the CRP merger and $1.6 million relates to the consolidation of HCP MOP. The remaining increase in depreciation and amortization of $18.8 million primarily relates to the additive effect of our other acquisitions in 2006 and 2005. Operating expenses. Operating costs increased 50.4% or $29.9 million to $89.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Approximately $8.6 million of the increase relates to properties acquired in the CRP merger and $3.4 million relates to the consolidation of HCP MOP. Operating costs are predominantly related to MOB properties that are leased under gross or modified gross lease agreements where we share certain costs with tenants. Accordingly, the number of properties in our MOB portfolio directly impacts operating costs. Additionally, we contract with third party property managers for most of our MOB properties. The remaining increase in operating expenses of $17.9 million primarily relates to the effect of our other property acquisitions in 2006 and 2005, as detailed below: Operating expenses resulting from acquisitions for the year ended December 31, Property Type 2006 2005 Change (in thousands) Medical office building $ 16,752 $ 3,351 $ 13,401 Other healthcare 708 708 Total $ 17,460 $ 3,351 $ 14,109 Additionally, included in operating expenses are facility level operating expenses for five senior housing properties that were previously leased on a triple net basis. Periodically tenants default on their leases, which cause us to take temporary possession of the operations of the facility. We contract with third party managers to manage these properties until a replacement tenant can be identified or the property can be sold. The operating revenues and expenses for these properties are included in triple net lease rental revenues and operating expenses, respectively. The increase in reported operating expenses for these facilities of $2.8 million to $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, was primarily due to us taking possession of two of these properties in 2005 and an increase in overall occupancy of such properties. The presentation of expenses as general and administrative and operating expenses is based on the underlying nature of the expense. Periodically, we review the classification of expenses between categories and make revisions based on changes in the underlying nature of the expense. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased 48.6% or $15.5 million to $47.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase is primarily due to higher compensation related expenses of approximately $9.0 million resulting from an increase in full time employees. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, full time employees were 165 and 83, respectively. In addition, during 2006 we incurred $5.0 million in merger and integration related expenses associated with the CRC and CRP mergers. We expect to incur integration costs associated with the CRP merger through 2007. Discontinued operations. Income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2006, was $310.9 million compared to $57.5 million for the comparable period in the prior year. The change is due to an increase in gains on real estate dispositions of $259.1 million, net of impairments, and a decline in operating income from discontinued operations of $5.7 million. Discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2006, includes 113 properties compared to 122 properties classified as discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2005. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we sold 83 properties for $512 million as compared to 18 properties for $65 million during the year ended December 31, 2005. 47 Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2005 to the year ended December 31, 2004 Rental and related revenue. MOB rental revenue increased 35.4% to $126.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in MOB rental revenue of $33.2 million primarily relates to the additive effect of our acquisitions in 2005 and 2004, which contributed $26.7 million to rental revenues year over year. Triple net lease rental revenues increased 15.2% to $269.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in triple net lease rental revenue of $35.7 million primarily relates to the additive effect of our acquisitions in 2005 and 2004, as detailed below: Triple net lease rental revenue resulting from acquisitions for the year ended December 31, Property Type 2005 2004 Change (in thousands) Senior housing $ 44,980 $ 14,183 $ 30,797 Other healthcare 6,091 5,566 525 Total $ 51,071 $ 19,749 $ 31,322 We also recognized $5.7 million of rental income during the fourth quarter of 2004 resulting from a change in an estimate related to the collectibility of straight line rental income from ARC. Additionally, included in triple net lease rental revenues are facility level operating revenues for five senior housing properties that were previously leased on a triple net basis. Periodically tenants default on their leases, which cause us to take temporary possession of the operations of the facility. We contract with third party managers to manage these properties until a replacement tenant can be identified or the property can be sold. The operating revenues and expenses for these properties are included in triple net lease rental revenues and operating expenses, respectively. The increase in reported revenues for these facilities of $3.6 million to $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, was primarily due to us taking possession of two of these properties in 2005 and increases in overall occupancy of such properties. Equity income (loss). Equity income decreased to a loss of $1.1 million primarily due to our investment in HCP MOP, for which we recorded equity losses of $1.4 million and equity income of $1.5 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, HCP MOP revised its purchase price allocation and attributed more of the purchase price of the properties acquired from MedCap Properties, LLC to below market lease intangibles and other intangibles from real estate assets. Lease intangibles generally amortize over a shorter period of time relative to tangible real estate assets. The decrease in the equity income from our investment in HCP MOP was primarily due to the revisions to the purchase price allocations referred to above. Additionally, HCP MOP incurred repairs and other related expenses for damages caused by hurricanes Katrina and Rita of $1.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2005. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on HCP MOP. Investment management fee income. Management and other fee income decreased by $0.1 million to $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Interest and other income. Interest and other income decreased 30.0% or $9.8 million to $22.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The change reflects a reduced level of loans receivable following an $83 million repayment from ARC and a $17 million repayment from Emeritus during the third quarter of 2004. The decrease in interest and other income was partially offset by gains from the sale of various investments of $4.5 million in 2005. The gains from these investments were primarily the result of the sale of securities in 2005, which were acquired in conjunction with real estate and or leasing transactions we completed in previous years. 48 Interest expense. Interest expense increased 22.3% to $107.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was due to the issuance of $450 million of senior notes payable in April and September of 2005, the assumption of $113.5 million of mortgage notes payable in connection with the acquisitions of real estate properties, and an overall increase in short term variable rates. The table below sets forth information with respect to our debt as of December 31, 2005 and 2004: As of December 31, 2005 2004 (dollars in thousands) Balance: Fixed rate $ 1,663,166 $ 1,153,012 Variable rate 295,265 337,010 Total $ 1,958,431 $ 1,490,022 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate 85 % 77 % Variable rate 15 % 23 % Total 100 % 100 % Weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 6.33 % 6.76 % Variable rate 4.95 % 3.09 % Total weighted average rate 6.14 % 5.93 % Depreciation and amortization. Real estate depreciation and amortization increased 30.8% to $94.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in depreciation and amortization of $22.4 million primarily relates to the additive effect of our acquisitions in 2005 and 2004, as detailed below: Depreciation and amortization resulting from acquisitions for the year ended December 31, Property Type 2005 2004 Change (in thousands) Senior housing $ 15,697 $ 5,258 $ 10,439 Medical office building 10,981 651 10,330 Other healthcare 810 766 44 Total $ 27,488 $ 6,675 $ 20,813 Operating expenses. Operating costs increased 39.6% to $59.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Operating costs are predominantly related to MOB properties that are leased under gross or modified gross lease agreements where we share certain costs with tenants. Accordingly, the number of properties in our MOB portfolio directly impacts operating costs. The increase in operating expenses of $16.8 million primarily relates to the effect of our acquisitions in 2005 and 2004, as detailed below: Operating expenses resulting from acquisitions for the year ended December 31, Property Type 2005 2004 Change (in thousands) Medical office building $ 11,796 $ 662 $ 11,134 Other healthcare 2,187 2,064 123 Total $ 13,983 $ 2,726 $ 11,257 49 Additionally, included in operating expenses are facility level operating expenses for five senior housing properties that were previously leased on a triple net basis. Periodically tenants default on their leases, which cause us to take temporary possession of the operations of the facility. We contract with third party managers to manage these properties until a replacement tenant can be identified or the property can be sold. The operating revenues and expenses for these properties are included in triple net lease rental revenues and operating expenses, respectively. The increase in reported operating expenses for these facilities of $3.6 million to $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, was primarily due to us taking possession of two of these properties in 2005 and an increase in the overall occupancy of such properties. The presentation of expenses between general and administrative and operating expenses is based on the underlying nature of the expense. Periodically, we review the classification of expenses between categories and make revisions based on changes in the underlying nature of the expense. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased 13.2% to $31.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The decrease was due to higher costs in 2004 primarily resulting from $1.5 million of income tax expense on income from certain assets held in a taxable REIT subsidiary, the implementation of a new information system, considerable resources that were expended towards initial compliance with certain regulatory requirements, principally Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, $0.7 million in expenses associated with the relocation of our corporate offices to Long Beach, California in 2004 and a charge of $1.6 million related to the settlement of a lawsuit filed against us by our former Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Offsetting the decrease from 2004 was an increase in compensation related expenses due to an increase in full time employees from 74 at December 31, 2004, to 83 at December 31, 2005. Discontinued operations. Income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $57.5 million compared to $54.9 million for the comparable period in the prior year. The change is due to an increase in the year over year gains on sale of real estate of $5.7 million and a decline of operating income of $3.2 million associated with discontinued operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal liquidity needs are to (i) fund normal operating expenses, (ii) repay remaining portions of the CRP merger related borrowings, (iii) meet debt service requirements, (iv) fund capital expenditures, including tenant improvements and leasing costs, (v) fund acquisition and development activities, and (vi) make minimum distributions required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code, as amended. We repaid remaining portions of the CRP merger related borrowings through our joint venture and capital market transactions in January 2007. We believe these other needs will be satisfied using cash flows generated by operations and provided by financing activities. We anticipate making future investments dependent on the availability of cost effective sources of capital. We intend to use our revolving credit facility, and the public debt and equity markets as our principal sources of financing. As of December 31, 2006, our senior debt is rated BBB by Standard & Poors Ratings Group, BBB by Fitch Ratings and Baa3 by Moodys Investors Service. Net cash provided by operating activities was $334 million and $282 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively. Cash flow from operations reflects increased revenues partially offset by higher costs and expenses, and changes in receivables, payables, accruals, and deferred revenue. Our cash flows from operations are dependent upon the occupancy level of multi tenant buildings, rental rates on leases, our tenants performance on their lease obligations, the level of operating expenses, and other factors. Net cash used in investing activities was $3.7 billion during 2006 and principally reflects the net effect of: (i) $3.3 billion used to acquire CRP, (ii) $618 million used to fund acquisitions and construction of real 50 estate, (iii) $512 million received from the sale of facilities, and (iv) $330 million in investment in loans receivable and debt securities. During 2006 and 2005, we used $19 million and $7 million to fund lease commissions and tenant and capital improvements, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities was $3.4 billion for 2006 and includes proceeds of $2.4 billion from borrowings under our term and bridge loans, $1.5 billion from senior note issuances, $1.0 billion from common stock issuances, $366 million of net borrowings under our bank lines of credit, and $614 million from mortgage debt issuances. These proceeds were partially offset by or used for the repayment of our term and partial repayment of bridge loans aggregating $1.9 billion, repayment of $255 million of senior notes, and payment of common and preferred dividends aggregating $267 million. In order to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we must distribute at least 90% of our taxable income to our shareholders. Accordingly, we intend to continue to make regular quarterly distributions to holders of our common and preferred stock. At December 31, 2006, we held approximately $36 million in deposits and $42 million in irrevocable letters of credit from commercial banks securing tenants lease obligations and borrowers loan obligations. We may draw upon the letters of credit or depository accounts if there are defaults under the related leases or loans. Amounts available under letters of credit could change based upon facility operating conditions and other factors, and such changes may be material. Debt Bank lines of credit. In connection with the CRP merger, we entered into credit agreements with a syndicate of banks providing for aggregate borrowings of $3.4 billion. The facilities included a $0.7 billion bridge loan, a $1.7 billion two year term loan, and a $1.0 billion three year revolving credit facility. We repaid the bridge loan facility on November 10, 2006. Our bridge loan facility accrued interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.60% to 1.35%, depending upon our debt ratings. At December 31, 2006, borrowings under our term loan facility were $504.6 million with a weighted average rate of 6.22%. We repaid all amounts outstanding under the term loan with proceeds from our capital market transactions completed in January 2007. At December 31, 2006, borrowings under our $1.0 billion revolving credit facility were $624.5 million with a weighted average interest rate of 6.05%. Our revolving credit facility matures on October 2, 2009, and accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.475% to 1.10%, depending upon our non credit enhanced senior unsecured long term debt ratings (debt ratings). We pay a facility fee on the entire revolving commitment ranging from 0.125% to 0.25%, depending upon our debt ratings. The revolving credit facility contains a negotiated rate option, which is available for up to 50% of borrowings, whereby the lenders participating in the credit facility bid on the interest to be charged and which may result in a reduced interest rate. Based on our debt ratings on December 31, 2006, the margin on the revolving loan facility is 0.70% and the facility fee is 0.15%. Our revolving credit agreement contains certain financial restrictions and other customary requirements. Among other things, these covenants, using terms defined in the agreement, initially limit (i) Consolidated Total Indebtedness to Consolidated Total Asset Value to 70%, (ii) Secured Debt to Consolidated Total Asset Value to 30%, and (iii) beginning January 1, 2007, Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Unencumbered Asset Value to 100%. The agreement also requires that we maintain (i) a Fixed Charge Coverage ratio, as defined, of 1.50 times and (ii) a formula determined Minimum Tangible Net Worth. These financial covenants become more restrictive over a period of approximately two years and ultimately (i) limit Consolidated Total Indebtedness to Consolidated Total Asset Value to 60%, 51 (ii) limit Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Unencumbered Asset Value to 65%, and (iii) require a Fixed Charge Coverage ratio, as defined, of 1.75 times. Senior unsecured notes. At December 31, 2006, we had $2.7 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding. Interest rates on the notes ranged from 4.88% to 7.62% with a weighted average rate of 5.88% at December 31, 2006. Discounts and premiums are amortized to interest expense over the term of the related debt. On December 4, 2006, we issued $400 million of 5.65% senior unsecured notes due in 2013. The notes were priced at 99.768% of the principal amount for an effective yield of 5.69%. We received net proceeds of $396 million, which were used to repay borrowings under our term loan facility. On September 19, 2006, we issued $1 billion of senior unsecured notes, which consisted of $300 million of floating rate notes due in 2008, $300 million of 5.95% notes due in 2011, and $400 million of 6.30% notes due in 2016. The notes were priced at 100% of the principal amount for the floating rate notes due in 2008, 99.971% of the principal amount for an effective yield of 5.957% for the 5.95% notes due in 2011, and 99.877% of the principal amount for an effective yield of 6.317% for the 6.30% notes due in 2016. We received net proceeds of $994 million, which together with cash on hand and borrowings under the new facilities were used to repay our then existing credit facility and to finance the CRP merger. On February 27, 2006, we issued $150 million of 5.625% senior unsecured notes due in 2013. The notes were priced at 99.071% of the principal amount for an effective yield of 5.788%. We received net proceeds of $149 million, which were used to repay outstanding indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes. In February and October 2006, we repaid an aggregate of $255 million of maturing senior unsecured notes which accrued interest at a weighted average rate of 7.1%. The senior unsecured notes contain certain covenants including limitations on debt and other customary terms. Mortgage debt. At December 31, 2006, we had $2.2 billion in mortgage debt secured by 269 healthcare facilities with a carrying amount of $4.5 billion. Interest rates on the mortgage notes ranged from 3.72% to 9.32% with a weighted average rate of 6.0% at December 31, 2006. On December 21, 2006, in anticipation of our senior housing joint venture that closed on January 5, 2007, we expanded an existing secured debt facility with Fannie Mae to $686 million, receiving $446 million in proceeds. The Fannie Mae facility bears interest at a weighted average rate of 5.66%, with $119 million maturing in October 2013, and $568 million maturing in November 2016. The funds from the expanded debt facility were used to repay borrowings under our term loan facility. During 2006, in addition to the mortgage debt issued under the Fannie Mae facility discussed above, we obtained $165 million of additional ten year mortgage financing with a weighted average effective rate of 6.36% in five separate transactions. We received net proceeds of $162 million, which were used to repay outstanding indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes. The instruments encumbering the properties restrict title transfer of the respective properties subject to the terms of the mortgage, prohibit additional liens, restrict prepayment, require payment of real estate taxes, maintenance of the properties in good condition, maintenance of insurance on the properties, and include a requirement to obtain lender consent to enter into material tenant leases. Other debt. In connection with the CRP merger on October 5, 2006, we assumed $104.5 million of non interest bearing life care bonds at two of our CCRCs and non interest bearing occupancy fee deposits at another senior housing facility, all of which were payable to the related trusts of the facilities (collectively Life Care Bonds). At December 31, 2006, $61.5 million of the Life Care Bonds were 52 refundable to the residents upon the resident moving out or to a residents estate upon the residents death, and $46.2 million of the Bonds were refundable after the unit has been successfully remarketed to a new resident. Debt Maturities The following table summarizes our stated debt maturities and scheduled principal repayments at December 31, 2006 (in thousands): Year Amount 2007 $ 196,718 2008 902,821 2009 900,907 2010 508,595 2011 457,520 Thereafter 3,243,707 $ 6,210,268 Equity On October 5, 2006, we issued an aggregate of 27.2 million shares of common stock in connection with the acquisitions of CRP and CRC. On November 10, 2006, we issued 33.5 million shares of our common stock. We received net proceeds of approximately $960 million, which were used to repay our bridge loan facility and borrowings under our term loan and revolving credit facilities. At December 31, 2006, we had 4.0 million shares of 7.25% Series E cumulative redeemable preferred stock, 7.8 million shares of 7.10% Series F cumulative redeemable preferred stock, and 198.6 million shares of common stock outstanding. On January 19, 2007, we issued 6.8 million shares of our common stock. We received net proceeds of approximately $261 million, which were used to repay borrowings under our term loan and revolving credit facilities. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we issued approximately 0.8 million shares of our common stock under our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan at an average price per share of $28.68 for an aggregate amount of $22.9 million. We also received $7.9 million in proceeds from stock option exercises. At December 31, 2006, stockholders equity totaled $3.3 billion and our equity securities had a market value of $7.8 billion. As of December 31, 2006, there were a total of 3.4 million DownREIT units outstanding in six limited liability companies in which we are the managing member (i) HCPI/Tennessee, LLC; (ii) HCPI/Utah, LLC; (iii) HCPI/Utah II, LLC; (iv) HCPI/Indiana, LLC; (v) HCP DR California, LLC; and (vi) HCP DR Alabama, LLC. The DownREIT units are redeemable for an amount of cash approximating the then current market value of shares of our common stock or, at our option, shares of our common stock (subject to certain adjustments, such as stock splits and reclassifications). Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We own interests in certain unconsolidated joint ventures, including HCP Ventures III, as described under Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Except in limited circumstances, our risk of loss is limited to our investment carrying amount and any outstanding loans receivable. We have no other material off balance sheet arrangements that we expect to materially affect our liquidity and capital resources except those described under Contractual Obligations. 53 Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our material contractual payment obligations and commitments at December 31, 2006 (in thousands): Less than One Year 2008 2009 2010 2011 More than Five Years Total Senior unsecured notes and mortgage debt $ 88,972 $ 674,635 $ 966,115 $ 3,243,707 $ 4,973,429 Revolving line of credit 624,500 624,500 Term loan 504,593 504,593 Other debt 107,746 107,746 Ground and other operating leases 1,380 2,806 2,862 79,837 86,885 Acquisition and construction commitments 59,396 59,396 Interest 276,681 506,001 411,869 1,384,576 2,579,127 Total $ 534,175 $ 2,312,535 $ 1,380,846 $ 4,708,120 $ 8,935,676 Inflation Our leases often provide for either fixed increases in base rents or indexed escalators, based on the Consumer Price Index or other measures, and or additional rent based on increases in the tenants operating revenues. Substantially all of our MOB leases require the tenant to pay a share of property operating costs such as real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, etc. We believe that inflationary increases in expenses will be offset, in part, by the tenant expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases described above. New Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the impact of new accounting standards. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk At December 31, 2006, we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on $215 million of variable rate mortgage notes payable, $0.6 billion of variable rate line of credit, $0.5 billion term loan and $325 million of variable rate senior unsecured notes. Of the $215 million of variable rate mortgage notes payable outstanding, $45.6 million has been hedged through interest rate swap contracts. We do not have, and do not plan to enter into, derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Of our consolidated debt of $6.2 billion at December 31, 2006, excluding the $45.6 million of variable rate debt where the rates have been hedged to a fixed rate, approximately 26% is at variable interest rates, which includes a $0.5 billion term loan that was used to pay the cash consideration of our merger with CRP. We repaid the remaining balance of the term loan with proceeds from our January 2007 joint venture and capital market transactions, which further reduced our variable interest rate exposure. Fluctuation in the interest rates will not affect our future earnings and cash flows on our fixed rate debt until that debt must be replaced or refinanced. However, interest rate changes will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments and our hedge contracts. Conversely, changes in interest rates on variable rate debt would change our future earnings and cash flows, but not affect the fair value of those instruments. Assuming a one percentage point increase in the interest rate related to the variable rate debt and related swap contracts, and assuming no change in the outstanding balance as of December 31, 2006, interest expense for 2006 would increase by approximately $17 million, or $0.11 per common share on a diluted basis. 54 The principal amount and the average interest rates for our mortgage loans receivable and debt categorized by maturity dates is presented in the table below. The fair value estimates for the mortgage loans receivable are based on the estimates of management and on rates currently prevailing for comparable loans. The fair market value for our debt securities and senior notes payable are based on prevailing market prices. The fair market value estimates for secured loans and mortgage notes payable are based on discounting future cash flows utilizing current rates offered to us for loans and debt of the same type and remaining maturity.
