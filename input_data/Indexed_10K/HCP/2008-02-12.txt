ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Cautionary Language Regarding Forward Looking Statements Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K that are not historical factual statements are "forward looking statements." We intend to have our forward looking statements covered by the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and include this statement for purposes of complying with those provisions. Forward looking statements include, among other things, statements regarding our and our officers intent, belief or expectations as identified by the use of words such as "may," "will," "project," "expect," "believe," "intend," "anticipate," "seek," "forecast," "plan," "estimate," "could," "would," "should" and other comparable and derivative terms or the negatives thereof. In addition, we, through our officers, from time to time, make forward looking oral and written public statements concerning our expected future operations, strategies, securities offerings, growth and investment opportunities, dispositions, capital structure changes, budgets and other developments. Readers are cautioned that, while forward looking statements reflect our good faith belief and reasonable assumptions based upon current information, we can give no assurance that our expectations or forecasts will be attained. Therefore, readers should be mindful that forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that they are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. As more fully set forth under "Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors" in this report, factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations contained in the forward looking statements include: (a)Changes in federal, state or local laws and regulations, including those affecting the healthcare industry that affect our costs of compliance or increase the costs, or otherwise affect the operations of our operators, tenants and borrowers; (b)Changes in the reimbursement available to our tenants and borrowers by governmental or private payors, including changes in Medicare and Medicaid payment levels and the availability and cost of third party insurance coverage; (c)Competition for tenants and borrowers, including with respect to new leases and mortgages and the renewal or rollover of existing leases; (d)Availability of suitable properties to acquire at favorable prices and the competition for the acquisition and financing of those properties; (e)The ability of our operators, tenants and borrowers to conduct their respective businesses in a manner sufficient to maintain or increase their revenues and to generate sufficient income to make rent and loan payments to us; (f)The financial weakness of some operators and tenants, including potential bankruptcies and downturns in their businesses, which results in uncertainties regarding our ability to continue to realize the full benefit of such operators and or tenants leases; (g)Changes in national, regional and local economic conditions, including changes in interest rates and the availability and cost of capital; (h)The risk that we will not be able to sell or lease properties that are currently vacant, at all or at competitive rates; (i)The financial, legal and regulatory difficulties of significant operators of our properties, including Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. and Tenet Healthcare Corporation; (k)The risk that we may not be able to integrate acquired businesses successfully or achieve the operating efficiencies and other benefits of acquisitions within expected time frames or at all, or within expected cost projections; 43 (l)The ability to obtain financing necessary to consummate acquisitions or on favorable terms; and (m)The potential impact of existing and future litigation matters, including related developments. Except as required by law, we undertake no, and hereby disclaim any, obligation to update any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, changed circumstances or otherwise. The information set forth in this Item 7 is intended to provide readers with an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations. We will discuss and provide our analysis in the following order: Executive Summary 2007 Transaction Overview Dividends Critical Accounting Policies Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Contractual Obligations Inflation New Accounting Pronouncements Executive Summary We are a self administered REIT that, together with our consolidated subsidiaries, invests primarily in real estate serving the healthcare industry in the United States. We acquire, develop, lease, dispose and manage healthcare real estate and provide mortgage and specialty financing to healthcare providers. We invest directly, often structuring sale leaseback transactions, and through joint ventures. At December 31, 2007, our real estate portfolio, excluding assets held for sale but including mortgage loans and properties owned by joint ventures, consisted of interests in 753 facilities. Investment Strategy Our business strategy is based on three principles: (i) opportunistic investing; (ii) portfolio diversification; and (iii) conservative financing. We actively redeploy capital from investments with lower return potential into assets with higher return potential and recycle capital from shorter term to longer term investments. We make investments where the expected risk adjusted return exceeds our cost of capital and strive to leverage our operator, tenant and other business relationships. Our strategy contemplates acquiring and developing properties on terms that are favorable to us. We attempt to structure transactions that are tax advantaged and mitigate risks in our underwriting process. Generally, we prefer larger, more complex private transactions that leverage our management teams experience and our infrastructure. We follow a disciplined approach to enhancing the value of our existing portfolio, including ongoing evaluation of potential disposition of properties that no longer fit our strategy. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we sold 97 properties for $922 million and marketable securities for 44 $53 million. At December 31, 2007, we had four properties with a carrying amount of $171,000 classified as held for sale. We primarily generate revenue by leasing healthcare properties under long term leases. Most of our rents and other earned income from leases are received under triple net leases or leases that provide for substantial recovery of operating expenses; however, some of our MOB and life science facilities leases are structured as gross or modified gross leases. Accordingly, for such MOBs and life science facilities we incur certain property operating expenses, such as real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance, property management fees, utilities and insurance. Our growth depends, in part, on our ability to (i) increase rental income and other earned income from leases by increasing rental rates and occupancy levels; (ii) maximize tenant recoveries given underlying lease structures; and (iii) control operating and other expenses. Our operations are impacted by property specific, market specific, general economic and other conditions. Access to external capital on favorable terms is critical to the success of our strategy. Generally, we attempt to match the long term duration of most of our investments with long term fixed rate financing. At December 31, 2007, 37% of our consolidated debt is at variable interest rates, which includes $1.35 billion for the outstanding balance of the bridge loan that was used to finance our acquisition of SEUSA. We intend to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior debt securities and manage various capital ratios and amounts within appropriate parameters. As of December 31, 2007, we have a credit rating of Baa3 (stable) from Moodys, BBB (negative outlook) from S&P and BBB (stable) from Fitch on our senior unsecured debt securities, and Ba1 (stable) from Moodys, BBB (negative outlook) from S&P and BBB (stable) from Fitch on our preferred securities. Access to capital markets impacts our ability to refinance existing indebtedness as it matures and fund future acquisitions and development through the issuance of additional securities. Our ability to access capital on favorable terms is dependent on various factors, including general market conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our securities, perception of our potential future earnings and cash distributions, and the market price of our capital stock. 2007 Transaction Overview Investment Transactions During the year ended December 31, 2007, we made investments of approximately $4.7 billion, that had a weighted average yield on cost of approximately 7.7%, in the following segments: (i) 67% life science, (ii) 20% skilled nursing, (iii) 6% medical office, (iv) 6% hospital and (v) 1% senior housing. Our 2007 investments include the following transactions: Acquisition of Medical City Dallas Campus. On February 9, 2007, we acquired the Medical City Dallas campus, which includes two hospital towers, six MOBs and three parking garages, for approximately $350 million, including DownREIT units valued at $179 million. The initial yield on this campus is approximately 7.2%. Acquisition of Slough Estates USA Inc. On August 1, 2007, we closed our acquisition of SEUSA for aggregate cash consideration of approximately $3.0 billion. SEUSAs life science portfolio is concentrated in the San Francisco Bay Area and San Diego County and comprised 83 properties representing approximately 5.2 million square feet and an established development pipeline at closing. The results of operations of SEUSA are included in our consolidated results beginning after August 1, 2007. Manor Care Mezzanine Loan. On December 21, 2007, we made an investment in mezzanine loans with an aggregate face value of $1.0 billion, at a discount, for approximately $900 million, as part of the financing for The Carlyle Groups $6.3 billion purchase of Manor Care, Inc. These loans bear interest 45 on the face amounts at a floating rate of LIBOR plus 4.0%, mature in January 2013, are pre payable at any time subject to payment of yield maintenance during the first twelve months, and are mandatorily pre payable in January 2012 unless the borrower satisfies certain financial conditions. These loans are secured by an indirect pledge of the equity ownership in 339 HCR ManorCare facilities located in 30 states and are subordinate to other debt, approximately $3.6 billion at closing. Other Investment Transactions. For the year ended December 31, 2007, in addition to the transactions listed above, we made investments of approximately $271 million, that had a weighted average first year yield on cost of approximately 9.5%, including the following transactions: On January 31, 2007, we acquired three long term acute care hospitals and received proceeds of $36 million in exchange for 11 SNFs valued at $77 million. We recognized a $47 million gain from the sale of these 11 SNFs. The three acquired properties have an initial contractual yield of 12% with escalators based on the lessees revenue growth. The acquired properties are included in a new master lease that contains 14 properties leased to the same operator. In November and December 2007, we acquired three life science facilities with an aggregate value of approximately $46 million, including $12 million of assumed debt. The initial weighted average yield of these properties is approximately 7.1%. During 2007, we funded approximately $150 million for construction and other capital projects. For the year ended December 31, 2007, our sales of properties and marketable securities aggregated approximately $975 million and were made from the following segments: (i) 59% senior housing, (ii) 32% skilled nursing, (iii) 5% hospital and (iv) 4% medical office. Our 2007 divestitures included the following: On June 29, 2007, we sold a portfolio of 17 senior housing facilities for an aggregate price of $185 million, resulting in a gain of $3 million. This portfolio was included in our acquisition of CNL Retirement Properties, Inc. on October 5, 2006. On August 15, 2007, we sold 41 senior housing facilities to Emeritus Corporation for an aggregate price of $501.5 million, resulting in a gain of $284 million. The 3,732 unit portfolio is comprised of 33 facilities operated by Emeritus Corporation and 8 facilities operated by Summerville Senior Living, Inc. Joint Venture Transactions During the year ended December 31, 2007, we contributed an aggregate of $1.7 billion of senior housing, medical office and hospital properties into institutional joint ventures, including the transactions discussed below, On January 5, 2007, we formed a senior housing joint venture, HCP Ventures II, with an institutional capital partner. The joint venture included 25 properties valued at $1.1 billion and encumbered by $686 million in mortgage loans. Upon the sale of a 65% interest, we received approximately $280 million in proceeds, including a one time acquisition fee of $5.4 million. We act as the managing member and expect to receive ongoing asset management fees. On April 30, 2007, we formed a MOB joint venture, HCP Ventures IV, LLC ("HCP Ventures IV"), with an institutional capital partner. The joint venture included 55 properties valued at approximately $585 million and encumbered by $344 million of secured debt. Upon the sale of an 80% interest in the venture, we received proceeds of $196 million and recognized a gain on the sale of our real estate interest of $10 million. These proceeds include a one time acquisition fee of $3 million. We act as the managing member and expect to receive ongoing asset management fees. During 2007, HCP Ventures IV acquired three MOBs valued at $58 million and concurrently placed $38 million of secured debt. The acquisitions were funded pro rata by us and our joint venture partner. 46 Financing Transactions During the year ended December 31, 2007, we raised $6.3 billion in capital through the issuance of common stock, senior unsecured notes and mortgage debt, and financing related to the closing of our SEUSA acquisition, which includes the transactions discussed below. On January 19, 2007, we issued 6.8 million shares of common stock. We received net proceeds of approximately $261 million, which were used to repay a portion of the borrowings outstanding under our former term loan facility and previous revolving credit. On January 22, 2007, we issued $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.00% senior unsecured notes due in 2017. The notes were priced at 99.323% of the principal amount for an effective yield of 6.09%. We received net proceeds of approximately $493 million, which were used to repay our former term loan facility and reduce borrowings under our former revolving credit facility. On April 27, 2007, in anticipation of the formation of HCP Ventures IV, discussed above, we placed $122 million of 10 year term mortgage notes with an interest rate of 5.53%. The proceeds from these notes were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our former revolving credit facility and for other general corporate purposes. On August 1, 2007, in connection with the completion of the SEUSA acquisition, we obtained, from a syndicate of banks, a financing commitment for a $3.0 billion bridge loan, under which $2.75 billion was borrowed at closing, and a four year $1.5 billion revolving line of credit facility. The bridge loan has an initial maturity date of July 31, 2008 and includes two optional 6 month extensions. In October 2007, we made aggregate payments of approximately $1.4 billion, reducing the outstanding principal balance of the bridge loan to $1.35 billion at December 31, 2007. On October 5, 2007, we issued 9 million shares of common stock and received net proceeds of approximately $303 million, which were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our bridge loan facility. On October 15, 2007, we issued $600 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.70% senior unsecured notes due in 2018. The notes were priced at 99.793% of the principal amount for an effective yield of 6.73%. We received net proceeds of approximately $595 million, which were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our bridge loan facility. Dividends During the year ended December 31, 2007, we issued approximately 1.6 million shares of our common stock under our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan at an average price per share of $31.82 for proceeds of approximately $50.9 million. Quarterly dividends paid during 2007 aggregated $1.78 per share. On January 28, 2008, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly common stock cash dividend of $0.455 per share. The common stock dividend will be paid on February 21, 2008 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 7, 2008. Based on the first quarters dividend, the annualized rate of distribution for 2008 is $1.82, compared with $1.78 for 2007. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") requires our management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base estimates on our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting 47 periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different, it is possible that different accounting would have been applied, resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. For a description of the risk associated with our critical accounting policies, see "Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business." From time to time, we re evaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Principles of Consolidation Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of HCP, its wholly owned subsidiaries and its controlled, through voting rights or other means, joint ventures. We apply Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, as revised ("FIN 46R"), for arrangements with variable interest entities ("VIEs") and consolidate those VIEs where we are the primary beneficiary. We also apply Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue 04 5, Investors Accounting for an Investment in a Limited Partnership When the Investor is the Sole General Partner and the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights ("EITF 04 05"), to investments in joint ventures. Our judgment with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity and whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE involves the consideration of various factors including, but not limited to, the form of our ownership interest, our representation on the entitys governing body, the size of our investment, estimates of future cash flows, our ability to participate in policy making decisions and the rights of the other investors to participate in the decision making process and to replace us as manager and or liquidate the venture, if applicable. Our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity or determine the primary beneficiary of a VIE affects the presentation of these entities in our consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2007, we leased 81 properties, with a carrying value of $1.3 billion, to a total of nine tenants that have been identified as VIEs ("VIE tenants") and have a loan with a carrying value of $85 million to a borrower that has been identified as a VIE. We acquired these leases and loan on October 5, 2006 in our merger with CRP. CRP determined it was not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, and we are generally required to carry forward CRPs accounting conclusions after the acquisition relative to their primary beneficiary assessments. On December 21, 2007, we made an investment of approximately $900 million in mezzanine loans where each mezzanine borrower has been identified as a VIE. We have also determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs. At December 31, 2007, our maximum exposure to losses resulting from our involvement in VIEs was limited to the future minimum lease payments of approximately $1.5 billion from the VIE tenants and the carrying value of approximately $1.0 billion of loans made to the VIE borrowers. If we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE our financial statements would include the results of the VIE (either tenant or borrower) rather than the results of our lease or loan to the VIE. We would depend on the VIE to provide us timely financial information, and we would rely on the internal controls of the VIE to provide accurate financial information. If the VIE has deficiencies in its internal controls over financial reporting, or does not provide us with timely financial information, this may adversely impact our financial reporting and our internal controls over financial reporting. Revenue Recognition Rental income from tenants is recognized in accordance with GAAP, including SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition ("SAB 104"). We begin recognizing rental revenue on a straight line basis over the lease term when collectibility is reasonably assured and the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of the leased asset. For assets acquired subject to leases 48 we recognize revenue upon acquisition of the asset provided the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of the leased asset. If the lease provides for tenant improvements, we determine whether the tenant improvements, for accounting purposes, are owned by the tenant or us. When we are the owner of the tenant improvements, the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or controls the physical use of the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially completed. When the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements any tenant improvement allowance funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term. The determination of ownership of the tenant improvements is subject to significant judgment. Tenant improvement ownership is determined based on various factors including, but not limited to: whether the lease stipulates how and on what a tenant improvement allowance may be spent; whether the tenant or landlord retains legal title to the improvements at the end of the lease term; whether the tenant improvements are unique to the tenant or general purpose in nature; and whether the tenant improvements are expected to have any residual value at the end of the lease. If our assessment of the owner of the tenant improvements for accounting purposes were to change, the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted. Certain leases provide for additional rents contingent upon a percentage of the facilitys revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds. Such revenue is recognized when actual results reported by the tenant, or estimates of tenant results, exceed the base amount or other thresholds. The recognition of additional rents requires us to make estimates of amounts owed and to a certain extent are dependent on the accuracy of the facility results reported to us. These estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements. We use the direct finance method of accounting to record income from direct financing leases ("DFLs"). For leases accounted for as DFLs, future minimum lease payments are recorded as a receivable. The difference between the future minimum lease payments and the estimated residual values less the cost of the properties is recorded as unearned income. Unearned income is deferred and amortized to income over the lease terms to provide a constant yield. Income recognized using the direct finance method requires us to make judgments regarding the collectibility of lease payments and estimated residual value of the leased asset on an ongoing basis. Changes in our estimates of residual value or collectibility of lease payments, could have a material impact to our consolidated financial statement. Allowances We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts, including an allowance for straight line rent receivables, for estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults or the inability of tenants to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments. We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants and operators on an ongoing basis. The evaluation considers industry and economic conditions, property performance, credit enhancements and other factors. For straight line rent amounts, our assessment is based on income recoverable over the term of the lease. We exercise judgment in establishing allowances and consider payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates. These estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements. We also establish allowances for loans based upon an estimate of probable losses for the individual loans deemed to be impaired. Impairment is indicated when it is deemed probable that we will be 49 unable to collect all amounts due on a timely basis according to the contractual terms of the loan. Determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires significant judgment by us about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The allowance is based upon the borrowers overall financial condition, resources and payment record; the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors; and, if appropriate, the realizable value of any collateral. Our estimates consider all available evidence including, as appropriate, the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loans contractual effective rate, the fair value of collateral, general economic conditions and trends, historical and industry loss experience, and other relevant factors. While our assumptions are based in part upon historical data, our estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Real Estate Real estate, consisting of land, buildings and improvements, is recorded at cost. We allocate the cost of the acquisition, including the assumption of liabilities, to the acquired tangible assets and identified intangibles based on their estimated fair values in accordance with SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations. We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and or capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it was vacant. We record acquired "above and below" market leases at fair value using discount rates which reflect the risks associated with the leases acquired. The amount recorded is based on the present value of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in place lease and (ii) our estimate of fair market lease rates for each in place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus extended term for any leases with below market fixed rate renewal options. Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenants lease. Factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods, market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, we include estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the hypothetical expected lease up periods, depending on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, we consider leasing commissions, legal and other related costs. We are required to make subjective assessments to allocate the purchase price paid to acquire investments in real estate among the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on our estimate of the fair values of such assets and liabilities. This includes determining the value of the buildings and improvements, land, ground leases, tenant improvements, in place tenant leases, favorable or unfavorable market leases and any debt assumed from the seller or loans made by the seller to us. Each of these estimates requires significant judgment and some of the estimates involve complex calculations. These allocation assessments have a direct impact on our results of operations as amounts allocated to some assets and liabilities are not subject to depreciation or amortization and those that are have different lives. Additionally, the amortization of value assigned to favorable or unfavorable market rate leases is recorded as an adjustment to rental revenue as compared to amortization of the value of in place leases, which is included in depreciation and amortization in our consolidated statements of income. 50 Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Goodwill We assess the carrying value of our long lived assets, including investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with SFAS No. 144, and with respect to goodwill, at least annually applying a fair value based test in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. If the sum of the expected future net undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the long lived asset, an impairment loss will be recognized by adjusting the assets carrying amount to its estimated fair value. The determination of the fair value of long lived assets, including goodwill, involves significant judgment. This judgment is based on our analysis and estimates of the future operating results and resulting cash flows of each long lived asset whose carrying amount may not be recoverable. Our ability to accurately predict future operating results, cash flows and fair values impacts the timing and recognition of impairments. While we believe our assumptions are reasonable, changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results. Derivatives We use a variety of methods and assumptions based on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date to determine the fair value of our derivative instruments. To estimate the fair value of these instruments we utilize pricing models, which consider inputs such as forward yield curves and discount rates. These methods of estimating fair value result in an approximation of benefits or obligations which may be different than amounts ultimately realized. At inception of each derivative instrument and on an ongoing basis we make an assessment to determine whether these instruments are eligible for hedge accounting by concluding that they are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows associated with the related hedged item. While we intend to continue to meet the conditions for hedge accounting, if hedges are no longer highly effective, the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments would be reflected in earnings. Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, significant management judgment is required to estimate our compliance with REIT requirements. Our determinations are based on interpretation of tax laws, and our conclusions may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized. Adjustments to income tax expense may be required as a result of i) audits conducted by federal and state tax authorities; ii) our ability to qualify as a REIT; iii) the potential for built in gain recognized related to prior tax free acquisitions of C corporations; and iv) changes in tax laws. Adjustments required in any given period are included in income, other than adjustments to income tax liabilities acquired in business combinations, which are adjusted through goodwill. Results of Operations We evaluate our business and allocate resources among our five business segments (i) senior housing; (ii) life science; (iii) medical office; (iv) hospital; and (v) skilled nursing. Under the senior housing, life science, hospital and skilled nursing segments, we invest primarily in single operator or tenant properties through the acquisition and development of real estate, secured financing, mezzanine financing and investment in marketable debt securities of operators in these sectors. Under the medical office segment, we invest through acquisition and secured financing in MOBs that are primarily leased under gross or modified gross leases, generally to multiple tenants, and which generally require a greater level of property management. The acquisition of SEUSA on August 1, 2007 resulted in a change to our reportable segments. Prior to the SEUSA acquisition, we operated through two reportable segments triple net leased and medical office buildings. The senior housing, life science, hospital and skilled nursing segments were previously aggregated under our triple net leased segment. 51 SEUSAs results are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition of August 1, 2007. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). There were no intersegment sales or transfers. Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2007 to the Year Ended December 31, 2006 We completed our acquisition of SEUSA on August 1, 2007, mergers with CRP and CRC on October 5, 2006 and the acquisition of an interest held by an affiliate of General Electric ("GE") in HCP MOP on November 30, 2006, which resulted in the consolidation of HCP MOP beginning on that date. The results of operations from our SEUSA, CRP and HCP MOP transactions are reflected in our consolidated financial statements from those respective dates. During 2008, we expect increases in revenues, expenses and interest income from a full year of results from our SEUSA acquisition, mezzanine loan investments and joint venture transactions. Rental and related revenues. Year Ended December 31, Change Segments 2007 2006 $ % (dollars in thousands) Senior housing $ 298,213 $ 167,771 $ 130,442 78 % Life science 79,664 14,919 64,745 434 Medical office 286,556 165,942 120,614 73 Hospital 128,156 94,448 33,708 36 Skilled nursing 43,133 40,841 2,292 6 Total $ 835,722 $ 483,921 $ 351,801 73 % Senior housing. Senior housing rental and related revenues increased $130.4 million, to $298.2 million, for the year ended December 31, 2007. Approximately $98 million of the increase relates to properties acquired in the CRP merger. Additionally, the results for the year ended December 31, 2007, include income of $9 million resulting from our change in estimate relating to the collectability of straight line rents due from Summerville Senior Living, Inc. The remaining increase in senior housing rental and related revenues primarily relates to rent escalations and resets, and the additive effect of our other acquisitions in 2007 and 2006. Additionally, included in senior housing rental and related revenues were facility level operating revenues for five senior housing properties that were previously leased on a triple net basis. Periodically, tenants default on their leases, which causes us to take temporary possession of the operations of the facility. We contract with third party managers to manage these properties until a replacement tenant can be identified or the property can be sold. The operating revenues and expenses for these properties are included in senior housing rental and related revenues and operating expenses, respectively. The increase in reported revenues for these facilities of $1.7 million, to $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, was primarily due to an increase in overall occupancy of such properties. Life science. Life science rental and related revenues increased by $64.7 million, to $79.7 million, for the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily as a result of our acquisition of SEUSA on August 1, 2007. Medical office. Medical office rental and related revenues increased $120.6 million, to $286.6 million, for the year ended December 31, 2007. Approximately $36 million of the increase relates to MOBs acquired in the CRP merger and $64.7 million relates to the consolidation of HCP MOP. The remaining increase in medical office rental and related revenues primarily relates to the additive effect of our MOB acquisitions in 2007 and 2006. 52  Hospital. Hospital rental and related revenues increased by $33.7 million, to $128.2 million, for the year ended December 31, 2007. Approximately $31.4 million of the increase relates to the additive effect of our hospital acquisitions in 2007 and $3.2 million related to properties acquired in the CRP merger. The remaining increase in hospital rental and related revenues primarily relates to rent escalations and increases in additional rents that are based on the respective facilitys revenues. Tenant recoveries. Year Ended December 31, Change Segments 2007 2006 $ % (dollars in thousands) Life science $ 19,326 $ 3,935 $ 15,391 391 % Medical office 48,936 28,098 20,838 74 Hospital 1,092 34 1,058 NM (1) Total $ 69,354 $ 32,067 $ 37,287 116 % (1)Percentage change not meaningful. Life science. Life science tenant recoveries increased by $15.4 million, to $19.3 million, for the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily as a result of our acquisition of SEUSA on August 1, 2007. Medical office. Medical office tenant recoveries increased $20.8 million, to $48.9 million, for the year ended December 31, 2007. Approximately $11.6 million of the increase relates to MOBs acquired in the CRP merger and $7.7 million relates to the consolidation of HCP MOP. The remaining increase in medical office tenant recoveries primarily relates to the additive effect of our MOB acquisitions in 2007 and 2006. Hospital. Hospital tenant recoveries increased as a result of our hospital acquisitions in 2007. Income from direct financing leases. Income from direct financing leases of $63.9 million relates to properties acquired from CRP, which are accounted for using the direct financing method. At December 31, 2007, these leased properties had a carrying value of $640.1 million and accrued income at a weighted average interest rate of 8.5%. During the year ended December 31, 2007, two DFL tenants exercised their purchase options and we received proceeds of $51 million and recognized additional income of $4.3 million. Investment management fee income. Investment management fee income increased $9.7 million, to $13.6 million, for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition fees related to HCP Ventures II of $5.4 million on January 5, 2007 and HCP Ventures IV of $3.0 million on April 30, 2007, partially offset by the decline in fees of $3.1 million resulting from our purchase of GEs interests in HCP MOP on November 30, 2006. Interest expense. Interest expense increased $145.2 million, to $357.0 million, for the year ended December 31, 2007. This increase was primarily due to (i) $106 million of interest expense from the issuance of $2.65 billion of senior unsecured notes during 2006 and 2007, (ii) $43 million increase in our outstanding mortgage debt resulting primarily from our acquisitions of CRP, consolidation of HCP MOP and other property acquisitions, (iii) $17 million from the increase in outstanding indebtedness under our bridge and term loans and line of credit facilities, and the related amortization and write off of unamortized debt issuance costs. The increase in interest expense is partially offset by $11 million increase in the amount of capitalized interest relating to the increase in assets under development 53 primarily from our acquisition of SEUSA and $10 million decrease from the maturity of $275 million of senior unsecured notes during 2006 and 2007. We expect an increase in capitalized interest during 2008 as a result of our assets under development. The table below sets forth information with respect to our debt, excluding premiums and discounts (dollars in thousands): As of December 31, 2007 2006 Balance: Fixed rate $ 4,704,988 $ 4,541,237 Variable rate 2,822,316 1,669,031 Total $ 7,527,304 $ 6,210,268 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate 63 % 73 % Variable rate 37 % 27 % Total 100 % 100 % Weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 6.18 % 5.91 % Variable rate 5.90 % 6.13 % Total weighted average rate 6.08 % 5.97 % Depreciation and amortization expenses. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $141.4 million, to $274.3 million, for the year ended December 31, 2007. Approximately $65.2 million of the increase relates to properties acquired in the CRP merger, $19.2 million relates to the consolidation of HCP MOP and $33.5 million relates to the SEUSA acquisition. The remaining increase in depreciation and amortization primarily relates to the additive effect of our other acquisitions in 2007 and 2006. Operating expenses. Year Ended December 31, Change Segments 2007 2006 $ % (dollars in thousands) Senior housing $ 14,125 $ 12,849 $ 1,276 10 % Life science 25,697 4,757 20,940 440 Medical office 144,767 68,944 75,823 110 Hospital 1,884 1,334 550 41 Skilled nursing 77 637 (560 ) (88 ) Total $ 186,550 $ 88,521 $ 98,029 111 % Operating expenses are predominantly related to MOB and life science properties where we incur the expenses and recover a portion of those expenses under the lease. Accordingly, the number of properties in our MOB and life science portfolios directly impact operating expenses. The presentation of expenses as general and administrative or operating is based on the underlying nature of the expense. Periodically, we review the classification of expenses between categories and make revisions based on changes in the underlying nature of the expense. Senior housing. Included in operating expenses are facility level operating expenses for five senior housing properties that were previously leased on a triple net basis. Periodically, tenants 54 default on their leases, which causes us to take possession of the operations of the facility. We contract with third party managers to manage these properties until a replacement tenant can be identified or the property can be sold. The operating revenues and expenses for these properties are included in healthcare rental revenues and operating expenses, respectively. The increase in reported operating expenses for these facilities of $1.3 million, to $14.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, was primarily due to an increase in the overall occupancy of such properties. Life science. Life science operating expenses increased by $20.9 million, to $25.7 million, for the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily as a result of our acquisition of SEUSA on August 1, 2007. Medical office. Medical office operating expenses increased $75.8 million, to $144.8 million, for the year ended December 31, 2007. Approximately $34.8 million relates to the consolidation of HCP MOP and $18.5 million of the increase relates to properties acquired in the CRP merger. The remaining increase in medical office operating expenses relates to the additive effect of our acquisitions in 2007 and 2006. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased $23.7 million, to $70.9 million, for the year ended December 31, 2007. Included in general and administrative expenses are merger and integration related expenses associated with the CRC, CRP and SEUSA acquisitions of $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $5.0 million in the prior year. Merger and integration related expenses are primarily costs from our CRP merger, such as employee transition costs as well as severance costs for certain of our employees whose responsibilities became redundant after the completion of the merger. The remaining increase was primarily due to $9.4 million in various items including increased professional and legal fees, federal and state taxes, and compensation related expenses. We expect to incur integration costs associated with our acquisition of SEUSA through 2008. Equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures. For the year ended December 31, 2007, equity income decreased $2.7 million, to $5.6 million. This decrease is primarily due to our consolidation of HCP MOP, which was previously accounted for as an equity method investment, partially offset by equity income from HCP Ventures II, III and IV. Gain on sale of real estate interest. On April 30, 2007, we sold an 80% interest in HCP Ventures IV, which resulted in a gain of $10.1 million. There were no interests in joint ventures sold during the year ended December 31, 2006. Interest and other income, net. Interest and other income, net increased $40.9 million, to $75.7 million, for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily related to an increase of $24.0 million of interest income from $275 million of marketable debt securities, $9.3 million of interest income from an $85 million loan acquired in the CRP merger and $7.6 million of interest income from cash and cash equivalents. During 2007, our marketable debt securities accrued interest at rates ranging from 9.25% to 9.625%, and our $85 million loan accrued interest at a rate of 14%. Minority interests share of earnings. For the year ended December 31, 2007, minority interests share of earnings increased $9.6 million, to $24.4 million. This increase was primarily due to the issuance of 4.2 million non managing member units of HCP DR MCD, LLC, in connection with our February 9, 2007 acquisition of a medical campus. Discontinued operations. Income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $428.3 million, compared to $338.4 million for the comparable period in the prior year. The increase is primarily due to an increase in gains on real estate dispositions of $128 million and a decline in impairment charges of $6 million year over year. During the year ended December 31, 2007, 55 we sold 97 properties for $922 million, as compared to 83 properties for $512 million in the year ago period. The increase was partially offset by a year over year decline in operating income from discontinued operations of $44 million. Discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 included 101 properties compared to 184 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Included in discontinued operations during the year ended December 31, 2007 was income of $6 million, resulting from a change in estimate related to the collectability of straight line rental income from Emeritus Corporation. Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2006 to the Year Ended December 31, 2005 On October 5, 2006, we completed our merger with CRP. On November 30, 2006, we acquired the interest held by an affiliate of GE in HCP MOP, which resulted in the consolidation of HCP MOP beginning on that date. The impact on various income statement line items from our merger with CRP and consolidation of HCP MOP are discussed below. Rental and related revenues. Year Ended December 31, Change Segments 2006 2005 $ % (dollars in thousands) Senior housing $ 167,771 $ 84,281 $ 83,490 99 % Life science 14,919 12,124 2,795 23 Medical office 165,942 113,463 52,479 46 Hospital 94,448 91,122 3,326 4 Skilled nursing 40,841 39,494 1,347 3 Total $ 483,921 $ 340,484 $ 143,437 42 % Senior housing. Senior housing rental and related revenues increased $83.5 million, to $167.8 million, for the year ended December 31, 2006. Approximately $51.3 million of the increase relates to properties acquired in the CRP merger. The remaining increase in senior housing rental and related revenues of $32.2 million primarily relates to rent escalations and resets, and the additive effect of our other acquisitions in 2006 and 2005. Additionally, included in senior housing rental and related revenues are facility level operating revenues for five senior housing properties that were previously leased on a triple net basis. Periodically tenants default on their leases, which causes us to take temporary possession of the operations of the facility. We contract with third party managers to manage these properties until a replacement tenant can be identified or the property can be sold. The operating revenues and expenses for these properties are included in senior housing rental and related revenues and operating expenses, respectively. The increase in revenues for these facilities of $1.9 million to $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, was primarily due to an increase in overall occupancy of such properties. Life science. Life science rental and related revenues increased by $2.8 million, to $14.9 million, for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in life science rental and related revenues are primarily related to the additive effect of our life science acquisitions in 2006. Medical office. Medical office rental and related revenues increased $52.5 million, to $165.9 million, for the year ended December 31, 2006. Approximately $19.0 million of the increase relates to MOBs acquired in the CRP merger and $5.3 million relates to the consolidation of HCP MOP. The remaining increase in medical office rental and related revenues primarily relates to the additive effect of our MOB acquisitions in 2006 and 2005. 56 Tenant recoveries. Year Ended December 31, Change Segments 2006 2005 $ % (dollars in thousands) Life science $ 3,935 $ 3,462 $ 473 14 % Medical office 28,098 17,605 10,493 60 Hospital 34 34 NM (1) Total $ 32,067 $ 21,067 $ 11,000 52 % (1)Percentage change not meaningful. Medical office. Medical office tenant recoveries increased $10.5 million, to $28.1 million, for the year ended December 31, 2006. Approximately $4.3 million of the increase relates to MOBs acquired in the CRP merger and $0.6 million relates to the consolidation of HCP MOP. The remaining increase of $5.6 million in medical office tenant recoveries primarily relates to the additive effect of our MOB acquisitions in 2006 and 2005. Income from direct financing leases. Income from direct financing leases of $15 million relates to 32 leased properties acquired from CRP that are accounted for using the direct financing method. At December 31, 2006, these leased properties had a carrying value of $678 million and accrued interest at a weighted average interest rate of 9.0%. Investment management fee income. Investment management fee income increased by $0.7 million, to $3.9 million, for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition fee earned from HCP Ventures III of $0.7 million on October 27, 2006. Interest expense. Interest expense increased $105.6 million, to $211.9 million, for the year ended December 31, 2006. This increase was primarily due to (i) $39 million from the issuance of $2 billion of senior unsecured notes during 2005 and 2006; (ii) $30 million increase from additional mortgage debt primarily as a result of our acquisition of CRP, consolidation of HCP MOP and other property acquisitions; and (iii) $48 million from the increase in outstanding indebtedness under our line of credit facilities and CRP related bridge and term loans, and the related amortization write off of unamortized debt issuance costs. The increase in interest expense was partially offset by $11 million decrease from the maturity of $255 million of senior unsecured notes during 2006. 57 The table below sets forth information with respect to our debt, excluding premiums and discounts (dollars in thousands): As of December 31, 2006 2005 Balance: Fixed rate $ 4,541,237 $ 1,663,166 Variable rate 1,669,031 295,265 Total $ 6,210,268 $ 1,958,431 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate 73 % 85 % Variable rate 27 % 15 % Total 100 % 100 % Weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 5.91 % 6.33 % Variable rate 6.13 % 4.95 % Total weighted average rate 5.97 % 6.14 % Depreciation and amortization expenses. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased 55%, or $47.1 million, to $132.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Approximately $27.8 million of the increase related to properties acquired in the CRP merger and $1.6 million related to the consolidation of HCP MOP. The remaining increase in depreciation and amortization expenses of $17.7 million primarily relates to the additive effect of our other acquisitions in 2006 and 2005. Operating expenses. Year Ended December 31, Change Segments 2006 2005 $ % (dollars in thousands) Senior housing $ 12,849 $ 6,072 $ 6,777 112 % Life science 4,757 4,259 498 12 Medical office 68,944 46,991 21,953 47 Hospital 1,334 977 357 37 Skilled nursing 637 411 226 55 Total $ 88,521 $ 58,710 $ 29,811 51 % Operating expenses are predominantly related to MOB and life science properties where we incur the expenses and recover a portion of those expenses under the lease. Accordingly, the number of properties in our MOB and life science portfolios directly impact operating expenses. Additionally, we contract with third party property managers for most of our MOB properties. The presentation of expenses as general and administrative or operating is based on the underlying nature of the expense. Periodically, we review the classification of expenses between categories and make revisions based on changes in the underlying nature of the expense. Senior housing. Included in operating expenses were facility level operating expenses for five senior housing properties that were previously leased on a triple net basis. Periodically tenants default on their leases, which causes us to take temporary possession of the operations of the facility. We contract with third party managers to manage these properties until a replacement tenant can be identified or the property can be sold. The operating revenues and expenses for 58 these properties are included in triple net lease rental revenues and operating expenses, respectively. The increase in reported operating expenses for these facilities of $2.8 million, to $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, was primarily due to us taking possession of two of these properties in 2005 and an increase in overall occupancy of such properties. The remaining increase in operating expenses of approximately $4 million primarily relates to the effect of our other property acquisitions in 2006 and 2005. Medical office. Medical office operating expenses increased $22 million, to $69 million, for the year ended December 31, 2006. Approximately $9.2 million of the increase related to properties acquired in the CRP merger and $3.4 million related to the consolidation of HCP MOP. The remaining increase in operating expenses of $9.4 million primarily relates to the effect of our other property acquisitions in 2006 and 2005. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased 48.3% or $15.4 million, to $47.2 million, for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily due to higher compensation related expenses of approximately $9.0 million resulting from an increase in full time employees. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had 165 and 83 full time employees, respectively. In addition, during 2006 we incurred $5.0 million in merger and integration related expenses associated with the CRC and CRP mergers. Merger and integration related expenses are primarily costs from our CRP merger, such as employee transition costs as well as severance costs for certain of our employees whose responsibilities became redundant after the completion of the merger. Equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures. Equity income increased by $9.5 million, to $8.3 million, primarily due to our investment in HCP MOP, for which we recorded equity income of $7.8 million and equity losses of $1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2006, HCP MOP sold 34 MOBs for approximately $100.7 million, net of transaction costs, and recognized aggregate gains of $19.7 million. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on HCP MOP. On November 30, 2006, we acquired the interest held by an affiliate of GE in HCP MOP, which resulted in us becoming the sole owner of HCP MOP and consolidating its results of operations beginning on that date. On October 27, 2006, we formed HCP Ventures III, a joint venture with an institutional capital partner, with 13 of our previously 85% owned properties. Beginning on October 27, 2006, HCP Ventures III, in which we retained an effective 26% interest, has been accounted for as an equity method investment. Interest and other income, net. Interest and other income, net increased by $11.9 million, to $34.8 million, for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily related to $3.5 million of interest income from a $300 million investment in senior secured notes receivable purchased on November 17, 2006, which accrues interest at a rate of 9.625%. In addition, we recognized income of $7.3 million in connection with a prepayment premium we received in 2006 upon the early repayment of a secured loan receivable of $30.0 million with an original maturity of May 1, 2010 and an interest rate of 11.4%. Minority interests share of earnings. For the year ended December 31, 2006, minority interests share of earnings increased $1.9 million, to $14.8 million. This increase was primarily due to the minority interest holders in our HCP Birmingham Portfolio LLC and HCPI VPI Sorrento II, LLC consolidated joint ventures. These joint ventures were formed in 2006 in connection with our acquisitions of a medical campus and life science facilities, respectively. Discontinued operations. Income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $338.4 million, compared to $82.0 million for the comparable period in the prior year. The change was primarily due to an increase in gains on real estate dispositions of $259.1 million, net of impairments, partially offset by a decline in operating income from discontinued operations of 59 $2.8 million. Discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2006, included 184 properties compared to 180 properties for the year ended December 31, 2005. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we sold 83 properties for $512 million, as compared to 18 properties for $65 million during the year ended December 31, 2005. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal liquidity needs are to (i) fund normal operating expenses; (ii) repay the remaining $1.35 billion of SEUSA acquisition related borrowings; (iii) meet debt service requirements, including with respect to $300 million of our senior unsecured notes maturing in 2008 and outstanding borrowings on our lines of credit; (iv) fund capital expenditures, including tenant improvements and leasing costs; (v) fund acquisition and development activities; and (vi) make minimum distributions required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Code. We believe these needs will be satisfied using cash flows generated by operations, provided by financing activities, sales of assets and or contributions of assets to joint ventures during the next twelve months. Access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital and our ability to refinance maturing indebtedness, as well as to fund future acquisitions and development through the issuance of additional securities or secured debt. Our ability to access capital on favorable terms is dependent on various factors, including general market conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our securities, perception of our potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of our capital stock. As of December 31, 2007, we have a credit rating of Baa3 (stable) from Moodys, BBB (negative outlook) from S&P and BBB (stable) from Fitch on our senior unsecured debt securities, and Ba1(stable) from Moodys, BBB (negative outlook) from S&P and BBB (stable) from Fitch on our preferred securities. We strive to maintain investment grade credit ratings on our senior debt securities. From time to time, we have financed significant entity level acquisitions such as CRP and SEUSA using shorter term bridge and term loan facilities with the intent to repay or refinance these borrowings with the proceeds from future asset sales and joint venture contributions, and future debt and equity capital market transactions. This results in increased leverage ratios until such financing is repaid or refinanced. Our outstanding bridge loan which funded our acquisition of SEUSA, as well as our new revolving credit facility, have financial covenants that become more restrictive over their term. We are required to manage our leverage and capital structure to maintain compliance with such covenants. During 2007, through our unsecured debt and equity issuances as well as asset dispositions, we repaid $1.4 billion of the SEUSA acquisition related borrowings, reducing the balance to $1.35 billion at December 31, 2007. Net cash provided by operating activities was $453.1 million and $341.2 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Cash flow from operations reflects increased revenues partially offset by higher costs and expenses, and changes in receivables, payables, accruals and deferred revenue. Our cash flows from operations are dependent upon the occupancy level of multi tenant buildings, rental rates on leases, our tenants performance on their lease obligations, the level of operating expenses and other factors. Net cash used in investing activities was $2.9 billion during 2007 and principally reflects the net effect of: (i) $3.0 billion used to acquire SEUSA, (ii) $425.5 million used to fund acquisitions and construction of real estate, (iii) $887.2 million received from the sales of facilities, (iv) $923.5 million used to fund our investment in loans receivable and debt securities, and (v) $478.3 million of distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures. During 2007 and 2006, we used $50 million and $19 million, respectively, to fund lease commissions and tenant and capital improvements. As a result of our SEUSA acquisition, we expect to fund development commitments of approximately $95.7 million for 2008. Net cash provided by financing activities was $2.5 billion for 2007 and included proceeds of (i) $2.75 billion from borrowings under our bridge loan, (ii) $1.1 billion from senior note issuances, (iii) $618.9 million from common stock issuances, (iv) $327.2 million of net borrowings under our bank 60 lines of credit and (v) $143.4 million from mortgage debt issuances. These proceeds were partially offset by or used for the repayment of our former term and partial repayment of various bridge loans aggregating $1.9 billion and payment of common and preferred dividends aggregating $393.6 million. In order to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we must distribute at least 90% of our taxable income to our stockholders. Accordingly, we intend to continue to make regular quarterly distributions to holders of our common and preferred stock. At December 31, 2007, we held approximately $28.2 million in deposits and $35.1 million in irrevocable letters of credit from commercial banks securing tenants lease obligations and borrowers loan obligations. We may draw upon the letters of credit or depository accounts if there are defaults under the related leases or loans. Amounts available under letters of credit could change based upon facility operating conditions and other factors, and such changes may be material. Debt Bank lines of credit and bridge and term loans. On January 22, 2007, the Company repaid all amounts outstanding under a former $1.7 billion term loan with proceeds from capital market and joint venture transactions. As of December 31, 2007, all amounts outstanding under our previous $1.0 billion, three year revolving line of credit facility were repaid. In connection with the SEUSA acquisition, on August 1, 2007, we terminated our former $1.0 billion revolving line of credit facility and closed on a $2.75 billion bridge loan and a $1.5 billion revolving line of credit facility with a syndicate of banks. We incurred a charge of $6.2 million related to the write off of unamortized loan fees associated with our previous revolving line of credit facility that was terminated in August 2007. As of December 31, 2007, the outstanding balance of our bridge loan was $1.35 billion. Our bridge loan has an initial maturity date of July 31, 2008, and an extended maturity date of July 31, 2009 with the exercise of two optional 6 month extension options, subject to debt covenant compliance and extension fees. This bridge loan accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.425% to 1.25%, depending upon our debt ratings. Based on our debt ratings on January 31, 2008, the margin on the bridge loan facility is 0.70%. Our revolving line of credit facility has an initial $1.5 billion capacity, matures on August 1, 2011 and can be increased to $2.0 billion subject to certain conditions. This revolving line of credit accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.325% to 1.00%, depending upon our debt ratings. We pay a facility fee on the entire revolving commitment ranging from 0.10% to 0.25%, depending upon our debt ratings. The revolving line of credit facility contains a negotiated rate option, whereby the lenders participating in the line of credit facility bid on the interest to be charged, which may result in a reduced interest rate, and is available for up to 50% of borrowings. Based on our debt ratings on January 31, 2008, the margin on the revolving line of credit facility is 0.55% and the facility fee is 0.15%. As of December 31, 2007, we had $951.7 million outstanding under this credit facility with a weighted average effective interest rate of 5.66% and $548.3 million of available, unused borrowing capacity. Our revolving line of credit facility and bridge loan contain certain financial restrictions and other customary requirements. Among other things, these covenants, using terms defined in the agreement, initially limit the ratio of (i) Consolidated Total Indebtedness to Consolidated Total Asset Value to 75%, (ii) Secured Debt to Consolidated Total Asset Value to 30% and (iii) Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Unencumbered Asset Value to 90%. The agreement also requires that we maintain (i) a Fixed Charge Coverage ratio, as defined in the agreement, of 1.50 times and (ii) a formula determined Minimum Consolidated Tangible Net Worth. A portion of these financial covenants become more restrictive over a period of approximately two years from origination date and ultimately (i) limit the ratio of Consolidated Total Indebtedness to Consolidated Total Asset Value to 60%, (ii) limit the ratio 61 of Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Unencumbered Asset Value to 65% and (iii) require a Fixed Charge Coverage ratio, as defined in the agreement, of 1.75 times. As of December 31, 2007, we were in compliance with each of these restrictions and requirements of our credit revolving credit facility and bridge loan. Senior unsecured notes. At December 31, 2007, we had $3.8 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding. Interest rates on the notes ranged from 4.88% to 7.07% with a weighted average rate of 6.18% at December 31, 2007. Discounts and premiums are amortized to interest expense over the term of the related debt. On January 22, 2007, we issued $500 million of 6.00% senior unsecured notes due in 2017. The notes were priced at 99.323% of the principal amount for an effective yield of 6.09%. We received net proceeds of approximately $493 million, which proceeds were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our former term loan and revolving credit facilities. The senior unsecured notes contain certain covenants including limitations on debt and other customary terms. On October 15, 2007, we issued $600 million of 6.70% senior unsecured notes due in 2018. The notes were priced at 99.793% of the principal amount for an effective yield of 6.73%. We received net proceeds of approximately $595 million, which were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our bridge loan facility. The senior unsecured notes contain certain covenants including limitations on debt and other customary terms. Mortgage debt. At December 31, 2007, we had $1.3 billion in mortgage debt secured by 199 healthcare facilities with a carrying amount of $2.7 billion. Interest rates on the mortgage notes ranged from 3.33% to 8.63% with a weighted average rate of 6.02% at December 31, 2007. On April 27, 2007, in anticipation of closing HCP Ventures IV, $122 million of 10 year term mortgage notes were placed with an interest rate of 5.53%. The proceeds from the placement of these notes were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our previous revolving line of credit facility and for other general corporate purposes. The instruments encumbering the properties typically restrict title transfer of the respective properties subject to the terms of the mortgage, prohibit additional liens, restrict prepayment, require payment of real estate taxes, maintenance of the properties in good condition, maintenance of insurance on the properties and include a requirement to obtain lender consent to enter into material tenant leases. Other debt. At December 31, 2007, we had $108.5 million of non interest bearing Life Care Bonds at two of our CCRCs and non interest bearing occupancy fee deposits at another of our senior housing facilities, all of which were payable to certain residents of the facilities (collectively "Life Care Bonds"). At December 31, 2007, $39.4 million of the Life Care Bonds were refundable to the residents upon the resident moving out or to their estate upon death, and $69.1 million of the Life Care Bonds were refundable after the unit is successfully remarketed to a new resident. Derivative Financial Instruments. During October and November 2007, we entered into two forward starting interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts aggregating $900 million to hedge the benchmark interest rate component of anticipated interest payments resulting from forecasted issuances of unsecured, fixed rate debt. The derivative instruments have a mandatory cash settlement date of June 30, 2008. For a more detailed description of our derivative financial instruments, see Item 7A of this report. 62  Debt Maturities The following table summarizes our stated debt maturities and scheduled principal repayments, excluding debt premiums and discounts, at December 31, 2007 (in thousands): Year Amount 2008 $ 500,392 2009(1) 1,621,844 2010 498,983 2011 1,381,769 2012 352,054 Thereafter 3,172,262 $ 7,527,304 (1)Includes the debt incurred in our acquisition of SEUSA, which closed August 1, 2007. We have a prospectus on file with the SEC as part of a registration statement on Form S 3, using a "shelf" registration process which expires in 2009. Under this "shelf" process, we may sell from time to time any combination of the securities in one or more offerings. The securities described in the prospectus include, common stock, preferred stock and debt securities. Each time we sell securities under the "shelf" registration, we will provide a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information about the terms of the securities being offered and of the offering. We may offer and sell the securities pursuant to this prospectus from time to time in one or more of the following ways: through underwriters or dealers, through agents, directly to purchasers or through a combination of any of these methods of sales. Proceeds from the sale of these securities may be used for general corporate purposes, which may include repayment of indebtedness, working capital and potential acquisitions. During 2007, we issued approximately $564 million of common stock and $1.1 billion of senior unsecured notes under the "shelf." Equity On January 19, 2007, we issued 6.8 million shares of our common stock. We received net proceeds of approximately $261 million, which were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our previous term loan and revolving credit facilities. On October 5, 2007, we issued 9 million shares of common stock and received net proceeds of approximately $302.6 million, which were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our bridge loan facility. At December 31, 2007, we had 4.0 million shares of 7.25% Series E cumulative redeemable preferred stock, 7.8 million shares of 7.10% Series F cumulative redeemable preferred stock and 216.8 million shares of common stock outstanding. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we issued approximately 1.6 million shares of our common stock under our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan, at an average price per share of $31.82, for aggregate proceeds of $50.9 million. We also received $8.1 million in proceeds from stock option exercises. At December 31, 2007, stockholders equity totaled $4.1 billion and our equity securities had a market value of $7.8 billion. As of December 31, 2007, there were a total of 7.6 million DownREIT units outstanding in seven limited liability companies in which we are the managing member: (i) HCPI/Tennessee, LLC; (ii) HCPI/Utah, LLC; (iii) HCPI/Utah II, LLC; (iv) HCPI/Indiana, LLC; (v) HCP DR California, LLC; (vi) HCP DR Alabama, LLC; and (vii) HCP DR MDC, LLC. The DownREIT units are redeemable for an amount of cash approximating the then existing market value of shares of our common stock or, 63 at our option, shares of our common stock (subject to certain adjustments, such as stock splits and reclassifications). Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We own interests in certain unconsolidated joint ventures, including HCP Ventures II, HCP Ventures III and HCP Ventures IV, as described under Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Except in limited circumstances, our risk of loss is limited to our investment in the joint venture and any outstanding loans receivable. In addition, we have certain properties which serve as collateral for debt that is owed by a previous owner of certain of our facilities, as described under Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our risk of loss for these certain properties is limited to the outstanding debt balance plus penalties, if any. We have no other material off balance sheet arrangements that we expect would materially affect our liquidity and capital resources except those described below under "Contractual Obligations." Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our material contractual payment obligations and commitments at December 31, 2007 (in thousands): Total Less than One Year 2009 2010 2011 2012 More than Five Years Senior unsecured notes and mortgage debt $ 5,117,108 $ 391,896 $ 770,827 $ 782,123 $ 3,172,262 Development commitments(1) 95,684 77,189 18,495 Revolving line of credit 951,700 951,700 Bridge loan(2) 1,350,000 1,350,000 Ground and other operating leases 190,317 4,744 9,400 9,273 166,900 Other debt 108,496 108,496 Interest 2,025,283 309,555 543,412 250,611 921,705 Total $ 9,838,588 $ 891,880 $ 2,692,134 $ 1,993,707 $ 4,260,867 (1)Represents construction and other commitments for developments in progress. (2)Represents the outstanding debt balance incurred in our acquisition of SEUSA, which closed August 1, 2007. During 2007, we entered into two forward starting interest rate swap contracts that we are mandatorily required to cash settle on June 30, 2008. For a more detail description of our derivative financial instruments, see Item 7A of this report. Inflation Our leases often provide for either fixed increases in base rents or indexed escalators, based on the Consumer Price Index or other measures, and or additional rent based on increases in the tenants operating revenues. Substantially all of our MOB leases require the tenant to pay a share of property operating costs such as real estate taxes, insurance and utilities. Substantially all of our senior housing, life science, skilled nursing and hospital leases require the operator or tenant to pay all of the property operating costs or reimburse us for all such costs. We believe that inflationary increases in expenses will be offset, in part, by the operator or tenant expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases described above. New Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the impact of new accounting standards. 64 ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk. At December 31, 2007, we were exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on approximately: (i) $952 million of variable rate line of credit borrowings, (ii) $1.35 billion of variable rate bridge financing, (iii) $196 million of variable rate mortgage notes payable, (iv) $325 million of variable rate senior unsecured notes and (v) $1 billion of variable rate mezzanine loans receivable. Of the $196 million of variable rate mortgage notes payable outstanding, $46 million has been hedged through interest rate swap contracts. Of our consolidated debt of $7.5 billion at December 31, 2007, excluding the $46 million of variable rate debt where the rates have been swapped to a fixed rate, approximately 37% is at variable interest rates. Interest rate fluctuations will generally not affect our future earnings or cash flows on our fixed rate debt, loans receivable or debt securities unless such instruments mature or are otherwise terminated. However, interest rate changes will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments. Conversely, changes in interest rates on variable rate debt and loans receivable would change our future earnings and cash flows, but not significantly affect the fair value of those instruments. Assuming a one percentage point increase in the interest rate related to the variable rate debt and variable rate loans, and assuming no change in the outstanding balance as of December 31, 2007, interest expense, net of interest income, for 2007 would increase by approximately $28 million, or $0.13 per common share on a diluted basis. We use derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage or hedge interest rate risk. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information in this regard. The following table summarizes our interest rate swap contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2007 (dollars in thousands): Date Entered Effective Date Swap End Date(2) Pay Fixed Rate Receive Floating Rate Index Notional Amount Fair Value July 13, 2005 July 19, 2005 July 15, 2020 3.820 % BMA Swap Index $ 45,600 $ (1,311 ) October 24, 2007 June 30, 2008 (1) June 30, 2018 4.999 3 Month LIBOR 500,000 (11,208 ) November 29, 2007 June 30, 2008 (1) June 30, 2018 4.648 3 Month LIBOR 400,000 2,022 Total $ 945,600 $ (10,497 ) (1)At the effective date we are mandatorily required to cash settle the forward starting interest rate swap at fair value. (2)Swap end date represents the outside date of the interest rate swap for the purpose of establishing its fair value. To illustrate the effect of movements in the interest rate markets, we performed a market sensitivity analysis on the noted hedging instruments. To do so, we applied various basis point spreads, to the underlying interest rates of the derivative portfolio in order to determine the instruments change in fair value. The following table summarizes the analysis performed (dollars in thousands): Effects of Change in Interest Rates Date Entered Maturity Date 50 Basis Points 50 Basis Points 100 Basis Points 100 Basis Points July 13, 2005 July 15, 2020 $ 1,700 $ (2,600 ) $ 4,400 $ (4,800 ) October 24, 2007 June 30, 2018 19,000 (20,000 ) 38,000 (39,000 ) November 29, 2007 June 30, 2018 15,000 (16,000 ) 30,000 (31,000 ) 65 Market Risk. We are directly and indirectly affected by changes in equity and bond markets. We have investments in marketable debt and equity securities classified as available for sale. Gains and losses on these securities are recognized in income when realized and other than temporary impairment may be periodically recorded when identified. The initial indicator of impairment for marketable equity securities is a sustained decline in market price below the amount recorded for that investment. We consider a variety of factors, such as: the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost; the issuers financial condition, capital strength and near term prospects; any recent events specific to that issuer and economic conditions of its industry; and our investment horizon in relationship to an anticipated near term recovery in the stock or bond price, if any. At December 31, 2007, the fair value and cost, or the new basis for those securities where a realized loss was recorded as a result of an other than temporary impairment, of marketable equity securities was $14 million, and the fair value of marketable debt securities was $289 million, with an original cost of $275 million. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of marketable equity securities was $15 million, with an original cost of $13 million, and the fair value of the marketable debt securities was $323 million, with an original cost of $300 million. The principal amount and the average interest rates for our mortgage loans receivable and debt categorized by maturity dates is presented in the table below. The fair value estimates for the mortgage loans receivable are based on our managements estimates on currently prevailing rates for comparable loans. The fair market value for our debt securities and senior notes payable are based on prevailing market prices. The fair market value estimates for secured loans and mortgage notes payable are based on discounting future cash flows utilizing current rates offered to us for loans and debt of the same type and remaining maturity.
