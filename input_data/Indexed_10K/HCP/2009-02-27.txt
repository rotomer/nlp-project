ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Cautionary Language Regarding Forward Looking Statements Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K that are not historical factual statements are "forward looking statements." We intend to have our forward looking statements covered by the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and include this statement for purposes of complying with those provisions. Forward looking statements include, among other things, statements regarding our and our officers intent, belief or expectations as identified by the use of words such as "may," "will," "project," "expect," "believe," "intend," "anticipate," "seek," "forecast," "plan," "estimate," "could," "would," "should" and other comparable and derivative terms or the negatives thereof. In addition, we, through our officers, from time to time, make forward looking oral and written public statements concerning our expected future operations, strategies, securities offerings, growth and investment opportunities, dispositions, capital structure changes, budgets and other developments. Readers are cautioned that, while forward looking statements reflect our good faith belief and reasonable assumptions based upon current information, we can give no assurance that our expectations or forecasts will be attained. Therefore, readers should be mindful that forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that they are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. As more fully set forth in Part I, Item 1A., "Risk Factors" in this report, factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations contained in the forward looking statements include: (a)Changes in national and local economic conditions, including a prolonged recession; (b)Continued volatility in the capital markets, including changes in interest rates and the availability and cost of capital; (c)The ability of the Company to manage its indebtedness level, and changes in the terms of such indebtedness; (d)Changes in federal, state or local laws and regulations, including those affecting the healthcare industry that affect our costs of compliance or increase the costs, or otherwise affect the operations of our operators, tenants and borrowers; (e)Changes in the reimbursement available to our tenants and borrowers by governmental or private payors, including changes in Medicare and Medicaid payment levels and the availability and cost of third party insurance coverage; (f)Competition for tenants and borrowers, including with respect to new leases and mortgages and the renewal or rollover of existing leases; (g)Availability of suitable properties to acquire at favorable prices and the competition for the acquisition and financing of those properties; (h)The ability of our operators, tenants and borrowers to conduct their respective businesses in a manner sufficient to maintain or increase their revenues and to generate sufficient income to make rent and loan payments to us; (i)The financial weakness of some operators and tenants, including potential bankruptcies and downturns in their businesses, which results in uncertainties regarding our ability to continue to realize the full benefit of such operators and or tenants leases; (j)The risk that we will not be able to sell or lease properties that are currently vacant, at all or at competitive rates; (k)The financial, legal and regulatory difficulties of significant operators of our properties, including Sunrise Senior Living, Inc.; 44 Table of Contents (l)The risk that we may not be able to integrate acquired businesses successfully or achieve the operating efficiencies and other benefits of acquisitions within expected time frames or at all, or within expected cost projections; (m)The ability to obtain financing necessary to consummate acquisitions or on favorable terms; and (n)The potential impact of existing and future litigation matters, including related developments. Except as required by law, we undertake no, and hereby disclaim any, obligation to update any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, changed circumstances or otherwise. The information set forth in this Item 7 is intended to provide readers with an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations. We will discuss and provide our analysis in the following order: Executive Summary 2008 Transaction Overview Dividends Critical Accounting Policies Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Contractual Obligations Inflation Recent Accounting Pronouncements Executive Summary We are a self administered REIT that, together with our consolidated subsidiaries, invests primarily in real estate serving the healthcare industry in the United States. We acquire, develop, lease, manage and dispose of healthcare real estate and provide financing to healthcare providers. At December 31, 2008, our portfolio of investments, excluding assets held for sale but including properties owned by our Investment Management Platform, consisted of interests in 694 facilities. Our business strategy is based on three principles: (i) opportunistic investing, (ii) portfolio diversification, and (iii) conservative financing. We actively redeploy capital from investments with lower return potential into assets with higher return potential and recycle capital from shorter term to longer term investments. We make investments where the expected risk adjusted return exceeds our cost of capital and strive to leverage our operator, tenant and other business relationships. Our strategy contemplates acquiring and developing properties on terms that are favorable to us. We attempt to structure transactions that are tax advantaged and mitigate risks in our underwriting process. Generally, we prefer larger, more complex private transactions that leverage our management teams experience and our infrastructure. We follow a disciplined approach to enhancing the value of our existing portfolio, including ongoing evaluation of potential disposition of properties that no longer fit our strategy. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we sold 51 properties for $643 million. At December 31, 2008, we had six properties with a carrying amount of $15.4 million classified as held for sale. We primarily generate revenue by leasing healthcare properties under long term leases. Most of our rents and other earned income from leases are received under triple net leases or leases that 45 Table of Contents provide for substantial recovery of operating expenses; however, some of our MOBs and life science leases are structured as gross or modified gross leases. Accordingly, for such MOBs and life science facilities we incur certain property operating expenses, such as real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance, property management fees, utilities and insurance. Our growth depends, in part, on our ability to (i) increase rental income and other earned income from leases by increasing rental rates and occupancy levels; (ii) maximize tenant recoveries given underlying lease structures; and (iii) control operating and other expenses. Our operations are impacted by property specific, market specific, general economic and other conditions. Access to external capital on favorable terms is critical to the success of our strategy. Generally, we attempt to match the long term duration of most of our investments with long term fixed rate financing. At December 31, 2008, 15% of our consolidated debt is at variable interest rates, which includes a balance of $520 million outstanding under our bridge and term loans. We intend to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior debt securities and manage various capital ratios and amounts within appropriate parameters. Access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital and ability to refinance maturing indebtedness, as well as to fund future acquisitions and development through the issuance of additional securities or secured debt. During 2008 we have raised $1.0 billion of equity capital, $656 million from asset dispositions, $566 million from the placement of Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie Mae") secured debt and $197 million in a bank term loan. In 2008, there was a decline in the availability of financing from the capital markets and widening credit spreads. Our ability to continue to access capital could be impacted by various factors including general market conditions and the continuing slowdown in the economy, interest rates, credit ratings on our securities, and any changes to these ratings, the market price of our capital stock, the performance of our portfolio, tenants, borrowers and operators, including any restructurings, disruptions or bankruptcies of our tenants, borrowers and operators, the perception of our potential future earnings and cash distributions, any unwillingness on the part of lenders to make loans to us and any deterioration in the financial position of lenders that might make them unable to meet their obligations to us. 2008 Transaction Overview Investment Transactions During 2008, we made investments aggregating $228 million through the acquisition of a senior housing facility for $11 million, purchase of marketable debt securities for $30 million, purchase of a joint venture interest valued at $29 million and funding an aggregate of $158 million for construction, tenant and capital improvement projects primarily in the life science and medical office segments. During 2008, we sold assets valued at $656 million, which included the sale of 51 properties for approximately $643 million and other investments for $13 million. Our sales of properties and other investments during 2008 were made from the following segments: (i) $438 million of hospital, (ii) $97 million of skilled nursing, (iii) $94 million of medical office and (iv) $27 million of senior housing. During 2008, three of our life science facilities located in South San Francisco were placed into service representing 229,000 square feet. Financing Transactions During the year ended December 31, 2008, we raised $1.8 billion in capital through the issuance of common stock, placement of Fannie Mae secured debt and the bank term loan market, which includes the transactions discussed below: In connection with HCPs addition to the S&P 500 Index on March 28, 2008, we issued 12.5 million shares of our common stock on April 2, 2008. In a separate transaction, we issued 4.5 million 46 Table of Contents shares to a REIT dedicated institutional investor on April 2, 2008. The net proceeds received from these two offerings in the aggregate were approximately $560 million, which were used to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under our revolving line of credit facility. In May 2008, we placed $259 million of seven year mortgage financing on 21 of our senior housing assets. The assets are cross collateralized and the debt has a fixed interest rate of 5.83%. We received net proceeds aggregating $254 million, which were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under our revolving line of credit facility and bridge loan. In June 2008, we settled two forward starting swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $900 million. Upon settlement of these contracts and for the year ended December 31, 2008, we recognized ineffectiveness charges of $3.5 million, or $0.01 per diluted share of common stock, in interest and other income, net. On August 11, 2008, we issued 14.95 million shares of our common stock. We received net proceeds of $481 million, which were used to repay a portion of our outstanding indebtedness under our bridge loan facility. In September 2008, we placed mortgage financing on senior housing assets through Fannie Mae aggregating $319 million, which was comprised of $140 million of five year mortgage financing on four assets and $179 million of eight year financing on 12 assets. The assets are cross collateralized and the debt has a weighted average fixed interest rate of 6.39%. We received net proceeds aggregating $312 million, which were used to repay our outstanding indebtedness under our revolving line of credit facility. On October 24, 2008, we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks for a $200 million unsecured term loan. The term loan accrues interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.00%, based on our current debt ratings, and matures in August 2011. The net proceeds of $197 million received by us from the term loan were used to repay a portion of our outstanding indebtedness under our bridge loan facility. On December 19, 2008, we recognized a gain of $2.4 million related to the negotiated early repayment of $120 million of mortgage debt, at a discount, with an original maturity of January 27, 2009. The mortgage debt was repaid with funds available under our revolving line of credit facility. Other Events On July 30, 2008, we received and recognized lease termination income of $18 million from a tenant in connection with the early termination of three leases representing 149,000 square feet in our life science segment. Upon termination of the leases, we recognized an impairment of $4 million related to intangible assets associated with these leases. On September 19, 2008, we completed the restructuring of our hospital portfolio leased to Tenet and settled various disputes. The settlement provided for, among other things, the sale of our hospital in Tarzana, California, valued at $89 million, the purchase of Tenets minority interest in a joint venture valued at $29 million and the extension of the terms of three other hospitals leased by us to Tenet. As a result of the sale of our hospital in Tarzana, California and the settlement of our legal disputes with Tenet, we recognized income of $47 million. On December 1, 2008, we completed the transfer of an 11 property senior housing portfolio to Emeritus. In connection with the transfer, we recognized impairments of lease related intangible assets of $12 million. Dividends Quarterly dividends paid during 2008 aggregated $1.82 per share. On February 2, 2009, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly common stock cash dividend of $0.46 per 47 Table of Contents share. The common stock dividend was paid on February 23, 2009 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 9, 2009. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") requires our management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base estimates on our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different, it is possible that different accounting would have been applied, resulting in a different presentation of our consolidated financial statements. For a description of the risk associated with our critical accounting policies, see "Risk Factors Risks Related to HCP" in Item 1A. From time to time, we re evaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of HCP, our wholly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures that we control, through voting rights or other means. We apply Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, as revised ("FIN 46R"), for arrangements with variable interest entities ("VIEs"). We consolidate investments in VIEs when we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE at either the creation of the variable interest entity or upon the occurrence of a qualifying reconsideration event. We also apply Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue 04 5, Investors Accounting for an Investment in a Limited Partnership When the Investor is the Sole General Partner and the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights ("EITF 04 05"), to investments in joint ventures. Our judgment with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity and whether we are (or are not) the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Consideration of various factors including, but not limited to, the form of our ownership interest, our representation on the entitys governing body, the size and seniority of our investment, various cash flow scenarios related to the VIE, our ability to participate in policy making decisions and the rights of the other investors to participate in the decision making process and to replace us as manager and or liquidate the venture, if applicable. Our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity at inception of our involvement or upon a reconsideration event and determine the primary beneficiary of a VIE, affects the presentation of these entities in our consolidated financial statements. If we were to perform a primary beneficiary analysis upon the occurrence of a future reconsideration event, our assumptions may be different, which could result in the identification of a different primary beneficiary. If we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE our consolidated financial statements would include the results of the VIE (either tenant or borrower) rather than the results of our lease or loan to the VIE. We would depend on the VIE to provide us timely financial information, and we would rely on the internal controls of the VIE to provide accurate financial information. If the VIE has deficiencies in its internal controls over financial reporting, or does not provide us with timely financial information, this may adversely impact our financial reporting and our internal controls over financial reporting. 48 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition Rental income from tenants is recognized in accordance with GAAP, including SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition ("SAB 104"). We recognize rental revenue on a straight line basis over the lease term when collectibility is reasonably assured and the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of the leased asset. For assets acquired subject to leases, we recognize revenue upon acquisition of the asset provided the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of the leased asset. If the lease provides for tenant improvements, we determine whether the tenant improvements, for accounting purposes, are owned by the tenant or us. When we are the owner of the tenant improvements, the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the physical use of the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially completed. When the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements, any tenant improvement allowance funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term. The determination of ownership of the tenant improvements is subject to significant judgment. Tenant improvement ownership is determined based on various factors including, but not limited to: whether the lease stipulates how and on what a tenant improvement allowance may be spent; whether the tenant or landlord retains legal title to the improvements at the end of the lease term; whether the tenant improvements are unique to the tenant or general purpose in nature; and whether the tenant improvements are expected to have any residual value at the end of the lease. If our assessment of the owner of the tenant improvements for accounting purposes were to change, the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted. Certain leases provide for additional rents contingent upon a percentage of the facilitys revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds. Such revenue is recognized when actual results reported by the tenant, or estimates of tenant results, exceed the base amount or other thresholds. The recognition of additional rents requires us to make estimates of amounts owed and to a certain extent are dependent on the accuracy of the facility results reported to us. Our estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts, including an allowance for straight line rent receivables, for estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults or the inability of tenants to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments. We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants and operators on an ongoing basis. This evaluation considers industry and economic conditions, property performance, credit enhancements and other factors. For straight line rent amounts, our assessment is based on income recoverable over the term of the lease. We exercise judgment in establishing allowances and consider payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates. These estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements. We use the direct finance method of accounting to record income from DFLs. For leases accounted for as DFLs, future minimum lease payments are recorded as a receivable. The difference between the future minimum lease payments and the estimated residual values less the cost of the properties is recorded as unearned income. Unearned income is deferred and amortized to income over the lease terms to provide a constant yield when collectibility of the lease payments is reasonably assured. Investments in DFLs are presented net of unamortized unearned income. Loans receivable are classified as held for investment based on managements intent and ability to hold the loans for the foreseeable future or to maturity. Loans held for investment are carried at 49 Table of Contents amortized cost, reduced by a valuation allowance for estimated credit losses. We recognize interest income on loans, including the amortization of discounts and premiums, using the effective interest method applied on a loan by loan basis when collectibility of the future payments is reasonably assured. Premiums and discounts are recognized as yield adjustments over the life of the related loans. Loans are transferred from held for investment to held for sale when managements intent is to no longer hold the loans for the foreseeable future. Loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. Allowances are established for loans and DFLs based upon a probable loss estimate for individual loans and DFLs deemed to be impaired. Loans and DFLs are impaired when it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due on a timely basis in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan or lease. Determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires significant judgment by us about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The allowance is based upon our assessment of the borrowers or lessees overall financial condition, resources and payment record; the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors; and, if appropriate, the realizable value of any collateral. These estimates consider all available evidence including, as appropriate, the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loans or DFLs effective interest rate, the fair value of collateral, general economic conditions and trends, historical and industry loss experience, and other relevant factors. While our assumptions are based in part upon historical data, our estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Loans and DFLs are placed on non accrual status at such time as management determines that collectibility of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured. While on non accrual status, loans or DFLs are either accounted for on a cash basis, in which income is recognized only upon receipt of cash, or on a cost recovery basis, in which all cash receipts reduce the carrying value of the loan or DFL, based on managements judgment of collectibility. Real Estate Real estate, consisting of land, buildings and improvements, is recorded at cost. We allocate the cost of the acquisition, including the assumption of liabilities, to the acquired tangible assets and identified intangibles based on their estimated fair values in accordance with SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 141R, Business Combinations, as revised ("SFAS No. 141R"). SFAS No. 141R is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The adoption of SFAS No. 141R on January 1, 2009 will, among other things, require us to prospectively expense all transaction costs for business combinations. The implementation of SFAS No. 141R on January 1, 2009 could materially impact our future financial results to the extent that we acquire significant amounts of real estate, as related acquisition costs will be expensed as incurred rather than our past practice of capitalizing such costs and amortizing them over the estimated useful life of the assets acquired. We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and or capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it was vacant. We record acquired "above and below" market leases at fair value using discount rates which reflect the risks associated with the leases acquired. The amount recorded is based on the present value of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in place lease and (ii) our estimate of fair market lease rates for each in place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus extended term for any 50 Table of Contents leases with below market renewal options. Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenants lease. Factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods, market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, we include estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the hypothetical expected lease up periods, which are dependent on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, we consider leasing commissions, legal and other related costs. We are required to make subjective assessments to allocate the purchase price paid to acquire investments in real estate among the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on our estimate of the fair values of such assets and liabilities. This includes determining the value of the buildings and improvements, land, ground leases, tenant improvements, in place tenant leases, favorable or unfavorable market leases and any debt assumed from the seller or loans made by the seller to us. Each of these estimates requires significant judgment and some of the estimates involve complex calculations and judgments about useful lives. These allocation assessments have a direct impact on our results of operations as amounts allocated to some assets and liabilities are not subject to depreciation or amortization and those that are have different lives. Additionally, the amortization of value assigned to favorable or unfavorable market rate leases is recorded as an adjustment to rental revenue as compared to amortization of the value of in place leases, which is included in depreciation and amortization in our consolidated statements of income. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Goodwill We assess the carrying value of real estate assets and related intangibles ("real estate assets"), whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets ("SFAS No. 144"). We test our real estate assets for impairment by comparing the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows to the carrying amount of the real estate asset or asset group. If the carrying value exceeds the expected undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss will be recognized by adjusting the carrying amount of the real estate assets to their estimated fair value. Our ability to accurately predict future operating results and cash flows and to accurately estimate and allocate fair values impacts the timing and recognition of real estate asset impairments. While we believe our assumptions are reasonable, changes in these assumptions, such as the anticipated hold period for an asset, may have a material impact on our financial results. Goodwill is tested for impairment by applying the two step approach defined in SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, at least annually and whenever we identify triggering events that may indicate impairment. Potential impairment indicators include a significant decline in real estate valuations, restructuring plans or a decline in our market capitalization below book value. We test for impairment of our goodwill by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit containing goodwill to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, the second step of the test is needed to measure the amount of potential goodwill impairment. The second step requires the fair value of the reporting unit to be allocated to all the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if it had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test. The excess fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of assets and liabilities is the implied value of goodwill and is used to determine the amount of impairment. We selected the fourth quarter of each fiscal year to perform our annual impairment test. The evaluation of goodwill requires significant judgments and estimates when determining fair value, including, but not limited to, real estate market capitalization rates, projected future cash flows, discount rates and the fair value of HCP. We estimated the fair value of HCP based on the market capitalization of our outstanding shares at December 31, 2008 and a control premium of approximately ten percent. This control premium approximates comparable sale transactions during the 18 months 51 Table of Contents prior to our impairment test. We also performed various sensitivity analyses in which real estate capitalization rates, discount rates and the control premium were expanded or contracted by 50 to 100 basis points, noting that the results would not lead to an impairment of our goodwill assets. Our estimates may differ from actual results due to, among other things, economic conditions or changes in operating performance. While we believe our assumptions are reasonable, changes in these assumptions, such as significant expansions in real estate market capitalization rates, may have a material impact on our financial results. Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures Investments in entities which we do not consolidate but for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are reported under the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, our share of the investees earnings or losses are included in our consolidated results of operations. The initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is based on the amount paid to purchase the joint venture interest or the carrying value of the assets prior to the sale of interests in the joint venture. We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment based upon a comparison of the fair value of the equity method investment to our carrying value. When we determine that a decline in the fair value of our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is other than temporary and is below its carrying value, an impairment is recorded. The determination of the fair value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures involves significant judgment. Our estimates consider all available evidence including, as appropriate, the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at market rates, general economic conditions and trends, and other relevant factors. While we believe our assumptions are reasonable, changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results. Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, significant management judgment is required to evaluate our compliance with REIT requirements. Our determinations are based on interpretation of tax laws, and our conclusions may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized. Adjustments to income tax expense may be required as a result of: (i) audits conducted by federal and state tax authorities, (ii) our ability to qualify as a REIT, (iii) the potential for built in gain recognized related to prior tax free acquisitions of C corporations, and (iv) changes in tax laws. Adjustments required in any given period are included in income, other than adjustments to income tax liabilities acquired in business combinations, which are adjusted through goodwill. Results of Operations We evaluate our business and allocate resources among our five business segments (i) senior housing, (ii) life science, (iii) medical office, (iv) hospital, and (v) skilled nursing. Under the senior housing, life science, hospital and skilled nursing segments, we invest primarily in single operator or tenant properties through the acquisition and development of real estate and by providing financing to operators in these segments. Under the medical office segment, we invest through acquisition in MOBs that are primarily leased under gross or modified gross leases, generally to multiple tenants, and which generally require a greater level of property management. The acquisition of SEUSA on August 1, 2007 resulted in a change to our reportable segments. Prior to the SEUSA acquisition, we operated through two reportable segments triple net leased and medical office buildings. The senior housing, life science, hospital and skilled nursing segments were previously aggregated under our triple net leased segment. SEUSAs results are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition of August 1, 2007. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 52  Table of Contents Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2008 to the Year Ended December 31, 2007 We completed our acquisition of SEUSA on August 1, 2007 and an investment in mezzanine loans with an aggregate face value of $1.0 billion on December 21, 2007. SEUSAs results of operations and the results of these mezzanine loans are reflected in our consolidated financial statements from those respective dates. Rental and related revenues. Year Ended December 31, Change Segments 2008 2007 $ % (dollars in thousands) Senior housing $ 289,876 $ 293,331 $ (3,455 ) (1 )% Life science 208,415 79,660 128,755 NM (1) Medical office 261,732 275,951 (14,219 ) (5 ) Hospital 82,894 80,960 1,934 2 Skilled nursing 35,982 35,172 810 2 Total $ 878,899 $ 765,074 $ 113,825 15 % (1)Percentage change not meaningful. Senior housing. Senior housing rental and related revenues decreased by $3.5 million to $289.9 million, for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily as a result of income of $9.1 million recognized in 2007, resulting from our change in estimate relating to the collectibility of straight lined rents due from Emeritus, which was partially offset by the additive effect of our acquisitions during 2008 and 2007. No significant changes in estimates related to the collectibility of straight lined rents were made during the year ended December 31, 2008. Life science. Life science rental and related revenues increased by $128.8 million, to $208.4 million, for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily as a result of our acquisition of SEUSA on August 1, 2007. In addition, included in life science rental and related revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008, is lease termination income of $18 million received from a tenant in connection with the early termination of three leases on July 30, 2008 and rental revenues related to three development projects that were placed into service in 2008. Medical office. Medical office rental and related revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $18 million from assets that are no longer consolidated and are now in the HCP Ventures IV, LLC joint venture ("HCP Ventures IV"). The decrease in medical office rental and related revenues resulting from HCP Ventures IV was partially offset by the additive effect of our MOB acquisitions during 2007. Tenant recoveries. Year Ended December 31, Change Segments 2008 2007 $ % (dollars in thousands) Life science $ 33,914 $ 19,311 $ 14,603 76 % Medical office 47,015 44,451 2,564 6 Hospital 1,918 1,092 826 76 Total $ 82,847 $ 64,854 $ 17,993 28 % 53 Table of Contents The increase in tenant recoveries for the year ended December 31, 2008 was primarily as a result of our acquisition of SEUSA on August 1, 2007, three development projects that were placed into service in 2008, and the additive effect of our other acquisitions during 2007, partially offset by tenant recoveries related to the assets contributed to HCP Ventures IV. Income from direct financing leases. Income from DFLs decreased $5.7 million to $58.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease was primarily due to two DFL tenants exercising their purchase options on our leased assets during 2007 and two additional DFLs that were placed on non accrual status and accounted for on a cost recovery basis beginning October 2008. No purchase options were exercised during 2008. We expect that income from DFLs will decline in 2009 as a result of the two DFLs that are accounted for on a cost recovery basis. Investment management fee income. Investment management fee income decreased $7.7 million, to $5.9 million, for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in investment management fee income was primarily due to the acquisition fees earned related to our HCP Ventures II joint venture of $5.4 million on January 5, 2007 and HCP Ventures IV of $3.0 million on April 30, 2007. No acquisition fees were earned for the year ended December 31, 2008. Depreciation and amortization expenses. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $55.7 million, to $314.6 million, for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily related to our SEUSA acquisition and three development projects that were placed into service in 2008. The increase in depreciation and amortization related to SEUSA was partially offset by our other acquisitions in 2008 and 2007 and by the 2007 expenses related to the assets contributed to HCP Ventures IV. Operating expenses. Year Ended December 31, Change Segments 2008 2007 $ % (dollars in thousands) Senior housing $ 10,492 $ 10,958 $ (466 ) (4 )% Life science 43,541 26,220 17,321 66 Medical office 135,305 136,171 (866 ) (1 ) Hospital 3,294 1,907 1,387 73 Total $ 192,632 $ 175,256 $ 17,376 10 % Operating expenses are predominantly related to MOB and life science properties where we incur the expenses and recover a portion of those expenses under the respective leases. Accordingly, the number of properties in our MOB and life science portfolios directly impact operating expenses. The presentation of expenses as general and administrative or operating is based on the underlying nature of the expense. Periodically, we review the classification of expenses between categories and make revisions based on changes in the underlying nature of the expense. Life science. Life science operating expenses increased by $17.3 million, to $43.5 million, for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily as a result of our acquisition of SEUSA on August 1, 2007 and three development projects that were placed into service in 2008. Medical office. Medical office operating expenses decreased $0.9 million, to $135.3 million, for the year ended December 31, 2008. Medical office operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2007 include $7.2 million related to assets contributed to HCP Ventures IV. The decrease in medical office operating expenses resulting from HCP Ventures IV was partially 54 Table of Contents offset by the additive effect of our MOB acquisitions during 2007 and increased operating expenses in 2008. Hospital. Hospital operating expenses increased $1.4 million, to $3.3 million, for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily as a result the additive effect of our hospital acquisitions during 2007. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased $7.3 million, to $75.7 million, for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in general and administrative expenses was due to an increase in legal fees of $7 million primarily resulting from litigation and an increase of $11 million related to compensation related expenses and professional fees. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $10 million in merger and integration related expenses associated with the SEUSA acquisition and our merger with CNL Retirement Properties, Inc. and CNL Retirement Corp., and a $2 million decrease in costs related to acquisitions that were not consummated in 2007. The information set forth under the heading "Legal Proceedings" of Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this report, is incorporated herein by reference. Impairments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recognized impairments of $24.7 million as follows: (i) $16.9 million related to intangible assets associated with the early termination of leases and (ii) $7.8 million related to three senior housing properties and one hospital as a result of a decrease in expected cash flows. No assets were determined to be impaired during the year ended December 31, 2007. Gain on sale of real estate interest. On April 30, 2007, we sold an 80% interest in HCP Ventures IV, which resulted in a gain of $10.1 million. No similar transactions occurred during the year ended December 31, 2008. Interest and other income, net. Interest and other income, net increased $81.2 million, to $156.8 million, for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily related to an increase of $81.0 million of interest income from our HCR ManorCare mezzanine loan investment made in December 2007 and $28.6 million related to the settlement of litigation with Tenet. The increase in interest and other income, net was partially offset by (i) $7.1 million of lower interest earned on cash balances in 2008, (ii) a decrease in gains resulting from insurance proceeds of $4.9 million in 2007, (iii) an increase in losses from derivatives and hedge ineffectiveness of $6.4 million, (iv) an increase in recognized losses of marketable equity securities and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures of $4.4 million, (v) $3.5 million of fee income related to the early repayment of a loan in 2007, and (vi) a decrease in gains from the sale of marketable debt securities of $3.2 million. Our mezzanine investment bears interest on the $1.0 billion aggregate face amount at a floating rate of LIBOR plus 4.0%. During the second half of 2008, LIBOR significantly declined. If interest rates stay at current levels or continue to decline, we expect interest income will decline in 2009 relative to amounts in 2008. For a more detailed description of our mezzanine loan investments, see Note 7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. Our exposure to income fluctuations related to our variable rate loans is partially mitigated by our variable rate indebtedness. For a more detailed discussion of our interest rate risk, see "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in Item 7A. Interest expense. Interest expense decreased $7.1 million, to $348.4 million, for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease was primarily due to: (i) a decrease of $17 million related to the average outstanding balance under our bridge loan and a decline in LIBOR, (ii) an increase of $15 million of capitalized interest related to an increase in assets under development in our life science 55 Table of Contents segment, (iii) a decrease of $10 million resulting from the repayment of $300 million senior unsecured floating rate notes in September 2008, and (iv) a charge of $6 million related to the write off of unamortized loan fees associated with our previous revolving line of credit facility that was terminated in 2007. The decrease in interest expense was partially offset by: (i) an increase of $34 million of interest expense from the issuance of $1.1 billion of senior unsecured notes during 2007 and (ii) an increase of $6 million related to the average outstanding balances under our line of credit and term loan. Our exposure to expense fluctuations related to our variable rate indebtedness is mitigated by our variable rate investments. For a more detailed discussion of our interest rate risk, see "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in Item 7A. The table below sets forth information with respect to our debt, excluding premiums and discounts (dollars in thousands): As of December 31, 2008 2007 Balance: Fixed rate $ 5,059,910 $ 4,704,988 Variable rate 892,431 2,822,316 Total $ 5,952,341 $ 7,527,304 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate 85 % 63 % Variable rate 15 37 Total 100 % 100 % Weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 6.34 % 6.18 % Variable rate 2.57 % 5.90 % Total weighted average rate 5.77 % 6.08 % Income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2008, income taxes increased $2.8 million to $4.3 million. This increase is primarily due to an increase in taxable income related to a portion of one of our mezzanine loan investments, which was contributed to a TRS in January 2008. Equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures. For the year ended December 31, 2008, equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures decreased $2.3 million, to $3.3 million. This decrease is primarily due to a change in the expected useful life of certain intangible assets of one of our unconsolidated joint ventures that resulted in higher amounts of amortization expense. Minority interests share in earnings. For the year ended December 31, 2008, minority interests share in earnings decreased $2.3 million, to $21.3 million. This decrease is primarily due to the conversion of 2.8 million of DownREIT units into shares of our common stock during 2008, and to a lesser extent, the purchase in September 2008 of Tenets minority interest in Health Care Property Partners ("HCPP"), a joint venture between HCP and an affiliate of Tenet. We expect that these conversions and the purchase of Tenets minority interest in HCPP will decrease distributions of minority interests during 2009 relative to amounts in 2008. See Notes 2 and 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for additional information on DownREIT units and HCPP. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements An Amendment of ARB No. 51 ("SFAS No. 160"). Upon adoption on January 1, 2009, SFAS No. 160 requires us to include the net income attributable to the minority interests in our consolidated net income. However, the adoption of SFAS No. 160 is not expected to significantly change the amount of net income applicable to common shares. 56 Table of Contents Discontinued operations. Income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $244.2 million, compared to $473.4 million for the comparable period in the prior year. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in gains on real estate dispositions. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we sold 51 properties for $643 million, as compared to 97 properties for $922 million in the year ago period. Additionally, the decrease was attributable to a year over year decline in operating income from discontinued operations of $51.4 million and an increase in impairment charges of $2.8 million. Discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 included 57 properties compared to 154 for the year ended December 31, 2007. Also included in discontinued operations during the year ended December 31, 2007 was $6 million of rental income we recognized, as a result of a change in estimate related to the collectibility of straight line rental income from Emeritus. Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2007 to the Year Ended December 31, 2006 We completed our acquisition of SEUSA on August 1, 2007, mergers with CRP and CRC on October 5, 2006 and the acquisition of an interest held by an affiliate of General Electric ("GE") in HCP MOP on November 30, 2006, which resulted in the consolidation of HCP MOP beginning on that date. The results of operations from our SEUSA, CRP and HCP MOP transactions are reflected in our consolidated financial statements from those respective dates. Rental and related revenues. Year Ended December 31, Change Segments 2007 2006 $ % (dollars in thousands) Senior housing $ 293,331 $ 162,988 $ 130,343 80 % Life science 79,660 14,919 64,741 NM (1) Medical office 275,951 155,801 120,150 77 Hospital 80,960 49,540 31,420 63 Skilled nursing 35,172 32,955 2,217 7 Total $ 765,074 $ 416,203 $ 348,871 84 % (1)Percentage change not meaningful. Senior housing. Senior housing rental and related revenues increased $130.3 million, to $293.3 million, for the year ended December 31, 2007. Approximately $98 million of the increase relates to properties acquired in the CRP merger. Additionally, the results for the year ended December 31, 2007, include income of $9 million resulting from our change in estimate relating to the collectibility of straight line rents due from Summerville Senior Living, Inc. The remaining increase in senior housing rental and related revenues primarily relates to rent escalations and resets, and the additive effect of our other acquisitions in 2007 and 2006. Life science. Life science rental and related revenues increased by $64.7 million, to $79.7 million, for the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily as a result of our acquisition of SEUSA on August 1, 2007. Medical office. Medical office rental and related revenues increased $120.2 million, to $276.0 million, for the year ended December 31, 2007. Approximately $31 million of the increase relates to MOBs acquired in the CRP merger and $64.7 million relates to the consolidation of HCP MOP. The remaining increase in medical office rental and related revenues primarily relates to the additive effect of our MOB acquisitions in 2007 and 2006. Hospital. Hospital rental and related revenues increased by $31.4 million, to $81.0 million, for the year ended December 31, 2007. Approximately $29.7 million of the increase relates to the 57 Table of Contents additive effect of our hospital acquisitions in 2007 and $1.9 million related to properties acquired in the CRP merger. Tenant recoveries. Year Ended December 31, Change Segments 2007 2006 $ % (dollars in thousands) Life science $ 19,311 $ 3,935 $ 15,376 NM (1) Medical office 44,451 25,172 19,279 77 % Hospital 1,092 34 1,058 NM (1) Total $ 64,854 $ 29,141 $ 35,713 123 % (1)Percentage change not meaningful. Life science. Life science tenant recoveries increased by $15.4 million, to $19.3 million, for the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily as a result of our acquisition of SEUSA on August 1, 2007. Medical office. Medical office tenant recoveries increased $19.3 million, to $44.5 million, for the year ended December 31, 2007. Approximately $10.3 million of the increase relates to MOBs acquired in the CRP merger and $7.7 million relates to the consolidation of HCP MOP. The remaining increase in medical office tenant recoveries primarily relates to the additive effect of our MOB acquisitions in 2007 and 2006. Hospital. Hospital tenant recoveries increased as a result of our hospital acquisitions in 2007. Income from direct financing leases. Income from direct financing leases increased $48.8 million, to $63.9 million, for the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily as a result of properties acquired from CRP, which are accounted for using the direct financing method. At December 31, 2007, these leased properties had a carrying value of $640.1 million and accrued income at a weighted average interest rate of 8.5%. During the year ended December 31, 2007, two DFL tenants exercised their purchase options and we received proceeds of $51 million and recognized additional income of $4.3 million. Investment management fee income. Investment management fee income increased $9.7 million, to $13.6 million, for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition fees related to HCP Ventures II of $5.4 million on January 5, 2007 and HCP Ventures IV of $3.0 million on April 30, 2007, partially offset by the decline in fees of $3.1 million resulting from our purchase of GEs interests in HCP MOP on November 30, 2006. Depreciation and amortization expenses. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $140.6 million, to $258.9 million, for the year ended December 31, 2007. Approximately $64.8 million of the increase relates to properties acquired in the CRP merger, $19.2 million relates to the consolidation of HCP MOP and $33.5 million relates to the SEUSA acquisition. The remaining increase in depreciation and amortization primarily relates to the additive effect of our other acquisitions in 2007 and 2006. 58 Table of Contents Operating expenses. Year Ended December 31, Change Segments 2007 2006 $ % (dollars in thousands) Senior housing $ 10,958 $ 8,972 $ 1,986 22 % Life science 26,220 4,969 21,251 NM (1) Medical office 136,171 65,312 70,859 NM (1) Hospital 1,907 1,907 100 % Total $ 175,256 $ 79,253 $ 96,003 121 % (1)Percentage change not meaningful. Operating expenses are predominantly related to MOB and life science properties where we incur the expenses and recover a portion of those expenses under the lease. Accordingly, the number of properties in our MOB and life science portfolios directly impact operating expenses. The presentation of expenses as general and administrative or operating is based on the underlying nature of the expense. Periodically, we review the classification of expenses between categories and make revisions based on changes in the underlying nature of the expense. Senior housing. Included in operating expenses are facility level operating expenses for three senior housing properties that were previously leased on a triple net basis. Periodically, tenants default on their leases, which causes us to take possession of the operations of the facility. We contract with third party managers to manage these properties until a replacement tenant can be identified or the property can be sold. The operating revenues and expenses for these properties are included in healthcare rental revenues and operating expenses, respectively. The increase in reported operating expenses for these facilities of $0.9 million, to $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, was primarily due to an increase in the overall occupancy of such properties. Life science. Life science operating expenses increased by $21.3 million, to $26.2 million, for the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily as a result of our acquisition of SEUSA on August 1, 2007. Medical office. Medical office operating expenses increased $70.9 million, to $136.2 million, for the year ended December 31, 2007. Approximately $34.8 million relates to the consolidation of HCP MOP and $16.6 million of the increase relates to properties acquired in the CRP merger. The remaining increase in medical office operating expenses relates to the additive effect of our acquisitions in 2007 and 2006. Hospital. Hospital operating expenses increased as a result of our hospital acquisitions in 2007. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased $21.5 million, to $68.4 million, for the year ended December 31, 2007. Included in general and administrative expenses are merger and integration related expenses associated with the CRC and CRP mergers and the SEUSA acquisition of $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $5 million in the prior year. Merger and integration related expenses are primarily costs from our CRP merger, such as employee transition costs as well as severance costs for certain of our employees whose responsibilities became redundant after the completion of the merger. The remaining increase was primarily due to various items including increased professional and legal fees, federal and state taxes, and compensation related expenses. Impairments. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized impairments of $3.6 million as follows: (i) $1.0 million as a result of a decrease in expected cash flows from a senior 59 Table of Contents housing facility and (ii) $2.6 million as a result of the contribution of 25 properties into a senior housing joint venture in January 2007. No properties were determined to be impaired during the year ended December 31, 2007. Gain on sale of real estate interest. On April 30, 2007, we sold an 80% interest in HCP Ventures IV, which resulted in a gain of $10.1 million. There were no interests in joint ventures sold during the year ended December 31, 2006. Interest and other income, net. Interest and other income, net increased $40.9 million, to $75.6 million, for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily related to an increase of $24.0 million of interest income from $275 million of marketable debt securities, $9.3 million of interest income from an $85 million loan acquired in the CRP merger and $7.6 million of interest income from cash and cash equivalents. During 2007, our marketable debt securities accrued interest at rates ranging from 9.25% to 9.625%, and our $85 million loan accrued interest at a rate of 14%. Interest expense. Interest expense increased $144.0 million, to $355.5 million, for the year ended December 31, 2007. This increase was primarily due to (i) $106 million of interest expense from the issuance of $2.65 billion of senior unsecured notes during 2006 and 2007, (ii) $43 million increase in our outstanding mortgage debt resulting primarily from our acquisitions of CRP, consolidation of HCP MOP and other property acquisitions, (iii) $17 million from the increase in outstanding indebtedness under our bridge and term loans and line of credit facilities, and the related amortization and write off of unamortized debt issuance costs. The increase in interest expense is partially offset by $11 million increase in the amount of capitalized interest relating to the increase in assets under development primarily from our acquisition of SEUSA and $10 million decrease related to the repayment of $275 million of maturing senior unsecured notes during 2006 and 2007. The table below sets forth information with respect to our debt, excluding premiums and discounts (dollars in thousands): As of December 31, 2007 2006 Balance: Fixed rate $ 4,704,988 $ 4,541,237 Variable rate 2,822,316 1,669,031 Total $ 7,527,304 $ 6,210,268 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate 63 % 73 % Variable rate 37 27 Total 100 % 100 % Weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 6.18 % 5.91 % Variable rate 5.90 % 6.13 % Total weighted average rate 6.08 % 5.97 % Equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures. For the year ended December 31, 2007, equity income decreased $2.7 million, to $5.6 million. This decrease is primarily due to our consolidation of HCP MOP, which was previously accounted for as an equity method investment, partially offset by equity income from HCP Ventures II, III and IV. Minority interests share in earnings. For the year ended December 31, 2007, minority interests share in earnings increased $9.5 million, to $23.5 million. This increase was primarily due to the 60 Table of Contents issuance of 4.2 million non managing member units of HCP DR MCD, LLC, in connection with our February 9, 2007 acquisition of a medical campus. Discontinued operations. Income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $473.4 million, compared to $384.1 million for the comparable period in the prior year. The increase is primarily due to an increase in gains on real estate dispositions of $128.3 million and a decline in impairment charges of $6 million year over year. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we sold 97 properties for $922 million, as compared to 83 properties for $512 million in the year ago period. The increase was partially offset by a year over year decline in operating income from discontinued operations of $45.0 million. Discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 included 154 properties compared to 237 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Included in discontinued operations during the year ended December 31, 2007 was income of $6 million, resulting from a change in estimate related to the collectibility of straight line rental income from Emeritus Corporation. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal liquidity needs are to (i) fund normal operating expenses, (ii) repay the $320 million outstanding balance on the bridge loan, (iii) meet debt service requirements, including $155 million of our mortgage debt maturing in 2009, (iv) fund capital expenditures, including tenant improvements and leasing costs, (v) fund acquisition and development activities, and (vi) make minimum distributions required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Code. We believe these needs will be satisfied using cash flows generated by operations, provided by financing activities and from sales of assets during the next twelve months. Access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital and ability to refinance maturing indebtedness, as well as to fund future acquisitions and development through the issuance of additional securities or secured debt. During 2008, we raised $1 billion of equity capital, $656 million from asset dispositions, $566 million from the placement of Fannie Mae secured debt and $197 million in the bank term loan market. As of January 31, 2009, we had a credit rating of Baa3 (stable) from Moodys, BBB (stable) from S&P and BBB (positive) from Fitch on our senior unsecured debt securities, and Ba1 (stable) from Moodys, BB+ (stable) from S&P and BBB (positive) from Fitch on our preferred equity securities. During 2008, there was a decline in the availability of financing from the capital markets and widening credit spreads. Our ability to continue to access capital could be impacted by various factors including general market conditions and the continuing slowdown in the economy, interest rates, credit ratings on our securities, and any changes to these ratings, the market price of our capital stock, the performance of our portfolio, tenants, borrowers and operators, including any restructurings, disruptions or bankruptcies of our tenants, borrowers and operators, the perception of our potential future earnings and cash distributions, any unwillingness on the part of lenders to make loans to us and any deterioration in the financial position of lenders that might make them unable to meet their obligations to us. Net cash provided by operating activities was $568.7 million and $453.1 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively. Cash flow from operations reflects increased revenues partially offset by higher costs and expenses, as well as fluctuations in receivables, payables, accruals and deferred revenue. Our cash flows from operations are dependent upon the occupancy level of multi tenant buildings, rental rates on leases, our tenants performance on their lease obligations, the level of operating expenses and other factors. Net cash provided by investing activities was $427.3 million during 2008 and principally reflects the net effect of: (i) $639.6 million received from the sales of facilities, (ii) $155.5 million used to fund acquisitions and development of real estate, and (iii) $30.1 million used to purchase marketable securities. During 2008 and 2007, we used $60.0 million and $49.7 million, respectively, to fund lease 61 Table of Contents commissions and tenant and capital improvements. We expect to fund development commitments of $36.5 million for 2009. Net cash used by financing activities was $1.0 billion for 2008 and included proceeds of (i) $1.1 billion from common stock issuances and exercise of options, (ii) $579.6 million from the placement of mortgage debt and draws on construction loans, and (iii) $200 million from borrowings under our term loan. These proceeds were partially offset by or used for (i) repayments of $801.7 million of borrowings under our line of credit, (ii) repayment of $1.0 billion of borrowings under our bridge loan, (iii) repayment of $300 million of senior unsecured notes, (iv) repayment of mortgage debt aggregating $225.3 million and (v) payment of common and preferred dividends aggregating $457.6 million. In order to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we must distribute at least 90% of our taxable income, excluding capital gains, to our stockholders. Accordingly, we intend to continue to make regular quarterly distributions to holders of our common and preferred stock. At December 31, 2008, we held approximately $15.0 million in deposits and $38.2 million in irrevocable letters of credit from commercial banks securing tenants lease obligations and borrowers loan obligations. We may draw upon the letters of credit or depository accounts, subject to certain restrictions by mortgage lenders, if there are defaults under the related leases or loans. Amounts available under letters of credit could change based upon facility operating conditions and other factors, and such changes may be material. Debt Bank line of credit and bridge and term loans. Our revolving line of credit with a syndicate of banks provided for an aggregate $1.5 billion of borrowing capacity at December 31, 2008. This revolving line of credit facility accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.325% to 1.00%, depending upon our debt ratings. We pay a facility fee on the entire revolving commitment ranging from 0.10% to 0.25%, depending upon our debt ratings. Based on our debt ratings on December 31, 2008, the margin on the revolving line of credit facility was 0.55% and the facility fee was 0.15%. Our revolving line of credit facility matures on August 1, 2011. At December 31, 2008, we had $150 million outstanding under this revolving line of credit facility with a weighted average effective interest rate of 1.36%. At December 31, 2008, the outstanding balance of our bridge loan was $320 million. The bridge loan had an initial maturity date of July 31, 2008 that has been extended to July 30, 2009 through the exercise of two extension options. This bridge loan accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.425% to 1.25%, depending upon our debt ratings (weighted average effective interest rate of 2.19% at December 31, 2008). Based on our debt ratings on December 31, 2008, the margin on the bridge loan facility was 0.70%. Our revolving line of credit facility and bridge loan contain certain financial restrictions and other customary requirements. A portion of these financial covenants become more restrictive through the period ending March 31, 2009. Among other things, these covenants, using terms defined in the agreement, (i) limit the ratio of Consolidated Total Indebtedness to Consolidated Total Asset Value to 60%, (ii) limit the ratio of Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Unencumbered Asset Value to 65%, (iii) require a Fixed Charge Coverage ratio of 1.75 times, and (iv) require a formula determined Minimum Consolidated Tangible Net Worth of $4.2 billion at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with each of these restrictions and requirements of our credit revolving credit facility and bridge loan. On October 24, 2008, we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks for a $200 million unsecured term loan, which matures on August 1, 2011. The term loan accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.825% to 2.375%, depending upon our debt ratings (weighted average effective interest rate of 3.68% at December 31, 2008). Based on our 62 Table of Contents debt rating on December 31, 2008, the margin on the term loan was 2.00%. We received net proceeds of $197 million, which were used to repay a portion of our outstanding indebtedness under our bridge loan facility. The term loan contains certain financial restrictions and other customary requirements, similar to those included in our revolving line of credit and bridge loan. At December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with each of these restrictions and requirements of the term loan. Our revolving line of credit facility and bridge and term loans also contain cross default provisions to other indebtedness of ours, including in some instances, certain mortgages on our properties. Certain mortgages contain default provisions relating to defaults under the leases or operating agreements on the applicable properties by our operators or tenants, including default provisions relating to the bankruptcy of such operator or tenant. Although we believe that we would be able to secure amendments under the applicable agreements if a default as described above occurs, such default may result in significantly less favorable borrowing terms than currently available, material delays in the availability of funding or other material adverse consequences. Senior unsecured notes. At December 31, 2008, we had $3.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding. Interest rates on the notes ranged from 2.90% to 7.07% with a weighted average effective rate of 6.25% at December 31, 2008. Discounts and premiums are amortized to interest expense over the term of the related debt. In September 2008, we repaid $300 million of maturing senior unsecured notes which accrued interest based on the three month LIBOR plus 0.45%. The notes were repaid with funds available under our revolving line of credit facility. The senior unsecured notes contain certain covenants including limitations on debt, cross acceleration provisions and other customary terms. At December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with these covenants. Mortgage debt. At December 31, 2008, we had $1.6 billion in mortgage debt secured by 198 healthcare facilities with a carrying amount of $2.8 billion. Interest rates on the mortgage notes ranged from 1.03% to 8.63% with a weighted average effective interest rate of 6.10% at December 31, 2008. In May 2008, we placed $259 million of seven year mortgage financing on 21 of our senior housing assets. The assets are cross collateralized and the debt has a fixed interest rate of 5.83%. We received net proceeds aggregating $254 million, which were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under our revolving line of credit facility and bridge loan. In September 2008, we placed mortgage financing on our senior housing assets through Fannie Mae aggregating $319 million, which was comprised of $140 million of five year mortgage financing on four assets and $179 million of eight year financing on 12 assets. The assets are cross collateralized and the debt has a weighted average fixed interest rate of 6.39%. We received net proceeds aggregating $312 million, which were used to repay our outstanding indebtedness under our revolving line of credit facility. On December 19, 2008, we recognized a gain of $2.4 million related to the negotiated early repayment of $120 million of mortgage debt, at a discount, with an original maturity of January 27, 2009. The mortgage debt was repaid with funds available under our revolving line of credit facility. Mortgage debt generally requires monthly principal and interest payments, is collateralized by certain properties and is generally non recourse. Mortgage debt typically restricts transfer of the encumbered properties, prohibits additional liens, restricts prepayment, requires payment of real estate taxes, requires maintenance of the properties in good condition, requires maintenance of insurance on the properties and includes requirements to obtain lender consent to enter into and terminate material leases. Some of the mortgage debt is also cross collateralized by multiple properties and may require tenants or operators to maintain compliance with the applicable leases or operating agreements of such properties. 63  Table of Contents Other debt. At December 31, 2008, we had $102.2 million of non interest bearing Life Care Bonds at two of our CCRCs and non interest bearing occupancy fee deposits at another of our senior housing facilities, all of which were payable to certain residents of the facilities (collectively "Life Care Bonds"). At December 31, 2008, $42.4 million of the Life Care Bonds were refundable to the residents upon the resident moving out or to their estate upon death, and $59.8 million of the Life Care Bonds were refundable after the unit is successfully remarketed to a new resident. Derivative Financial Instruments. During October and November 2007, we entered into two forward starting interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts aggregating $900 million. In June 2008, we terminated these hedges per the cash settlement provisions of the derivative contracts. The termination of the $500 million notional contract resulted in a payment of $14.8 million and the termination of the $400 million notional contract resulted in a cash receipt of $5.2 million. We also have three interest rate swap contracts outstanding at December 31, 2008, which hedge fluctuations in interest payments on variable rate secured debt. At December 31, 2008, these interest rate swap contracts had an aggregate notional amount of $45.6 million and a fair value of a $2.3 million liability, respectively. For a more detailed description of our derivative financial instruments, see "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in Item 7A.

We have a prospectus on file with the SEC as part of a registration statement on Form S 3, using a shelf registration process which expires in 2009. Under this "shelf" process, we may sell from time to time any combination of the securities in one or more offerings. The securities described in the prospectus include common stock, preferred stock and debt securities. Each time we sell securities under the shelf registration, we will provide a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information about the terms of the securities being offered and of the offering. We may offer and sell the securities pursuant to this prospectus from time to time in one or more of the following ways: through underwriters or dealers, through agents, directly to purchasers or through a combination of any of these methods of sales. Proceeds from the sale of these securities may be used for general corporate purposes, which may include repayment of indebtedness, working capital and potential acquisitions. During 2008, we issued approximately $1.0 billion of common stock under the shelf. 64 Table of Contents Equity On April 2, 2008, we issued 17 million shares of our common stock and used the net proceeds received of approximately $560 million to repay a portion of our outstanding indebtedness under our revolving line of credit facility. On August 11, 2008, we issued 14.95 million shares of our common stock and used the net proceeds received of approximately $481 million to repay a portion of our outstanding indebtedness under our bridge loan. At December 31, 2008, we had 4.0 million shares of 7.25% Series E cumulative redeemable preferred stock, 7.8 million shares of 7.10% Series F cumulative redeemable preferred stock and 253.6 million shares of common stock outstanding. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we issued approximately 438,000 shares of our common stock under our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan, at an average price per share of $30.71 for aggregate proceeds of $13.5 million. We also received $11.5 million in proceeds from stock option exercises. At December 31, 2008, stockholders equity totaled $5.2 billion and our equity securities had a market value of $3.8 billion. As of December 31, 2008, there were a total of 4.8 million DownREIT units outstanding in six limited liability companies in which we are the managing member: (i) HCPI/Tennessee, LLC; (ii) HCPI/Utah, LLC; (iii) HCPI/Utah II, LLC; (iv) HCP DR California, LLC; (v) HCP DR Alabama, LLC; and (vi) HCP DR MCD, LLC. The DownREIT units are redeemable for an amount of cash approximating the then existing market value of shares of our common stock or, at our option, shares of our common stock (subject to certain adjustments, such as stock splits and reclassifications). For the year ended December 31, 2008, we issued 3.7 million shares of our common stock upon the conversion of 2.8 million DownREIT units. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We own interests in certain unconsolidated joint ventures, including HCP Ventures II, HCP Ventures III and HCP Ventures IV, as described under Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Except in limited circumstances, our risk of loss is limited to our investment in the joint venture and any outstanding loans receivable. In addition, we have certain properties which serve as collateral for debt that is owed by a previous owner of certain of our facilities, as described under Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our risk of loss for these properties is limited to the outstanding debt balance plus penalties, if any. We have no other material off balance sheet arrangements that we expect would materially affect our liquidity and capital resources except those described below under "Contractual Obligations." 65 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our material contractual payment obligations and commitments at December 31, 2008 (in thousands): Total Less than One Year 2010 2011 2012 2013 More than Five Years Senior unsecured notes and mortgage debt $ 5,180,132 $ 155,347 $ 942,490 $ 1,093,987 $ 2,988,308 Development commitments(1) 36,460 36,460 Bank line of credit(2) 150,000 150,000 Bridge and term loans 520,000 320,000 200,000 Ground and other operating leases 176,981 3,638 6,809 6,996 159,538 Other debt(3) 102,209 102,209 Interest 1,862,348 324,163 576,286 459,660 502,239 Total $ 8,028,130 $ 941,817 $ 1,875,585 $ 1,560,643 $ 3,650,085 (1)Represents construction and other commitments for developments in progress.

(3)Other debt represents non interest bearing Life Care Bonds and occupancy fee deposits at three of our senior housing facilities, which are payable on demand, under certain conditions. Inflation Our leases often provide for either fixed increases in base rents or indexed escalators, based on the Consumer Price Index or other measures, and or additional rent based on increases in the tenants operating revenues. Substantially all of our MOB leases require the tenant to pay a share of property operating costs such as real estate taxes, insurance and utilities. Substantially all of our senior housing, life science, skilled nursing and hospital leases require the operator or tenant to pay all of the property operating costs or reimburse us for all such costs. We believe that inflationary increases in expenses will be offset, in part, by the operator or tenant expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases described above. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for the impact of new accounting standards.  ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk. At December 31, 2008, we were exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on approximately $1.0 billion of variable rate mezzanine loans receivable and $111 million investment in leased assets whose rental payments fluctuate with changes in LIBOR. Our exposure to income fluctuations related to our variable rate investments is partially offset by (i) $150 million of variable rate line of credit borrowings, (ii) $520 million of variable rate bridge and term financing, (iii) $197 million of variable rate mortgage notes payable, excluding $46 million variable rate mortgage notes which have been hedged through interest rate swap contracts, and (iv) $25 million of variable rate senior unsecured notes. Of our consolidated debt of $6.0 billion at December 31, 2008, excluding the $46 million of variable rate debt where the rates have been swapped to a fixed rate, $892 million or 15% is at variable interest rates. Interest rate fluctuations will generally not affect our future earnings or cash flows on our fixed rate debt, loans receivable and debt securities unless such instruments mature or are otherwise 66 Table of Contents terminated. However, interest rate changes will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments. Conversely, changes in interest rates on variable rate debt and investments would change our future earnings and cash flows, but not significantly affect the fair value of those instruments. Assuming a one percentage point increase in the interest rate related to the variable rate investments and variable rate debt, and assuming no change in the outstanding balance as of December 31, 2008, net interest income would improve by approximately $2.2 million, or $0.01 per common share on a diluted basis. Assuming a 50 basis point decrease in interest rates under the above circumstances and taking into consideration that the index underlying many of our arrangements is currently below 50 basis points and is not expected to go below zero, net interest income would decline by $1.1 million. We use derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage or hedge interest rate risk. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for further information in this regard. At December 31, 2008, we had three interest rate swap contracts outstanding which are designated in qualifying cash flow hedging relationships. On December 31 2008, the interest rate swap contracts have an aggregate notional amount and fair value of $45.6 million and a $2.3 million liability, respectively. The derivative contracts mature in July 2020 and are currently recognized in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. To illustrate the effect of movements in the interest rate markets, we performed a market sensitivity analysis on the noted hedging instruments. To do so, we applied various basis point spreads, to the underlying interest rates of the derivative portfolio in order to determine the instruments change in fair value. The following table summarizes the analysis performed (dollars in thousands): Effects of Change in Interest Rates Date Entered Maturity Date 50 Basis Points 50 Basis Points 100 Basis Points 100 Basis Points July 13, 2005 July 15, 2020 $ 2,140 $ (2,426 ) $ 4,423 $ (4,709 ) Market Risk. We are directly and indirectly affected by changes in the equity and bond markets. We have investments in marketable debt and equity securities classified as available for sale. Gains and losses on these securities are recognized in income when realized and losses are recognized when an other than temporary decline in value is identified. The initial indicator of an other than temporary decline in value for marketable equity securities is a sustained decline in market price below the carrying value for that investment. We consider a variety of factors in evaluating an other than temporary decline in value, such as: the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost; the issuers financial condition, capital strength and near term prospects; any recent events specific to that issuer and economic conditions of its industry; and our investment horizon in relationship to an anticipated near term recovery in the stock or bond price, if any. At December 31, 2008, the fair value and cost, or the new basis for those securities where a realized loss was recorded, of marketable equity securities was $3.8 million and $4.2 million, respectively, and the fair value and cost of marketable debt securities was $229 million and $295 million, respectively. The principal amount and the average interest rates for our loans receivable and debt categorized by maturity dates is presented in the table below. The fair value for our debt securities and senior unsecured notes payable are based on prevailing market prices. The fair value estimates for loans 67 Table of Contents receivable and mortgage debt payable are based on discounting future cash flows utilizing current rates offered to us for loans and debt of the same type and remaining maturity.
