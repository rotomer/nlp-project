ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Cautionary Language Regarding Forward Looking Statements Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K that are not historical factual statements are "forward looking statements." We intend to have our forward looking statements covered by the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and include this statement for purposes of complying with those provisions. Forward looking statements include, among other things, statements regarding our and our officers intent, belief or expectations as identified by the use of words such as "may," "will," "project," "expect," "believe," "intend," "anticipate," "seek," "forecast," "plan," "estimate," "could," "would," "should" and other comparable and derivative terms or the negatives thereof. In addition, we, through our officers, from time to time, make forward looking oral and written public statements concerning our expected future operations, strategies, securities offerings, growth and investment opportunities, dispositions, capital structure changes, budgets and other developments. Readers are cautioned that, while forward looking statements reflect our good faith belief and reasonable assumptions based upon current information, we can give no assurance that our expectations or forecasts will be attained. Therefore, readers should be mindful that forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that they are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. As more fully set forth in Part I, Item 1A., "Risk Factors" in this report, factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations contained in the forward looking statements include: (a)Changes in national and local economic conditions, including a prolonged recession; (b)Continued volatility in the capital markets, including changes in interest rates and the availability and cost of capital; (c)The ability of the Company to manage its indebtedness level and changes in the terms of such indebtedness; (d)Changes in federal, state or local laws and regulations, including those affecting the healthcare industry that affect our costs of compliance or increase the costs, or otherwise affect the operations of our operators, tenants and borrowers; (e)The potential impact of existing and future litigation matters, including the possibility of larger than expected litigation costs and related developments; (f)Competition for tenants and borrowers, including with respect to new leases and mortgages and the renewal or rollover of existing leases; (g)The ability of the Company to negotiate the same or better terms with new tenants or operators if existing leases are not renewed or the Company exercises its right to replace an existing operator or tenant upon default; (h)Availability of suitable properties to acquire at favorable prices and the competition for the acquisition and financing of those properties; (i)The ability of our operators, tenants and borrowers to conduct their respective businesses in a manner sufficient to maintain or increase their revenues and to generate sufficient income to make rent and loan payments to us; (j)The financial weakness of some operators and tenants, including potential bankruptcies and downturns in their businesses, which results in uncertainties regarding our ability to continue to realize the full benefit of such operators and or tenants leases; (k)The risk that we will not be able to sell or lease properties that are currently vacant, at all or at competitive rates; 40 Table of Contents (l)The financial, legal and regulatory difficulties of significant operators of our properties, including Sunrise; (m)The risk that we may not be able to integrate acquired businesses successfully or achieve the operating efficiencies and other benefits of acquisitions within expected time frames or at all, or within expected cost projections; (n)The ability to obtain financing necessary to consummate acquisitions on favorable terms; and (o)Changes in the reimbursement available to our tenants and borrowers by governmental or private payors, including changes in Medicare and Medicaid payment levels and the availability and cost of third party insurance coverage. Except as required by law, we undertake no, and hereby disclaim any, obligation to update any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, changed circumstances or otherwise. The information set forth in this Item 7 is intended to provide readers with an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations. We will discuss and provide our analysis in the following order: Executive Summary 2009 Transaction Overview Dividends Critical Accounting Policies Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Contractual Obligations Inflation Recent Accounting Pronouncements Executive Summary We are a self administered REIT that, together with our consolidated subsidiaries, invests primarily in real estate serving the healthcare industry in the U.S. We acquire, develop, lease, manage and dispose of healthcare real estate and provide financing to healthcare providers. At December 31, 2009, our portfolio of investments, including properties owned by our Investment Management Platform, consisted of interests in 675 facilities and $1.8 billion of mezzanine and other secured loan investments. Our business strategy is based on three principles: (i) opportunistic investing, (ii) portfolio diversification, and (iii) conservative financing. We actively redeploy capital from investments with lower return potential into assets with higher return potential and recycle capital from shorter term to longer term investments. We make investments where the expected risk adjusted return exceeds our cost of capital and strive to leverage our operator, tenant and other business relationships. Our strategy contemplates acquiring and developing properties on terms that are favorable to us. We attempt to structure transactions that are tax advantaged and mitigate risks in our underwriting process. Generally, we prefer larger, more complex private transactions that leverage our management teams experience and our infrastructure. 41 Table of Contents We follow a disciplined approach to enhancing the value of our existing portfolio, including ongoing evaluation of potential disposition of properties that no longer fit our strategy. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we sold 14 properties for $72 million, recognizing gain on sales of real estate of $37 million, and HCA marketable debt securities for $157 million, resulting in gains of $9 million. We primarily generate revenue by leasing healthcare properties under long term leases. Most of our rents and other earned income from leases are received under triple net leases or leases that provide for substantial recovery of operating expenses; however, some of our medical office and life science leases are structured as gross or modified gross leases. Accordingly, for such MOBs and life science facilities we incur certain property operating expenses, such as real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance, property management fees, utilities and insurance. Our growth depends, in part, on our ability to (i) increase rental income and other earned income from leases by increasing rental rates and occupancy levels; (ii) maximize tenant recoveries given underlying lease structures; and (iii) control operating and other expenses. Our operations are impacted by property specific, market specific, general economic and other conditions. Access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital and ability to refinance maturing indebtedness, as well as to fund future acquisitions and development through the issuance of additional securities or secured debt. Access to external capital on favorable terms is critical to the success of our strategy. During 2009, we closed $881 million of equity capital offerings through the issuance of common stock. 2009 Transaction Overview Investment Transactions During the year ended December 31, 2009, we made aggregate investments of $724 million as follows: i) purchased a $720 million participation in the first mortgage debt of HCR ManorCare at a discount of $130 million, which resulted in an acquisition cost of $590 million that is discussed below; ii) purchased the remaining interests in three senior housing joint ventures with an aggregate unencumbered value of $15 million; and iii) funded $119 million for construction and other capital projects, primarily in our life science segment. The $720 million participation in the first mortgage debt of HCR ManorCare discussed above bears interest at the London Interbank Offer Rate ("LIBOR") plus 1.25% and represents 45% of the $1.6 billion most senior tranche of HCR ManorCares mortgage debt incurred as part of the financing for The Carlyle Groups acquisition of Manor Care, Inc. in December 2007. The mortgage debt matures in January 2013 if the borrower meets certain performance conditions and exercises a one year extension option, and was secured by a first lien on 331 facilities located in 30 states at closing. We obtained favorable financing to fund 72% of the purchase price, resulting in a net cash payment by HCP of $166 million. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we sold $229 million of investments from the following segments: i) $203 million of hospital ($157 million of HCA bonds and $46 million in real estate assets); ii) $15 million of senior housing; and iii) $11 million of medical office. Financing Transactions During the year ended December 31, 2009, we raised $881 million in equity capital and entered into interest rate swap transactions with an aggregate notional amount of $750 million, as discussed below: On May 8, 2009, we completed a $440 million public offering of 20.7 million shares of our common stock at a price per share of $21.25. We received net proceeds of $422 million, which were 42 Table of Contents used to repay all amounts of indebtedness outstanding under our bridge loan credit facility, with the remainder used for general corporate purposes. On June 12, 2009, the Company entered into an interest rate swap contract (pay float and receive fixed) with a notional amount of $250 million that terminates in September 2011. This interest rate swap contract reduces our net floating rate asset exposure, which increased as a result of the repayment of our floating rate bridge loan credit facility. On August 10, 2009, we completed a $441 million public offering of 17.8 million shares of our common stock at a price of $24.75 per share. We received net proceeds of $423 million, which were used to repay the total outstanding indebtedness under our revolving line of credit facility, including borrowings for the additional investment in HCR ManorCare discussed above, with the remainder used for general corporate purposes. On August 20, 2009, we entered into two interest rate swap contracts (pay float and receive fixed) with an aggregate notional amount of $500 million that terminate in 2011. The interest rate swap contracts reduced our net floating rate asset exposure, which had increased as a result of our additional investment in HCR ManorCare and third quarter repayments of floating rate debt, which were both funded with proceeds from our August 2009 public equity offering. On August 27, 2009, we prepaid $100 million of variable rate mortgage debt. The mortgage debt, with an original maturity of January 2010, was repaid with proceeds from our August 2009 public equity offering and third quarter asset sales. Other Events On October 1, 2009, we completed the transition of management agreements on 15 communities operated by Sunrise that were previously terminated for Sunrises failure to achieve certain performance thresholds. The transition of these facilities to new operators decreases our Sunrise managed properties in our portfolio to 75 communities from the original 101 communities we acquired in the 2006 CNL Retirement Properties, Inc. transaction. The termination of the agreements did not require the payment of a termination fee to Sunrise by our tenants or us. Dividends Quarterly dividends paid during 2009 aggregated $1.84 per share. On February 1, 2010, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly common stock cash dividend of $0.465 per share. The common stock dividend will be paid on February 23, 2010 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 11, 2010. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") requires our management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base estimates on our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different, it is possible that different accounting would have been applied, resulting in a different presentation of our consolidated financial statements. From time to time, we re evaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and 43 Table of Contents assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. For a more detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of HCP, our wholly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures that we control, through voting rights or other means. We consolidate investments in variable interest entities ("VIEs") when we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE at either the creation of the variable interest entity or upon the occurrence of a qualifying reconsideration event. We make judgments with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity and whether we are (or are not) the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Consideration of various factors including, but not limited to, the form of our ownership interest, our representation on the entitys governing body, the size and seniority of our investment, various cash flow scenarios related to the VIE, our ability to participate in policy making decisions and the rights of the other investors to participate in the decision making process and to replace us as manager and or liquidate the venture, if applicable. Our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity at inception of our involvement or upon a reconsideration event and determine the primary beneficiary of a VIE, affects the presentation of these entities in our consolidated financial statements. If we were to perform a primary beneficiary analysis upon the occurrence of a future reconsideration event, our assumptions may be different, which could result in the identification of a different primary beneficiary. If we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE our consolidated financial statements would include the results of the VIE (either tenant or borrower) rather than the results of our lease or loan to the VIE. We would depend on the VIE to provide us timely financial information, and we would rely on the internal controls of the VIE to provide accurate financial information. If the VIE has deficiencies in its internal controls over financial reporting, or does not provide us with timely financial information, this may adversely impact our financial reporting and our internal controls over financial reporting. Revenue Recognition We recognize rental revenue on a straight line basis over the lease term when collectibility is reasonably assured and the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of the leased asset. For assets acquired subject to leases, we recognize revenue upon acquisition of the asset provided the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of the leased asset. If the lease provides for tenant improvements, we determine whether the tenant improvements, for accounting purposes, are owned by the tenant or us. When we are the owner of the tenant improvements, the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the physical use of the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially completed. When the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements, any tenant improvement allowance funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term. The determination of ownership of the tenant improvements is subject to significant judgment. If our assessment of the owner of the tenant improvements for accounting purposes were to change, the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted. Certain leases provide for additional rents contingent upon a percentage of the facilitys revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds. Such revenue is recognized when actual results reported by the tenant, or estimates of tenant results, exceed the base amount or other thresholds. The recognition of additional rents requires us to make estimates of amounts owed and to a certain extent are dependent on the accuracy of the facility results reported to us. Our estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements. 44  Table of Contents We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts, including an allowance for straight line rent receivables, for estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults or the inability of tenants to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments. We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants and operators on an ongoing basis. This evaluation considers industry and economic conditions, property performance, credit enhancements and other factors. For straight line rent amounts, our assessment is based on income recoverable over the term of the lease. We exercise judgment in establishing allowances and consider payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates. These estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Loans receivable are classified as held for investment based on managements intent and ability to hold the loans for the foreseeable future or to maturity. We recognize interest income on loans, including the amortization of discounts and premiums, using the effective interest method applied on a loan by loan basis when collectibility of the future payments is reasonably assured. Premiums, discounts and related costs are recognized as yield adjustments over the life of the related loans. We use the direct finance method of accounting to record income from DFLs. For leases accounted for as DFLs, future minimum lease payments are recorded as a receivable. The difference between the future minimum lease payments and the estimated residual values less the cost of the properties is recorded as unearned income. Unearned income is deferred and amortized to income over the lease terms to provide a constant yield when collectibility of the lease payments is reasonably assured. Investments in DFLs are presented net of unamortized unearned income. Loans and DFLs are placed on non accrual status at such time as management determines that collectibility of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured. While on non accrual status, loans or DFLs are either accounted for on a cash basis, in which income is recognized only upon receipt of cash, or on a cost recovery basis, in which all cash receipts reduce the carrying value of the loan or DFL, based on managements judgment of collectibility. Allowances are established for loans and DFLs based upon a probable loss estimate for individual loans and DFLs deemed to be impaired. Loans and DFLs are impaired when it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due on a timely basis in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan or lease. Determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires significant judgment by us about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The allowance is based upon our assessment of the borrowers or lessees overall financial condition, resources and payment record; the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors; and, if appropriate, the realizable value of any collateral. These estimates consider all available evidence including, as appropriate, the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loans or DFLs effective interest rate, the fair value of collateral, general economic conditions and trends, historical and industry loss experience, and other relevant factors. While our assumptions are based in part upon historical data, our estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Real Estate We make estimates as part of our allocation of the purchase price of acquisitions to the various components of the acquisition based upon the relative value of each component. The most significant components of our allocations are typically the allocation of fair value to the buildings as if vacant, land and market value of in place leases. In the case of the fair value of buildings and the allocation of value to land and other intangibles, our estimates of the values of these components will affect the amount of depreciation we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or the remaining lease term. In the case of the market value of in place leases, we make our best estimates based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenants lease. Factors considered include 45 Table of Contents estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods, market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. Our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue that we will recognize over the remaining lease term for the acquired in place leases. A variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition, development and leasing of properties. After determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. Determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment. The costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes and other costs incurred during the period of development. We consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy and cease capitalization of costs upon the completion of the related tenant improvements. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Goodwill We assess the carrying value of our real estate assets and related intangibles ("real estate assets"), whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested at least annually by applying the two step approach. If the sum of the expected future net undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the real estate assets, an impairment loss will be recognized by adjusting the assets carrying amount to its estimated fair value. If the fair value of a reporting unit containing goodwill is less than its carrying value, then a second step of the test is needed to measure the amount of potential goodwill impairment. The second step requires the fair value of the reporting unit to be allocated to all the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of assets and liabilities is the implied value of goodwill and is used to determine the amount of impairment. The determination of the fair value of real estate assets and goodwill involves significant judgment. This judgment is based on our analysis and estimates of fair value of real estate assets and reporting units, and the future operating results and resulting cash flows of each real estate asset whose carrying amount may not be recoverable. Our ability to accurately predict future operating results and cash flows and estimate and allocate fair values impacts the timing and recognition of impairments. While we believe our assumptions are reasonable, changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results. Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures Investments in entities which we do not consolidate but for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are reported under the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, our share of the investees earnings or losses are included in our consolidated results of operations. The initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is based on the amount paid to purchase the joint venture interest or the carrying value of the assets prior to the sale of interests in the joint venture. We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment based upon a comparison of the fair value of the equity method investment to our carrying value. When we determine a decline in the fair value of our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is below its carrying value is other than temporary, an impairment is recorded. The determination of the fair value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, involves significant judgment. Our estimates consider all available evidence including, as appropriate, the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at market rates, general economic conditions and trends, and other relevant factors. Capitalization rates, discount rates and credit spreads utilized in our valuation models are based upon rates that we believe to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for the respective 46 Table of Contents investments. While we believe our assumptions are reasonable, changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results. Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, significant management judgment is required to evaluate our compliance with REIT requirements. Our determinations are based on interpretation of tax laws, and our conclusions may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized. Adjustments to income tax expense may be required as a result of: (i) audits conducted by federal and state tax authorities, (ii) our ability to qualify as a REIT, (iii) the potential for built in gain recognized related to prior tax free acquisitions of C corporations, and (iv) changes in tax laws. Adjustments required in any given period are included in income, other than adjustments to income tax liabilities acquired in business combinations, which are adjusted through goodwill. Results of Operations We evaluate our business and allocate resources among our five business segments: (i) senior housing, (ii) life science, (iii) medical office, (iv) hospital and (v) skilled nursing. Under the senior housing, life science, hospital and skilled nursing segments, we invest primarily in single operator or tenant properties, through the acquisition and development of real estate, and by debt issued by operators in these sectors. Under the medical office segment, we invest through the acquisition of MOBs that are primarily leased under gross or modified gross leases, generally to multiple tenants, and which generally require a greater level of property management. The acquisition of SEUSA on August 1, 2007 resulted in a change to our reportable segments. Prior to the SEUSA acquisition, we operated through two reportable segments triple net leased and medical office buildings. The senior housing, life science, hospital and skilled nursing segments were previously aggregated under our triple net leased segment. SEUSAs results are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition of August 1, 2007. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report). Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2009 to the Year Ended December 31, 2008 Rental and related revenues. Year Ended December 31, Change Segments 2009 2008 $ % (dollars in thousands) Senior housing $ 290,816 $ 288,625 $ 2,191 1 % Life science 214,134 208,415 5,719 3 Medical office 260,516 259,442 1,074 Hospital 83,282 83,029 253 Skilled nursing 37,747 35,925 1,822 5 Total $ 886,495 $ 875,436 $ 11,059 1 % Senior housing. Senior housing rental and related revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 includes $6.4 million resulting from an adjustment to the purchase price allocation of certain assets acquired in 2006. No similar adjustments were made in the year ended December 31, 2008. As a result of the transfer of an 11 property senior housing portfolio to Emeritus Corporation ("Emeritus") on December 1, 2008, our rental revenues increased by $9.8 million primarily related to new leases with Emeritus. These increases were partially offset by (i) a decrease of $7.4 million related to 2008 additional rents from property level expense 47 Table of Contents credits related to our properties operated by Sunrise and (ii) a $7.3 million decrease in the facility level operating revenues for three senior housing properties that were previously under management agreements and re leased on a triple net basis during 2009. Life science. The increase in life science rental and related revenues was primarily a result of (i) a net increase of $14.9 million from lease up activities that were partially offset by vacancies, and (ii) a $6.7 million net increase from development assets placed in service during 2008 that were partially offset by assets placed in redevelopment. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $14.7 million in lease termination fees. Tenant recoveries. Year Ended December 31, Change Segments 2009 2008 $ % (dollars in thousands) Life science $ 40,845 $ 33,932 $ 6,913 20 % Medical office 46,748 46,960 (212 ) Hospital 1,989 1,919 70 4 Total $ 89,582 $ 82,811 $ 6,771 8 % Life science. Life science tenant recoveries increased primarily as a result of an increase in occupancy levels at our life science facilities and the impact of development assets placed in service during 2008. Income from direct financing leases. Income from DFLs decreased $6.7 million to $51.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease was primarily due to three DFLs that during 2009 were deemed to be completely impaired. (See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report). Interest income. For the year ended December 31, 2009, interest income decreased $6.7 million to $124.1 million. This decrease was primarily related to a decline in LIBOR resulting in a decrease of interest earned on our mezzanine variable rate loans, which was partially offset by additional interest income earned from the $720 million participation in the first mortgage debt of HCR ManorCare purchased in August 2009. For a more detailed description of our mezzanine loan and participation in the first mortgage debt of HCR ManorCare, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. Our exposure to income fluctuations related to our variable rate loans is partially mitigated by our variable rate indebtedness. For a more detailed discussion of our interest rate risk, see "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in Item 7A. Depreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $6.2 million to $319.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily relates to a $3.3 million increase due to the purchase in September 2008 of Tenets noncontrolling interest in Health Care Property Partners, a joint venture between HCP and an affiliate of Tenet, and an increase of $2.0 million resulting from an adjustment to the purchase price allocation related to certain assets acquired in 2006 (See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report). 48 Table of Contents Operating expenses. Year Ended December 31, Change Segments 2009 2008 $ % (dollars in thousands) Senior housing $ 3,938 $ 11,373 $ (7,435 ) (65 )% Life science 47,285 43,565 3,720 9 Medical office 130,601 134,919 (4,318 ) (3 ) Hospital 3,873 3,264 609 19 Skilled nursing 201 201 NM (1) Total $ 185,898 $ 193,121 $ (7,223 ) (4 )% (1)Percentage change not meaningful. Operating expenses are predominantly related to MOB and life science properties where we incur the expenses and recover all or a portion of those expenses under the respective leases. Accordingly, the number of properties in our MOB and life science portfolios directly impact operating expenses. The presentation of expenses as general and administrative or operating is based on the underlying nature of the expense. Periodically, we review the classification of expenses between categories and make revisions that we believe improve the quality of our presentation. Senior housing. Senior housing operating expenses decreased primarily as a result of a decrease in facility level operating expenses for three senior housing properties that were previously under management agreements and re leased on a triple net basis during 2009. Life science. Life science operating expenses increased primarily as a result of an increase in occupancy levels at our life science facilities and the impact of development assets placed in service during 2008. Medical office. Medical office operating expenses decreased primarily as a result of cost saving initiatives implemented in 2009 and the impact of properties which were taken out of service and placed into redevelopment during 2008 and 2009. General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased $4.8 million to $78.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in legal fees associated with litigation matters partially offset by lower compensation related expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, in relation to the Ventas litigation matter, we incurred legal expenses of $13.2 million and $6.9 million, respectively (see the information set forth under the heading "Legal Proceedings" of Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report). Litigation provision. On September 4, 2009, a jury returned a verdict in favor of Ventas in an action brought against us in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky for tortious interference with prospective business advantage in connection with Ventas 2007 acquisition of Sunrise REIT. The jury awarded Ventas approximately $102 million in compensatory damages, which we recorded as a litigation provision expense during 2009 (see the information set forth under the heading "Legal Proceedings" of Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report). Impairments. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized impairments of $75.5 million as a result of (i) an aggregate $63.1 million provision related to DFL and loan losses (impairment charges) related to the bankruptcy of Erickson Retirement Communities ("Erickson") who is the tenant at three of our senior housing CCRC DFLs and the borrower of a senior construction loan in which we have a $10 million participation (see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements 49 Table of Contents in this report), and (ii) $5.9 million of intangible assets on 12 of 15 senior housing communities that were written off due to the termination of the Sunrise management agreements on 15 senior housing communities effective October 1, 2009, (iii) $4.3 million related to a senior secured term loan as a result of an expected restructuring of terms to the loan following the default of the borrower in our hospital segment (see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report), and (iv) $2.2 million related to intangible assets associated with the early termination of a lease in our life science segment. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recognized impairments of $27.5 million as follows: (i) $12.0 million related to intangible assets associated with the transfer of an 11 property senior housing portfolio, (ii) $3.7 million related to intangible assets associated with the early termination of three leases in the life science segment, (iii) $1.0 million related to intangible assets associated with the early termination of two leases in the hospital segment, (iv) $1.6 million related to two senior housing facilities as a result of a decrease in expected cash flows, and (v) $9.2 million, included in discontinued operations, related to the decrease in expected cash flows and anticipated dispositions of two senior housing properties and one hospital. Other income, net. For the year ended December 31, 2009, other income, net decreased $17.9 million to $7.9 million. This decrease was primarily related to the $28.6 million of income related to the 2008 settlement of litigation with Tenet and a $2.4 million gain on the early repayment of debt. The decrease was partially offset by increases in gains on marketable debt securities of $8.6 million and a reduction of $7.3 million of other than temporary impairments on marketable equity securities. For a more detailed description of our marketable securities investments, see Note 10 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. Interest expense. For the year ended December 31, 2009, interest expense decreased $49.5 million to $298.9 million. The decrease was primarily due to (i) a decrease of $45.7 million from the decline in LIBOR and the repayment of the outstanding balance under our bridge loan and revolving line of credit facility, and (ii) a decrease of $8.3 million resulting from the repayment of $300 million senior unsecured floating rate notes in September 2008. These decreases in interest expense were partially offset by an increase of $5.2 million from the net impact of mortgage debt placed on senior housing assets in 2008 and the repayment of mortgage debt related to contractual maturities. Our exposure to expense fluctuations related to our variable rate indebtedness is mitigated by our variable rate investments. For a more detailed discussion of our interest rate risk, see "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in Item 7A. 50 Table of Contents The table below sets forth information with respect to our debt, excluding premiums and discounts (dollars in thousands): As of December 31, 2009 2008 Balance: Fixed rate $ 4,695,082 $ 5,059,910 Variable rate 972,427 892,431 Total $ 5,667,509 $ 5,952,341 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate 83 % 85 % Variable rate 17 15 Total 100 % 100 % Weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 6.32 % 6.34 % Variable rate 2.47 % 2.57 % Total weighted average rate 5.65 % 5.77 % Income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2009, income taxes decreased $2.3 million to $1.9 million. This decrease is primarily due to lower interest earned, due to a decline in LIBOR, for a portion of one of our mezzanine loans, the transfer of a loan investment out of one of our taxable REIT subsidiary ("TRS") and increased depreciation expense, due to a correction of an immaterial error for one of our real estate investments held in a TRS. Discontinued operations. Income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $39.8 million, compared to $239.8 million for the comparable period in 2008. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in gains on real estate dispositions of $191.9 million and a decline in operating income from discontinued operations of $17.1 million, partially offset by a reduction of impairment charges in discontinued operations of $9.1 million. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we sold 14 properties for $72 million, as compared to 51 properties for $643 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Noncontrolling interests and participating securities share in earnings. For the year ended December 31, 2009, noncontrolling interests and participating securities share in earnings decreased $8.5 million, to $16.0 million. This decrease was primarily due to (i) a $4 million decrease related to the conversions of 3.3 million DownREIT units that converted into shares of our common stock during 2008 and 2009, and (ii) a $4 million decrease related to purchases of other noncontrolling interests during 2008 and 2009. Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2008 to the Year Ended December 31, 2007 We completed our acquisition of SEUSA on August 1, 2007 and an investment in mezzanine loans with an aggregate face value of $1.0 billion on December 21, 2007. SEUSAs results of operations and the results of these mezzanine loans are reflected in our consolidated financial statements from those respective dates. 51 Table of Contents Rental and related revenues.

Senior housing. Senior housing rental and related revenues decreased by $2.9 million to $288.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily as a result of income of $9.1 million recognized in 2007, resulting from our change in estimate relating to the collectibility of straight lined rents due from Emeritus, which was partially offset by the additive effect of our acquisitions during 2008 and 2007. No significant changes in estimates related to the collectibility of straight lined rents were made during the year ended December 31, 2008. Life science. Life science rental and related revenues increased by $128.8 million, to $208.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily as a result of our acquisition of SEUSA on August 1, 2007. In addition, included in life science rental and related revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008, is lease termination income of $18 million received from a tenant in connection with the early termination of three leases on July 30, 2008 and rental revenues related to three development projects that were placed into service in 2008. Medical office. Medical office rental and related revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes $18 million from assets that are no longer consolidated and are now in the HCP Ventures IV, LLC joint venture ("HCP Ventures IV"). The decrease in medical office rental and related revenues resulting from HCP Ventures IV was partially offset by the additive effect of our MOB acquisitions during 2007. Tenant recoveries. Year Ended December 31, Change Segments 2008 2007 $ % (dollars in thousands) Life science $ 33,932 $ 19,311 $ 14,621 76 % Medical office 46,960 44,529 2,431 5 Hospital 1,919 1,092 827 76 Total $ 82,811 $ 64,932 $ 17,879 28 % The increase in tenant recoveries for the year ended December 31, 2008 was primarily as a result of our acquisition of SEUSA on August 1, 2007, three development projects that were placed into service in 2008, and the additive effect of our other acquisitions during 2007, partially offset by tenant recoveries related to the assets contributed to HCP Ventures IV. Income from direct financing leases. Income from DFLs decreased $5.7 million to $58.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease was primarily due to two DFL tenants exercising 52 Table of Contents their purchase options on our leased assets during 2007 and two additional DFLs that were placed on non accrual status and accounted for on a cost recovery basis beginning October 2008. No purchase options were exercised during 2008. We expect that income from DFLs will decline in 2009 as a result of the two DFLs that are accounted for on a cost recovery basis. Interest income. Interest income increased $79.3 million to $130.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily related to our HCR ManorCare mezzanine loan investment made in December 2007. For a more detailed description of our mezzanine loan investments, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. Our exposure to income fluctuations related to our variable rate loans is partially mitigated by our variable rate indebtedness. For a more detailed discussion of our interest rate risk, see "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in Item 7A. Investment management fee income. Investment management fee income decreased $7.7 million to $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in investment management fee income was primarily due to the acquisition fees earned related to our HCP Ventures II joint venture of $5.4 million on January 5, 2007 and HCP Ventures IV of $3.0 million on April 30, 2007. No acquisition fees were earned for the year ended December 31, 2008. Depreciation and amortization expenses. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $55.1 million to $313.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily related to our SEUSA acquisition and three development projects that were placed into service in 2008. The increase in depreciation and amortization related to SEUSA was partially offset by the 2007 expenses related to the assets contributed to HCP Ventures IV. Operating expenses. Year Ended December 31, Change Segments 2008 2007 $ % (dollars in thousands) Senior housing $ 11,373 $ 13,690 $ (2,317 ) (17 )% Life science 43,565 26,220 17,345 66 Medical office 134,919 133,787 1,132 1 Hospital 3,264 2,007 1,257 63 Total $ 193,121 $ 175,704 $ 17,417 10 % Operating expenses are predominantly related to MOB and life science properties where we incur the expenses and recover a portion of those expenses under the respective leases. Accordingly, the number of properties in our MOB and life science portfolios directly impact operating expenses. The presentation of expenses as general and administrative or operating is based on the underlying nature of the expense. Periodically, we review the classification of expenses between categories and make revisions based on changes in the underlying nature of the expense. Senior housing. Senior housing operating expenses decreased by $2.3 million to $11.4 million, for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily as a result of a senior housing property that was previously under a management agreement and re leased on a triple net basis during 2008. Life science. Life science operating expenses increased by $17.3 million to $43.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily as a result of our acquisition of SEUSA on August 1, 2007 and three development projects that were placed into service in 2008. 53 Table of Contents Hospital. Hospital operating expenses increased $1.3 million to $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily as a result the additive effect of our hospital acquisitions during 2007. General and administrative expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2008, general and administrative expenses increased $6.2 million to $73.7 million. The increase in general and administrative expenses was due to an increase in legal fees of $7 million primarily resulting from litigation and an increase of $11 million related to compensation related expenses and professional fees (the information set forth under the heading "Legal Proceedings" of Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this report, is incorporated herein by reference). These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $10 million in merger and integration related expenses associated with the SEUSA acquisition and our merger with CNL Retirement Properties, Inc. and CNL Retirement Corp., and a $2 million decrease in costs related to acquisitions that were not consummated in 2007. Impairments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recognized impairments of $27.5 million as follows: (i) $12.0 million related to intangible assets associated with the transfer of an 11 property senior housing portfolio, (ii) $3.7 million related to intangible assets associated with the early termination of three leases in the life science segment, (iii) $1.0 million related to intangible assets associated with the early termination of two leases in the hospital segment, (iv) $1.6 million related to two senior housing facilities as a result of a decrease in expected cash flows, and (v) $9.2 million, included in discontinued operations, related to the decrease in expected cash flows and anticipated dispositions of two senior housing properties and one hospital. No assets were determined to be impaired during the year ended December 31, 2007. Gain on sale of real estate interest. On April 30, 2007, we sold an 80% interest in HCP Ventures IV, which resulted in a gain of $10.1 million. No similar transactions occurred during the year ended December 31, 2008. Other income, net. Other income, net increased $1.5 million, to $25.8 million, for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily from $28.6 million related to the settlement of litigation with Tenet, which was predominantly offset by (i) $7.1 million of lower interest earned on cash balances in 2008, (ii) 2007 gains resulting from insurance proceeds of $4.9 million, (iii) an increase in losses from derivatives and hedge ineffectiveness of $6.4 million, (iv) an increase in recognized losses of marketable equity securities and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures of $4.4 million, and (v) a decrease in gains from the sale of marketable debt securities of $3.2 million. Interest expense. Interest expense decreased $6.8 million, to $348.4 million, for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease was primarily due to: (i) a decrease of $17 million related to the average outstanding balance under our bridge loan and a decline in LIBOR, (ii) an increase of $15 million of capitalized interest related to an increase in assets under development in our life science segment, (iii) a decrease of $10 million resulting from the repayment of $300 million senior unsecured floating rate notes in September 2008 and (iv) a charge of $6 million related to the write off of unamortized loan fees associated with our previous revolving line of credit facility that was terminated in 2007. The decrease in interest expense was partially offset by: (i) an increase of $34 million of interest expense from the issuance of $1.1 billion of senior unsecured notes during 2007 and (ii) an increase of $6 million related to the average outstanding balances under our line of credit and term loan. Our exposure to expense fluctuations related to our variable rate indebtedness is mitigated by our variable rate investments. For a more detailed discussion of our interest rate risk, see "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in Item 7A. 54  Table of Contents The table below sets forth information with respect to our debt, excluding premiums and discounts (dollars in thousands): As of December 31, 2008 2007 Balance: Fixed rate $ 5,059,910 $ 4,704,988 Variable rate 892,431 2,822,316 Total $ 5,952,341 $ 7,527,304 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate 85 % 63 % Variable rate 15 37 Total 100 % 100 % Weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 6.34 % 6.18 % Variable rate 2.57 % 5.90 % Total weighted average rate 5.77 % 6.08 % Income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2008, income taxes increased $2.8 million to $4.2 million. This increase is primarily due to an increase in taxable income related to a portion of one of our mezzanine loan investments, which was contributed to a TRS in January 2008. Equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures. For the year ended December 31, 2008, equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures decreased $2.3 million, to $3.3 million. This decrease is primarily due to a change in the expected useful life of certain intangible assets of one of our unconsolidated joint ventures that resulted in higher amounts of amortization expense. Discontinued operations. Income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $239.8 million, compared to $478.3 million for the comparable period in the prior year. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in gains on real estate dispositions. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we sold 51 properties for $643 million, as compared to 97 properties for $922 million in the year ago period. Additionally, the decrease was attributable to a year over year decline in operating income from discontinued operations of $54.2 million and an increase in impairment charges of $9.2 million. Discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 included 57 properties compared to 154 for the year ended December 31, 2007. Also included in discontinued operations during the year ended December 31, 2007 was $6 million of rental income we recognized, as a result of a change in estimate related to the collectibility of straight line rental income from Emeritus. Noncontrolling interests and participating securities. For the year ended December 31, 2008, noncontrolling interests and participating securities share in earnings decreased $3.4 million to $24.5 million. This decrease is primarily due to the conversion of 2.8 million of DownREIT units into shares of our common stock during 2008, and to a lesser extent, the purchase in September 2008 of Tenets noncontrolling interest in Health Care Property Partners ("HCPP"), a joint venture between HCP and an affiliate of Tenet. See Notes 2, 4 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for additional information on DownREIT units and HCPP. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal liquidity needs are to (i) fund normal operating expenses, (ii) meet debt service requirements, including $206 million of senior unsecured notes and $103 million of mortgage debt 55 Table of Contents principal payments and maturities in 2010, (iii) fund capital expenditures, including tenant improvements and leasing costs, (iv) fund acquisition and development activities, and (v) make dividend distributions. We believe these needs will be satisfied using cash flows generated by operations and from our various financing activities during the next twelve months. Access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital and ability to refinance maturing indebtedness, as well as to fund future acquisitions and development through the issuance of additional securities or secured debt. During 2009, we closed $881 million of equity capital through the issuance of common stock, sold $72 million of real estate and a portion of our HCA bonds for $157 million. As of January 31, 2009, we had a credit rating of Baa3 (stable) from Moodys, BBB (stable) from S&P and BBB (positive) from Fitch on our senior unsecured debt securities, and Ba1 (stable) from Moodys, BB+ (stable) from S&P and BB+ (positive) from Fitch on our preferred equity securities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $516 million and $569 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in operating cash flows from operations is primarily the result of the 2008 litigation settlement income and the decrease in termination fees. The decrease was partially offset by increased revenues, as well as fluctuations in receivables, payables, accruals and deferred revenue. Our cash flows from operations are dependent upon the occupancy level of multi tenant buildings, rental rates on leases, our tenants performance on their lease obligations, the level of operating expenses and other factors. Net cash used by investing activities was $61 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 and consisted of the net effects of funding: (i) $165 million for net investments in loans receivable, (ii) $41 million for lease commissions and tenant and capital improvements, and (iii) $96 million for development of real estate, which were partially offset by $157 million of proceeds from sales of HCA marketable debt securities and $72 million of proceeds from sales of real estate. Net cash used in financing activities was $400 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 and consisted of the net effects of: (i) repayment of our bridge loan credit facility of $320 million, (ii) net repayments under our bank revolving line of credit of $150 million, (iii) payments of common and preferred dividends aggregating $517 million, and (iv) repayment of our mortgage debt of $234 million, which were partially offset by net proceeds of $853 million from the issuances of common stock. Debt Bank line of credit and term loan. Our revolving line of credit with a syndicate of banks provided for an aggregate $1.5 billion of borrowing capacity at December 31, 2009. This revolving line of credit facility accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.325% to 1.00%, depending upon our debt ratings. We pay a facility fee on the entire revolving commitment ranging from 0.10% to 0.25%, depending upon our debt ratings. Based on our debt ratings on December 31, 2009, the margin on the revolving line of credit facility was 0.55% and the facility fee was 0.15%. Our revolving line of credit facility matures on August 1, 2011. At December 31, 2009, we had no outstanding amounts drawn under this revolving line of credit facility. At December 31, 2009, a $103 million letter of credit was issued against our revolving line of credit facility as a result of the Ventas litigation judgment. For further information regarding the Ventas litigation judgment see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. At December 31, 2009, the outstanding balance of our term loan was $200 million with a maturity date of August 1, 2011. The term loan accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.825% to 2.375%, depending upon our debt ratings (weighted average effective interest rate of 2.70% at December 31, 2009). Commencing on October 25, 2010, the margin on this loan will increase by an additional 0.25% through its maturity. Based on our debt ratings on December 31, 2009, the margin on the term loan facility was 2.00%. 56 Table of Contents Our revolving line of credit facility and term loan contain certain financial restrictions and other customary requirements. Among other things, these covenants, using terms defined in the agreement, (i) limit the ratio of Consolidated Total Indebtedness to Consolidated Total Asset Value to 60%, (ii) limit the ratio of Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Unencumbered Asset Value to 65%, (iii) require a Fixed Charge Coverage ratio of 1.75 times, and (iv) require a formula determined Minimum Consolidated Tangible Net Worth of $4.9 billion at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with each of these restrictions and requirements of our revolving line of credit facility and term loan. Our revolving line of credit facility and term loan contain cross default provisions to other indebtedness of ours, including in some instances, certain mortgages on our properties. Certain mortgages contain default provisions relating to defaults under the leases or operating agreements on the applicable properties by our operators or tenants, including default provisions relating to the bankruptcy filings of such operator or tenant. Although we believe that we would be able to secure amendments under the applicable agreements if a default as described above occurs, such default may result in significantly less favorable borrowing terms than currently available, material delays in the availability of funding or other material adverse consequences. Senior unsecured notes. At December 31, 2009, we had $3.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding. Interest rates on the notes ranged from 1.15% to 7.07% with a weighted average effective rate of 6.12% at December 31, 2009. Discounts and premiums are amortized to interest expense over the term of the related notes. The senior unsecured notes contain certain covenants including limitations on debt, cross acceleration provisions and other customary terms. At December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with these covenants. Mortgage and other secured debt. At December 31, 2009, we had $1.8 billion in mortgage debt secured by 165 healthcare facilities with a carrying amount of $2.3 billion. Interest rates on the mortgage debt ranged from 0.31% to 8.63% with a weighted average effective interest rate of 5.08% at December 31, 2009. Mortgage debt generally requires monthly principal and interest payments, is collateralized by certain properties and is generally non recourse. Mortgage debt typically restricts transfer of the encumbered properties, prohibits additional liens, restricts prepayment, requires payment of real estate taxes, requires maintenance of the properties in good condition, requires maintenance of insurance on the properties and includes conditions to obtain lender consent to enter into and terminate material leases. Some of the mortgage debt is also cross collateralized by multiple properties and may require tenants or operators to maintain compliance with the applicable leases or operating agreements of such properties. Other debt. At December 31, 2009, we had $99.9 million of non interest bearing life care bonds at two of our CCRCs and non interest bearing occupancy fee deposits at another of our senior housing facility, all of which were payable to certain residents of the facilities (collectively "Life Care Bonds"). At December 31, 2009, $43.3 million of the Life Care Bonds were refundable to the residents upon the resident moving out or to their estate upon death, and $56.6 million of the Life Care Bonds were refundable after the unit is successfully remarketed to a new resident. 57 Table of Contents Debt Maturities The following table summarizes our stated debt maturities and scheduled principal repayments, excluding debt premiums and discounts, at December 31, 2009 (in thousands): Year Term Loan Senior Unsecured Notes Mortgage and Other Secured Debt Total(1) 2010 $ $ 206,421 $ 102,958 $ 309,379 2011 200,000 292,265 146,987 639,252 2012 250,000 63,776 313,776 2013 550,000 675,104 1,225,104 2014 87,000 177,435 264,435 Thereafter 2,150,000 665,680 2,815,680 $ 200,000 $ 3,535,686 $ 1,831,940 $ 5,567,626 (1)Excludes $99.9 million of other debt that represents non interest bearing Life Care Bonds and occupancy fee deposits at three of our senior housing facilities, which have no scheduled maturities. Derivative Financial Instruments. We use derivative instruments to mitigate the effects of interest rate fluctuations on specific forecasted transactions as well as recognized obligations or assets. We do not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes. The following table summarizes our outstanding interest rate swap contracts as of December 31, 2009 (dollars in thousands): Date Entered Maturity Date Hedge Designation Fixed Rate Floating Rate Index Notional Amount Fair Value July 2005(1) July 2010 Cash Flow 3.82 % BMA Swap Index $ 45,600 $ (3,311 ) June 2009 September 2011 Fair Value 5.95 % 1 Month LIBOR+4.21% 250,000 2,231 July 2009 July 2013 Cash Flow 6.13 % 1 Month LIBOR+3.65% 14,600 (127 ) August 2009 February 2011 Cash Flow 0.87 % 1 Month LIBOR 250,000 538 August 2009 August 2011 Cash Flow 1.24 % 1 Month LIBOR 250,000 754 (1)Represents three interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $45.6 million. For a more detailed description of our derivative financial instruments, see "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in Item 7A. Equity At December 31, 2009, we had 4.0 million shares of 7.25% Series E cumulative redeemable preferred stock, 7.8 million shares of 7.10% Series F cumulative redeemable preferred stock and 293.5 million shares of common stock outstanding. At December 31, 2009, equity totaled $6.0 billion and our equity securities had a market value of $9.4 billion. As of December 31, 2009, there were a total of 4.3 million DownREIT units outstanding in six limited liability companies in which we are the managing member: (i) HCPI/Tennessee, LLC; (ii) HCPI/Utah, LLC; (iii) HCPI/Utah II, LLC; (iv) HCP DR California, LLC; (v) HCP DR Alabama, LLC; and (vi) HCP DR MCD, LLC. The DownREIT units are redeemable for an amount of cash approximating the then existing market value of shares of our common stock or, at our option, shares of our common stock (subject to certain adjustments, such as stock splits and reclassifications). 58 Table of Contents Shelf Registration We have a prospectus on file with the SEC as part of a registration statement on Form S 3, using a shelf registration process which expires in September 2012. Under this "shelf" process, we may sell from time to time any combination of the securities in one or more offerings. The securities described in the prospectus include common stock, preferred stock and debt securities. Each time we sell securities under the shelf registration, we will provide a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information about the terms of the securities being offered and of the offering. We may offer and sell the securities pursuant to this prospectus from time to time in one or more of the following ways: through underwriters or dealers, through agents, directly to purchasers or through a combination of any of these methods of sales. Proceeds from the sale of these securities may be used for general corporate purposes, which may include repayment of indebtedness, working capital and potential acquisitions. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We own interests in certain unconsolidated joint ventures, including HCP Ventures II, HCP Ventures III and HCP Ventures IV, as described under Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. Except in limited circumstances, our risk of loss is limited to our investment in the joint venture and any outstanding loans receivable. In addition, we have certain properties which serve as collateral for debt that is owed by a previous owner of certain of our facilities, as described under Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. Our risk of loss for these properties is limited to the outstanding debt balance plus penalties, if any. We have no other material off balance sheet arrangements that we expect would materially affect our liquidity and capital resources except those described below under "Contractual Obligations." Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our material contractual payment obligations and commitments at December 31, 2009 (in thousands): Total(1) Less than One Year 2011 2012 2013 2014 More than Five Years Senior unsecured notes $ 3,535,686 $ 206,421 $ 542,265 $ 637,000 $ 2,150,000 Mortgage and other secured debt 1,831,940 102,958 210,763 852,539 665,680 Term loan 200,000 200,000 Development commitments(2) 8,269 8,269 Ground and other operating leases 200,397 4,857 10,261 9,911 175,368 Interest 1,570,773 300,751 530,920 406,569 332,533 Total $ 7,347,065 $ 623,256 $ 1,494,209 $ 1,906,019 $ 3,323,581 (1)Excludes $99.9 million of other debt that represents non interest bearing Life Care Bonds and occupancy fee deposits at three of our senior housing facilities, which have no scheduled maturities. (2)Represents construction and other commitments for developments in progress. Inflation Our leases often provide for either fixed increases in base rents or indexed escalators, based on the Consumer Price Index or other measures, and or additional rent based on increases in the tenants operating revenues. Substantially all of our MOB leases require the tenant to pay a share of property operating costs such as real estate taxes, insurance and utilities. Substantially all of our senior housing, life science, skilled nursing and hospital leases require the operator or tenant to pay all of the property operating costs or reimburse us for all such costs. We believe that inflationary increases in expenses will 59 Table of Contents be offset, in part, by the operator or tenant expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases described above.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk. At December 31, 2009, we were exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on approximately $1.7 billion of variable rate HCR ManorCare loan investments and $83 million of other investments where the payments fluctuate with changes in LIBOR. Our exposure to income fluctuations related to our variable rate investments is partially offset by (i) $200 million of variable rate term loan financing, (ii) $498 million of variable rate mortgage notes and other secured debt payable, excluding $60 million of variable rate mortgage notes which have been hedged through interest rate swap contracts, (iii) $25 million of variable rate senior unsecured notes, and (iv) $750 million of additional variable interest rate exposure achieved through interest rate swap contracts (pay float and receive fixed). Interest rate fluctuations will generally not affect our future earnings or cash flows on our fixed rate debt, loans receivable and debt securities unless such instruments mature or are otherwise terminated. However, interest rate changes will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments. Conversely, changes in interest rates on variable rate debt and investments would change our future earnings and cash flows, but not significantly affect the fair value of those instruments. Assuming a one percentage point increase in the interest rate related to the variable rate investments and variable rate debt, and assuming no change in the outstanding balance as of December 31, 2009, net interest income would improve by approximately $3.1 million, or $0.01 per common share on a diluted basis. Assuming a 50 basis point decrease in interest rates under the above circumstances and taking into consideration that the index underlying many of our arrangements is currently below 50 basis points and is not expected to go below zero, net interest income would decline by $1.6 million, or less than $0.01 per common share on a diluted basis. We use derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage or hedge interest rate risk. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at their estimated fair value. See Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for further information. To illustrate the effect of movements in the interest rate markets, we performed a market sensitivity analysis on our hedging instruments. We applied various basis point spreads, to the underlying interest rate curves of the derivative portfolio in order to determine the instruments change in estimated fair value. Assuming a one percentage point change in the underlying interest rate curve, the estimated change in fair value of each of the underlying derivative instruments would not exceed $4.3 million. Market Risk. We are directly and indirectly affected by changes in the equity and bond markets. We have investments in marketable debt and equity securities classified as available for sale. Gains and losses on these securities are recognized in income when realized and losses are recognized when an other than temporary decline in value is identified. The initial indicator of an other than temporary decline in value for marketable equity securities is a sustained decline in market price below the carrying value for an extended period of time. We consider a variety of factors in evaluating an other than temporary decline in value, such as: the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost; the issuers financial condition, capital strength and near term prospects; any recent events specific to that issuer and economic conditions of its industry; and our 60 Table of Contents investment horizon in relationship to an anticipated near term recovery in the stock or bond price, if any. At December 31, 2009, the fair value and cost, or the adjusted cost basis for those securities where a recognized loss was recorded, of marketable equity securities was $3.5 million and $3.7 million, respectively, and the fair value and cost basis of marketable debt securities was $172.8 million and $160.8 million, respectively. The principal amount and the average interest rates for our loans receivable and debt categorized by maturity dates is presented in the table below. The fair value for our debt securities and senior unsecured notes payable are based on prevailing market prices. The fair value estimates for loans receivable and mortgage debt payable are based on discounting future cash flows utilizing current rates offered to us for loans and debt of the same type and remaining maturity.
