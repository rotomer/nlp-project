ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Cautionary Language Regarding Forward Looking Statements Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K that are not historical factual statements are "forward looking statements." We intend to have our forward looking statements covered by the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and include this statement for purposes of complying with those provisions. Forward looking statements include, among other things, statements regarding our and our officers intent, belief or expectations as identified by the use of words such as "may," "will," "project," "expect," "believe," "intend," "anticipate," "seek," "forecast," "plan," "estimate," "could," "would," "should" and other comparable and derivative terms or the negatives thereof. In addition, we, through our officers, from time to time, make forward looking oral and written public statements concerning our expected future operations, strategies, securities offerings, growth and investment opportunities, dispositions, capital structure changes, budgets and other developments. Readers are cautioned that, while forward looking statements reflect our good faith belief and reasonable assumptions based upon current information, we can give no assurance that our expectations or forecasts will be attained. Therefore, readers should be mindful that forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that they are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict.

Except as required by law, we undertake no, and hereby disclaim any, obligation to update any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, changed circumstances or otherwise. The information set forth in this Item 7 is intended to provide readers with an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations. We will discuss and provide our analysis in the following order: Executive Summary 2010 Transaction Overview Dividends Critical Accounting Policies Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Non GAAP Financial Measure Funds from Operations Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Contractual Obligations Inflation Recent Accounting Pronouncements Executive Summary We are a self administered REIT that, together with our unconsolidated joint ventures, invests primarily in real estate serving the healthcare industry in the U.S. We acquire, develop, lease, manage and dispose of healthcare real estate and provide financing to healthcare providers. At December 31, 2010, our portfolio of investments, including properties owned by our Investment Management Platform, consisted of interests in 672 facilities and $2.0 billion of mezzanine and other secured loan investments. Our business strategy is based on three principles: (i) opportunistic investing, (ii) portfolio diversification, and (iii) conservative financing. We actively redeploy capital from investments with lower return potential into assets with higher return potential. We make investments where the expected risk adjusted return exceeds our cost of capital and strive to capitalize on our operator, tenant and other business relationships. Our strategy contemplates acquiring and developing properties on terms that are favorable to us. Generally, we prefer larger, more complex private transactions that leverage our management teams experience and our infrastructure. 37 Table of Contents We follow a disciplined approach to enhancing the value of our existing portfolio, including ongoing evaluation of potential disposition of properties that no longer fit our strategy. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we sold real estate and debt investments for $230 million, resulting in gains of $33 million. We primarily generate revenue by leasing healthcare properties under long term leases. Most of our rents and other earned income from leases are received under triple net leases or leases that provide for substantial recovery of operating expenses; however, some of our medical office and life science leases are structured as gross or modified gross leases. Accordingly, for such MOBs and life science facilities we incur certain property operating expenses, such as real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance, property management fees, utilities and insurance. Our growth for these assets depends, in part, on our ability to (i) increase rental income and other earned income from leases by increasing rental rates and occupancy levels; (ii) maximize tenant recoveries given underlying lease structures; and (iii) control operating and other expenses. Our operations are impacted by property specific, market specific, general economic and other conditions. Access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital and ability to refinance maturing indebtedness, as well as to fund future acquisitions and development through the issuance of additional securities or secured debt. Access to external capital on favorable terms is critical to the success of our strategy. 2010 Transaction Overview HCR ManorCare Facilities Acquisition On December 13, 2010, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire substantially all of the real estate assets of HCR ManorCare for total consideration of $6.1 billion that includes: (i) $3.53 billion in cash; (ii) $1.72 billion (par value) reinvestment of our existing debt investments in HCR ManorCare; and (iii) subject to certain adjustments, 25.7 million shares of our common stock to be issued directly to the shareholders of HCR ManorCare, or, at our option, a cash equivalent of $852 million. We will acquire 334 HCR ManorCare post acute, skilled nursing and assisted living facilities. The facilities are located in 30 states, with the highest concentrations in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, Illinois and Michigan. A wholly owned subsidiary of HCR ManorCare will continue to operate the assets pursuant to a long term triple net master lease supported by a guaranty from HCR ManorCare. HCP Ventures II Purchase On January 14, 2011, we acquired our partners 65% interest in a joint venture that owns 25 senior housing assets, becoming the sole owner of the portfolio. At closing, we paid approximately $137 million in cash for the interest and assumed our partners share of approximately $650 million of Fannie Mae debt secured by the assets. This transaction valued the ventures real estate assets at $860 million. The assets were originally acquired on October 5, 2006, through our acquisition of CNL Retirement Properties, Inc., and were contributed to the joint venture in January 2007. Acquired Debt Investments in Genesis Healthcare In September and October 2010, we acquired debt investments in Genesis for $290 million, representing a $38 million discount from their aggregate par value of $328 million. The investments represent a portion of the $1.671 billion of debt incurred with the $2.0 billion acquisition of Genesis in July 2007. The $328 million investment consists of two participation interests in the senior term loan with an aggregate par value of $277.6 million that were purchased for $249.9 million and a $50 million participation interest in the secured mezzanine debt that was purchased for $40 million. 38 Table of Contents The senior loan bears interest on the par value at LIBOR (subject to a current floor of 1.5% increasing to 2.5% by maturity) plus a spread of 4.75% increasing to 5.75% by maturity. The senior loan is prepayable anytime without penalty, matures in September 2014 and is secured by all of Genesis assets. The mezzanine note bears interest on the par value at LIBOR plus a spread of 7.50% and matures in September 2014. In addition to the coupon interest payments, the mezzanine note requires payment of a termination fee, of which our share is currently $2 million, increasing to a maximum of $5 million if the debt is repaid in full at maturity. The mezzanine note is subordinate to the senior loan and secured by the indirect pledge of equity ownership in Genesis assets. Transition of 27 Sunrise managed Communities On November 1, 2010, we exercised our rights to terminate management contracts relating to 27 senior housing communities previously operated by Sunrise. We had acquired these termination rights as a part of our previously announced August 2010 settlement with Sunrise. These senior housing communities are now master leased to and operated by Emeritus. Our net investment to acquire the termination rights to transition these 27 communities to Emeritus was $41 million, which was comprised of a $50 million payment to Sunrise that was partially offset for certain working capital acquired in conjunction with this transaction. Other Investment Transactions During the year ended December 31, 2010, we made additional investments of $431 million as follows: (i) acquisition of real estate of $255 million; (ii) funding construction and other capital projects of $135 million primarily in our life science segment and (iii) buyout of management contracts for 27 Sunrise managed communities for $41 million (discussed above). Additional details regarding certain of the above investments are as follows: On July 26, 2010, we acquired a life science facility and two medical office buildings for approximately $48 million, including DownREIT units valued at $9 million and assumed debt of $5 million. The life science facility represents 85,000 rentable square feet and is occupied by a single tenant under a 15 year triple net lease. The medical office buildings aggregate 103,000 rentable square feet and were 95% occupied at closing. On June 1, 2010, we acquired four senior housing facilities for $102 million. These facilities are leased to Emeritus under a master lease agreement that has an initial term of 10 years and two 10 year renewal options. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we sold investments of $230 million as follows: (i) $174 million of debt investments, recognizing gains of $13 million and (ii) sales of real estate and other debt investments for $76 million, recognizing gain on sales of real estate of $21 million. Financings During the year ended December 31, 2010, we raised $2.5 billion in equity capital, as discussed below: On December 20, 2010, we completed a $1.472 billion public offering of 46 million shares of common stock at a price of $32.00 per share and received total net proceeds of $1.413 billion. On November 8, 2010, we completed a $486 million public offering of 13.8 million shares of common stock at a price of $35.25 per share and received total net proceeds of $467 million. In June 2010, we initiated a public offering, which resulted in the sale of 15.5 million shares of common stock at a price of $33.00 per share for gross proceeds of $512 million. This offering included: (i) the June 2010 public offering of 13.5 million shares for $445.5 million; and (ii) the 39 Table of Contents July 2010 sale of 2.025 million shares, for $66.8 million, as a result of the underwriters exercising the over allotment option from the June 2010 public offering. We received total net proceeds of $492 million from these sales. On January 24, 2011, we issued $2.4 billion of senior unsecured notes as follows: (i) $400 million of 2.70% notes due 2014; (ii) $500 million of 3.75% notes due 2016; (iii) $1.2 billion of 5.375% notes due 2021; and (iv) $300 million of 6.75% notes due 2041. The notes have a weighted average maturity of 10.3 years and a weighted average yield of 4.83%. The net proceeds of the offering were $2.37 billion. Dividends Quarterly dividends paid during 2010 aggregated $1.86 per share. On January 27, 2011, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly common stock cash dividend of $0.48 per share. The common stock dividend will be paid on February 23, 2011 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 10, 2011. Based on the first quarters dividend, the annualized rate of distribution for 2011 is $1.92, compared with $1.86, which represents a 3.2% increase. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") requires our management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base estimates on our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different, it is possible that different accounting would have been applied, resulting in a different presentation of our consolidated financial statements. From time to time, we re evaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. For a more detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of HCP, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures that we control, through voting rights or other means. We consolidate investments in variable interest entities ("VIEs") when we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE at: (i) the inception of the variable interest entity, (ii) as a result of a change in circumstance identified during our continuous review of our VIE relationships or (iii) upon the occurrence of a qualifying reconsideration event. We make judgments with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity and whether we are (or are not) the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Consideration of various factors includes, but is not limited to, our ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance, our form of ownership interest, our representation on the entitys governing body, the size and seniority of our investment, our ability and the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions, replace the manager and or liquidate the entity, if applicable. Our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity at inception of our involvement or on a continuous basis when determining the primary beneficiary of a VIE affects the presentation of these entities in our 40 Table of Contents consolidated financial statements. If we perform a primary beneficiary analysis at a date other than at inception of the variable interest entity, our assumptions may be different and may result in the identification of a different primary beneficiary. If we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE, our consolidated financial statements would include the operating results of the VIE (either tenant or borrower) rather than the results of the variable interest in the VIE. We would depend on the VIE to provide us timely financial information and rely on the internal control of the VIE to provide accurate financial information. If the VIE has deficiencies in its internal control over financial reporting, or does not provide us with timely financial information, this may adversely impact our financial reporting and our internal control over financial reporting. Revenue Recognition We recognize rental revenue on a straight line basis over the lease term when collectibility is reasonably assured and the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of the leased asset. For assets acquired subject to leases, we recognize revenue upon acquisition of the asset provided the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of the leased asset. If the lease provides for tenant improvements, we determine whether the tenant improvements, for accounting purposes, are owned by the tenant or us. When we are the owner of the tenant improvements, the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the physical use of the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially completed. When the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements, any tenant improvement allowance funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term. The determination of ownership of the tenant improvements is subject to significant judgment. If our assessment of the owner of the tenant improvements for accounting purposes were to change, the timing and amount of our revenue recognized would be impacted. Certain leases provide for additional rents contingent upon a percentage of the facilitys revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds. Such revenue is recognized when actual results reported by the tenant, or estimates of tenant results, exceed the base amount or other thresholds. The recognition of additional rents requires us to make estimates of amounts owed and to a certain extent are dependent on the accuracy of the facility results reported to us. Our estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts, including an allowance for straight line rent receivables, for estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults or the inability of tenants to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments. We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants and operators on an ongoing basis. This evaluation considers industry and economic conditions, property performance, credit enhancements and other factors. For straight line rent amounts, our assessment is based on income recoverable over the term of the lease. We exercise judgment in establishing allowances and consider payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates. These estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Loans receivable are classified as held for investment based on managements intent and ability to hold the loans for the foreseeable future or to maturity. We recognize interest income on loans, including the amortization of discounts and premiums, using the effective interest method applied on a loan by loan basis when collectibility of the future payments is reasonably assured. Premiums, discounts and related costs are recognized as yield adjustments over the life of the related loans. We use the direct finance method of accounting to record income from DFLs. For leases accounted for as DFLs, future minimum lease payments are recorded as a receivable. The difference between the future minimum lease payments and the estimated residual values less the cost of the 41 Table of Contents properties is recorded as unearned income. Unearned income is deferred and amortized to income over the lease terms to provide a constant yield when collectibility of the lease payments is reasonably assured. Investments in DFLs are presented net of unamortized unearned income. Loans and DFLs are placed on non accrual status at such time as management determines that collectibility of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured. While on non accrual status, loans or DFLs are either accounted for on a cash basis, in which income is recognized only upon receipt of cash, or on a cost recovery basis, in which all cash receipts reduce the carrying value of the loan or DFL, based on managements judgment of collectibility. Allowances are established for loans and DFLs based upon a probable loss estimate for individual loans and DFLs deemed to be impaired. Loans and DFLs are impaired when it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due on a timely basis in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan or lease. Determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires significant judgment by us about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The allowance is based upon our assessment of the borrowers or lessees overall financial condition, resources and payment record; the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors; and, if appropriate, the realizable value of any collateral. These estimates consider all available evidence including, as appropriate, the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loans or DFLs effective interest rate, the fair value of collateral, general economic conditions and trends, historical and industry loss experience, and other relevant factors. While our assumptions are based in part upon historical data, our estimates may differ from actual results, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Real Estate We make estimates as part of our allocation of the purchase price of acquisitions to the various components of the acquisition based upon the relative fair value of each component. The most significant components of our allocations are typically the allocation of fair value to the buildings as if vacant, land and in place leases. In the case of the fair value of buildings and the allocation of value to land and other intangibles, our estimates of the values of these components will affect the amount of depreciation and amortization we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or the remaining lease term. In the case of the value of in place leases, we make our best estimates based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenants lease. Factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods, market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. Our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue that we will recognize over the remaining lease term for the acquired in place leases. A variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition, development and leasing of properties. After determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. Determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment. The costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes and other costs incurred during the period of development. We consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy and cease capitalization of costs upon the completion of the related tenant improvements. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Goodwill We assess the carrying value of our real estate assets and related intangibles ("real estate assets"), whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparison of the 42 Table of Contents carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. In order to review our real estate assets for recoverability, we consider market conditions, as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques; including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third party appraisals, where considered necessary. If our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the real estate asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the real estate asset. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually by applying the two step approach. If the fair value of a reporting unit containing goodwill is less than its carrying value, then a second step of the test is needed to measure the amount of potential goodwill impairment. The second step requires the fair value of a reporting unit to be allocated to all the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of assets and liabilities is the implied value of goodwill and is used to determine the amount of impairment. We estimate the current fair value of the assets and liabilities in the reporting unit through various valuation techniques; including applying capitalization rates to estimated segment net operating income, quoted market values and third party appraisals, as necessary. The fair value of the reporting unit may also include an allocation of an enterprise value premium that we estimate a third party would be willing to pay for the company. The determination of the fair value of real estate assets and goodwill involves significant judgment. This judgment is based on our analysis and estimates of fair value of real estate assets and reporting units, and the future operating results and resulting cash flows of each real estate asset whose carrying amount may not be recoverable. Our ability to accurately predict future operating results and cash flows and estimate and allocate fair values impacts the timing and recognition of impairments. While we believe our assumptions are reasonable, changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results. Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures Investments in entities which we do not consolidate but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are reported under the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, our share of the investees earnings or losses are included in our consolidated results of operations. The initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is based on the amount paid to purchase the joint venture interest or the carrying value of the assets prior to the sale of interests in the joint venture. We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment based upon a comparison of the fair value of the equity method investment to our carrying value. When we determine a decline in the fair value of our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is below its carrying value is other than temporary, an impairment is recorded. The determination of the fair value of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures involves significant judgment. Our estimates consider all available evidence including, as appropriate, the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at market rates, general economic conditions and trends, and other relevant factors. Capitalization rates, discount rates and credit spreads utilized in our valuation models are based upon rates that we believe to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for the respective investments. While we believe our assumptions are reasonable, changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results. Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, significant management judgment is required to evaluate our compliance with REIT requirements. Our determinations are 43 Table of Contents based on interpretation of tax laws, and our conclusions may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized. Adjustments to income tax expense may be required as a result of: (i) audits conducted by federal and state tax authorities, (ii) our ability to qualify as a REIT, (iii) the potential for built in gain recognized related to prior tax free acquisitions of C corporations, and (iv) changes in tax laws. Adjustments required in any given period are included in income, other than adjustments to income tax liabilities acquired in business combinations, which are adjusted through goodwill. Results of Operations We evaluate our business and allocate resources among our five business segments: (i) senior housing, (ii) life science, (iii) medical office, (iv) post acute/skilled nursing and (v) hospital. Under the senior housing, life science, post acute/skilled nursing and hospital segments, we invest primarily in single operator or tenant properties, through the acquisition and development of real estate, and by debt issued by operators in these sectors. Under the medical office segment, we invest through the acquisition of MOBs that are primarily leased under gross or modified gross leases, generally to multiple tenants, and which generally require a greater level of property management. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Subject to closing the HCR ManorCare Acquisition (anticipated in March 2011), we expect to account for the leases of the 334 HCR ManorCare post acute, skilled nursing and assisted living facilities as DFLs. As a result, we expect significant increases in our income from DFLs. Further, a portion of the consideration for the HCR ManorCare Acquisition will be provided by the reinvestment of our existing $1.72 billion (par value) debt investments in HCR ManorCare, which will result in a significant reduction of interest income in 2011. On January 14, 2011, we acquired our partners 65% interest in HCP Ventures II, becoming the sole owner of the portfolio. During 2011, we expect increases in rental and related revenues and decreases in investment management fee income as a result of acquiring our partners interest in HCP Ventures II. On January 24, 2011, we issued $2.4 billion of senior unsecured notes with a combined weighted average yield of 4.83%. As a result of the issuance of these senior unsecured notes, we expect a significant increase in interest expense for 2011. Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2010 to the Year Ended December 31, 2009 Rental and related revenues. Year Ended December 31, Change Segments 2010 2009 $ % (dollars in thousands) Senior housing $ 333,508 $ 288,163 $ 45,345 16 % Life science 237,160 214,134 23,026 11 Medical office 262,854 260,238 2,616 1 Post acute/skilled nursing 37,242 36,585 657 2 Hospital 81,091 79,372 1,719 2 Total $ 951,855 $ 878,492 $ 73,363 8 % Senior housing. The increase in senior housing rental and related revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily related to: (i) a $29.4 million increase as a result of including facility level revenues for 27 properties as a result of the consolidation of four VIEs from August 31, 2010 to November 1, 2010 (see Notes 12 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial 44 Table of Contents Statements for additional information regarding these VIEs); (ii) a $7.6 million increase as a result of improved rental revenues related to the transition of properties to new operators of 15 communities previously operated by Sunrise effective October 1, 2009; (iii) the additive effect of our acquisitions in 2010 and (iv) increases from rent escalations and resets. The increase in senior housing rental and related revenues above was partially offset by income of $6.4 million in 2009 resulting from a correction to the purchase price allocation of certain assets acquired in 2006. Life science. The increase in life science rental and related revenues was primarily the result of assets that were placed in service in 2010, which were previously under development. Income from direct financing leases. Income from DFLs decreased $2.1 million to $49.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease was primarily due to three DFLs that were deemed to be substantially impaired during 2009 (see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Interest income. For the year ended December 31, 2010, interest income increased $36.0 million to $160.2 million. The increase was primarily related to: (i) $30.4 million of additional interest earned from the purchase of a participation in the first mortgage debt of HCR ManorCare in August 2009, (ii) a $11 million of prepayment penalty upon the early repayment of a mortgage loan that was secured by a hospital, and (iii) $8.0 million of additional income earned from the debt investments of Genesis purchased during 2010. These increases in interest income were partially offset by a $12.7 million decrease of interest earned from marketable debt securities that were sold in 2009 and 2010. For a more detailed description of our mezzanine loan and participation in the first mortgage debt of HCR ManorCare and Genesis, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our exposure to income fluctuations related to our variable rate loans is partially mitigated by our variable rate indebtedness. For a more detailed discussion of our interest rate risk, see "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in Item 7A. Investment management fee income. Investment management fee income decreased $0.6 million to $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Depreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased $4.8 million to $312.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily the result of lower depreciation from assets that were fully depreciated in 2009 and 2010, partially offset by additional amortization expense from leasing costs and tenant and capital improvements expenditures that were incurred in 2009 and 2010, and increases due to our 2010 real estate acquisitions. Interest expense. For the year ended December 31, 2010, interest expense decreased $10.2 million to $288.7 million. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease of: (i) $5.8 million from the net impact of the repayment of mortgage debt related to contractual maturities, partially offset by secured debt financing obtained in connection with our purchase of a participation in the first mortgage debt of HCR ManorCare, (ii) $4.6 million resulting from the repayment of our bridge loan in May 2009 and term loan in March 2010, (iii) $2.9 million resulting from the repayment of $206 million of senior unsecured notes in 2010, and (iv) $1.7 million resulting from the benefit of an interest rate swap (pay float and receive fixed) that was placed on $250 million of our unsecured senior notes in June 2009. The decreases in interest expense were partially offset by a decrease of $4.3 million of capitalized interest related to assets under development in our life science segment that were placed in service during 2010. 45  Table of Contents Our exposure to expense fluctuations related to our variable rate indebtedness is mitigated by our variable rate investments.

Operating expenses are generally related to MOB and life science properties where we incur the expenses and recover all or a portion of those expenses from the tenants. The presentation of expenses as operating or general and administrative is based on the underlying nature of the expense. Periodically, we review the classification of expenses between categories and make revisions based on changes in the underlying nature of the expenses. The increase in operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily the result of including facility level expenses for 27 properties as a result of the consolidation of four VIEs from August 31, 2010 to November 1, 2010 (see Notes 12 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these VIEs). General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased $4.6 million to $83.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased costs related to acquisitions pursued in 2010, partially offset by a decrease in legal fees associated with litigation matters and lower professional fees (see the 46 Table of Contents information set forth under the heading "Legal Proceedings" of Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Litigation provision. On September 4, 2009, a jury returned a verdict in favor of Ventas, Inc., in an action brought against us in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky for tortious interference with prospective business advantage in connection with Ventas 2007 acquisition of Sunrise REIT. The jury awarded Ventas approximately $102 million in compensatory damages, which we recorded as a litigation provision expense during 2009. We are seeking to have the judgment against us reversed. The appeal and cross appeal have now been fully briefed, and oral argument before the Court of Appeals is scheduled for March 10, 2011 (see the information set forth under the heading "Legal Proceedings" of Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Impairments (recoveries). The year ended December 31, 2010 includes $11.9 million related to the March 2010 reversal of portions of an allowance established by previous impairment charges of investments related to Erickson (discussed below). Erickson was the tenant at three of our senior housing continuing care retirement communities DFLs and the borrower of a senior construction loan in which we had a participation interest (see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The year ended December 31, 2009 includes impairments of $75.5 million as a result of (i) an aggregate $63.1 million provision related to DFL and loan losses (impairment charges) related to the bankruptcy of Erickson who was the tenant at three of our senior housing CCRC DFLs and the borrower of a senior construction loan in which we had a $10 million participation (see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), (ii) $5.9 million of intangible assets on 12 of 15 senior housing communities that were written off due to the termination of the Sunrise management agreements on 15 senior housing communities effective October 1, 2009, (iii) $4.3 million related to a senior secured term loan as a result of an expected restructuring of terms to the loan following the default of the borrower in our hospital segment (see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), and (iv) $2.2 million related to intangible assets associated with the early termination of a lease in our life science segment. Other income, net. For the year ended December 31, 2010, other income, net increased $8.1 million to $15.8 million. The increase was primarily a result of: (i) increases in gains on sales of marketable securities of $5.5 million and (ii) a $1.4 million of other than temporary impairments of goodwill recognized in 2009. For a more detailed description of our marketable securities investments, see Note 10 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income taxes. Income taxes decreased $1.5 million to $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease in income taxes is primarily due to the tax benefit resulting from the election of one of our former taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRS") to become a REIT in 2010. Equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures. During the year ended December 31, 2010, equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures increased $1.3 million to $4.8 million. This increase is primarily due to: (i) the recognition of additional rental revenues during 2010 from a life science tenant in one of our unconsolidated joint ventures that was previously deferred and (ii) a change in the expected useful life of certain intangible assets of one of our unconsolidated joint ventures that resulted in lower equity income due to higher amounts of amortization expense during 2009. These increases were partially offset by HCP Ventures IIs conclusion to cease recognizing non cash rental income (i.e., straight line rents) from Horizon Bay effective July 1, 2010, which resulted in lower earnings for, and our share of earnings from, HCP Ventures II during the year ended December 31, 2010. Impairments of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized impairments of $71.7 million related to our 35% interest in HCP Ventures II, an unconsolidated joint venture that owns 25 senior housing properties leased by Horizon Bay as a result 47 Table of Contents of the recent and projected deterioration of the operating performance of the properties leased by Horizon Bay from HCP Ventures II. Discontinued operations. Income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $22.8 million, compared to $45 million for the comparable period in 2009. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in gains on real estate dispositions of $17.4 million and a decline in operating income from discontinued operations of $4.9 million. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we sold 14 properties for $56 million, compared to 14 properties for $72 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2009 to the Year Ended December 31, 2008 Rental and related revenues. Year Ended December 31, Change Segments 2009 2008 $ % (dollars in thousands) Senior housing $ 288,163 $ 285,988 $ 2,175 1 % Life science 214,134 208,415 5,719 3 Medical office 260,238 259,164 1,074 Post acute/skilled nursing 36,585 34,567 2,018 6 Hospital 79,372 79,233 139 Total $ 878,492 $ 867,367 $ 11,125 1 % Senior housing. Senior housing rental and related revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 includes $6.4 million resulting from an adjustment to the purchase price allocation of certain assets acquired in 2006. No similar adjustments were made in the year ended December 31, 2008. As a result of the transfer of an 11 property senior housing portfolio to Emeritus on December 1, 2008, our rental revenues increased by $9.8 million primarily related to new leases with Emeritus. These increases were partially offset by (i) a decrease of $7.4 million related to 2008 additional rents from property level expense credits related to our properties operated by Sunrise and (ii) a $7.3 million decrease in the facility level operating revenues for three senior housing properties that were previously under management agreements and re leased on a triple net basis during 2009. Life science. The increase in life science rental and related revenues was primarily a result of (i) a net increase of $14.9 million from lease up activities that were partially offset by vacancies, and (ii) a $6.7 million net increase from development assets placed in service during 2008 that were partially offset by assets placed in redevelopment. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $14.7 million in lease termination fees. Tenant recoveries.

Life science tenant recoveries increased primarily as a result of an increase in occupancy levels at our life science facilities and the impact of development assets placed in service during 2008. Income from direct financing leases. Income from DFLs decreased $6.7 million to $51.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease was primarily due to three DFLs that during 2009 were deemed to be substantially impaired. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest income. For the year ended December 31, 2009, interest income decreased $6.7 million to $124.1 million. This decrease was primarily related to a decline in LIBOR resulting in a decrease of interest earned on our mezzanine variable rate loans, which was partially offset by additional interest income earned from the purchase of a participation in the first mortgage debt of HCR ManorCare in August 2009. For a more detailed description of our mezzanine loan and participation in the first mortgage debt of HCR ManorCare, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our exposure to income fluctuations related to our variable rate loans is partially mitigated by our variable rate indebtedness. For a more detailed discussion of our interest rate risk, see "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in Item 7A. Depreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $4.7 million to $316.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily relates to a $3.3 million increase due to the purchase in September 2008 of Tenets noncontrolling interest in Health Care Property Partners, a joint venture between HCP and an affiliate of Tenet, and an increase of $2.0 million resulting from an adjustment to the purchase price allocation related to certain assets acquired in 2006 (see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Interest expense. For the year ended December 31, 2009, interest expense decreased $49.5 million to $298.9 million. The decrease was primarily due to (i) a decrease of $45.7 million from the decline in LIBOR and the repayment of the outstanding balance under our bridge loan and revolving line of credit facility, and (ii) a decrease of $8.3 million resulting from the repayment of $300 million of senior unsecured floating rate notes in September 2008. These decreases in interest expense were partially offset by an increase of $5.2 million from the net impact of mortgage debt placed on senior housing assets in 2008 and the repayment of mortgage debt related to contractual maturities. Our exposure to expense fluctuations related to our variable rate indebtedness is mitigated by our variable rate investments. For a more detailed discussion of our interest rate risk, see "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in Item 7A. 49 Table of Contents The table below sets forth information with respect to our debt, excluding premiums and discounts (dollars in thousands): As of December 31, 2009 2008 Balance: Fixed rate $ 4,695,082 $ 5,059,910 Variable rate 972,427 892,431 Total $ 5,667,509 $ 5,952,341 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate 83 % 85 % Variable rate 17 15 Total 100 % 100 % Weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 6.32 % 6.34 % Variable rate 2.47 % 2.57 % Total weighted average rate 5.65 % 5.77 % Operating expenses.

Accordingly, the number of properties in our MOB and life science portfolios directly impact operating expenses. The presentation of expenses as general and administrative or operating is based on the underlying nature of the expense. Periodically, we review the classification of expenses between categories and make revisions that we believe improve the quality of our presentation. Senior housing. Senior housing operating expenses decreased primarily as a result of a decrease in facility level operating expenses for three senior housing properties that were previously under management agreements and re leased on a triple net basis during 2009. Life science. Life science operating expenses increased primarily as a result of an increase in occupancy levels at our life science facilities and the impact of development assets placed in service during 2008. Medical office. Medical office operating expenses decreased primarily as a result of cost saving initiatives implemented in 2009 and the impact of properties which were taken out of service and placed into redevelopment during 2008 and 2009. 50 Table of Contents General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased $4.8 million to $78.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in legal fees associated with litigation matters partially offset by lower compensation related expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, in relation to the Ventas litigation matter, we incurred legal expenses of $13.2 million and $6.9 million, respectively (see the information set forth under the heading "Legal Proceedings" of Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Litigation provision. On September 4, 2009, a jury returned a verdict in favor of Ventas in an action brought against us in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky for tortious interference with prospective business advantage in connection with Ventas 2007 acquisition of Sunrise REIT. The jury awarded Ventas approximately $102 million in compensatory damages, which we recorded as a litigation provision expense during 2009 (see the information set forth under the heading "Legal Proceedings" of Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Impairments (recoveries). During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized impairments of $75.5 million as a result of (i) an aggregate $63.1 million provision related to DFL and loan losses (impairment charges) related to the bankruptcy of Erickson who was the tenant at three of our senior housing CCRC DFLs and the borrower of a senior construction loan in which we had a $10 million participation (see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), and (ii) $5.9 million of intangible assets on 12 of 15 senior housing communities that were written off due to the termination of the Sunrise management agreements on 15 senior housing communities effective October 1, 2009, (iii) $4.3 million related to a senior secured term loan as a result of an expected restructuring of terms to the loan following the default of the borrower in our hospital segment (see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), and (iv) $2.2 million related to intangible assets associated with the early termination of a lease in our life science segment. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recognized impairments of $27.5 million as follows: (i) $12.0 million related to intangible assets associated with the transfer of an 11 property senior housing portfolio, (ii) $3.7 million related to intangible assets associated with the early termination of three leases in the life science segment, (iii) $1.0 million related to intangible assets associated with the early termination of two leases in the hospital segment, (iv) $1.6 million related to two senior housing facilities as a result of a decrease in expected cash flows, and (v) $9.2 million, included in discontinued operations, related to the decrease in expected cash flows and anticipated dispositions of two senior housing properties and one hospital. Other income, net. For the year ended December 31, 2009, other income, net decreased $17.9 million to $7.8 million. This decrease was primarily related to the $28.6 million of income related to the 2008 settlement of litigation with Tenet and a $2.4 million gain on the early repayment of debt. The decrease was partially offset by increases in gains on marketable debt securities of $8.6 million and a reduction of $7.3 million of other than temporary impairments on marketable equity securities. For a more detailed description of our marketable securities investments, see Note 10 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2009, income taxes decreased $2.3 million to $1.9 million. This decrease is primarily due to: (i) lower interest earned, due to a decline in LIBOR, for a portion of one of our mezzanine loans, (ii) the transfer of a loan investment out of one of our TRS and (iii) increased depreciation expense, due to a correction of an immaterial error for one of our real estate investments held in a TRS. Discontinued operations. Income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $45 million, compared to $246.5 million for the comparable period in 2008. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in gains on real estate dispositions of $191.9 million and a decline in 51 Table of Contents operating income from discontinued operations of $18.7 million, partially offset by a reduction of impairment charges in discontinued operations of $9.1 million. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we sold 14 properties for $72 million, as compared to 51 properties for $643 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Noncontrolling interests share in earnings. For the year ended December 31, 2009, noncontrolling interests share in earnings decreased $8.0 million to $14.5 million. This decrease was primarily due to (i) a $4 million decrease related to the conversions of 3.3 million DownREIT units that converted into shares of our common stock during 2008 and 2009, and (ii) a $4 million decrease related to purchases of other noncontrolling interests during 2008 and 2009. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal liquidity needs are to: (i) fund recurring operating expenses, (ii) meet debt service requirements, including $292 million of senior unsecured notes and $58 million of mortgage debt principal payments and maturities in 2011, (iii) fund capital expenditures, including tenant improvements and leasing costs, (iv) fund acquisition and development activities, and (v) make dividend distributions. We believe these needs will be satisfied using cash flows generated by operations and from our various financing activities during the next twelve months. During the year ended December 31, 2010, distributions to shareholders and noncontrolling interest holders exceeded cash flows from operations by approximately $26 million. During 2010, we raised aggregate net proceeds of $2.6 billion from issuances of common stock and sales of marketable securities and real estate, which proceeds, among other things, were the sources of cash used to fund the excess of distributions to shareholders and noncontrolling interest holders above cash flows from operations during the year ended December 31, 2010. We intend to pay the $3.53 billion cash portion of the consideration for the HCR ManorCare Acquisition primarily with the proceeds from our $1.472 billion December 2010 common stock offering and $2.4 billion January 2011 senior unsecured note offering. Access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital and ability to refinance maturing indebtedness, as well as our ability to fund future acquisitions and development through the issuance of additional securities or secured debt. Credit ratings impact our ability to access capital and directly impact our cost of capital as well. For example, as noted below, our revolving line of credit facility accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus a margin that depends upon our debt ratings. We also pay a facility fee on the entire revolving commitment that depends upon our debt ratings. As of January 31, 2011, we had a credit rating of Baa2 (stable) from Moodys, BBB (stable) from S&P and BBB (watch positive) from Fitch on our senior unsecured debt securities, and Baa3 (stable) from Moodys, BB+ (stable) from S&P and BB+ (watch positive) from Fitch on our preferred equity securities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $580 million and $516 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in operating cash flows is primarily the result of the following: (i) the additive impact of our investments in 2009 and 2010, (ii) assets placed in service in 2010 and (iii) rent escalations and resets in 2009 and 2010. Our cash flows from operations are dependent upon the occupancy level of multi tenant buildings, rental rates on leases, our tenants performance on their lease obligations, the level of operating expenses and other factors. Net cash used by investing activities was $431 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 and consisted of the net effects of funding: (i) $305 million for acquisition and development of real estate, (ii) $298 million for investments in loans receivables and DFLs, and (iii) $98 million for leasing costs and tenant and capital improvements. These expenditures were partially offset by our proceeds of $179 million from the sales of marketable debt securities and $32 million from the repayment of loans receivable and DFLs. 52 Table of Contents Net cash provided by financing activities was $775 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 and consisted primarily of net proceeds of $2.4 billion from the issuances of common stock. The amount of cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by or used for the: (i) repayment of our mortgage and other secured debt of $636 million, (ii) payments of common and preferred dividends aggregating $591 million, (iii) repayment of $206 million of senior unsecured notes, and (iv) repayment of our term loan of $200 million. Debt Bank line of credit. Our revolving line of credit facility with a syndicate of banks provides for an aggregate borrowing capacity of $1.5 billion and matures on August 1, 2011. This revolving line of credit facility accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus a margin that depends upon our debt ratings. We pay a facility fee on the entire revolving commitment that depends upon our debt ratings. Based on our debt ratings at December 31, 2010, the margin on the revolving line of credit facility was 0.55% and the facility fee was 0.15%. At December 31, 2010, we had no amounts drawn under this revolving line of credit facility. At December 31, 2010, $113 million of aggregate letters of credit were outstanding against our revolving line of credit facility, including a $103 million letter of credit as a result of the Ventas litigation. For further information regarding the Ventas litigation see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our revolving line of credit facility contains certain financial restrictions and other customary requirements. Among other things, these covenants, using terms defined in the agreement, (i) limit the ratio of Consolidated Total Indebtedness to Consolidated Total Asset Value to 60%, (ii) limit the ratio of Unsecured Debt to Consolidated Unencumbered Asset Value to 65%, (iii) require a Fixed Charge Coverage ratio of 1.75 times and (iv) require a formula determined Minimum Consolidated Tangible Net Worth of $6.9 billion at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with each of these restrictions and requirements of our revolving line of credit facility. Our revolving line of credit facility also contains cross default provisions to other indebtedness of ours, including in some instances, certain mortgages on our properties. Certain mortgages contain default provisions relating to defaults under the leases or operating agreements on the applicable properties by our operators or tenants, including default provisions relating to the bankruptcy filings of such operator or tenant. Although we believe that we would be able to secure amendments under the applicable agreements if a default as described above occurs, such a default may result in significantly less favorable borrowing terms than currently available, material delays in the availability of funding or other material adverse consequences. Senior unsecured notes. At December 31, 2010, we had senior unsecured notes outstanding with an aggregate principal balance of $3.3 billion. Interest rates on the notes ranged from 1.27% to 7.12% with a weighted average effective rate of 6.19% at December 31, 2010. Discounts and premiums are amortized to interest expense over the term of the related notes. The senior unsecured notes contain certain covenants including limitations on debt, cross acceleration provisions and other customary terms. At December 31, 2010, we believe we were in compliance with these covenants. On January 24, 2011, we issued $2.4 billion of senior unsecured notes as follows: (i) $400 million of 2.70% notes due 2014; (ii) $500 million of 3.75% notes due 2016; (iii) $1.2 billion of 5.375% notes due 2021; and (iv) $300 million of 6.75% notes due 2041. The notes have a weighted average maturity of 10.3 years and a weighted average yield of 4.83%. The net proceeds of the offering were $2.37 billion. If the HCR ManorCare Acquisition is not completed by June 13, 2011 (under certain conditions permitted under the purchase agreement this date may be extended to September 13, 2011), we are required to redeem all of these senior unsecured notes at 101% of the principal amount 20 business days subsequent to the earlier of such date or the date that the purchase agreement is terminated. 53  Table of Contents Mortgage and other secured debt. At December 31, 2010, we had $1.2 billion in aggregate principal amount of mortgage debt secured by 138 healthcare facilities, which had a carrying amount of $2.0 billion. Interest rates on the mortgage debt ranged from 1.96% to 8.30% with a weighted average effective interest rate of 6.14% at December 31, 2010. Mortgage debt generally requires monthly principal and interest payments, is collateralized by certain properties and is generally non recourse. Mortgage debt typically restricts transfer of the encumbered properties, prohibits additional liens, restricts prepayment, requires payment of real estate taxes, requires maintenance of the properties in good condition, requires maintenance of insurance on the properties and includes requirements to obtain lender consent to enter into and terminate material leases. Some of the mortgage debt is also cross collateralized by multiple properties and may require tenants or operators to maintain compliance with the applicable leases or operating agreements of such properties. Other debt. At December 31, 2010, we had $92.2 million of non interest bearing life care bonds at two of our CCRCs and non interest bearing occupancy fee deposits at another of our senior housing facility, all of which were payable to certain residents of the facilities (collectively, "Life Care Bonds"). At December 31, 2010, $35.9 million of the Life Care Bonds were refundable to the residents upon the resident moving out or to their estate upon death, and $56.3 million of the Life Care Bonds were refundable after the unit is successfully remarketed to a new resident.

Equity At December 31, 2010, we had 4.0 million shares of 7.25% Series E cumulative redeemable preferred stock, 7.8 million shares of 7.10% Series F cumulative redeemable preferred stock and 370.9 million shares of common stock outstanding. At December 31, 2010, equity totaled $8.1 billion and our equity securities had a market value of $14.2 billion. As of December 31, 2010, there were a total of 4.2 million DownREIT units outstanding in five limited liability companies in which we are the managing member. The DownREIT units are exchangeable for an amount of cash approximating the then current market value of shares of our common stock or, at our option, shares of our common stock (subject to certain adjustments, such as stock splits and reclassifications). Shelf Registration We have a prospectus on file with the SEC as part of a registration statement on Form S 3, using a shelf registration process that expires in September 2012. Under this "shelf" process, we may sell from time to time any combination of the registered securities in one or more offerings. The securities described in the prospectus include common stock, preferred stock and debt securities. Each time we sell securities under the shelf registration, we will provide a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information about the terms of the securities being offered and of the offering. We may offer and sell the securities pursuant to this prospectus from time to time in one or more of the following ways: through underwriters or dealers, through agents, directly to purchasers or through a combination of any of these methods of sales. Proceeds from the sale of these securities may be used for general corporate purposes, which may include repayment of indebtedness, working capital and potential acquisitions. Non GAAP Financial Measure Funds From Operations ("FFO") We believe FFO applicable to common shares, diluted FFO applicable to common shares, FFO, before the impact of impairments, recoveries and litigation provision, and basic and diluted FFO per common share are important supplemental measures of operating performance for a real estate investment trust. Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets utilizes straight line depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a real estate investment trust 55 Table of Contents that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. The term FFO was designed by the real estate investment trust industry to address this issue. FFO is defined as net income applicable to common shares (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, with adjustments for joint ventures. Adjustments for joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income. Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define the term in accordance with the current National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") definition or that have a different interpretation of the current NAREIT definition from us. In addition, we present FFO, before the impact of impairments, recoveries, merger related items and litigation provision ("FFO as adjusted"). Management believes FFO as adjusted is a useful alternative measurement. This measure is a modification of the NAREIT definition of FFO and should not be used as an alternative to net income. Details of certain items that affect comparability are discussed in the financials results summary of our financial results for the year months ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. The following is a reconciliation from net income applicable to common shares, the most direct comparable financial measure calculated and presented with GAAP, to FFO (dollars and shares in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Net income applicable to common shares $ 307,498 $ 109,069 $ 425,368 Depreciation and amortization of real estate, in place lease and other intangibles: Continuing operations 311,952 316,722 312,009 Discontinued operations 1,495 3,403 9,227 Gain on sales of real estate (19,925 ) (37,321 ) (229,189 ) Equity income from unconsolidated joint ventures (4,770 ) (3,511 ) (3,326 ) FFO from unconsolidated joint ventures 25,288 26,023 24,125 Noncontrolling interests and participating securities share in earnings 15,767 15,952 24,485 Noncontrolling interests and participating securities share in FFO (17,904 ) (17,873 ) (26,910 ) FFO applicable to common shares $ 619,401 $ 412,464 $ 535,789 Distributions on dilutive convertible units 6,676 12,974 Diluted FFO applicable to common shares $ 626,077 $ 412,464 $ 548,763 Diluted FFO per common share $ 2.02 $ 1.50 $ 2.24 Weighted average shares used to calculate diluted FFO per common share 310,465 274,631 244,650 56 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Impact of adjustments to FFO: Impairments, net of recoveries $ 59,793 $ 75,514 $ 27,851 Merger related items(1) 4,339 3,897 Litigation provision 101,973 $ 64,132 $ 177,487 $ 31,748 FFO as adjusted applicable to common shares $ 683,533 $ 589,951 $ 567,537 Distributions on dilutive convertible units 11,632 6,088 12,974 Diluted FFO as adjusted $ 695,165 $ 596,039 $ 580,511 Diluted FFO as adjusted per common share $ 2.23 $ 2.14 $ 2.37 Weighted average shares used to calculate diluted FFO as adjusted per common share(2) 311,285 278,134 244,650 (1)Merger related items for 2010 primarily include professional fees associated with our pending HCR ManorCare Acquisition; Merger related items for 2008 primarily include the amortization of fees associated with our acquisition financing for SEUSA. (2)Our weighted average shares used to calculate diluted FFO as adjusted eliminate the impact of our December 2010 common stock offering, which issuance increased its weighted average outstanding shares by 1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Proceeds from this offering will be used to fund a portion of the cash consideration of our pending HCR ManorCare Acquisition. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We own interests in certain unconsolidated joint ventures as described under Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Except in limited circumstances, our risk of loss is limited to our investment in the joint venture and any outstanding loans receivable. In addition, we have certain properties which serve as collateral for debt that is owed by a previous owner of certain of our facilities, as described under Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included. Our risk of loss for these properties is limited to the outstanding debt balance plus penalties, if any. We have no other material off balance sheet arrangements that we expect would materially affect our liquidity and capital resources except those described below under "Contractual Obligations." Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our material contractual payment obligations and commitments at December 31, 2010 (in thousands): Total(1) Less than One Year 2012 2013 2014 2015 More than Five Years Senior unsecured notes $ 3,329,265 $ 292,265 $ 800,000 $ 487,000 $ 1,750,000 Mortgage and other secured debt 1,237,052 57,571 314,844 532,889 331,748 Development commitments(2) 4,666 4,666 Ground and other operating leases 198,189 5,076 10,457 9,032 173,624 Interest(3) 1,292,807 274,343 475,592 332,387 210,485 Total $ 6,061,979 $ 633,921 $ 1,600,893 $ 1,361,308 $ 2,465,857 (1)Excludes $92 million of other debt that represents non interest bearing Life Care Bonds and occupancy fee deposits at three of our senior housing facilities, which have no scheduled maturities. (2)Represents construction and other commitments for developments in progress. (3)Interest on variable rate debt is calculated using rates in effect at December 31, 2010. 57 Table of Contents Inflation Our leases often provide for either fixed increases in base rents or indexed escalators, based on the Consumer Price Index or other measures, and or additional rent based on increases in the tenants operating revenues. Substantially all of our MOB leases require the tenant to pay a share of property operating costs such as real estate taxes, insurance and utilities. Substantially all of our senior housing, life science, post acute/skilled nursing and hospital leases require the operator or tenant to pay all of the property operating costs or reimburse us for all such costs. We believe that inflationary increases in expenses will be offset, in part, by the operator or tenant expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases described above. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the impact of new accounting standards. There were no accounting pronouncements that were issued, but not yet adopted by us, that we believe will materially impact our consolidated financial statements.  ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk At December 31, 2010, we were exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on approximately $1.3 billion of variable rate loan investments (excludes $500 million of variable rate loan investments that have been hedged through interest rate swap contracts) and $83 million of other investments where the payments fluctuate with changes in LIBOR. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our loan investments. Our exposure to income fluctuations related to our variable rate investments is partially offset by (i) $31 million of variable rate mortgage notes debt payable (excludes $88 million of variable rate mortgage notes that have been hedged through interest rate swap contracts), (ii) $25 million of variable rate senior unsecured notes and (iii) $250 million of additional variable interest rate exposure achieved through an interest rate swap contract (pay float and receive fixed). Interest rate fluctuations will generally not affect our future earnings or cash flows on our fixed rate debt and loans receivable unless such instruments mature or are otherwise terminated. However, interest rate changes will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments. Conversely, changes in interest rates on variable rate debt and investments would change our future earnings and cash flows, but not significantly affect the fair value of those instruments. Assuming a one percentage point increase in the interest rate related to the variable rate investments and variable rate debt, and assuming no change in the outstanding balance as of December 31, 2010, net interest income would improve by approximately $10.5 million or $0.03 per common share on a diluted basis. Assuming a 50 basis point decrease in interest rates under the above circumstances and taking into consideration that the index underlying many of our arrangements is currently below 50 basis points and is not expected to go below zero, net interest income would decline by $5.2 million, or less than $0.02 per common share on a diluted basis. We use derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to mitigate interest rate risk. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at their fair value. See Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. To illustrate the effect of movements in the interest rate markets, we performed a market sensitivity analysis on our hedging instruments. We applied various basis point spreads, to the underlying interest rate curves of the derivative portfolio in order to determine the instruments change in fair value. Assuming a one percentage point change in the underlying interest rate curve, the estimated change in fair value of each of the underlying derivative instruments would not exceed $4.0 million. See Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional analysis details. 58 Table of Contents The principal amount and the average interest rates for our loans receivable and debt categorized by maturity dates is presented in the table below. The fair value for our senior unsecured notes payable is based on prevailing market prices. The fair value estimates for loans receivable and mortgage debt payable are based on discounting future cash flows utilizing current rates for loans and debt of the same type and remaining maturity.

(2)Effective interest rate includes an interest rate swap contract (pay float and receive fixed) designated in a qualifying hedging relationship with a notional amount of $250 million that terminates in September 2011. The interest rate swap contact had a fixed rate of 5.95% and a floating rate of LIBOR plus 4.21% at December 31, 2010.
