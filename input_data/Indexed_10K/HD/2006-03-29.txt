Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Executive Summary and Selected Consolidated Statements of Earnings Data For fiscal year ended January 29, 2006 ("fiscal 2005"), we reported Net Earnings of $5.8 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share of $2.72 compared to Net Earnings of $5.0 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share of $2.26 for fiscal year ended January 30, 2005 ("fiscal 2004"). Net Sales increased 11.5% to $81.5 billion for fiscal 2005 from $73.1 billion for fiscal 2004. Comparable store sales increased 3.8% for fiscal 2005. We also achieved a record gross profit margin of 33.5% and a record operating margin of 11.5% for fiscal 2005. These results were achieved through the continued execution of our strategy to enhance the core, extend the business and expand the market. We enhanced our core business by continuing to introduce new and innovative merchandise that reflects emerging consumer trends, supported by continued investments in store modernization and technology. Significant merchandising enhancements in fiscal 2005 include: An enhanced grill lineup led by our proprietary Charmglow&reg; brand and the exclusive Ducane Stainless Steel Grills; Flooring innovation through our DuPont RealTouch Elite Laminate Flooring; Introduction of LG appliances and a broadened assortment of Maytag and GE products; Expanded patio lineup led by our proprietary Hampton Bay&reg; set; Broadened assortment of paint, including Colores Origenes, Bellagio faux paint, and the Ralph Lauren metallic and suede paint; Innovative products from Ryobi&reg;, including the Ryobi One+ System, Ryobi Multitaskit and Ryobi Gas Pressure Washer; and Growing power tool lineup, including the introduction of exclusive Makita and Milwaukee lithium ion power tools for professional and do it yourself customers. Our store modernization efforts included improved signage, point of purchase information and merchandise resets across a variety of categories. During fiscal 2005, we also achieved the following accomplishments related to our technology initiatives: Completed the rollout of our back end scanned receiving to all stores in the United States ("U.S.") and Canada; Commenced vendor certification for certified receiving; Continued installation of self check out registers, in 1,272 stores at the end of fiscal 2005; Grew centralized automatic replenishment to 20% of store sales; and Implemented the new in store Special Order Services Initiative pilot in 285 stores. These investments in our business are paying off as evidenced by improvement in key operating performance measurements, including average ticket, which increased 5.6% to a record $57.98 for fiscal 2005. We invested $3.9 billion in capital expenditures during fiscal 2005 for store modernization and technology as well as for 179 new store openings. We further extended our business by offering a variety of installation and home maintenance programs to our do it for me customers through our stores. Our services revenue increased 21.4% to $4.3 billion for fiscal 2005. We saw sustained growth in categories such as countertops, roofing, kitchens, windows and HVAC. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we extended our services business by acquiring Chem Dry, the worlds largest carpet and 20 upholstery cleaning franchisor. Chem Dry has nearly 4,000 franchises worldwide, including 2,500 in the U.S. We opened 179 new stores in fiscal 2005, including five relocations, and closed 22 stores, bringing our total store count at the end of fiscal 2005 to 2,042 compared to 1,890 at the end of fiscal 2004. As of the end of fiscal 2005, 191 of our stores were located in Canada and Mexico compared to 161 at the end of fiscal 2004. In fiscal 2005, we closed 20 of our EXPO Design Center ("EXPO") stores, four of which are being converted to The Home Depot store format. We recorded $91 million of asset impairment and lease obligation charges in Selling, General and Administrative Expense in fiscal 2005 related to the disposition of our interest in the underlying real estate and store conversions. Additionally, we recorded $29 million of expense in Cost of Sales related to inventory markdowns in fiscal 2005. Affected EXPO customers are being served by existing The Home Depot and EXPO stores. In fiscal 2005, we also closed two Home Depot Supply stores which did not have a material impact on our financial results. In fiscal 2005, we increased our offerings on www.homedepot.com to over 30,000 products; the site now averages 3 million hits per week. Additionally, we launched two unique direct to customer brands: 10 Crescent Lane (www.10CrescentLane.com) and Paces Trading Company (www.PacesTrading.com) which offer quality home d&eacute;cor and lighting options, respectively, through innovative new catalogs and e commerce sites. We have expanded our business by capturing a growing share of the professional residential, commercial and heavy construction markets, which operate under Home Depot Supply. As part of this expansion in fiscal 2005, we completed 18 acquisitions that operate under Home Depot Supply, including National Waterworks, Inc. ("National Waterworks"), the nations leading distributor of products used to build, repair and maintain water and wastewater transmission systems, and Williams Bros. Lumber Company, a leading supplier of lumber and building materials. In total for fiscal 2005, we completed 21 acquisitions and the total cash paid for businesses acquired in fiscal 2005 was $2.5 billion. In January 2006, we announced our intent to acquire Hughes Supply, Inc. ("Hughes Supply" NYSE "HUG"), a leading distributor of construction and repair products. We expect to complete this acquisition in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. We generated $6.5 billion of cash flow from operations in fiscal 2005. We used this cash flow to fund, in part, $3.9 billion in capital expenditures, $2.5 billion for acquisitions and $3.9 billion of dividends and share repurchases. At the end of fiscal 2005, our long term debt to equity ratio was 9.9%, reflecting the August 2005 issuance of $1.0 billion of 45/8% Senior Notes due August 15, 2010. Our return on invested capital (computed on beginning long term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters) was 22.4% compared to 21.5% for fiscal 2004, a 90 basis point improvement. 21  We believe the selected sales data, the percentage relationship between Net Sales and major categories in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and the percentage change in the dollar amounts of each of the items presented as follows is important in evaluating the performance of our business operations. We operate in one operating segment and believe the information presented in our Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations provides an understanding of our operating segment, our operations and our financial condition. % of Net Sales % Increase (Decrease) In Dollar Amounts Fiscal Year(1) 2005 2004 2003 2005 vs. 2004 2004 vs. 2003 NET SALES 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 11.5 % 12.8 % Gross Profit 33.5 33.4 31.8 11.8 18.7 Operating Expenses: Selling, General and Administrative 20.2 20.9 19.6 8.1 20.0 Depreciation and Amortization 1.8 1.7 1.6 17.9 22.2 Total Operating Expenses 22.0 22.6 21.2 8.8 20.2 OPERATING INCOME 11.5 10.8 10.6 18.1 15.8 Interest Income (Expense): Interest and Investment Income 0.1 0.1 0.1 10.7 (5.1 ) Interest Expense (0.2 ) (0.1 ) (0.1 ) 104.3 12.9 Interest, net (0.1 ) 478.6 366.7 EARNINGS BEFORE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES 11.4 10.8 10.6 17.3 15.6 Provision for Income Taxes 4.2 4.0 4.0 18.3 14.7 NET EARNINGS 7.2 % 6.8 % 6.6 % 16.7 % 16.2 % SELECTED SALES DATA Number of Customer Transactions (000s)(2) 1,329,873 1,295,185 1,245,721 2.7 % 4.0 % Average Ticket(2) $ 57.98 $ 54.89 $ 51.15 5.6 7.3 Weighted Average Weekly Sales per Operating Store(2) $ 763,000 $ 766,000 $ 763,000 (0.4 ) 0.4 Weighted Average Sales per Square Foot(2) $ 377.01 $ 375.26 $ 370.87 0.5 1.2 Comparable Store Sales Increase (%)(3) 3.8 % 5.4 % 3.8 % N/A N/A (1)Fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003 refer to the fiscal years ended January 29, 2006, January 30, 2005 and February 1, 2004, respectively.

Comparable store sales is intended only as supplemental information and is not a substitute for Net Sales or Net Earnings presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 22 Results of Operations For an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three fiscal years, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements presented in this Annual Report. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004 Net Sales Net Sales for fiscal 2005 increased 11.5% to $81.5 billion from $73.1 billion for fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2005 Net Sales growth was driven by an increase in comparable store sales of 3.8%, sales from new stores opened during fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 and sales from our newly acquired businesses. Assuming the acquisition of Hughes Supply closes in the first quarter of 2006, we expect sales growth of 14% to 17% for fiscal 2006, driven by comparable store sales growth, sales from new stores opened during fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006 and sales from newly acquired businesses, including Hughes Supply. The increase in comparable store sales in fiscal 2005 reflects a number of factors. The retail stores contributed 3.0% of comparable store sales growth and Home Depot Supply contributed 80 basis points of comparable store sales growth. In the retail stores, our average ticket, which increased 5.6% to a record $57.98, increased in all selling departments and our comparable store sales growth in fiscal 2005 was positive in 9 of 10 selling departments. Building materials had the strongest comparable store sales increase through sales growth of gypsum, roofing, concrete and insulation, due in part to the impact of one of the most destructive hurricane seasons in modern U.S. history. We experienced strong comparable store sales growth in kitchen and bath driven by continued growth in appliances and kitchen installations. We also experienced strong comparable store sales in our Pro categories, including plumbing, electrical and hardware in fiscal 2005. The impact of cannibalization partially offset our fiscal 2005 comparable store sales growth. In order to meet our customer service objectives, we strategically open stores near market areas served by existing stores ("cannibalize") to enhance service levels, gain incremental sales and increase market penetration. As of the end of fiscal 2005, certain new stores cannibalized approximately 20% of our existing stores and we estimate that store cannibalization reduced fiscal 2005 comparable store sales by approximately 1.8%. Additionally, we believe that our sales performance has been, and could continue to be, negatively impacted by the level of competition that we encounter in various markets. However, due to the highly fragmented U.S. home improvement and professional supply industry, in which we estimate our market share is approximately 11%, measuring the impact on our sales by our competitors is extremely difficult. The growth in Net Sales for fiscal 2005 reflects growth in services revenue, which increased 21.4% to $4.3 billion for fiscal 2005 from $3.6 billion for fiscal 2004. The growth in services revenue was driven by strength in a number of areas including countertops, roofing, kitchens, windows and HVAC. We continued to drive our services programs, which focus primarily on providing products and services to our do it for me customers. We also arrange for the provision of flooring, countertop, cabinet, and window covering installation services to production home builders through our Creative Touch Interiors brand. Our services revenue is expected to benefit from the growing percentage of aging "baby boomers" as they rely more heavily on installation services. We continue to invest in our stores to improve store efficiency and the overall customer shopping experience. In fiscal 2005, we completed the rollout of our back end automation and re engineering ("BEAR") project to all stores in the U.S. and Canada. Among other things, this initiative improves operational execution and productivity through the automation of our receiving process in the stores, enabling us to reallocate resources to the selling floor. During fiscal 2005, we continued the implementation or expansion of a number of other in store initiatives. We continued the installation of 23 self checkout registers, in 1,272 stores as of the end of fiscal 2005, grew our centralized automatic replenishment program, commenced vendor certification for certified receiving and implemented an in store Special Order Services Initiative pilot in 285 stores as of the end of fiscal 2005. We believe these initiatives will enhance our customers shopping experience as they are fully implemented in our stores. Gross Profit Gross Profit increased 11.8% to $27.3 billion for fiscal 2005 from $24.4 billion for fiscal 2004. Gross Profit as a percent of Net Sales increased 10 basis points to 33.5% for fiscal 2005, the highest annual rate in our Companys history. Our gross profit margin was impacted by a number of factors during the year including a change in the mix of merchandise sold, markdowns taken in connection with our decision to close or convert 20 EXPO stores, the increasing penetration of our Home Depot Supply business and the cost of our deferred interest programs. Through our private label credit card we offer no interest/no payment programs. The deferred interest associated with these programs is included in Cost of Sales. We believe these programs deliver long term benefits, including higher average ticket and customer loyalty. For fiscal 2005, the penetration of our private label credit sales was 25.6% compared to 24.1% for fiscal 2004. Operating Expenses Operating Expenses increased 8.8% to $18.0 billion for fiscal 2005 from $16.5 billion for fiscal 2004. Operating Expenses as a percent of Net Sales were 22.0% for fiscal 2005 compared to 22.6% for fiscal 2004. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses ("SG&A") increased 8.1% to $16.5 billion for fiscal 2005 from $15.3 billion for fiscal 2004. As a percent of Net Sales, SG&A was 20.2% for fiscal 2005 compared to 20.9% for fiscal 2004. The reduction of SG&A as a percent of Net Sales for fiscal 2005 was primarily a result of continued focus on cost take out initiatives and driving productivity gains throughout the Company. We also continue to see benefits from our private label credit card, which carries a lower discount rate than other forms of credit, like bank cards. In fiscal 2005, we recorded $52 million of income related to gift card breakage as a reduction of SG&A. Fiscal 2005 was the first year in which we recognized gift card breakage, and therefore, the amount recognized in fiscal 2005 includes the breakage income related to gift cards sold since the inception of our gift card program. While we expect to continue to recognize gift card breakage in future periods, the amounts will be significantly less than in fiscal 2005 due to the one time multi year inclusion in fiscal 2005. Finally, for fiscal 2005, we recorded $91 million of impairment charges and expense related to lease obligations in connection with our decision to close or convert 20 EXPO stores. Depreciation and Amortization increased 17.9% to $1.5 billion for fiscal 2005 from $1.2 billion for fiscal 2004. Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales was 1.8% for fiscal 2005 and 1.7% for fiscal 2004. The increase as a percent of Net Sales was primarily due to our investments in store modernization and technology. Interest, net In fiscal 2005, we recognized $81 million of net Interest Expense compared to $14 million in fiscal 2004. Net Interest Expense as a percent of Net Sales was 0.1% for fiscal 2005 and less than 0.1% for fiscal 2004. Interest Expense increased to $143 million for fiscal 2005 from $70 million for fiscal 2004 primarily due to additional interest incurred related to the August 2005 $1.0 billion issuance of 45/8% Senior Notes and the September 2004 $1.0 billion issuance of 33/4% Senior Notes. Interest and Investment Income increased 10.7% to $62 million for fiscal 2005 from $56 million for fiscal 2004 due primarily to a higher interest rate environment. 24 Provision for Income Taxes Our combined federal and state effective income tax rate increased to 37.1% for fiscal 2005 from 36.8% for fiscal 2004. The majority of the increase in our effective income tax rate was due to an increase in the state effective tax rate in fiscal 2005. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 ("AJC Act") provides a one time 85% dividends received deduction that applies to qualified cash dividends received from controlled foreign corporations if the funds are reinvested in the United States. The deduction can result in an effective income tax rate of 5.25% on the repatriation of foreign earnings, a rate much lower than the normal statutory tax rate of 35%. The Company has determined that it will not repatriate earnings of foreign subsidiaries under the AJC Act. The AJC Act also provides a new deduction for qualified domestic production activities. When fully phased in, the deduction will be up to 9% of the lesser of qualified production activities income or taxable income. Because this provision is targeted toward manufacturing activities, the Company does not expect to recognize a material benefit in the current or future tax years. Diluted Earnings per Share Diluted Earnings per Share were $2.72 and $2.26 for fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively. Diluted Earnings per Share were favorably impacted in both fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 as a result of the repurchase of shares of our common stock under our $11.0 billion repurchase authorization. Over the past four fiscal years, we have repurchased approximately 277 million shares of our common stock for a total of $9.7 billion. On February 23, 2006 our Board of Directors authorized an additional $1.0 billion for share repurchases, bringing our total authorization to $12.0 billion. In fiscal 2006, we estimate Diluted Earnings per Share growth of 10% to 14%. Fiscal 2004 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended February 1, 2004 ("fiscal 2003") Net Sales Net Sales for fiscal 2004 increased 12.8% to $73.1 billion from $64.8 billion for fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2004 Net Sales growth was driven by an increase in comparable store sales of 5.4%, sales from the 183 net new stores opened during fiscal 2004, sales from the 175 net new stores opened during fiscal 2003 and sales from our newly acquired businesses. The increase in comparable store sales in fiscal 2004 reflects a number of factors. Our average ticket, which increased 7.3% to $54.89, increased in all selling departments and our comparable store sales growth in fiscal 2004 was positive in all selling departments. We experienced strong comparable store sales increases in building materials due in part to the impact of several hurricanes in the Southeastern U.S. Lumber was another strong category during fiscal 2004, driven primarily by commodity price inflation. Additionally, we had strong sales growth in our kitchen and bath categories, driven by appliances, bath fixtures, vanities and sinks. Finally, our comparable store sales growth in fiscal 2004 reflects the impact of cannibalization. As of the end of fiscal 2004, certain new stores cannibalized approximately 17% of our existing stores and we estimate that store cannibalization reduced fiscal 2004 comparable store sales by approximately 2.2%. The growth in Net Sales for fiscal 2004 reflects growth in services revenue, which increased 28% to $3.6 billion for fiscal 2004 from $2.8 billion for fiscal 2003, driven by strength in a number of areas including countertops, HVAC, kitchens and our flooring companies. 25 Gross Profit Gross Profit increased 18.7% to $24.4 billion for fiscal 2004 from $20.6 billion for fiscal 2003, an increase of 167 basis points. Gross Profit as a percent of Net Sales was 33.4% for fiscal 2004, compared to 31.8% for fiscal 2003. The adoption of Emerging Issues Task Force 02 16, "Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor" ("EITF 02 16"), reduced our Cost of Sales by co op advertising allowances of $891 million, or 122 basis points, in fiscal 2004 and $40 million, or 6 basis points, in fiscal 2003. See section "Impact of the Adoption of EITF 02 16." Excluding the impact of the adoption of EITF 02 16, our Gross Profit as a percent of Net Sales would have been 32.2% for fiscal 2004 compared with 31.7% for fiscal 2003. Improved inventory management, which resulted in lower shrink levels, contributed 18 basis points of our increase in Gross Profit. Finally, 33 basis points resulted from benefits arising from a change in merchandising mix, offset by the cost of our deferred interest programs. Operating Expenses Operating Expenses increased 20.2% to $16.5 billion for fiscal 2004 from $13.7 billion for fiscal 2003. Operating Expenses as a percent of Net Sales were 22.6% for fiscal 2004 compared to 21.2% for fiscal 2003. SG&A increased 20.0% to $15.3 billion for fiscal 2004 from $12.7 billion for fiscal 2003. As a percent of Net Sales, SG&A was 20.9% for fiscal 2004 compared to 19.6% for fiscal 2003. The increase in SG&A in fiscal 2004 includes $1.0 billion of advertising expense related to the adoption of EITF 02 16. Excluding the impact of EITF 02 16, SG&A increased 12.2% to $14.3 billion, or 19.5% of Net Sales, in fiscal 2004 compared with 19.6% of Net Sales in fiscal 2003. The decrease in SG&A as a percent of Net Sales for fiscal 2004, excluding the impact of EITF 02 16, was due to an increase in labor productivity and benefits from our private label credit card, which carries a lower discount rate than other forms of credit, like bank cards. Labor productivity, as measured by sales per labor hour, reached an all time high in fiscal 2004, as we moved our associates from tasking to selling activities. This reduction in costs was partially offset by higher expenses associated with incentive programs, like our success sharing program and our management incentive plan and stock based compensation expense. In addition, our planned investment in store modernization and technology caused remodel and repair expenses to rise at a faster rate than our Net Sales growth. Depreciation and Amortization increased 22.2% to $1.2 billion for fiscal 2004 from $1.0 billion for fiscal 2003. Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales was 1.7% for fiscal 2004 and 1.6% for fiscal 2003. The increase in fiscal 2004 was primarily due to our investment in store modernization and technology. Interest, net In fiscal 2004, we recognized $14 million of net Interest Expense compared to $3 million in fiscal 2003. Net Interest Expense as a percent of Net Sales was less than 0.1% for both fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003. Interest Expense increased 12.9% to $70 million for fiscal 2004 from $62 million for fiscal 2003 primarily due to an increase in outstanding indebtedness and a reduction in the amount of capitalized interest. Interest Expense also increased due to the addition of $38 million in capital leases during the year. Interest and Investment Income decreased 5.1% to $56 million for fiscal 2004 from $59 million for fiscal 2003 primarily due to a lower interest rate environment. Provision for Income Taxes Our combined federal and state effective income tax rate decreased to 36.8% for fiscal 2004 from 37.1% for fiscal 2003. The majority of this reduction was due to the reversal of a $31 million valuation 26 allowance as we were able to recognize previous capital losses for which no tax benefit had been recorded at the time the capital loss was incurred. Diluted Earnings per Share Diluted Earnings per Share were $2.26 and $1.88 for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, respectively. The adoption of EITF 02 16 negatively impacted Diluted Earnings per Share for fiscal 2004 by $0.04 per share. Diluted Earnings per Share were favorably impacted in fiscal 2004 as a result of the repurchase of shares of our common stock in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004. Impact of the Adoption of EITF 02 16 In fiscal 2003, we adopted EITF 02 16 which states that certain cash consideration received from a vendor is presumed to be a reduction of the prices of the vendors products or services and should, therefore, be recorded as a reduction of Cost of Sales when recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. That presumption is overcome when the consideration is either a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to sell the vendors products or a payment for assets or services delivered to the vendor. We receive consideration in the form of advertising co op allowances from our vendors pursuant to annual agreements, which are generally on a calendar year basis. As permitted by EITF 02 16, we elected to apply its provisions prospectively to all agreements entered into or modified after December 31, 2002. Therefore, the impact of us adopting EITF 02 16 in fiscal 2003 was limited to advertising co op allowances earned pursuant to vendor agreements entered into in late 2003, which became effective in January 2004. The one month impact of the adoption of EITF 02 16 in fiscal 2003 resulted in a reduction of Cost of Sales of $40 million, an increase in SG&A of $47 million and a reduction of Earnings before Provision for Income Taxes of $7 million. The impact on our Diluted Earnings per Share was immaterial. The impact of the adoption of EITF 02 16 in fiscal 2004 resulted in a reduction of Cost of Sales of $891 million, an increase in SG&A of $1.0 billion and a reduction of Earnings before Provision for Income Taxes of $158 million. The impact on our Diluted Earnings per Share for fiscal 2004 was a reduction of $0.04 per share. EITF 02 16 did not have a material impact on our fiscal 2005 consolidated results of operations or financial condition as of January 29, 2006. Prior to the adoption of EITF 02 16 in fiscal 2003, the entire amount of advertising co op allowances received was offset against advertising expense and resulted in a reduction of SG&A. We continue to earn certain advertising co op allowances that are recorded as an offset against advertising expenses as they are reimbursements of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors products. In fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, net advertising expense was $1.1 billion, $1.0 billion and $58 million, respectively, which was recorded in SG&A. 27 The following table illustrates the full year effect on Cost of Sales, Gross Profit, SG&A, Operating Income and Diluted Earnings per Share as if advertising co op allowances had always been treated as a reduction of Cost of Sales in accordance with EITF 02 16 (amounts in millions, except per share data): Fiscal Year Ended January 29, 2006 January 30, 2005 February 1, 2004 Cost of Sales As Reported $ 54,191 $ 48,664 $ 44,236 Pro Forma 54,191 48,524 43,295 Gross Profit As Reported 27,320 24,430 20,580 Pro Forma 27,320 24,570 21,521 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses As Reported 16,485 15,256 12,713 Pro Forma 16,485 15,256 13,654 Operating Income As Reported 9,363 7,926 6,846 Pro Forma 9,363 8,066 6,846 Diluted Earnings per Share As Reported $ 2.72 $ 2.26 $ 1.88 Pro Forma $ 2.72 $ 2.30 $ 1.88 Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flow generated from operations provides a significant source of liquidity. For fiscal 2005, Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities was $6.5 billion as compared to $6.9 billion for fiscal 2004. The decrease in fiscal 2005 was primarily due to a reduction in Deferred Income Taxes resulting from the reversal of certain temporary differences and no increase in Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities partially offset by stronger Net Earnings. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities increased to $4.6 billion for fiscal 2005 from $4.5 billion for fiscal 2004. This increase was due to an increase in Payments for Businesses Acquired, partially offset by a decrease in the net proceeds from sales, maturities and purchases of investments. We paid $2.5 billion to complete 21 acquisitions in fiscal 2005, primarily adding professional service capabilities to Home Depot Supply. In January 2006, we announced our intent to acquire Hughes Supply for aggregate consideration of $3.5 billion. We expect to complete this acquisition in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. Additionally in fiscal 2005, we had $3.9 billion of Capital Expenditures, allocated as follows: 66% for new stores, 10% for store modernization, 9% for technology and 15% for other initiatives. In fiscal 2005, we opened 179 new stores, including five relocations. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities for fiscal 2005 was $1.6 billion compared with $3.1 billion for fiscal 2004. The decrease in Net Cash Used in Financing Activities was primarily due to the issuance of $1.0 billion of Long Term Debt in August 2005 and $900 million of Short Term Debt in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 under our commercial paper program. In May 2005, we filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the future issuance of up to $5.0 billion of debt securities. In August 2005, we issued $1.0 billion of 45/8% Senior Notes (see Note 3 in "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements") at a discount of $5 million. The net proceeds of $995 million were used to pay for a portion of the acquisition price of National Waterworks. Commercial paper borrowings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 supported short term liquidity needs. 28 In February 2005 and August 2005, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $2.0 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, in our share repurchase program, bringing the total authorization by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2002 to $11.0 billion as of January 29, 2006. Pursuant to this authorization, we have repurchased approximately 277 million shares of our common stock for a total of $9.7 billion as of January 29, 2006. During fiscal 2005, we repurchased approximately 76 million shares of our common stock for $3.0 billion and during fiscal 2004 we repurchased 84 million shares of our common stock for $3.1 billion. As of January 29, 2006, approximately $1.3 billion remained under our previously authorized share repurchase program. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2005, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $1.0 billion bringing the total authorization since the inception of the share repurchase program to $12.0 billion. During fiscal 2005, we also increased dividends paid by 19.2% to $857 million from $719 million in fiscal 2004. We have a commercial paper program that allows for borrowings up to a maximum of $2.5 billion. In connection with the program, we have a back up credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. As of January 29, 2006, there was $900 million outstanding under the program. We expect to repay this amount during the first quarter of 2006. The credit facility, which expires in December 2010, contains various restrictions, none of which is expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. We use capital and operating leases to finance a portion of our real estate, including our stores, distribution centers and store support centers. The net present value of capital lease obligations is reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in Long Term Debt. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the operating leases are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of the end of fiscal 2005, our long term debt to equity ratio was 9.9% compared to 8.9% at the end of fiscal 2004. This increase reflects the net increase in Long Term Debt as a result of the August 2005 issuance of 45/8% Senior Notes due August 15, 2010. As of January 29, 2006, we had $807 million in Cash and Short Term Investments. We believe that our current cash position and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and any required long term debt payments through the next several fiscal years. In addition, we have funds available from the $2.5 billion commercial paper program and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing for future acquisitions and other requirements. In March 2006, we used the remaining availability under our shelf registration statement to issue $1.0 billion of 5.20% Senior Notes due March 1, 2011 and $3.0 billion of 5.40% Senior Notes due March 1, 2016. We intend to use the proceeds to fund our pending acquisition of Hughes Supply and to refinance our $500 million of 53/8% Senior Notes due April 1, 2006. 29  The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of January 29, 2006 (amounts in millions): Payments Due by Fiscal Year Contractual Obligations(1) Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total Debt(2) $ 4,192 $ 1,521 $ 500 $ 2,143 $ 28 Capital Lease Obligations(3) 1,248 72 145 147 884 Operating Leases 8,449 706 1,287 1,093 5,363 Subtotal $ 13,889 $ 2,299 $ 1,932 $ 3,383 $ 6,275 Amount of Commitment Expiration per Fiscal Year Commercial Commitments(4) Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Letters of Credit $ 1,292 $ 1,257 $ 35 $ $ Purchase Obligations(5) 2,315 946 1,067 302 Subtotal 3,607 2,203 1,102 302 Total $ 17,496 $ 4,502 $ 3,034 $ 3,685 $ 6,275 (1)Contractual obligations include Short Term Debt, Long Term Debt comprised primarily of $2.5 billion of Senior Notes further discussed in "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" and future minimum lease payments under capital and operating leases used in the normal course of business. The amounts listed do not include aggregate consideration of $3.5 billion related to our pending acquisition of Hughes Supply, expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 or any debt issued subsequent to the end of fiscal 2005. (2) Excludes present value of capital lease obligations of $381 million. Includes $479 million of interest payments and $8 million of unamortized discount. (3) Includes $867 million of imputed interest. (4) Commercial commitments include letters of credit from certain business transactions, purchase obligations and commitments to purchase store assets. We issue letters of credit for insurance programs, purchases of import merchandise inventories and construction contracts. Our purchase obligations consist of commitments for both merchandise and services. (5) Purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm commitments for inventory purchases, utility purchases, capital expenditures, software acquisition and license commitments and legally binding service contracts. Purchase orders that are not binding agreements are excluded from the table above. Additionally, we have included a commitment to purchase the underlying asset under an off balance sheet lease related to certain stores for $282 million during 2008. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Our exposure to market risk results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates. Although we have international operating entities, our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not significant to our financial condition and results of operations. Our primary objective for entering into derivative instruments is to manage our exposure to interest rates, as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate debt. As of January 29, 2006 we had, net of discounts, $996 million of 45/8% Senior Notes, $996 million of 33/4% Senior Notes and $500 million of 53/8% Senior Notes outstanding. The market values of the publicly traded 45/8%, 33/4% and 53/8% Senior Notes as of January 29, 2006, were approximately $985 million, $976 million and $500 million, respectively. We have several outstanding interest rate 30 swap agreements, with notional amounts totaling $475 million, that swap fixed rate interest on our $500 million 53/8% Senior Notes for variable interest rates equal to LIBOR plus 30 to 245 basis points and expire on April 1, 2006. At January 29, 2006, the fair market value of these agreements was a liability of $1 million, which is the estimated amount that we would have paid to settle similar interest rate agreements at current interest rates. Impact of Inflation, Deflation and Changing Prices We have experienced inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity products. During fiscal 2005, lumber prices decreased our comparable store sales by approximately 13 basis points. We do not believe that changing prices for other commodities have had a material effect on our Net Sales or results of operations. Although we cannot accurately determine the precise overall effect of inflation and deflation on operations, we do not believe inflation and deflation have had a material effect on our results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue, net of estimated returns, at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise or receives services. We estimate the liability for sales returns based on our historical return levels. The methodology used is consistent with other retailers. We believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns. We have never recorded a significant adjustment to our estimated liability for sales returns. However, if these estimates are significantly below the actual amounts, our sales could be adversely impacted. When we receive payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed, the amount received is recorded as Deferred Revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets until the sale or service is complete. Merchandise Inventories Our Merchandise Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first in, first out) or market, with approximately 86% valued under the retail inventory method and the remainder under the cost method. Retailers like The Home Depot, with many different types of merchandise at low unit cost and a large number of transactions, frequently use the retail inventory method. Under the retail inventory method, Merchandise Inventories are stated at cost, which is determined by applying a cost to retail ratio to the ending retail value of inventories. As our inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, our inventory valued under the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market. We evaluate our inventory valued under the cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or market. The valuation allowance for Merchandise Inventories valued under the cost method was not material to the Company as of the end of fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004. Independent physical inventory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in each store, distribution center and Home Depot Supply location to ensure that amounts reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for Merchandise Inventories are properly stated. During the period between physical inventory counts in our stores, we accrue for estimated losses related to shrink on a store by store basis. Shrink (or in the case of excess inventory, "swell") is the 31 difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory. Shrink may occur due to theft, loss, inaccurate records for the receipt of inventory or deterioration of goods, among other things. We estimate shrink as a percent of Net Sales using the average shrink results from the previous two physical inventories. The estimates are evaluated quarterly and adjusted based on recent shrink results and current trends in the business. Self Insurance We are self insured for certain losses related to general liability, product liability, automobile, workers compensation and medical claims. Our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. The estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates, and is reviewed by management and third party actuaries on a quarterly basis to ensure that the liability is appropriate. While we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available, if actual trends, including the severity or frequency of claims, medical cost inflation, or fluctuations in premiums, differ from our estimates, our results of operations could be impacted. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123(R), "Share Based Payment" ("SFAS 123(R)"). This statement revises SFAS Statement No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation" ("SFAS 123") and supersedes Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." SFAS 123(R) requires all public entities to recognize compensation expense for all share based payments as measured by the fair value on the grant date over the requisite service period. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued guidance delaying the effective date of SFAS 123(R), therefore it will now be effective for The Home Depot in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. Effective February 3, 2003, we adopted the fair value based method of recording stock based compensation expense in accordance with SFAS 123. We selected the prospective method of adoption as described in SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure," and accordingly, stock based compensation expense was recorded for all share based payments granted or modified after the beginning of fiscal 2003. Historically, we have used the Black Scholes option pricing model to estimate the value of stock options granted to employees. SFAS 123(R) requires that all share based payments granted prior to the adoption date that remain unvested at the adoption date also be expensed over the remaining service period. We currently intend to adopt SFAS 123(R) using the modified prospective method, therefore in addition to continuing to recognize stock based compensation expense for all share based payments awarded since our adoption of SFAS 123 in fiscal 2003, we will also begin expensing unvested options granted prior to 2003 upon the adoption of SFAS 123(R). We currently estimate the impact of adopting SFAS 123(R) will be a reduction of Earnings before Provision for Income Taxes of approximately $40 million for fiscal 2006. In October 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") 13 1, "Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred during a Construction Period" ("FSP 13 1"). FSP 13 1 requires rental costs associated with operating leases that are incurred during a construction period be recognized as rental expense and included in income from continuing operations. FSP 13 1 becomes effective for the first reporting period beginning after December 15, 2005, and will therefore be effective for The Home Depot in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. The adoption of FSP 13 1 is not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
