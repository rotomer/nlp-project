Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Executive Summary and Selected Consolidated Statements of Earnings Data For fiscal year ended January 28, 2007 ("fiscal 2006"), we reported Net Earnings of $5.8 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share of $2.79 compared to Net Earnings of $5.8 billion and Diluted Earnings per Share of $2.72 for fiscal year ended January 29, 2006 ("fiscal 2005"). Net Sales increased 11.4% to $90.8 billion for fiscal 2006 from $81.5 billion for fiscal 2005. Our gross profit margin was 32.8% and our operating margin was 10.7% for fiscal 2006. In the face of a slowdown in the housing market, our retail comparable store sales declined 2.8% in fiscal 2006 driven by a decline in comparable store customer transactions. This was partially offset by an increase in our average ticket of 1.6% in fiscal 2006 to $58.90, including increases in 8 of 10 selling departments. We grew our numerous installation and home maintenance programs serving our do it for me customers through our stores. Our retail services revenue increased 8.3% to $3.8 billion for fiscal 2006. We experienced sustained growth in categories such as countertops, exterior patios, solar, windows and HVAC. We continued to introduce innovative and distinctive merchandise that reflects emerging consumer trends, supported by continued investments in store modernization and technology. We invested $3.5 billion in capital expenditures during fiscal 2006 primarily for new store construction, store modernization and technology. We began an accelerated store reinvestment program whereby we increased our investment in existing stores by $350 million more than our plan in the second half of fiscal 2006 to enhance the customer experience. This investment included capital and expense dollars to reset 100 merchandise bays in 540 stores, incorporate a richer staffing model and support our "Orange Juiced" program, a customer service incentive program for our store associates. We added 125 new stores in fiscal 2006, including 12 stores through our acquisition of The Home Way, a Chinese home improvement retailer, and 10 relocations, bringing our total store count at the end of fiscal 2006 to 2,147. As of the end of fiscal 2006, 228, or approximately 11%, of our stores were located in Canada, Mexico or China compared to 191, or approximately 9%, at the end of fiscal 2005. We have expanded our business by capturing a growing share of the professional residential, commercial and heavy construction markets through the growth of HD Supply. HD Supply experienced 162% Net Sales growth in fiscal 2006 and accounted for approximately 13% of our total Net Sales in fiscal 2006. We completed 12 acquisitions in fiscal 2006 that were integrated into HD Supply, including Hughes Supply, Inc., a leading distributor of construction and repair products. Organic Net Sales growth for the HD Supply segment was 5.6% in fiscal 2006. In February 2007, we announced our decision to evaluate strategic alternatives for HD Supply. In order to maximize the value of HD Supply, we would need to further integrate it with our Retail business. We are currently evaluating whether this integration or other strategic alternatives, such as a sale or initial public offering of the business, would create the most shareholder value. We generated $7.7 billion of cash flow from operations in fiscal 2006. We used this cash flow, along with the net proceeds of additional borrowings of $7.6 billion, to fund $8.1 billion of share repurchases and dividends, $4.3 billion in acquisitions and $3.5 billion in capital expenditures. At the end of fiscal 2006, our long term debt to equity ratio was 47%. Our return on invested capital (computed on beginning long term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters) was 20.5% at the end of fiscal 2006 compared to 22.4% for fiscal 2005. 20 We believe the selected sales data, the percentage relationship between Net Sales and major categories in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and the percentage change in the dollar amounts of each of the items presented as follows is important in evaluating the performance of our business operations. % of Net Sales % Increase (Decrease) In Dollar Amounts Fiscal Year(1) 2006 2005 2004 2006 vs. 2005 2005 vs. 2004 NET SALES 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 11.4 % 11.5 % Gross Profit 32.8 33.5 33.4 9.0 11.8 Operating Expenses: Selling, General and Administrative 20.2 20.2 20.9 11.3 8.1 Depreciation and Amortization 1.9 1.8 1.7 19.7 17.9 Total Operating Expenses 22.1 22.0 22.6 12.0 8.8 OPERATING INCOME 10.7 11.5 10.8 3.3 18.1 Interest Income (Expense): Interest and Investment Income 0.1 0.1 (56.5 ) 10.7 Interest Expense (0.4 ) (0.2 ) (0.1 ) 174.1 104.3 Interest, net (0.4 ) (0.1 ) 350.6 478.6 EARNINGS BEFORE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES 10.3 11.4 10.8 0.3 17.3 Provision for Income Taxes 4.0 4.2 4.0 3.0 18.3 NET EARNINGS 6.3 % 7.2 % 6.8 % (1.3 )% 16.7 % SELECTED SALES DATA(2) Number of Retail Customer Transactions (millions) 1,330 1,330 1,295 0.0 % 2.7 % Average Ticket $ 58.90 $ 57.98 $ 54.89 1.6 5.6 Weighted Average Weekly Sales per Operating Store (000s) $ 723 $ 763 $ 766 (5.2 ) (0.4 ) Weighted Average Sales per Square Foot $ 357.83 $ 377.01 $ 375.26 (5.1 ) 0.5 Retail Comparable Store Sales (Decrease) Increase (%)(3) (2.8 )% 3.1 % 5.1 % N/A N/A (1) Fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004 refer to the fiscal years ended January 28, 2007, January 29, 2006 and January 30, 2005, respectively.

Retail comparable store sales is intended only as supplemental information and is not a substitute for Net Sales or Net Earnings presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 21 Results of Operations For an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three fiscal years, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements presented in this report. We operate in two reportable business segments: Retail and HD Supply. The Retail segment is principally engaged in the operation of retail stores located in the United States, Canada, Mexico and our recently acquired stores in China. The HD Supply segment distributes products and sells installation services to business to business customers, including home builders, professional contractors, municipalities and maintenance professionals. We identify segments based on how management makes operating decisions, assesses performance and allocates resources. The first quarter of fiscal 2006 was the first period in which we began to report our results of operations in two segments. This change was a result of the purchase of Hughes Supply, which significantly increased the size of HD Supply and resulted in changes in our internal reporting and management structure. The Retail segment includes The Home Depot stores, EXPO Design Center stores ("EXPO") and other retail formats. The Retail segment also includes our retail services business and our catalog and on line sales businesses. The HD Supply segment consists of four major platforms: 1) infrastructure, including waterworks and utilities; 2) construction, including construction supply, lumber and building materials, electrical, plumbing/HVAC and interiors; 3) maintenance, including facilities maintenance and industrial PVF; and 4) repair and remodel. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 Net Sales Total Net Sales for fiscal 2006 increased 11.4%, or $9.3 billion, to $90.8 billion from $81.5 billion for fiscal 2005. Of the $9.3 billion increase, $7.3 billion, net of intercompany sales, came from our HD Supply segment and $2.0 billion came from our Retail segment. Net Sales for our Retail segment were $79.0 billion for fiscal 2006, a 2.6% increase over fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2006 Retail segment Net Sales growth was primarily driven by sales from new stores. Retail comparable store sales decreased 2.8% for fiscal 2006 compared to an increase of 3.1% for fiscal 2005. The decline in retail comparable store sales was driven by a 4.6% decline in comparable store customer transactions offset in part by a 1.6% increase in average ticket. Our average ticket increased to $58.90 for fiscal 2006 and increased in 8 of 10 selling departments. The decrease in retail comparable store sales for fiscal 2006 was due to the significant slowdown in the U.S. retail home improvement market as well as difficult year over year comparisons due to sales arising from hurricane activity in fiscal 2005. Both Canada and Mexico, however, experienced positive retail comparable store sales for fiscal 2006. Additionally, our retail comparable store sales results reflect in part the impact of cannibalization. In order to meet our customer service objectives, we strategically open stores near market areas served by existing stores ("cannibalize") to enhance service levels, gain incremental sales and increase market penetration. Our new stores cannibalized approximately 13.5% of our existing stores during fiscal 2006, which had a negative impact to retail comparable store sales of approximately 1.9%. Despite the difficult U.S. retail home improvement market, we continued to expand our retail services revenue, which increased 8.3% to $3.8 billion for fiscal 2006 from $3.5 billion for fiscal 2005. The growth in retail services revenue was driven by strength in a number of areas including countertops, exterior patios, solar, windows and HVAC. Our retail services programs focus primarily on providing products and services to our do it for me customers. Our services revenue is expected to benefit from the growing percentage of aging "baby boomers" as they rely more heavily on installation services. 22 Net Sales for our HD Supply segment for fiscal 2006 were $12.1 billion, an increase of 162% over fiscal 2005. The increase was primarily a result of recent acquisitions. Organic Net Sales growth for the HD Supply segment was 5.6% in fiscal 2006, which includes the impact of commodity price inflation and market share gains. We believe that our sales performance has been, and could continue to be, negatively impacted by the level of competition that we encounter in various markets. Due to the highly fragmented U.S. home improvement and professional supply industry, in which we estimate our market share is approximately 10%, measuring the impact on our sales by our competitors is difficult. Gross Profit Total Gross Profit increased 9.0% to $29.8 billion for fiscal 2006 from $27.3 billion for fiscal 2005. Gross Profit as a percent of Net Sales decreased 73 basis points to 32.8% for fiscal 2006 compared to 33.5% for fiscal 2005. The decline in total Gross Profit as a percent of Net Sales was primarily due to a higher penetration of the lower margin HD Supply segment. In fiscal 2006, 65 basis points of the total Gross Profit decline was a result of a higher penetration of HD Supply businesses as well as a drop in HD Supplys Gross Profit rate due to a change in the mix of businesses owned. Operating Expenses Operating Expenses increased 12.0% to $20.1 billion for fiscal 2006 from $18.0 billion for fiscal 2005. Operating Expenses as a percent of Net Sales were 22.1% for fiscal 2006 compared to 22.0% for fiscal 2005. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses ("SG&A") increased 11.3% to $18.3 billion for fiscal 2006 from $16.5 billion for fiscal 2005. As a percent of Net Sales, SG&A was 20.2% for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005. The increase in SG&A during fiscal 2006 was due to added associate labor hours on the floor of our stores, increased spending on store maintenance programs and the expansion of merchandise display resets. This increase was partially offset by reduced self insurance costs as we continue to realize benefits from safety programs and other initiatives. Fiscal 2006 SG&A also reflects benefits from our private label credit card, which carries a lower discount rate than other forms of credit, like bank cards. Through our private label credit card we offer no interest/no payment programs. The cost of deferred interest associated with these programs is included in Cost of Sales. We believe these programs deliver long term benefits, including higher average ticket and customer loyalty. For fiscal 2006, the penetration of our private label credit sales was 28.0% compared to 25.6% for fiscal 2005. Also impacting our SG&A in fiscal 2006 is expense associated with executive severance of $129 million and the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123(R), "Share Based Payment" ("SFAS 123(R)"), whereby we recorded approximately $40 million of stock compensation expense related to the continued vesting of options granted prior to fiscal 2003. Partially offsetting the increase in SG&A was $91 million of impairment charges and expense related to lease obligations associated with the closing of 20 EXPO stores in fiscal 2005. Depreciation and Amortization increased 19.7% to $1.8 billion for fiscal 2006 from $1.5 billion for fiscal 2005. Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales was 1.9% for fiscal 2006 and 1.8% for fiscal 2005. The increase as a percent of Net Sales was primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets acquired as part of our recent acquisitions and the depreciation of our investments in store modernization and technology. 23 Interest, net In fiscal 2006, we recognized $365 million of net Interest Expense compared to $81 million in fiscal 2005. Net Interest Expense as a percent of Net Sales was 0.4% for fiscal 2006 compared to 0.1% for fiscal 2005. The increase was primarily due to additional interest incurred related to the March 2006 issuance of $1.0 billion of 5.20% Senior Notes and $3.0 billion of 5.40% Senior Notes and the December 2006 issuance of $750 million of floating rate Senior Notes, $1.25 billion of 5.25% Senior Notes and $3.0 billion of 5.875% Senior Notes. Provision for Income Taxes Our combined federal, state and foreign effective income tax rate increased to 38.1% for fiscal 2006 from 37.1% for fiscal 2005. The increase in our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2006 was primarily due to the impact of a retroactive tax assessment from the Canadian province of Quebec. During the second quarter of fiscal 2006, the Quebec National Assembly passed legislation that retroactively changed certain tax laws that subjected us to additional tax and interest. As a result, we received an assessment from Quebec for $57 million in retroactive tax and $12 million in related interest for the 2002 through 2005 taxable years. Diluted Earnings per Share Diluted Earnings per Share were $2.79 for fiscal 2006 and $2.72 for fiscal 2005. Diluted Earnings per Share were favorably impacted in both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 by the repurchase of shares of our common stock under our $17.5 billion repurchase authorization. Since the inception of the program in 2002, we have repurchased 451 million shares of our common stock for a total of $16.4 billion, including $5 billion through accelerated share repurchases in fiscal 2006. As of January 28, 2007, we had $1.1 billion remaining under our authorized share repurchase program. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended January 30, 2005 ("fiscal 2004") Net Sales Net Sales for fiscal 2005 increased 11.5% to $81.5 billion from $73.1 billion for fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2005 Net Sales growth was driven by an increase in retail comparable store sales of 3.1%, sales from new stores opened during fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 and sales from our newly acquired businesses within HD Supply. The increase in retail comparable store sales in fiscal 2005 reflects a number of factors. Our average ticket, which increased 5.6% to $57.98, increased in all selling departments and our retail comparable store sales growth in fiscal 2005 was positive in 9 of 10 selling departments. Building materials had the strongest retail comparable store sales increase through sales growth of gypsum, roofing, concrete and insulation, due in part to the impact of one of the most destructive hurricane seasons in modern U.S. history. We experienced strong retail comparable store sales growth in kitchen and bath driven by continued growth in appliances and kitchen installations. We also experienced strong retail comparable store sales in our Pro categories, including plumbing, electrical and hardware in fiscal 2005. The impact of cannibalization partially offset our fiscal 2005 retail comparable store sales growth. As of the end of fiscal 2005, certain new stores cannibalized approximately 20% of our existing stores and we estimate that store cannibalization reduced fiscal 2005 retail comparable store sales by approximately 1.8%. The growth in Net Sales for fiscal 2005 also reflects growth in services revenue, which increased 16.6% to $3.5 billion for fiscal 2005 from $3.0 billion for fiscal 2004. The growth in services revenue was driven by strength in a number of areas including countertops, roofing, kitchens, windows and HVAC. 24 Gross Profit Gross Profit increased 11.8% to $27.3 billion for fiscal 2005 from $24.4 billion for fiscal 2004. Gross Profit as a percent of Net Sales increased 10 basis points to 33.5% for fiscal 2005, the highest annual rate in our Companys history. Our gross profit margin was impacted by a number of factors during the year including a change in the mix of merchandise sold, markdowns taken in connection with our decision to close 20 EXPO stores, the increasing penetration of our HD Supply business and the cost of our deferred interest programs. For fiscal 2005, the penetration of our private label credit sales was 25.6% compared to 24.1% for fiscal 2004. Operating Expenses Operating Expenses increased 8.8% to $18.0 billion for fiscal 2005 from $16.5 billion for fiscal 2004. Operating Expenses as a percent of Net Sales were 22.0% for fiscal 2005 compared to 22.6% for fiscal 2004. SG&A increased 8.1% to $16.5 billion for fiscal 2005 from $15.3 billion for fiscal 2004. As a percent of Net Sales, SG&A was 20.2% for fiscal 2005 compared to 20.9% for fiscal 2004. The reduction of SG&A as a percent of Net Sales for fiscal 2005 was primarily a result of continued focus on cost take out initiatives and driving productivity gains throughout the Company. We also continue to see benefits from our private label credit card, which carries a lower discount rate than other forms of credit, like bank cards. In fiscal 2005, we recorded $52 million of income related to gift card breakage as a reduction of SG&A. Fiscal 2005 was the first year in which we recognized gift card breakage, and therefore, the amount recognized in fiscal 2005 includes the breakage income related to gift cards sold since the inception of our gift card program. Finally, for fiscal 2005, we recorded $91 million of impairment charges and expense related to lease obligations in connection with our decision to close 20 EXPO stores. Depreciation and Amortization increased 17.9% to $1.5 billion for fiscal 2005 from $1.2 billion for fiscal 2004. Depreciation and Amortization as a percent of Net Sales was 1.8% for fiscal 2005 and 1.7% for fiscal 2004. The increase as a percent of Net Sales was primarily due to our investments in store modernization and technology. Interest, net In fiscal 2005, we recognized $81 million of net Interest Expense compared to $14 million in fiscal 2004. Net Interest Expense as a percent of Net Sales was 0.1% for fiscal 2005 and less than 0.1% for fiscal 2004. Interest Expense increased to $143 million for fiscal 2005 from $70 million for fiscal 2004 primarily due to additional interest incurred related to the August 2005 $1.0 billion issuance of 4.625% Senior Notes and the September 2004 $1.0 billion issuance of 3.75% Senior Notes. Interest and Investment Income increased 10.7% to $62 million for fiscal 2005 from $56 million for fiscal 2004 due primarily to a higher interest rate environment. Provision for Income Taxes Our combined federal and state effective income tax rate increased to 37.1% for fiscal 2005 from 36.8% for fiscal 2004. The majority of the increase in our effective income tax rate was due to an increase in the state effective tax rate in fiscal 2005. Diluted Earnings per Share Diluted Earnings per Share were $2.72 and $2.26 for fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively. Diluted Earnings per Share were favorably impacted in both fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 as a result of the repurchase of shares of our common stock. 25 Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flow generated from operations provides a significant source of liquidity. For fiscal 2006, Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities was $7.7 billion as compared to $6.6 billion for fiscal 2005. The increase was primarily a result of more productive working capital in fiscal 2006. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities increased to $7.6 billion for fiscal 2006 from $4.6 billion for fiscal 2005. This increase was primarily the result of an increase in Payments for Businesses Acquired of $1.7 billion as well as a decrease in net Proceeds from Sales and Maturities of Investments of $1.7 billion, partially offset by a $339 million decrease in Capital Expenditures. We paid $4.3 billion to complete 15 acquisitions in fiscal 2006, including Hughes Supply. Our fiscal 2006 acquisitions resulted in increases in Receivables, Merchandise Inventories, Goodwill, Other Assets and Accounts Payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 28, 2007. See Note 11 to our "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion. Additionally in fiscal 2006, we spent $3.5 billion on Capital Expenditures, allocated as follows: 64% for new stores, 11% for store modernization, 6% for technology and 19% for other initiatives. In fiscal 2006, we added 125 new stores, including 12 stores in China through our acquisition of The Home Way, and 10 relocations. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities for fiscal 2006 was $203 million compared with $1.7 billion for fiscal 2005. The decrease in Net Cash Used in Financing Activities was primarily due to net proceeds of $7.6 billion from the issuance of additional long term debt, partially offset by a net increase of $4.2 billion in Repurchases of Common Stock and Cash Dividends Paid to Stockholders. In February 2006, May 2006 and August 2006, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $1.0 billion, $2.0 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively, in our share repurchase program, bringing the total authorization by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2002 to $17.5 billion as of January 28, 2007. Pursuant to this authorization, we have repurchased approximately 451 million shares of our common stock for a total of $16.4 billion as of January 28, 2007. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased approximately 174 million shares of our common stock for $6.7 billion and during fiscal 2005 we repurchased approximately 76 million shares of our common stock for $3.0 billion. As of January 28, 2007, approximately $1.1 billion remained under our share repurchase program. During fiscal 2006, we also increased dividends paid by 62.8% to $1.4 billion from $857 million in fiscal 2005. We have a commercial paper program that allows for borrowings up to $2.5 billion. In connection with the program, we have a back up credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $2.0 billion. As of January 28, 2007, there were no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program or the credit facility. The credit facility, which expires in December 2010, contains various restrictions, none of which is expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. We use capital and operating leases to finance a portion of our real estate, including our stores, distribution centers, HD Supply locations and store support centers. The net present value of capital lease obligations is reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in Long Term Debt. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the operating leases are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of the end of fiscal 2006, our long term debt to equity ratio was 46.5% compared to 9.9% at the end of fiscal 2005. This increase reflects the net increase in Long Term Debt as a result of the issuance of Senior Notes in March and December of fiscal 2006. As of January 28, 2007, we had $614 million in Cash and Short Term Investments. We believe that our current cash position and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and any required long term debt payments through the next several fiscal years. In addition, we have funds available from the $2.5 billion commercial paper program and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing for other requirements. 26 In March 2006, we entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $2.0 billion, accounted for as a cash flow hedge, to hedge interest rate fluctuations in anticipation of the issuance of the 5.40% Senior Notes due March 1, 2016. Upon issuance of the hedged debt, we settled our forward starting interest rate swap agreement and recorded a $12 million decrease, net of income taxes, to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, which will be amortized to interest expense over the life of the related debt. In May 2006, we entered into a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement with a financial institution pursuant to which we repurchased approximately 53 million shares of our common stock. Under the agreement, the financial institution purchased an equivalent number of shares of our common stock in the open market. The shares repurchased by us were subject to a future purchase price adjustment based upon the weighted average price of our common stock over an agreed period, subject to a specified collar. In August 2006, we settled the accelerated share repurchase. We elected settlement in cash and received $61 million from the financial institution, which was recorded as an offset to our cost of treasury stock. In October 2006, we entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $1.0 billion, accounted for as a cash flow hedge, to hedge interest rate fluctuations in anticipation of the issuance of the 5.875% Senior Notes due December 16, 2036. Upon issuance of the hedged debt in December 2006, we settled our forward starting interest rate swap agreement and recorded an $11 million decrease, net of income taxes, to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, which will be amortized to interest expense over the life of the related debt. In December 2006, we entered into a $3 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement with a financial institution pursuant to which we repurchased approximately 75 million shares of our common stock. Under the agreement, the financial institution purchased an equivalent number of shares of our common stock in the open market. The shares repurchased by us were subject to a future purchase price adjustment based upon the weighted average price of our common stock over an agreed period. In March 2007, we settled the accelerated share repurchase. We elected settlement in cash and received $36 million from the financial institution, which was recorded as an offset to our cost of treasury stock in fiscal 2007. 27  The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of January 28, 2007 (amounts in millions): Payments Due by Fiscal Year Contractual Obligations(1) Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total Debt(2) $ 19,358 $ 607 $ 3,224 $ 2,946 $ 12,581 Capital Lease Obligations(3) 1,323 78 157 160 928 Operating Leases 9,131 917 1,580 1,213 5,421 Subtotal $ 29,812 $ 1,602 $ 4,961 $ 4,319 $ 18,930 Amount of Commitment Expiration per Fiscal Year Commercial Commitments(4) Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Letters of Credit $ 1,238 $ 1,230 $ 8 $ $ Purchase Obligations(5) 2,741 1,379 1,336 22 4 Guarantees 72 72 Subtotal 4,051 2,681 1,344 22 4 Total $ 33,863 $ 4,283 $ 6,305 $ 4,341 $ 18,934 (1) Contractual obligations include Long Term Debt comprised primarily of $11 billion of Senior Notes further discussed in "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" and future minimum lease payments under capital and operating leases used in the normal course of business. (2) Excludes present value of capital lease obligations of $419 million. Includes $8.0 billion of interest payments and $69 million of unamortized discount. (3) Includes $904 million of imputed interest. (4) Commercial commitments include letters of credit from certain business transactions, purchase obligations and commitments to purchase store assets. We issue letters of credit for insurance programs, purchases of import merchandise inventories and construction contracts. Our purchase obligations consist of commitments for both merchandise and services. (5) Purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm commitments for inventory purchases, utility purchases, capital expenditures, software acquisition and license commitments and legally binding service contracts. Purchase orders that are not binding agreements are excluded from the table above. Additionally, we have included a commitment to purchase the underlying asset under an off balance sheet lease related to certain stores for $282 million during 2008. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Our exposure to market risk results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates. Although we have international operating entities, our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not significant to our financial condition and results of operations. Our primary objective for entering into derivative instruments is to manage our exposure to interest rates, as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate debt. As of January 28, 2007 we had, net of discounts, $10.9 billion of Senior Notes outstanding. The market values of the publicly traded Senior Notes as of January 28, 2007, were approximately $10.9 billion. Impact of Inflation, Deflation and Changing Prices We have experienced inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity products. During fiscal 2006, lumber prices decreased our comparable store sales by approximately 43 basis 28 points. We do not believe that changing prices for commodities have had a material effect on our Net Sales or results of operations. Although we cannot precisely determine the overall effect of inflation and deflation on operations, we do not believe inflation and deflation have had a material effect on our results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue, net of estimated returns, at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise or receives services. We estimate the liability for sales returns based on our historical return levels. We believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns. We have never recorded a significant adjustment to our estimated liability for sales returns. However, if these estimates are significantly below the actual amounts, our sales could be adversely impacted. When we receive payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed, the amount received is recorded as Deferred Revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets until the sale or service is complete. Merchandise Inventories Our Merchandise Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first in, first out) or market, with approximately 80% valued under the retail inventory method and the remainder under the cost method. Retailers like The Home Depot, with many different types of merchandise at low unit cost and a large number of transactions, frequently use the retail inventory method. Under the retail inventory method, Merchandise Inventories are stated at cost, which is determined by applying a cost to retail ratio to the ending retail value of inventories. As our inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, our inventory valued under the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market. We evaluate our inventory valued under the cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or market. The valuation allowance for Merchandise Inventories valued under the cost method was not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company as of the end of fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005. Independent physical inventory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in each store, distribution center and HD Supply location to ensure that amounts reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for Merchandise Inventories are properly stated. During the period between physical inventory counts in our stores, we accrue for estimated losses related to shrink on a store by store basis. Shrink (or in the case of excess inventory, "swell") is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory. Shrink may occur due to theft, loss, inaccurate records for the receipt of inventory or deterioration of goods, among other things. We estimate shrink as a percent of Net Sales using the average shrink results from the previous two physical inventories. The estimates are evaluated quarterly and adjusted based on recent shrink results and current trends in the business. Self Insurance We are self insured for certain losses related to general liability, product liability, automobile, workers compensation and medical claims. Our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. The estimated liability is not discounted and is established based 29 upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates, and is reviewed by management and third party actuaries on a quarterly basis to ensure that the liability is appropriate. While we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available, if actual trends, including the severity or frequency of claims, medical cost inflation, or fluctuations in premiums, differ from our estimates, our results of operations could be impacted. Vendor Allowances Vendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and advertising co op allowances for the promotion of vendors products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels. These vendor allowances are accrued as earned, with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases. We believe that our estimate of vendor allowances earned based on expected volume of purchases over the incentive period is an accurate reflection of the ultimate allowance to be received from our vendors. Volume rebates and advertising co op allowances earned are initially recorded as a reduction in Merchandise Inventories and a subsequent reduction in Cost of Sales when the related product is sold. Certain advertising co op allowances that are reimbursements of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, "Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements" ("SAB 108"). SAB 108 addresses the process of quantifying prior year financial statement misstatements and their impact on current year financial statements. The provisions of SAB 108 allow companies to report the cumulative effect of correcting immaterial prior year misstatements, based on the Companys historical method for evaluating misstatements, by adjusting the opening balance of retained earnings in the current year financial statements rather than amending previously filed reports. SAB 108 also requires disclosure of the nature and amount of each individual error being corrected, how the event arose and the fact that the errors are considered immaterial to the prior year financial statements. SAB 108 is effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006, and therefore was effective for The Home Depot in fiscal 2006. See Note 2 to our "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion. In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" ("FIN 48"). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax reporting by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 requires that companies recognize tax benefits in their financial statements for a tax position only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. Additionally, FIN 48 provides guidance on de recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, and will therefore be effective for The Home Depot in fiscal 2007. The cumulative impact of adopting FIN 48 in fiscal 2007 is not expected to have a material impact on the financial condition of the Company. Item 7A.
