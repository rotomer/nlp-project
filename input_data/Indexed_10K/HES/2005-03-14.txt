Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview The Corporation is a global integrated energy company that operates in two segments, exploration and production (E&P) and refining and marketing (R&M). The E&P segment explores for, produces and sells crude oil and natural gas. The R&M segment manufactures, purchases, trades and markets refined petroleum and other energy products. The Corporations goal for the E&P segment is to grow reserves and production profitably with its portfolio of development projects and to deliver exploration success. During 2002 and 2003, the Corporation reshaped its E&P asset portfolio by: Selling higher cost properties predominantly in the shallow water Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea for proceeds of $738 million. Exchanging interests in mature producing assets for increased interests in development stage assets in the joint development area of Malaysia and Thailand and deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Participating in two oil discoveries in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The asset sales and exchanges contributed significantly to the decline in production from 451,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2002 to 342,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2004. In 2005, the Corporation forecasts that crude oil and natural gas production will average 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In 2004, the Corporation continued to make progress in its development projects that are expected to provide significant new production in 2006 and 2007, which will more than offset natural declines in existing fields. Milestones accomplished on our development projects in 2004 were: In April, the Llano Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico commenced production. The Corporation has a 50% interest in this field and net production at year end is averaging approximately 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In August, the government of Equatorial Guinea approved the development plan for the Corporations Northern Block G fields, which is now called the Okume Complex. The Corporation anticipates first production in 2007. In August, the second phase of the project to redevelop the Gassi El Agreb fields in Algeria was approved, resulting in an increased investment commitment of approximately $400 million. This change reflects the Corporations success in the area. Since 2000, the Corporation has increased gross production from 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 55,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In December, the Corporation negotiated additional gas sales from Block A 18 in the Malaysia Thailand joint development area. The Corporation anticipates that this agreement will allow it to double proved reserves on the field over the next several years and contribute to future production growth. First sales of natural gas from this block under the original gas sales agreement began in 2005. In December, the Corporation approved the Ujung Pangkah development in Indonesia. Gas sales should commence by early 2007. In the United Kingdom, first production from the Clair Field commenced in 2005 and production from the Atlantic and Cromarty gas fields is expected to commence in 2006. Combined net production from these three fields is anticipated to be at an annualized rate of 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day when all three fields are onstream in 2006. During 2004, the Corporation drilled successful appraisal wells at the Shenzi prospect in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, at the Phu Horm Field onshore Thailand, and at Ujung Pangkah. In December, the Corporation announced a natural gas discovery at the Belud prospect offshore Malaysia. The Corporation has an inventory of exploration prospects and will drill several high impact wells in 2005. The Corporation has two exploration wells currently drilling in the Gulf of Mexico that will have estimated pre tax capitalized drilling costs of approximately $100 to $110 million upon completion. If either or both of these wells are unsuccessful, after tax first quarter 2005 earnings would be reduced by up to $70 million. 17 Table of Contents Proved reserves increased to 1.046 billion barrels of oil equivalent at year end 2004 from 1.035 billion barrels of oil equivalent at the end of 2003. The Corporations reserves included in this Form 10 K are calculated by an independent third party reserve engineer. See further discussion of managements governance over the estimation of oil and gas reserves in the Supplementary Oil and Gas Data on page 73. The strategic goals for R&M are to maximize returns from existing assets and generate free cash flow. The Corporation may grow the retail and energy marketing businesses opportunistically. During 2004 and 2003, the R&M segments results improved significantly, primarily due to higher refining margins. The HOVENSA and Port Reading refineries operated near maximum capacity for most of the year, enabling them to take full advantage of the strong margins. HOVENSAs capacity to process lower cost heavy crude oil enhanced profitability in 2004, due to a significant price differential between light and heavy crude oil. In 2004, the Corporation received a cash distribution of $88 million from HOVENSA. The HOVENSA fluid catalytic cracking unit was shutdown for approximately 30 days of planned maintenance in the first quarter of 2005. Planned maintenance of the fluid catalytic cracking unit at the Port Reading facility is underway and expected to last for approximately 30 days. The Corporations liquidity and financial position have improved significantly since year end 2002. At December 31, 2002, the Corporations debt was $5 billion and its debt to capitalization ratio was 54%. As of December 31, 2004, the Corporations debt has been reduced to $3.8 billion and the debt to capitalization ratio was 40.7%. Aggregate debt maturities through 2006 are $128 million. The Corporations cash balance at December 31, 2004 was $877 million. Capital expenditures were $1.5 billion in 2004, $1.4 billion in 2003 and $1.5 billion in 2002. Capital expenditures for 2005 are forecast to be $2.1 billion, with $2.0 billion dedicated to the exploration and production segment. This higher spending reflects the Corporations portfolio of organic growth projects and attractive investment opportunities. The Corporation has hedged approximately 60% of its 2005 worldwide crude oil production to underpin its cash flows to fund development projects. See further discussion on hedging starting on page 34. Consolidated Results of Operations Net income in 2004 was $977 million compared with net income of $643 million in 2003 and a net loss of $218 million in 2002, including impairments. Included in these amounts was income from discontinued operations of $7 million in 2004, $169 million in 2003 and $27 million in 2002. See the following page for a table of items affecting the comparability of earnings between periods. The after tax results by major operating activity for 2004, 2003 and 2002 are summarized below: 2004 2003 2002 (Millions of dollars, except per share data) Exploration and production $ 755 $ 414 $ (102 ) Refining and marketing 451 327 85 Corporate (85 ) (101 ) (63 ) Interest expense (151 ) (173 ) (165 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations 970 467 (245 ) Discontinued operations Net gains from asset sales 116 Income from operations 7 53 27 Income from cumulative effect of accounting change 7 Net income (loss) $ 977 $ 643 $ (218 ) Income (loss) per share from continuing operations diluted $ 9.50 $ 5.17 $ (2.78 ) Net income (loss) per share diluted $ 9.57 $ 7.11 $ (2.48 ) 18 Table of Contents In the discussion that follows, the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after tax basis. Management reviews segment earnings on an after tax basis and uses after tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings. Management believes that after tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre tax amount. After tax amounts are determined by applying the appropriate income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre tax amounts. The following items, on an after tax basis, are included in income from continuing operations for the years 2004, 2003 and 2002: 2004 2003 2002 (Millions of dollars) Net gains from asset sales $ 54 $ 11 $ 100 Income tax adjustments 32 30 (43 ) Corporate insurance accrual (13 ) LIFO inventory liquidation 12 Accrued severance and office costs (9 ) (32 ) Premiums on bond repurchases (34 ) (6 ) Asset impairments (737 ) Reduction in carrying value of refining and marketing intangible assets and severance (22 ) $ 76 $ (25 ) $ (708 ) The items in the table above are explained on pages 21 through 24. The pre tax amounts are shown on pages 21, 23 and 24. Comparison of Results Exploration and Production: After considering the exploration and production items in the preceding table, the remaining changes in exploration and production earnings are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices, production volumes and operating costs and exploration expenses, as discussed below. Selling prices: Higher average selling prices of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas increased exploration and production revenues from continuing operations by approximately $400 million in 2004 compared with 2003. In 2003, the change in average selling prices increased revenues by approximately $170 million compared with 2002. The Corporations average selling prices from continuing operations, including the effects of hedging, were as follows: 2004 2003 2002 Crude oil (per barrel) United States $ 27.42 $ 24.23 $ 24.04 Foreign 26.40 24.93 24.69 Natural gas liquids (per barrel) United States 29.50 23.74 16.12 Foreign 30.02 24.09 19.09 Natural gas (per Mcf) United States 5.18 4.02 3.72 Foreign 3.94 3.01 2.26 19 Table of Contents The after tax impacts of crude oil and U.S. natural gas hedges reduced earnings by $583 million ($935 million before income taxes) in 2004 and $260 million ($418 million before income taxes) in 2003 compared with an increase of $48 million ($82 million before income taxes) in 2002. The Corporation has after tax, deferred hedge losses of $875 million recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income at December 31, 2004. Of this amount, $680 million is unrealized and relates to open hedge positions. The remaining $195 million deferred loss is realized and relates to closed hedge positions. The deferred realized loss will be recognized in earnings as the underlying barrels are sold in 2005. The Corporation has open hedge positions equal to 60% of its estimated worldwide crude oil production for 2005. The average price per barrel for open United States crude oil hedges is $33.06. The average price for open foreign crude oil hedges is $31.17. Approximately 20% of the Corporations hedges are WTI related and the remainder are Brent. In addition to the gains or losses on these open hedge positions, approximately $52 million of the $195 million deferred realized loss will reduce first quarter 2005 earnings and the remaining deferred realized loss will be recognized in earnings over the balance of the year. The Corporation also has approximately 24,000 barrels per day of Brent related production hedged from 2006 to 2012. The average price of these hedge positions is $26.20 per barrel. There were no natural gas hedges outstanding at December 31, 2004. Production and sales volumes: The Corporations crude oil and natural gas production, on a barrel of oil equivalent basis, was 342,000 barrels per day in 2004, 373,000 barrels per day in 2003 and 451,000 barrels per day in 2002. Approximately 50% of the production declines in 2004 and 2003 resulted from sales and exchanges of oil and gas producing properties. The remainder resulted principally from natural decline, and in 2003 compared with 2002, disappointing results from fields acquired in the United States in 2001 and reduced production from the Ceiba Field in Equatorial Guinea. The Corporation anticipates that its 2005 production, including anticipated production from Libya, will be approximately 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. See page 27 for the current status of the discussions on the Corporations return to Libya. The Corporations net daily worldwide production was as follows: 2004 2003 2002 Crude oil (thousands of barrels per day) United States 44 44 54 Foreign 182 195 250 Total 226 239 304 Natural gas liquids (thousands of barrels per day) United States 12 11 12 Foreign 8 9 9 Total 20 20 21 Natural gas (thousands of Mcf per day) United States 171 253 373 Foreign 404 430 381 Total 575 683 754 Barrels of oil equivalent* (thousands of barrels per day) 342 373 451 Barrels of oil equivalent production included above related to discontinued operations 13 51 * Reflects natural gas production converted on the basis of relative energy content (six Mcf equals one barrel). 20 Table of Contents Decreased sales volumes resulted in lower revenue from continuing operations of approximately $75 million in 2004 compared with 2003 and lower revenue of approximately $425 million in 2003 compared with 2002. Operating costs and exploration expenses: Operating costs and exploration expenses from continuing operations decreased by approximately $115 million in 2004 compared with 2003 and increased by $70 million in 2003 compared with 2002. Depreciation, depletion and amortization charges were lower in 2004 and 2003 principally reflecting decreased production volumes. Exploration expenses were lower in 2004 as a result of lower dry hole costs. Exploration expenses were higher in 2003, reflecting increased activity in the United States and Equatorial Guinea, as well as additional lease cost amortization. Production expenses increased in 2004 and 2003 primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar which increased costs incurred in foreign currencies. In addition, higher selling prices of crude oil and natural gas increased the costs of production taxes, transportation, maintenance and fuel. Unit costs per barrel totaled $17.26 in 2004, $17.32 in 2003 and $15.11 in 2002. Unit cost per barrel includes production expense, depreciation, depletion and amortization, exploration expense and administrative costs. Other: After tax foreign currency gains amounted to $6 million ($29 million before income taxes) in 2004, compared with a loss of $22 million ($4 million before income taxes) in 2003 and income of $6 million ($26 million before income taxes) in 2002. Excluding items in the following table, the effective income tax rate for exploration and production operations in 2004 was 46%. This includes income taxes paid in jurisdictions with rates in excess of the United States statutory rate, such as the United Kingdom and Norway. It also reflects an income tax deduction for the Corporations hedging results at the U.S. statutory rate. Each of these factors increases the Corporations overall exploration and production effective income tax rate. The effective income tax rate for exploration and production operations in 2005 is expected to be in the range of 45% to 49%. Assuming agreements are finalized and the Corporation returns to Libya, the exploration and production effective income tax rate will exceed the range above. Exploration and production earnings from continuing operations include the following items: After Income Taxes 2004 2003 2002 (Millions of dollars) Gains from asset sales $ 54 $ 31 $ 34 Income tax adjustments 19 30 (43 ) Accrued severance and office costs (9 ) (32 ) Asset impairments (737 ) $ 64 $ 29 $ (746 ) Before Income Taxes 2004 2003 2002 (Millions of dollars) Gains from asset sales $ 55 $ 47 $ 41 Accrued severance and office costs (15 ) (53 ) Asset impairments (1,024 ) $ 40 $ (6 ) $ (983 ) 21 Table of Contents 2004: The Corporation recognized gains on the sales of an office building in Aberdeen, Scotland, a non producing property in Malaysia and two mature Gulf of Mexico properties. It also recorded foreign income tax benefits resulting from a change in tax law and a tax settlement. The Corporation accrued an additional amount for severance and costs for vacated office space during 2004. Additional accruals for vacated office space of approximately $35 million before income taxes are anticipated in 2005. 2003: The Corporation recorded an after tax charge of $32 million for accrued severance in the United States and United Kingdom and a reduction of leased office space in London. The pre tax amount of this charge was $53 million, of which $32 million relates to vacated office space. The remainder of $21 million relates to severance for positions that were eliminated in London, Aberdeen and Houston. The Corporation recorded an income tax benefit reflecting the recognition for United States income tax purposes of certain prior year foreign exploration expenses. The gain from asset sale in 2003 reflects the sale of the Corporations 1.5% interest in the Trans Alaska Pipeline System. 2002: Exploration and production earnings included after tax asset impairments of $737 million, $530 million of which related to the Ceiba Field in Equatorial Guinea. The pre tax amount of the Ceiba Field impairment was $706 million. The charge resulted from a 12% reduction in the estimated total field reserves that will ultimately be produced from the field, as well as higher anticipated development costs needed to produce the remaining reserves at lower production rates over a longer period. The reduction in estimated recoverable reserves was attributable to disappointing 2002 year end drilling results on the western flank of the field. The reduction in probable reserves and higher estimated future development costs resulted in an asset impairment because projected cash flows were less than the book value of the field, which includes allocated purchase price from the Triton acquisition. The Corporation also recorded an after tax impairment charge of $207 million to reduce the carrying value of oil and gas properties located primarily in the Main Pass/ Breton Sound area of the Gulf of Mexico. Most of these properties were obtained in the 2001 LLOG acquisition and consisted of producing oil and gas fields with proved and probable reserves and exploration acreage. This charge principally reflects reduced reserve estimates on these fields resulting from unfavorable production performance. The fair values of producing properties were determined by using discounted cash flows. Exploration properties were evaluated by using results of drilling and production data from nearby fields and seismic data for these and other properties in the area. During 2002, the United Kingdom government enacted a 10% supplementary tax on profits from oil and gas production. A one time charge of $43 million was recorded to increase the existing United Kingdom deferred tax liability on the balance sheet. The gain on asset sales in 2002 reflected the disposal of oil and gas producing properties in the United States, United Kingdom and Azerbaijan, and the Corporations energy marketing business in the United Kingdom. The Corporations future exploration and production earnings may be impacted by external factors, such as volatility in the selling prices of crude oil and natural gas, reserve and production changes and changes in tax rates. Refining and Marketing: Earnings from refining and marketing activities amounted to $451 million in 2004, $327 million in 2003 and $85 million in 2002. The Corporations downstream operations include HOVENSA L.L.C. (HOVENSA), a 50% owned refining joint venture with a subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) that is accounted for using the equity method. Additional refining and marketing activities include a fluid catalytic cracking facility in Port Reading, New Jersey, as well as retail gasoline stations, energy marketing and trading operations. In 2004, the Corporation invested in a 50% joint venture, Hess LNG L.L.C., to pursue investments in liquified natural gas terminals and related supply, trading and marketing opportunities. HOVENSA: The Corporations share of HOVENSAs income was $244 million in 2004, compared with income of $117 million in 2003 and a loss of $47 million in 2002. The increases in 2004 and 2003 were 22 Table of Contents due primarily to higher refining margins compared with prior years. HOVENSAs total crude runs amounted to 484,000 barrels per day in 2004, 440,000 barrels per day in 2003 and 361,000 barrels per day in 2002. In late 2002 and early 2003, crude oil deliveries to HOVENSA were interrupted due to political disturbances in Venezuela. For the remainder of 2003 and in 2004, HOVENSA received contracted quantities of crude oil from PDVSA. The fluid catalytic cracking unit at HOVENSA operated at 139,000, 142,000 and 116,000 barrels per day in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The coking unit at HOVENSA commenced production in August 2002. The unit operated at the rate of 55,000 barrels per day in 2004 and 53,000 barrels per day in 2003. Planned maintenance of the fluid catalytic cracking unit at HOVENSA was completed during the first quarter of 2005. Earnings from refining and marketing activities also include interest income on the note received from PDVSA at the formation of the joint venture. Interest on the PDVSA note amounted to $25 million in 2004, $30 million in 2003 and $35 million in 2002. Interest income is reflected in non operating income in the income statement. In 2004, the Corporation recorded deferred income tax expense of $32 million in refining and marketing results relating to HOVENSAs earnings and interest on the PDVSA note. In 2005, the Corporation expects that deferred income taxes will be recorded at the Virgin Islands statutory rate of 38.5%. At December 31, 2004, the Corporation has approximately $190 million of net operating loss carryforwards available to offset its share of future HOVENSA taxable income. Retail, Energy Marketing and Other: Retail gasoline operations in 2004 were profitable but less so than in 2003, reflecting lower margins. Earnings from retail gasoline operations were higher in 2003 compared with 2002, reflecting higher margins. Energy marketing earnings were lower in 2004 compared with 2003 because of lower margins. Energy marketing activities had higher earnings in 2003, reflecting increased margins and sales volumes in the early part of the year resulting from the cold winter. Results of the Port Reading refining facility improved in 2004 reflecting higher margins than in 2003, which was also an improvement over 2002 results. Total refined product sales volumes were 428,000 barrels per day in 2004, 419,000 barrels per day in 2003 and 383,000 barrels per day in 2002. Planned maintenance at the Port Reading fluid catalytic cracking unit is underway in the first quarter of 2005. The Corporation has a 50% voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades energy commodities and energy derivatives. The Corporation also takes trading positions for its own account. The Corporations after tax results from trading activities, including its share of the earnings of the trading partnership amounted to income of $37 million in 2004, $17 million in 2003 and $3 million in 2002. Before income taxes, the trading income was $72 million in 2004, $30 million in 2003 and $6 million in 2002. Marketing expenses increased in 2004 compared with 2003 reflecting higher expenses from retail operations and the trading partnership. Refining and marketing earnings include the following items: After Income Taxes 2004 2003 2002 (Millions of dollars) LIFO inventory liquidation $ 12 $ $ Gain (loss) from asset sales (20 ) 67 Reduction in carrying value of intangible assets (14 ) Severance accrual (8 ) $ 12 $ (20 ) $ 45 23 Table of Contents Before Income Taxes 2004 2003 2002 (Millions of dollars) LIFO inventory liquidation $ 20 $ $ Gain (loss) from asset sales (9 ) 102 Reduction in carrying value of intangible assets (22 ) Severance accrual (13 ) $ 20 $ (9 ) $ 67 In 2004, refining and marketing results include income of $12 million from the liquidation of LIFO inventories. In 2003, refining and marketing earnings were reduced by a loss from the sale of the Corporations interest in a shipping joint venture. In 2002, the Corporation completed the sale of six United States flag vessels for $161 million in cash and a note for $29 million. The sale resulted in a net gain of $67 million. In connection with this sale, the Corporation agreed to support the buyers charter rate on these vessels for up to five years. The support agreement requires that if the actual contracted rate for the charter of a vessel is less than the stipulated support rate in the agreement, the Corporation will pay to the buyer the difference between the contracted rate and the stipulated rate. At January 1, 2004, the charter support reserve was $32 million. During 2004, the Corporation made net payments of $4 million for charter support. Based on contractual long term charters and estimates of future charter rates, the Corporation lowered the estimated charter support reserve by $18 million in 2004. The balance in this reserve at December 31, 2004 was $10 million. In 2002, the Corporation recorded a charge for the write off of intangible assets in its U.S. energy marketing business. In addition, severance was recorded for cost reduction initiatives in refining and marketing, principally energy marketing. Refining and marketing earnings will likely continue to be volatile reflecting competitive industry conditions and supply and demand factors, including the effects of weather. Corporate: After tax corporate expenses amounted to $85 million in 2004, $101 million in 2003 and $63 million in 2002. The 2004 corporate expenses include $13 million ($20 million before income taxes) of insurance costs related to retrospective premium increases. In addition, corporate results include an income tax benefit of $13 million from the settlement of a federal tax audit. The 2003 amount includes expenses of $34 million for premiums paid on the repurchase of bonds compared with $6 million in 2002. The pre tax amounts of the bond repurchase premiums were $58 million in 2003 and $15 million in 2002 and are recorded in non operating income (expense) in the income statement. Recurring after tax corporate expenses for 2005 are estimated to be in the range of $90 to $100 million. Interest: After tax interest expense in 2004, 2003 and 2002 was as follows: 2004 2003 2002 (Millions of dollars) Total interest incurred $ 295 $ 334 $ 357 Less capitalized interest 54 41 101 Interest expense before income taxes 241 293 256 Less income taxes 90 120 91 After tax interest expense $ 151 $ 173 $ 165 Interest incurred decreased in 2004 and 2003 reflecting lower average outstanding debt. After tax interest expense in 2005 is anticipated to be lower than the 2004 level because of higher estimated capitalized interest. Discontinued Operations: In 2003, the Corporation exchanged its crude oil producing properties in Colombia (acquired in 2001 as part of the Triton acquisition), plus $10 million in cash, for an additional 25% interest in Block A 18 in the joint development area of Malaysia and Thailand (JDA). The exchange resulted 24 Table of Contents in an after tax charge to income of $47 million ($51 million before income taxes). The after tax loss on this exchange included a $43 million adjustment of the book value of the Colombian assets to fair value. The loss also included $17 million from the recognition in earnings of the value of related hedge contracts at the time of the exchange. These items were partially offset by after tax earnings in Colombia prior to the exchange of $13 million. Income from discontinued operations of $7 million in 2004 reflects the settlement of a previously accrued contingency relating to the Colombian asset exchange. In 2003, the Corporation also sold Gulf of Mexico shelf properties, the Jabung Field in Indonesia and several small United Kingdom fields for $445 million. The after tax gain from these asset sales of $176 million ($248 million before income taxes) was included in discontinued operations. Discontinued operations in 2003 also included $40 million of income from operations prior to the sales of these assets. Change in Accounting Principle: The Corporation adopted FAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, effective January 1, 2003. A net after tax gain of $7 million resulting from the cumulative effect of this accounting change was recorded at the beginning of 2003. At the date of adoption, a liability of $556 million representing the estimated fair value of the Corporations required dismantlement obligations was recorded on the balance sheet. In addition, a dismantlement asset of $311 million was recorded, as well as accumulated depreciation of $203 million. Sales and Other Operating Revenues: In 2004, sales and other operating revenues totaled $16,733 million, an increase of 17% compared with 2003. This increase principally reflects higher selling prices and sales volumes of refined products, partially offset by decreased sales of purchased natural gas in energy marketing. Sales and other operating revenues increased by 24% in 2003 compared with 2002, reflecting increased sales volumes and selling prices of refined products and the higher selling price of purchased natural gas in energy marketing activities. The change in cost of goods sold in each year reflects the change in sales volumes and prices of refined products and purchased natural gas. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview: Cash flows from operating activities, including changes in operating assets and liabilities, totaled $1,903 million in 2004. During the year, the Corporation repaid $106 million of debt, which decreased its debt to capitalization ratio to 40.7% at December 31, 2004 from 42.5% at December 31, 2003. Total debt was $3,835 million at December 31, 2004 and $3,941 million at December 31, 2003. The Corporation has debt maturities of $128 million during the next two years. In 2004, the Corporation entered into a new $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, expiring in 2009. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2004 totaled $877 million, an increase of $359 million for the year. Cash Flows from Operating Activities: Net cash provided by operating activities, including changes in operating assets and liabilities, totaled $1,903 million in 2004, $1,581 million in 2003 and $1,965 million in 2002. The increased cash flows in 2004 resulted primarily from higher earnings and the timing of cash flows associated with changes in operating assets and liabilities. In 2004, the Corporation also received a cash distribution of $88 million from HOVENSA. Lower cash flows in 2003 were primarily due to reduced exploration and production sales volumes. Changes in operating assets and liabilities increased cash flow by $230 million in 2004 and decreased cash flow by $120 million in 2003. 25 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Investing Activities: The following table summarizes the Corporations capital expenditures in 2004, 2003 and 2002: 2004 2003 2002 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and production Exploration $ 230 $ 196 $ 239 Production and development 1,204 1,067 1,095 Acquisitions 23 70 1,434 1,286 1,404 Refining and marketing Operations 67 72 83 Acquisitions 20 47 87 72 130 Total $ 1,521 $ 1,358 $ 1,534 Proceeds from asset sales in 2004 totaled $57 million. In 2003, the Corporation sold certain producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico Shelf, the Jabung Field in Indonesia, several small United Kingdom fields and an interest in a shipping joint venture. Proceeds from asset sales totaled $545 million in 2003. In addition, the Corporation completed several asset exchanges. The Corporation swapped mature, high cost assets in Colombia for an additional 25% interest in long lived natural gas reserves in Block A 18 in the joint development area of Malaysia and Thailand, bringing the Corporations interest in the area to 50%. The Corporation exchanged its 25% equity investment in Premier Oil plc for a 23% interest in Natuna Sea Block A in Indonesia, plus approximately $10 million in cash. In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Corporation exchanged 14% interests in the Scott and Telford fields in the United Kingdom for an additional 22.5% interest in the Llano Field in the Gulf of Mexico and $17 million in cash. This exchange increased the Corporations working interest in the Llano Field to 50% and decreased its interest in the Scott Field to 21% and the Telford Field to 17%. The net production from fields sold or exchanged in 2003 at the time of disposition was approximately 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In 2002, the Corporation sold six United States Flag vessels, its energy marketing business in the United Kingdom and several small oil and gas fields for net proceeds of $412 million. Cash Flows from Financing Activities: The Corporation reduced debt by $106 million in 2004, $1,051 million in 2003 and $673 million in 2002. The debt reduction in 2004 was due to cash flow from operations. In 2003, debt was reduced by proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock and from asset sales, as well as cash flow from operations. In 2003, the Corporation issued 13,500,000 shares of mandatory convertible preferred stock for net proceeds of $653 million. In 2004, the Corporation received proceeds from the exercise of stock options totaling $90 million. Dividends paid were $157 million in 2004, $108 million in 2003 and $107 million in 2002. The increase in 2004 was due to dividends on the 7% preferred stock issued in the fourth quarter of 2003. Future Capital Requirements and Resources: Capital expenditures in 2005 are expected to be approximately $2.1 billion, including an estimated amount for re entering Libya. The Corporation anticipates that these expenditures will be funded by available cash and cash flow from operations, however, revolving credit facilities are available, if necessary. With higher crude oil prices, the Corporations collateral requirements under certain contracts with hedging and trading counterparties have increased. Outstanding letters of credit were $1,487 million at December 31, 2004, including $570 million drawn against the Corporations $2.5 billion syndicated, revolving credit facility, compared with outstanding letters of credit of $229 million at December 31, 2003. At December 31, 2004, the Corporation has $1,930 million available under its committed revolving credit 26 Table of Contents agreement and has additional unused lines of credit of approximately $150 million, primarily for letters of credit, under uncommitted arrangements with banks. The Corporation also has a shelf registration under which it may issue $825 million of additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or preferred stock. Loan agreement covenants allow the Corporation to borrow an additional $5.5 billion for the construction or acquisition of assets at December 31, 2004. At year end, the maximum amount of dividends or stock repurchases that can be paid from borrowings under the loan agreements is $2.0 billion. The Corporations aggregate maturities of long term debt total $128 million over the next two years. Based on current estimates of production, capital expenditures and other factors, and assuming West Texas Intermediate oil prices average $35 per barrel and United States natural gas prices average $6 per Mcf, the Corporation anticipates it will fund its 2005 operations, including capital expenditures, dividends and required debt repayments, with existing cash on hand and cash flow from operations. If necessary, additional financing is available from its revolving credit facility and shelf registration. Libya: Prior to June 30, 1986, the Corporation had extensive exploration and production operations in Libya; however, U.S. government sanctions required suspension of participation in these operations. The Corporation wrote off the book value of its Libyan assets in connection with the cessation of operations. During 2004, the Corporation received U.S. government authorization to negotiate and execute an agreement with the government of Libya that would define the terms for resuming active participation in the Libyan properties. The U.S. Government has lifted most of the sanctions imposed on Libya and has rescinded the Libya portions of the Iran Libya Sanctions Act of 1976. As a result, the Corporation and its partners will be able to resume operations in Libya if they are able to reach a successful conclusion to ongoing commercial negotiations. Repatriation Provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004: On October 22, 2004, the President signed the American Jobs Creation Act (the Act) that effectively provides for a one time reduction of the income tax rate to 5.25% on eligible dividends from foreign subsidiaries to a U.S. parent. Subsequent to December 31, 2004, the Corporation decided to repatriate approximately $1.3 billion of unremitted foreign earnings. As a result, the Corporation expects to record a tax provision of approximately $41 million in the first quarter of 2005. Had the additional taxes been recorded at the end of 2004, net income would have been $936 million ($9.93 per share basic and $9.17 per share diluted). The Corporation is reviewing the possibility of additional repatriations during 2005. The maximum additional amount that the Corporation could repatriate under the Act is approximately $600 million. The Corporation estimates that an additional tax provision of up to $32 million would be recorded, depending on the incremental amount distributed, if any. Credit Ratings: In 2004, two credit rating agencies downgraded their ratings of the Corporations debt. One of the revised ratings was below investment grade. If another rating agency were to reduce its credit rating below investment grade, the Corporation would have to comply with a more stringent financial covenant contained in its revolving credit facility. In addition, the incremental margin requirements with hedging and trading counterparties at December 31, 2004 would be approximately $23 million. Contractual Obligations and Contingencies: Following is a table showing aggregated information about certain contractual obligations at December 31, 2004: Payments Due by Period 2006 and 2008 and Total 2005 2007 2009 Thereafter (Millions of dollars) Long term debt $ 3,835 $ 50 $ 270 $ 467 $ 3,048 Operating leases 1,445 79 157 157 1,052 Purchase obligations Supply commitments 14,435 4,794 4,850 4,791 * Capital expenditures 1,374 932 409 33 Operating expenses 426 220 131 69 6 Other long term liabilities 199 58 72 36 33 * The Corporation intends to continue purchasing refined product supply from HOVENSA. Current purchases amount to approximately $2.4 billion annually. 27 Table of Contents In the preceding table, the Corporations supply commitments include its estimated purchases of 50% of HOVENSAs production of refined products, after anticipated sales by HOVENSA to unaffiliated parties. Also included are normal term purchase agreements at market prices for additional gasoline necessary to supply the Corporations retail marketing system and feedstocks for the Port Reading refining facility. In addition, the Corporation has commitments to purchase natural gas for use in supplying contracted customers in its energy marketing business. These commitments were computed based on year end market prices. The table also reflects that portion of the Corporations planned capital expenditures that are contractually committed at December 31. The Corporations 2005 capital expenditures are estimated to be approximately $2.1 billion. Obligations for operating expenses include commitments for transportation, seismic purchases, oil and gas production expenses and other normal business expenses. Other long term liabilities reflect contractually committed obligations on the balance sheet at December 31, including minimum pension plan funding requirements. In connection with the sale of six vessels in 2002, the Corporation agreed to support the buyers charter rate on these vessels for up to five years. The support agreement requires that if the actual contracted rate for the charter of a vessel is less than the stipulated support rate in the agreement, the Corporation will pay to the buyer the difference between the contracted rate and the stipulated rate. The balance in the charter support reserve at December 31, 2004 was $10 million. The Corporation has a contingent purchase obligation to acquire the remaining 50% interest in a retail marketing and gasoline station joint venture for approximately $90 million. The Corporation guarantees the payment of up to 50% of HOVENSAs crude oil purchases from suppliers other than PDVSA. The amount of the Corporations guarantee fluctuates based on the volume of crude oil purchased and related prices and at December 31, 2004 amounted to $97 million. In addition, the Corporation has agreed to provide funding up to a maximum of $40 million to the extent HOVENSA does not have funds to meet its senior debt obligations. At December 31, the Corporation has $1,415 million of letters of credit principally relating to accrued liabilities with hedging and trading counterparties recorded on its balance sheet. In addition, the Corporation is contingently liable under letters of credit and under guarantees of the debt of other entities directly related to its business, as follows: Total (Millions of dollars) Letters of credit $ 72 Guarantees 237 * $ 309 * Includes $40 million HOVENSA debt and $97 million crude oil purchase guarantees discussed above. The remainder relates principally to loan guarantees $55 million for a natural gas pipeline in which the Corporation owns a 5% interest and $45 million for an oil pipeline in which the Corporation owns a 2.36% interest. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements: The Corporation has leveraged lease financings not included in its balance sheet, primarily related to retail gasoline stations that the Corporation operates. The net present value of these financings is $467 million at December 31, 2004 compared with $462 million at December 31, 2003. The Corporations December 31, 2004 debt to capitalization ratio would increase from 40.7% to 43.5% if the lease financings were included as debt. See also Contractual Obligations and Contingencies above, Note 5, Refining Joint Venture, and Note 16, Guarantees and Contingencies, in the financial statements. 28 Table of Contents Foreign Operations: The Corporation conducts exploration and production activities in many foreign countries, including the United Kingdom, Norway, Denmark, Gabon, Indonesia, Thailand, Azerbaijan, Algeria, Malaysia and Equatorial Guinea. Therefore, the Corporation is subject to the risks associated with foreign operations. These exposures include political risk (including tax law changes) and currency risk. The effects of these events are accounted for when they occur and generally have not been material to the Corporations liquidity or financial position. HOVENSA L.L.C., owned 50% by the Corporation and 50% by Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), owns and operates a refinery in the Virgin Islands. Although there have in the past been political disruptions in Venezuela that reduced the availability of Venezuelan crude oil used in refining operations, these disruptions did not have a material adverse effect on the Corporations financial position. The Corporation also has a note receivable of $273 million at December 31, 2004 from a subsidiary of PDVSA. The Corporation anticipates collection of the remaining balance. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities on the Corporations balance sheet and revenues and expenses on the income statement. The accounting methods used can affect net income, stockholders equity and various financial statement ratios. However, the Corporations accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity. Accounting for Exploration and Development Costs: Oil and gas exploration and production activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses, brokers fees and other related costs, are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are capitalized. The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found. In an area requiring a major capital expenditure before production can begin, an exploration well is carried as an asset if sufficient reserves are discovered to justify its completion as a production well, and additional exploration drilling is underway or firmly planned. The Corporation does not capitalize the cost of other exploratory wells for more than one year unless proved reserves are found. Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves: The determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities. The estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations, undeveloped leasehold impairments and the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties, wells and equipment. Reductions in reserve estimates may result in the need for increased depreciation or impairments of proved properties and related assets. The Corporations oil and gas reserves are calculated in accordance with SEC regulations and interpretations and the requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board. For reserves to be booked as proved they must be commercially producible, government approvals must be obtained and depending on the amount of the project cost, senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project. The Corporations oil and gas reserve estimation and reporting process involves an annual independent third party reserve determination as well as internal technical appraisals of reserves. The Corporation maintains its own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties. The Corporations technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells, performance reviews, new technical data and other studies. To provide consistency throughout the Corporation, standard reserve estimation guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and approval practices are used. The internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management reviews the estimates. The oil and gas reserve estimates reported in the Supplementary Oil and Gas Data in accordance with FAS No. 69 are determined independently by the consulting firm of DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&M) and are consistent with internal estimates. Annually, the Corporation provides D&M with engineering, geological and geophysical data, actual production histories and other information necessary for the reserve 29 Table of Contents determination. The Corporations and D&Ms technical staffs meet to review and discuss the information provided. Senior management and the Board of Directors review the final reserve estimates issued by D&M. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Goodwill: As explained below there are significant differences in the way long lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing. The Corporation reviews long lived assets, including oil and gas fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered. Long lived assets are tested at the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable and are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying amounts of the long lived assets are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted future net cash flow estimates, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows. In the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future net cash flows is based on managements best estimate of future prices, which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices, applied to projected production volumes of individual fields and discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks involved. The projected production volumes represent reserves, including probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures. The production volumes, prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information. Oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, since the standardized measure requires the use of actual prices on the last day of the year. The Corporations impairment tests of long lived exploration and production producing assets are based on its best estimates of future production volumes (including recovery factors), selling prices, operating and capital costs and the timing of future production, which are updated each time an impairment test is performed. In 2002, the Corporation recorded impairments of the Ceiba Field and LLOG properties that were required primarily because of reduced estimates of oil and gas production volumes and, in the case of Ceiba, anticipated additional development costs. The impairment charges did not result from changes in the other factors. The change in the estimated timing of production on the Ceiba Field did not significantly affect the undiscounted future cash flows, but did significantly reduce the fair value of the field determined by discounted cash flows. The Corporation could have additional impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields were reduced. Significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas selling prices could also result in asset impairments. The Corporation recorded $977 million of goodwill in connection with the purchase of Triton Energy Limited in 2001. Factors contributing to the recognition of goodwill included the strategic value of expanding global operations to access new growth areas outside of the United States and the North Sea, obtaining critical mass in Africa and Southeast Asia, and synergies, including cost savings, improved processes and portfolio high grading opportunities. In accordance with FAS No. 142, goodwill is no longer amortized but must be tested for impairment annually. FAS No. 142 requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at a reporting unit level. The reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed. A reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment. A component is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. However, two or more components of an operating segment shall be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. An operating segment shall be deemed a reporting unit if all of its components are economically similar. Within the Corporations exploration and production operating segment there are currently two components: (1) Americas and West Africa and (2) Europe, North Africa and Asia. Each component has a manager who reports to the segment manager. The Corporation has determined the components have similar economic characteristics and, therefore, has aggregated the components into a single reporting unit the exploration and production operating segment. As a result, goodwill has been assigned to the exploration and production operating segment. If the Corporation reorganized its exploration and production business such 30 Table of Contents that there was more than one operating segment, or its components were no longer economically similar, goodwill would be assigned to two or more reporting units. The goodwill would be allocated to any new reporting units using a relative fair value approach in accordance with FAS No. 142. Goodwill impairment testing for lower level reporting units could result in the recognition of an impairment that would not otherwise be recognized at the current higher level of aggregation. The Corporation expects that the benefits of goodwill will be recovered through the operation of the exploration and production segment as a whole and it evaluated the following characteristics in determining that the components are economically similar: The Corporation operates its exploration and production segment as a single, global business. Each component produces oil and gas. The exploration and production processes are similar in each component. The methods used by each component to market and distribute oil and gas are similar. Customers of each component are similar. The components share resources and are supported by a worldwide exploration team and a shared services organization. The Corporations fair value estimate of the exploration and production segment is the sum of: (1) the discounted anticipated cash flows of producing assets and known developments, (2) the expected risked present value of exploration assets, and (3) an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential synergies including cost savings, access to new business opportunities, enterprise control, improved processes and increased market share. The Corporation also considers the relative market valuation of similar exploration and production companies. The determination of the fair value of the exploration and production operating segment depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves, future prices, timing of future net cash flows and market premiums. Significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of the exploration and production operating segment that could result in an impairment of goodwill. In addition, changes in management structure or sales or dispositions of a portion of the exploration and production segment may result in goodwill impairment. Because there are significant differences in the way long lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing, there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the $977 million of goodwill assigned to the exploration and production segment. In 2002, the Corporation recognized asset impairments because reduced estimates of oil and gas production volumes caused the expected undiscounted cash flows of the assets to be lower than the asset carrying amounts. No impairment of goodwill existed because the fair value of the overall exploration and production operating segment continued to exceed its recorded book value. Segments: The Corporation has two operating segments, exploration and production, and refining and marketing. Management has determined that these are its operating segments because, in accordance with FAS No. 131, these are the segments of the Corporation (i) that engage in business activities from which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred, (ii) whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Corporations chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance and (iii) for which discrete financial information is available. The Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation, is the chief operating decision maker (CODM) as defined in FAS No. 131, because he is responsible for performing the functions within the Corporation of allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, the Corporations operating segments. The CODM uses only the operating results of each segment as a whole to make decisions about resources to be allocated to each segment and to assess the segment performance. The CODM manages each segment globally and does not regularly review the operating results of any component (e.g., geographic area) or asset within each 31 Table of Contents segment or any such information by geographical location, oil and gas property or project, subsidiary or division, to make decisions about resources to be allocated or to assess performance. While the CODM does review and approve initial corporate funding for a new project using information about the project, he does not review subsequent operating results by project after the initial funding. Each operating segment has one manager. The segment managers are responsible for allocating resources within the segments, reviewing financial results of components within the segments, and assessing the performance of the components. The CODM evaluates the performance of the segment managers based on performance metrics related to each managers operating segment as a whole. The Board of Directors of the Corporation does not receive more detailed information than that used by the CODM to operate and manage the Corporation. Hedging: The Corporation may use futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination, to reduce the effects of fluctuations in crude oil, natural gas and refined product selling prices. Related hedge gains or losses are an integral part of the selling or purchase prices. Generally, these derivatives are designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges), and the changes in fair value are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. These transactions meet the requirements for hedge accounting, including correlation. The Corporation reclassifies hedging gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings at the time the hedged transactions are recognized. The ineffective portion of hedges is included in current earnings. The Corporations remaining derivatives, including foreign currency contracts, are not designated as hedges and the change in fair value is included in income currently. At December 31, 2004, the Corporation has $875 million of deferred exploration and production hedging losses, after income taxes, included in accumulated other comprehensive income. Income Taxes: Judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements. The Corporation has net operating loss carryforwards in several jurisdictions, including the United States, and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses. Additionally, the Corporation has deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities. Regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized. If it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that will be realized. In evaluating realizability of deferred tax assets, the Corporation refers to the reversal periods for temporary differences, available carryforward periods for net operating losses, estimates of future taxable income, the availability of tax planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets and other factors. Estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the Corporations internal business forecasts. Environment, Health and Safety The Corporation has implemented a values based, socially responsible strategy focused on improving environment, health and safety performance and making a positive impact on communities. The strategy is supported by the Corporations environment, health, safety and social responsibility policies and by environment and safety management systems that help protect the Corporations workforce, customers and local communities. The Corporations management systems are based on international standards and are intended to promote internal consistency, adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in EHS performance. Improved performance may increase the Corporations operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to assets, reputation and license to operate. While overall governance is the responsibility of senior management, the Corporation has programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance, audit facilities, train employees and to generally meet corporate EHS goals. The Port Reading refining facility and the HOVENSA refinery manufacture conventional and reformulated gasolines that are cleaner burning than that required under current U.S. regulations. The production of motor and other fuels in the United States and elsewhere has faced increasing regulatory pressures to reduce sulfur content in recent years. In 2004, new regulations went into effect that significantly reduced gasoline sulfur content and additional rules to reduce the allowable sulfur content in diesel fuel will go into effect in 2006. Fuels production will likely continue to be subject to more stringent regulation in future years and as such may require additional large capital expenditures. 32 Table of Contents The Corporation and HOVENSA continue to evaluate options to determine the most cost effective compliance strategies for known fuel regulations. Estimated capital expenditures necessary to comply with low sulfur gasoline requirements at Port Reading are approximately $70 million over the next two years. Capital expenditures to comply with low sulfur gasoline and diesel fuel requirements at HOVENSA are presently expected to be approximately $400 million in total, $50 million of which has already been spent. Remaining capital expenditures are projected to be $350 million over the next two years. HOVENSA plans to finance these capital expenditures through cash flow from operations. If it becomes necessary to finance a portion of the capital expenditures, HOVENSA has $400 million of available revolving credit capacity. Federal legislation to restrict or ban the use of MTBE, a gasoline oxygenate, and to require the use of renewable fuels was considered by the United States Congress in 2004 and will likely be reconsidered in 2005. The Corporation and HOVENSA both manufacture and use MTBE, where permitted, to meet the federal requirement for oxygen in reformulated gasoline. In states within the Corporations marketing area where MTBE bans have been enacted, such as Connecticut and New York, the Corporation markets reformulated gasoline without oxygenates and ethanol is added to the gasoline downstream from the refineries to meet regulatory requirements. If Congress bans MTBE nationally or if additional state bans take effect, or if an obligation to use ethanol or other renewable fuels is imposed, the effect on the Corporation and HOVENSA could be significant. Whether the effect is significant will depend on several factors, including the extent and timing of any such bans of MTBE or obligations to use ethanol, requirements for maintenance of certain air emission reductions if MTBE is banned, the cost and availability of alternative oxygenates or credits and whether the minimum oxygen content standard for reformulated gasoline remains in effect. The Corporation will continue to review various options to market and produce reformulated gasolines if additional MTBE bans take effect. As described in Item 3 Legal Proceedings in 2003, the Corporation and HOVENSA began discussions with the U.S. EPA regarding the EPAs Petroleum Refining Initiative (PRI). The PRI is an ongoing program that is designed to reduce certain air emissions at all U.S. refineries. Since 2000, EPA has entered into settlements addressing these emissions with petroleum refining companies that control over 50% of the nations refining capacity in 26 states and negotiations continue with many refiners. Depending on the outcome of these discussions, the Corporation and HOVENSA may experience increased capital and operating expenses related to air emissions controls. The PRI allows for controls to be phased in over several years. The Corporation recognizes the worldwide concern about the environmental and social impact of air emissions. On a global scale, climate change is an issue that has prompted much public debate and has a potential impact on future economic growth and development. The Corporation has undertaken a program to assess, monitor and reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane. The challenges associated with this program may be significant, not only from the standpoint of technical feasibility, but also from the perspective of adequately measuring the Corporations entire greenhouse gas inventory. The Corporation expects continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation related primarily to existing conditions. Sites where corrective action may be necessary include gasoline stations, terminals, onshore exploration and production facilities, refineries (including solid waste management units under permits issued pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act) and, although not currently significant, Superfund sites where the Corporation has been named a potentially responsible party. The Corporation accrues for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable. At year end 2004, the Corporations reserve for its estimated environmental liability was approximately $81 million. The Corporation does not discount its environmental liability. The Corporation expects that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites. Remediation spending was $12 million in 2004 and 2003 and $9 million in 2002. Capital expenditures for facilities, primarily to comply with federal, state and local environmental standards, were $1 million in 2004, $7 million in 2003 and $5 million in 2002. 33 Table of Contents Forward Looking Information Certain sections of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, including references to the Corporations future results of operations and financial position, liquidity and capital resources, capital expenditures, oil and gas production, tax rates, debt repayment, hedging, derivative, market risk and environmental disclosures, off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations and contingencies include forward looking information. Forward looking disclosures are based on the Corporations current understanding and assessment of these activities and reasonable assumptions about the future. Actual results may differ from these disclosures because of changes in market conditions, government actions and other factors. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk In the normal course of its business, the Corporation is exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the price of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and electricity, as well as to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. In the disclosures that follow, these operations are referred to as non trading activities. The Corporation also has trading operations, principally through a 50% voting interest in a trading partnership. These activities are also exposed to commodity risks primarily related to the prices of crude oil, natural gas and refined products. The following describes how these risks are controlled and managed. Controls: The Corporation maintains a control environment under the direction of its chief risk officer and through its corporate risk policy, which the Corporations senior management has approved. Controls include volumetric, term and value at risk limits. In addition, the chief risk officer must approve the use of new instruments or commodities. Risk limits are monitored daily and exceptions are reported to business units and to senior management. The Corporations risk management department also performs independent verifications of sources of fair values and validations of valuation models. These controls apply to all of the Corporations non trading and trading activities, including the consolidated trading partnership. The Corporations treasury department administers foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs. Instruments: The Corporation primarily uses forward commodity contracts, foreign exchange forward contracts, futures, swaps, options and energy commodity linked securities in its non trading and trading activities. These contracts are widely traded instruments mainly with standardized terms. The following describes these instruments and how the Corporation uses them: Forward Commodity Contracts: The forward purchase and sale of commodities is performed as part of the Corporations normal activities. At title date, the notional value of the contract is exchanged for physical delivery of the commodity. Forward contracts that are designated as normal purchase and sale contracts under FAS No. 133 are excluded from the quantitative market risk disclosures. Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts: Forward contracts include forward purchase contracts for both the British pound sterling and the Danish kroner. These foreign currency contracts commit the Corporation to purchase a fixed amount of pound sterling and kroner at a predetermined exchange rate on a certain date. Futures: The Corporation uses exchange traded futures contracts on a number of different underlying energy commodities. These contracts are settled daily with the relevant exchange and are subject to exchange position limits. Swaps: The Corporation uses financially settled swap contracts with third parties as part of its hedging and trading activities. Cash flows from swap contracts are determined based on underlying commodity prices and are typically settled over the life of the contract. Options: Options on various underlying energy commodities include exchange traded and third party contracts and have various exercise periods. As a seller of options, the Corporation receives a premium at the outset and bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the commodity underlying the option. As a purchaser of options, the Corporation pays a premium at the outset and has the right to participate in the favorable price movements in the underlying commodities. 34 Table of Contents Energy Commodity Linked Securities: Securities where the price is linked to the price of an underlying energy commodity. These securities may be issued by a company or government. Quantitative Measures: The Corporation uses value at risk to monitor and control commodity risk within its trading and non trading activities. The value at risk model uses historical simulation and the results represent the potential loss in fair value over one day at a 95% confidence level. The model captures both first and second order sensitivities for options. The potential change in fair value based on commodity price risk is presented in the non trading and trading sections below. For foreign exchange rate risk, the impact of a 10% change in foreign exchange rates on the value of the Corporations portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts is presented in the non trading section. Similarly, the impact of a 15% change in interest rates on the fair value of the Corporations debt is also presented in the non trading section. A 10% change in foreign exchange rates and a 15% change in the rate of interest over one year are considered reasonable possibilities for providing sensitivity disclosures. Non Trading: The Corporations non trading activities include hedging of crude oil and natural gas production. Futures and swaps are used to fix the selling prices of a portion of the Corporations future production and the related gains or losses are an integral part of the Corporations selling prices. As of December 31, the Corporation has open hedge positions equal to 60% of its estimated 2005 worldwide crude oil production. The average price for West Texas Intermediate crude oil (WTI) related open hedge positions is $33.06. The average price for Brent crude oil related open hedge positions is $31.17. Approximately 20% of the Corporations hedges is WTI related and the remainder is Brent. In addition, the Corporation has approximately 24,000 barrels per day of Brent related crude oil production hedged from 2006 through 2012 at an average price of $26.20 per barrel. There were no hedges of natural gas production at year end. As market conditions change, the Corporation may adjust its hedge percentages. Because the selling price of crude oil has increased during 2004, accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at December 31, 2004 includes after tax deferred losses of $875 million ($195 million of realized losses and $680 million of unrealized losses) related to crude oil contracts used as hedges of exploration and production sales. Realized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income represent losses on closed contracts that are deferred until the underlying barrels are sold. In addition to the impact of the open hedge positions described above, approximately $52 million of the realized losses will reduce earnings in the first quarter of 2005 and the remainder will reduce earnings during the balance of 2005. The pre tax amount of all deferred hedge losses is reflected in accounts payable and the related income tax benefits are recorded as deferred tax assets on the balance sheet. The Corporation also markets energy commodities including refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity. The Corporation uses futures and swaps to fix the purchase prices of commodities to be sold under fixed price sales contracts. The following table summarizes the value at risk results of commodity related derivatives that are settled in cash and used in non trading activities. The results may vary from time to time as hedge levels change. Non Trading Activities (Millions of dollars) 2004 At December 31 $ 108 Average for the year 90 High during the year 111 Low during the year 52 2003 At December 31 $ 44 Average for the year 43 High during the year 47 Low during the year 40 35 Table of Contents The increase in the value at risk in 2004 principally reflects additional hedge positions on Brent related production for the years 2006 through 2012. The Corporation uses foreign exchange contracts to reduce its exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates by entering into forward purchase contracts for both the British pound sterling and the Danish kroner. At December 31, 2004, the Corporation has $476 million of notional value foreign exchange contracts maturing in 2005 ($384 million at December 31, 2003). The fair value of foreign exchange contracts recorded as assets was $49 million at December 31, 2004 ($40 million at December 31, 2003). The change in fair value of the foreign exchange contracts from a 10% change in exchange rates is estimated to be $53 million at December 31, 2004 ($43 million at December 31, 2003). At December 31, 2004, the interest rate on substantially all of the Corporations debt was fixed and there were no interest rate swaps. The Corporations outstanding debt of $3,835 million has a fair value of $4,327 million at December 31, 2004 (debt of $3,941 million at December 31, 2003 had a fair value of $4,440 million). A 15% change in the rate of interest would change the fair value of debt by approximately $260 million at December 31, 2004 and by approximately $270 million at December 31, 2003. Trading: The trading partnership in which the Corporation has a 50% voting interest trades energy commodities and derivatives. The accounts of the partnership are consolidated with those of the Corporation. The Corporation also takes trading positions for its own account. These strategies include proprietary position management and trading to enhance the potential return on assets. The information that follows represents 100% of the trading partnership and the Corporations proprietary trading accounts. In trading activities, the Corporation is exposed to changes in crude oil, natural gas and refined product prices, primarily in North America and Europe. Trading positions include futures, forwards, swaps and options. In some cases, physical purchase and sale contracts are used as trading instruments and are included in the trading results. Gains or losses from sales of physical products are recorded at the time of sale. Derivative trading transactions are marked to market and are reflected in income currently. Total realized gains for the year amounted to $79 million. The following table provides an assessment of the factors affecting the changes in fair value of trading activities and represents 100% of the trading partnership and other trading activities. 2004 2003 (Millions of dollars) Fair value of contracts outstanding at the beginning of the year $ 67 $ 36 Change in fair value of contracts outstanding at the beginning of the year and still outstanding at the end of year 13 36 Reversal of fair value for contracts closed during the year (10 ) (26 ) Fair value of contracts entered into during the year and still outstanding 114 21 Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the year $ 184 $ 67 The Corporation uses observable market values for determining the fair value of its trading instruments. In cases where actively quoted prices are not available, other external sources are used which incorporate information about commodity prices in actively quoted markets, quoted prices in less active markets and other market fundamental analysis. Internal estimates are based on internal models incorporating underlying market information such as commodity volatilities and correlations. The Corporations risk management department 36 Table of Contents regularly compares valuations to independent sources and models.
