Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview The Corporation is a global integrated energy company that operates in two segments, exploration and production (E&P) and marketing and refining. The E&P segment explores for, develops, produces and sells crude oil and natural gas. The marketing and refining segment manufactures, purchases, trades and markets refined petroleum products and other energy products. Exploration & Production The Corporations strategy for the E&P segment is to grow reserves and production in a sustainable and financially disciplined manner. The Corporation has increased its reserve life in each of the last three years. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Corporations total proved reserves were 1,093 million and 1,046 million barrels of oil equivalent. The following table summarizes the components of proved reserves as of December 31: 2005 2004 Crude oil and condensate (millions of barrels) U.S. 124 18 % 124 19 % International 568 82 522 81 Total 692 100 % 646 100 % Natural Gas (millions of Mcf) U.S. 282 12 % 300 12 % International 2,124 88 2,100 88 Total 2,406 100 % 2,400 100 % Income from continuing operations was $1,058 million in 2005, $755 million in 2004 and $414 million in 2003. The improved results were primarily driven by increasingly higher oil and gas prices during the reporting period. See further discussion in Comparison of Results on page 21. Production totaled 335,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in 2005, 342,000 boepd in 2004 and 373,000 boepd in 2003. During 2005, first production was achieved from Block A 18 of the Malaysia Thailand Joint Development Area (JDA), the Clair field in the North Sea and Phase 1 of the ACG fields in Azerbaijan. Damage caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in the Gulf of Mexico caused production to be lower by 7,000 boepd in 2005. The Corporation estimates that production will be approximately 360,000 boepd to 380,000 boepd in 2006. The Corporation has a number of development projects that are in various stages of completion that should begin production in 2006 and 2007. Development milestones achieved in 2005 include: Development of the Atlantic and Cromarty natural gas fields in the United Kingdom sector of the North Sea is substantially complete. The Phu Horm onshore gas project in Thailand was sanctioned. First production is scheduled at the end of 2006. The Okume Complex development in Equatorial Guinea is on schedule and on budget. First production of crude oil is scheduled for the beginning of 2007. Development of the Pangkah field in Indonesia also progressed and is on schedule. First gas is expected in the first half of 2007. During 2005, the Corporation acquired a controlling interest in a corporate joint venture operating in the Volga Urals region of Russia. Subsequent to the acquisition, this venture acquired additional licenses and 18 Table of Contents assets, bringing the Corporations total investment in Russia to approximately $400 million. Production averaged 6,000 boepd in 2005 and is expected to average 12,000 to 15,000 boepd in 2006. In January 2006, the Corporation, in conjunction with its Oasis Group partners, re entered its former oil and gas production operations in the Waha concessions in Libya. The re entry terms include a 25 year extension of the concessions, in which the Corporation will hold an 8.16% interest, and a payment by the Corporation to the Libyan National Oil Corporation of $260 million. In addition, the Corporation will make a payment of $106 million related to certain investments in fixed assets made since 1986. The Corporation estimates its net share of 2006 production from Libya will average approximately 20,000 to 25,000 boepd. In January 2006, the Corporation acquired a 55% working interest in the deepwater section of the West Mediterranean Block 1 Concession (the West Med Block) in Egypt for $413 million. The Corporation has a 25 year development lease for the West Med Block, which contains four existing natural gas discoveries and additional exploration opportunities. In 2006, the Corporation will complete the sale of its interests in certain producing properties located in the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico for $404 million, before purchase price adjustments. The Corporation estimates that it will record an after tax gain of $160 to $180 million in the first quarter on the sale of these assets. Marketing & Refining The Corporations strategy is to deliver consistent financial performance from marketing and refining assets and generate free cash flow. Net income was $515 million in 2005, $451 million in 2004 and $327 million in 2003. Refining operations contributed net income of $346 million in 2005, $302 million in 2004 and $165 million in 2003. Marketing earnings were $136 million in 2005, $112 million in 2004 and $145 million in 2003. Total marketing and refining earnings improved due to increased margins and higher refined product sales volumes. The Corporation received cash distributions from HOVENSA totaling $275 million in 2005 and $88 million in 2004. In 2005, the Corporations Port Reading facility commenced its approximately $75 million program for complying with low sulfur gasoline requirements. Capital expenditures of $23 million were made in 2005 with the remainder of the expenditures anticipated in 2006. Capital expenditures to comply with low sulfur gasoline and diesel fuel requirements at HOVENSA are expected to approximate $410 million, of which $160 million has been spent. Anticipated capital expenditures in 2006 for the low sulfur requirements are $200 million. HOVENSA plans to finance these capital expenditures through cash flow from operations. Liquidity and Capital and Exploratory Expenditures Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,840 million in 2005 compared with $1,903 million in 2004. At December 31, 2005, cash and cash equivalents totaled $315 million compared with $877 million at December 31, 2004. The Corporations debt to capitalization ratio at December 31, 2005 was 37.6% compared with 40.7% at the end of 2004. Total debt was $3,785 million at December 31, 2005 and $3,835 million at December 31, 2004. The Corporation has debt maturities of $26 million in 2006. 19 Table of Contents Capital and exploratory expenditures were as follows for the years ended December 31: 2005 2004 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and Production United States $ 353 $ 446 International 2,031 1,117 Total Exploration and Production 2,384 1,563 Marketing and Refining 106 87 Total Capital and Exploratory Expenditures $ 2,490 $ 1,650 Exploration expenses charged to income included above: United States $ 89 $ 89 International 60 40 $ 149 $ 129 The Corporation has approved a $4 billion capital and exploratory expenditure program for 2006, which includes a total of approximately $780 million for the acquisition of Egyptian assets and re entry to the Waha concessions in Libya. Excluding acquisitions, $3.1 billion is targeted for Exploration and Production and $125 million for Marketing and Refining. Consolidated Results of Operations Net income from continuing operations in 2005 was $1,242 million compared with $970 million in 2004 and $467 million in 2003. See the following page for a table of items affecting the comparability of earnings between periods. The after tax results by major operating activity are summarized below: 2005 2004 2003 (Millions of dollars, except per share data) Exploration and Production $ 1,058 $ 755 $ 414 Marketing and Refining 515 451 327 Corporate (191 ) (85 ) (101 ) Interest expense (140 ) (151 ) (173 ) Income from continuing operations 1,242 970 467 Discontinued operations 7 169 Income from cumulative effect of accounting change 7 Net income $ 1,242 $ 977 $ 643 Income per share from continuing operations diluted $ 11.94 $ 9.50 $ 5.17 Net income per share diluted $ 11.94 $ 9.57 $ 7.11 In the discussion that follows, the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after tax basis. Management reviews segment earnings on an after tax basis and uses after tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings. Management believes that after tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre tax amount. After tax amounts are determined by applying the appropriate income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre tax amounts. 20 Table of Contents The following items of income (expense), on an after tax basis, are included in income from continuing operations: 2005 2004 2003 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and Production Net gains from asset sales $ 41 $ 54 $ 31 Hurricane related costs (26 ) Income tax adjustments 11 19 30 Legal settlement 11 Accrued severance and office costs (9 ) (32 ) Marketing and Refining LIFO inventory liquidation 32 12 Charge related to customer bankruptcy (8 ) Net loss from asset sales (20 ) Corporate Premiums on bond repurchases (26 ) (34 ) Tax on repatriated earnings (72 ) Income tax adjustments 13 Insurance accrual (13 ) $ (37 ) $ 76 $ (25 ) The items in the table above are explained, and the pre tax amounts are shown, on pages 24 through 26. Comparison of Results Exploration and Production Following is a summarized income statement of the Corporations exploration and production operations: 2005 2004 2003 (Millions of dollars) Sales and other operating revenues $ 4,210 $ 3,416 $ 3,087 Non operating income 94 90 21 Total revenues 4,304 3,506 3,108 Costs and expenses Production expenses, including related taxes 1,007 825 796 Exploration expenses, including dry holes and lease impairment 397 287 369 General, administrative and other expenses 140 150 168 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 965 918 998 Total costs and expenses 2,509 2,180 2,331 Results of operations from continuing operations before income taxes 1,795 1,326 777 Provision for income taxes 737 571 363 Results from continuing operations 1,058 755 414 Discontinued operations 7 170 Income from cumulative effect of accounting change 7 Results of operations $ 1,058 $ 762 $ 591 21 Table of Contents After considering the exploration and production items in the table on page 24, the remaining changes in exploration and production earnings are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices, production volumes and operating costs and exploration expenses, as discussed below. Selling prices: Higher average selling prices of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas increased exploration and production revenues from continuing operations by approximately $870 million, including the effect of hedging, in 2005 compared with 2004. In 2004, the change in average selling prices increased revenues by approximately $400 million compared with 2003. The Corporations average selling prices, including the effects of hedging, were as follows: 2005 2004 2003 Crude oil (per barrel) United States $ 32.64 $ 27.42 $ 24.23 Europe 33.13 26.18 24.66 Africa 32.10 26.35 25.43 Asia and other 54.69 38.36 28.49 Natural gas liquids (per barrel) United States 38.50 29.50 23.74 Europe 37.13 27.44 23.09 Natural gas (per Mcf) United States 7.93 5.18 4.02 Europe 5.29 3.96 3.00 Asia and other 4.02 3.90 3.10 The Corporations average selling prices, excluding the effects of hedging, were as follows: 2005 2004 2003 Crude oil (per barrel) United States $ 51.16 $ 38.56 $ 29.43 Europe 52.22 37.57 29.06 Africa 51.70 37.07 28.10 Asia and other 54.69 38.36 28.49 Natural gas liquids (per barrel) United States 38.50 29.50 23.74 Europe 37.13 27.44 23.09 Natural gas (per Mcf) United States 7.93 5.53 5.08 Europe 5.29 3.96 3.00 Asia and other 4.02 3.90 3.10 The after tax impacts of hedging reduced earnings by $989 million ($1,582 million before income taxes) in 2005, $583 million ($935 million before income taxes) in 2004 and $260 million ($418 million before income taxes) in 2003. Production and sales volumes: The Corporations crude oil and natural gas production was 335,000 boepd in 2005, 342,000 boepd in 2004 and 373,000 boepd in 2003. Hurricane related interruptions in the Gulf of Mexico reduced 2005 production by approximately 7,000 boepd. The Corporation anticipates that 22 Table of Contents its 2006 production will average between 360,000 and 380,000 boepd, including 20,000 to 25,000 boepd from Libya. The Corporations net daily worldwide production was as follows: 2005 2004 2003 Crude oil (thousands of barrels per day) United States 44 44 44 Europe 110 119 137 Africa 67 61 52 Asia and other 7 4 8 Total 228 228 241 Natural gas liquids (thousands of barrels per day) United States 12 12 11 Europe 4 6 7 Total 16 18 18 Natural gas (thousands of Mcf per day) United States 137 171 253 Europe 274 319 367 Asia and other 133 85 63 Total 544 575 683 Barrels of oil equivalent* (thousands of barrels per day) 335 342 373 Barrels of oil equivalent production included above related to discontinued operations 13 * Reflects natural gas production converted on the basis of relative energy content (six Mcf equals one barrel). Crude oil production in the United States in 2005 included increased production from the Llano field which offset natural decline and the effect of the hurricanes. Production in Europe was lower due to natural decline and increased maintenance, partially offset by new production from Russia. Increased crude oil production in Africa is principally due to improved performance from the Ceiba field in Equatorial Guinea. Natural gas production in Asia increased due to new production from the JDA. Decreased sales volumes resulted in lower revenue of approximately $80 million in 2005 and $75 million in 2004. Operating costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization: Cash operating costs, consisting of production expenses and general and administrative expenses, increased by $147 million in 2005 and $44 million in 2004 compared with the prior years, excluding the hurricane related costs and accrued severance and office lease costs discussed on page 24. Production expenses increased in 2005 and 2004, principally reflecting higher maintenance expenses, production taxes and fuel costs. Production expenses in 2005 also increased due to expanded operations in Russia and the JDA. Depreciation, depletion and amortization charges were higher in 2005, principally due to higher per barrel rates. Depreciation and related charges were lower in 2004 compared with 2003, reflecting decreased production volumes. Unit production costs per barrel of oil equivalent, comprised of production expense, administrative costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization totaled $16.88 in 2005, $14.96 in 2004 and $14.52 in 2003. Unit production costs in 2006 are estimated to be $17 to $19 per barrel of oil equivalent. Exploration expenses: Exploration expenses were higher in 2005, reflecting increased drilling and seismic activity compared with 2004. Exploration expenses were lower in 2004 compared with 2003 as a result of lower dry hole costs. 23 Table of Contents Other: After tax foreign currency gains were $20 million ($3 million loss before income taxes) in 2005 and $6 million ($29 million before income taxes) in 2004, compared with a loss of $22 million ($4 million before income taxes) in 2003. The effective income tax rate for exploration and production operations was 41% in 2005, 43% in 2004 and 47% in 2003. After considering the items in the table below, the effective income tax rates were 42% in 2005, 46% in 2004 and 51% in 2003. The effective income tax rate for exploration and production operations in 2006 is expected to be in the range of 50% to 52%. The increase in the estimated 2006 effective income tax rate is due to an anticipated additional 10% supplementary tax on oil and gas earnings in the United Kingdom, and the estimated impact of Libyan operations, which commenced in 2006 and will be taxed at a rate higher than the current exploration and production effective rate. In addition, there will also be a one time non cash charge of approximately $40 to $50 million from the adjustment of deferred income tax liabilities when the anticipated United Kingdom tax is enacted, which is expected to be in the second or third quarter of 2006. Reported exploration and production earnings include the following items of income (expense) before and after income taxes: Before Income Taxes After Income Taxes 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 2003 (Millions of dollars) Gains from asset sales $ 48 $ 55 $ 47 $ 41 $ 54 $ 31 Hurricane related costs (40 ) (26 ) Income tax adjustments 11 19 30 Legal settlement 19 11 Accrued severance and office costs (15 ) (53 ) (9 ) (32 ) $ 27 $ 40 $ (6 ) $ 37 $ 64 $ 29 2005: The gains from asset sales in 2005 represent the disposal of non producing properties in the United Kingdom and the exchange of a mature North Sea asset for an increased interest in the Pangkah natural gas development in Indonesia. The Corporation incurred incremental expenses, principally repair costs and higher insurance premiums in 2005, as a result of hurricane damage in the Gulf of Mexico that are included in production expenses in the income statement. The income tax adjustment reflects the effect on deferred income taxes of a reduction in the income tax rate in Denmark and a tax settlement in the United Kingdom. The legal settlement reflects the favorable resolution of contingencies on a prior year asset sale, which is reflected in non operating income in the income statement. 2004: The Corporation recognized gains on the sales of an office building in Aberdeen, Scotland, a non producing property in Malaysia and two mature Gulf of Mexico properties. It also recorded foreign income tax benefits resulting from a change in tax law and a tax settlement. The Corporation accrued an additional amount for severance and vacated office space during 2004, which is reflected in general and administrative expenses in the income statement. 2003: The Corporation recorded an after tax charge for accrued severance in the United States and United Kingdom and a reduction of leased office space in London. The pre tax amount of this charge was $53 million, of which $32 million relates to vacated office space. The remainder of $21 million relates to severance for positions that were eliminated in London, Aberdeen and Houston. These expenses are reflected principally in general and administrative expenses in the income statement. The Corporation recorded an income tax benefit reflecting the recognition for United States income tax purposes of certain prior year foreign exploration expenses. The gain from asset sale in 2003 reflects the sale of the Corporations 1.5% interest in the Trans Alaska Pipeline System. The Corporations future exploration and production earnings may be impacted by external factors, such as political risk, volatility in the selling prices of crude oil and natural gas, reserve and production changes, industry cost inflation, exploration expenses and changes in tax rates. 24 Table of Contents Marketing and Refining Earnings from marketing and refining activities amounted to $515 million in 2005, $451 million in 2004 and $327 million in 2003. After considering the marketing and refining items in the table on page 26, the earnings amounted to $491 million in 2005, $439 million in 2004 and $347 million in 2003 and are discussed in the paragraphs below. The Corporations downstream operations include HOVENSA, a 50% owned refining joint venture with a subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) that is accounted for using the equity method. Additional marketing and refining activities include a fluid catalytic cracking facility in Port Reading, New Jersey, as well as retail gasoline stations, energy marketing and trading operations. Refining: Refining earnings, which consist of the Corporations share of HOVENSAs results, Port Reading earnings, interest income on the note receivable from PDVSA and other miscellaneous items were $346 million in 2005, $302 million in 2004 and $165 million in 2003. The Corporations share of HOVENSAs income was $376 million ($231 million after income taxes) in 2005 and $244 million ($216 million after income taxes) in 2004. In 2003, HOVENSAs earnings were $117 million, before and after income taxes. The increased earnings in 2005 were due to higher refining margins. In 2005, the Corporation provided income taxes at the Virgin Islands statutory rate of 38.5% on HOVENSAs income and the interest income on the PDVSA note. In 2004, income taxes on HOVENSAs earnings were partially offset by available loss carryforwards. Cash distributions from HOVENSA were $275 million in 2005 and $88 million in 2004. A crude unit and the fluid catalytic cracking unit at HOVENSA were each shutdown for approximately 30 days of scheduled maintenance in 2005. Pre tax interest on the PDVSA note was $20 million, $25 million and $30 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Interest income is reflected in non operating income in the income statement. At December 31, 2005, the remaining balance of the PDVSA note was $212 million, which is scheduled to be fully repaid by February 2009. Port Readings after tax earnings were $100 million in 2005, $60 million in 2004 and $27 million in 2003, reflecting higher margins in each period. In 2005, the Port Reading facility was shutdown for 36 days of planned maintenance. The following table summarizes refinery utilization rates: Refinery Utilization Refinery Capacity 2005 2004 2003 (Thousands of barrels per day) HOVENSA Crude 500 92.2% * 96.7% 88.0% Fluid catalytic cracker 150 81.9% * 92.9% 94.7% Coker 58 92.8% 94.5% 91.4% Port Reading 65 85.3% * 83.4% ** 87.1% * Reflects reduced utilization from scheduled maintenance. ** Includes a storm related interruption. Marketing: Marketing operations, which consist principally of retail gasoline and energy marketing activities, generated income of $112 million in 2005, $100 million in 2004 and $165 million in 2003, excluding the income from liquidation of LIFO inventories and other items described on page 26. The increase in 2005 was primarily due to higher margins and increased sales volumes. The decrease in 2004 was principally due to lower margins. Total refined product sales volumes were 456,000 barrels per day in 2005, 428,000 barrels per day in 2004 and 419,000 barrels per day in 2003. The Corporation has a 50% voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades energy commodities and energy derivatives. The Corporation also takes trading positions for its own account. The Corporations after tax results from trading activities, including its share of the earnings of the trading partnership amounted 25 Table of Contents to income of $33 million in 2005, $37 million in 2004 and $17 million in 2003. Before income taxes, the trading income amounted to $60 million in 2005, $72 million in 2004 and $30 million in 2003, which is included in operating revenues in the income statement. Marketing expenses increased in 2005, 2004 and 2003 reflecting additional retail sites and higher costs of the trading partnership. Reported marketing and refining earnings include the following items of income (expense) before and after income taxes: Before Income Taxes After Income Taxes 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 2003 (Millions of dollars) LIFO inventory liquidation $ 51 $ 20 $ $ 32 $ 12 $ Loss from asset sales (9 ) (20 ) Charge related to customer bankruptcy (13 ) (8 ) $ 38 $ 20 $ (9 ) $ 24 $ 12 $ (20 ) In 2005, marketing and refining earnings include income from the liquidation of prior year LIFO inventories and a charge resulting from the bankruptcy of a customer in the utility industry, which is included in marketing expenses. In 2004, marketing and refining results include income from the liquidation of LIFO inventories. In 2003, marketing and refining earnings were reduced by a loss from the sale of the Corporations interest in a shipping joint venture. Marketing and refining earnings will likely continue to be volatile reflecting competitive industry conditions, government regulatory changes and supply and demand factors, including the effects of weather. Corporate The following table summarizes corporate expenses: 2005 2004 2003 (Millions of dollars) Corporate expenses (excluding the other items, after tax listed below) $ 119 $ 116 $ 98 Income taxes (benefits) on the above (26 ) (31 ) (31 ) 93 85 67 Other items, after tax Tax on repatriation of foreign earnings 72 Premiums on bond repurchases 26 34 Corporate insurance accrual 13 Adjustments relating to income tax audits (13 ) Net corporate expenses $ 191 $ 85 $ 101 The American Jobs Creation Act provided for a one time reduction in the income tax rate to 5.25% on the remittance of eligible dividends from foreign subsidiaries to a U.S. parent. During 2005, the Corporation repatriated $1.9 billion of previously unremitted foreign earnings resulting in the recognition of an income tax provision of $72 million. The pre tax amounts of the bond repurchase premiums in 2005 and 2003 were $39 million and $58 million, respectively, which are reflected in non operating income in the income statement. The pre tax amount of the 2004 corporate insurance accrual was $20 million. Recurring after tax corporate expenses in 2006 are estimated to be in the range of $105 to $115 million. 26 Table of Contents Interest After tax interest expense was as follows: 2005 2004 2003 (Millions of dollars) Total interest incurred $ 304 $ 295 $ 334 Less capitalized interest 80 54 41 Interest expense before income taxes 224 241 293 Less income taxes 84 90 120 After tax interest expense $ 140 $ 151 $ 173 After tax interest expense in 2006 is anticipated to be lower than the 2005 level because of higher estimated capitalized interest. Discontinued Operations In 2003, the Corporation exchanged its crude oil producing properties in Colombia plus $10 million in cash, for an additional 25% interest in natural gas reserves in the JDA. In addition, the Corporation sold, for aggregate proceeds of $445 million, producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico shelf, the Jabung field in Indonesia and several small United Kingdom fields. These disposals resulted in a net gain from asset sales of $116 million and income from operations prior to sale was $53 million, after income taxes. Income from discontinued operations of $7 million in 2004 reflects the settlement of a previously accrued contingency relating to the exchanged Colombian assets. Change in Accounting Principle The Corporation adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, effective January 1, 2003. A net after tax gain of $7 million resulting from the cumulative effect of this accounting change was recorded at the beginning of 2003. Sales and Other Operating Revenues Sales and other operating revenues totaled $22,747 million in 2005, an increase of 36% compared with 2004. The increase reflects higher selling prices of crude oil and natural gas in exploration and production activities and higher selling prices and sales volumes in marketing activities. In 2004, sales and other operating revenues totaled $16,733 million, an increase of 17% compared with 2003. This increase principally reflects higher selling prices and sales volumes of refined products, partially offset by decreased sales of purchased natural gas in marketing activities. The change in cost of goods sold in each year reflects the change in sales volumes and prices of refined products and purchased natural gas. 27 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table sets forth certain relevant measures of the Corporations liquidity and capital resources as of December 31: 2005 2004 (Millions of dollars, except ratios) Cash and cash equivalents $ 315 $ 877 Current portion of long term debt $ 26 $ 50 Total debt $ 3,785 $ 3,835 Stockholders equity $ 6,286 $ 5,597 Debt to capitalization ratio* 37.6 % 40.7 % * Total debt as a percentage of the sum of total debt plus stockholders equity. Cash Flows The following table sets forth a summary of the Corporations cash flows: 2005 2004 2003 (Millions of dollars) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,840 $ 1,903 $ 1,581 Investing activities (2,255 ) (1,371 ) (777 ) Financing activities (147 ) (173 ) (483 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (562 ) $ 359 $ 321 Operating Activities: In 2005, net cash provided by operating activities of $1,840 million was comparable to the prior year as higher earnings in 2005 were offset by a decrease from changes in operating assets and liabilities, principally working capital, of $408 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,903 million in 2004, an increase of $322 million over 2003, resulting primarily from higher earnings and an increase from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $227 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,581 million in 2003. The Corporation received cash distributions of $275 million in 2005 and $88 million in 2004 from HOVENSA. Investing Activities: The following table summarizes the Corporations capital expenditures: 2005 2004 2003 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and production Exploration $ 229 $ 168 $ 180 Production and development 1,598 1,204 1,067 Acquisitions (including leasehold) 408 62 39 2,235 1,434 1,286 Marketing and refining Operations 106 67 72 Acquisitions 20 106 87 72 Total $ 2,341 $ 1,521 $ 1,358 28 Table of Contents Proceeds from asset sales in 2005 and 2004 were $74 million and $57 million, respectively, principally from the sale of non producing properties. Proceeds from asset sales totaled $545 million in 2003. Financing Activities: The Corporation reduced debt by $50 million in 2005, $106 million in 2004 and $1,051 million in 2003. In 2005, bond repurchases of $600 million were funded by borrowings on the revolving credit facility in connection with the repatriation of foreign earnings to the United States. The net reduction in debt in 2005 and 2004 was funded by available cash and cash flow from operations. In 2003, debt was reduced by proceeds of $653 million from the issuance of 13,500,000 shares of mandatory convertible preferred stock and from asset sales, as well as cash flow from operations. In 2005 and 2004, the Corporation received proceeds from the exercise of stock options totaling $62 million and $90 million, respectively. Dividends paid were $159 million in 2005, $157 million in 2004 and $108 million in 2003. The increase in 2004 was due to dividends on the 7% preferred stock issued in the fourth quarter of 2003. Future Capital Requirements and Resources: In January 2006, the Corporation announced a $4 billion capital and exploratory expenditure program for 2006, which includes approximately $780 million for the acquisition of Egyptian assets and payments for the Corporations re entry into Libya. Excluding acquisitions, $3.1 billion relates to exploration and production, including $1,370 million for development, $1,130 million for production and $570 million for exploration. The program also includes $125 million for marketing and refining. The Corporations aggregate maturities of long term debt total $54 million over the next two years. The Corporation anticipates it will fund its 2006 operations, including capital expenditures, dividends, pension contributions and required debt repayments, with existing cash on hand and cash flow from operations and, as necessary, additional borrowings on the revolving credit facility. Outstanding letters of credit, principally relating to hedging activities at December 31, were as follows: 2005 2004 (Millions of dollars) Lines of Credit Revolving credit facility $ 28 $ 570 Committed short term letter of credit facilities 1,675 Uncommitted lines 982 917 $ 2,685 $ 1,487 At December 31, 2005, the Corporation has $1,872 million available under its $2.5 billion syndicated revolving credit facility and has additional unused lines of credit of approximately $370 million, primarily for letters of credit, under uncommitted arrangements with banks. The Corporation also has a shelf registration under which it may issue additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or preferred stock. A loan agreement covenant allows the Corporation to borrow up to an additional $6.7 billion for the construction or acquisition of assets at December 31, 2005. At year end, the maximum amount of dividends or stock repurchases that can be paid from borrowings under this covenant is $2.5 billion. Credit Ratings: Two credit rating agencies have rated the Corporations debt as investment grade and one rating agencys rating is below investment grade. If another rating agency were to reduce its credit rating below investment grade, the Corporation would have to comply with a more stringent financial covenant contained in its revolving credit facility. In addition, margin requirements with non trading and trading counterparties at December 31, 2005 would increase by approximately $30 million. 29 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Contingencies: Following is a table showing aggregated information about certain contractual obligations at December 31, 2005: Payments Due by Period 2007 and 2009 and Total 2006 2008 2010 Thereafter (Millions of dollars) Long term debt* $ 3,785 $ 26 $ 58 $ 775 $ 2,926 Operating leases 2,384 345 719 283 1,037 Purchase obligations Supply commitments 29,070 9,905 9,961 9,204 ** Capital expenditures 1,729 1,191 523 15 Operating expenses 470 319 119 27 5 Other long term liabilities 306 72 91 78 65 * At December 31, 2005, the Corporations debt bears interest at a weighted average rate of 7.0%. ** The Corporation intends to continue purchasing refined product supply from HOVENSA. Estimated future purchases amount to approximately $4.6 billion annually using year end 2005 prices. In the preceding table, the Corporations supply commitments include its estimated purchases of 50% of HOVENSAs production of refined products, after anticipated sales by HOVENSA to unaffiliated parties. The value of future supply commitments will fluctuate based on prevailing market prices at the time of purchase, the actual output from HOVENSA, and the level of sales to unaffiliated parties. Also included are term purchase agreements at market prices for additional gasoline necessary to supply the Corporations retail marketing system and feedstocks for the Port Reading refining facility. In addition, the Corporation has commitments to purchase natural gas for use in supplying contracted customers in its energy marketing business. These commitments were computed based on year end market prices. The table also reflects that portion of the Corporations planned $4 billion capital expenditure program that is contractually committed at December 31. Obligations for operating expenses include commitments for transportation, seismic purchases, oil and gas production expenses and other normal business expenses. Other long term liabilities reflect contractually committed obligations on the balance sheet at December 31, including minimum pension plan funding requirements. At December 31, 2004, the Corporation had an accrual of $39 million for vacated office costs in London. During 2005, $8 million of payments were made reducing the accrual to $31 million at December 31, 2005. Additional accruals totaling approximately $30 million, before income taxes, are anticipated in 2006 for office space to be vacated. In December 2005, the Minerals Management Service (MMS) issued an order to the Corporation to pay royalties on certain deep water exploration leases in the Gulf of Mexico held by the Corporation. In the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995 (the Act), Congress granted royalty relief in order to encourage deep water exploration in the Gulf of Mexico. With respect to exploration leases issued between November 28, 1995 and November 28, 2000, the Act granted royalty relief without regard to the market price of crude oil and natural gas at the time the royalty is payable. However, in regulations promulgated by MMS relating to these deep water leases, the MMS imposed a price threshold such that if the market price for crude oil or natural gas exceeded the threshold, royalty relief would not be granted. The Corporation has accrued $34 million for royalties relating to sales from these leases, which the Corporation believes is its full potential liability if the MMS regulations are determined to be valid. The Corporation has a contingent purchase obligation, expiring in April 2010, to acquire the remaining interest in a retail marketing and gasoline station joint venture for approximately $140 million. The Corporation guarantees the payment of up to 50% of HOVENSAs crude oil purchases from suppliers other than PDVSA. The amount of the Corporations guarantee fluctuates based on the volume of crude oil purchased and related prices and at December 31, 2005 amounted to $135 million. In addition, the 30 Table of Contents Corporation has agreed to provide funding up to a maximum of $40 million to the extent HOVENSA does not have funds to meet its senior debt obligations. At December 31, the Corporation has $2,612 million of letters of credit principally relating to accrued liabilities with hedging and trading counterparties recorded on its balance sheet. In addition, the Corporation is contingently liable under letters of credit and under guarantees of the debt of other entities directly related to its business, as follows: Total (Millions of dollars) Letters of credit $ 73 Guarantees 233 * $ 306 * Includes $40 million HOVENSA debt and $135 million crude oil purchase guarantees discussed above. The remainder relates to a loan guarantee of $58 million for an oil pipeline in which the Corporation owns a 2.36% interest. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements: The Corporation has leveraged leases not included in its balance sheet, primarily related to retail gasoline stations that the Corporation operates. The net present value of these leases is $480 million at December 31, 2005 compared with $467 million at December 31, 2004. The Corporations December 31, 2005 debt to capitalization ratio would increase from 37.6% to 40.4% if these leases were included as debt. See also Contractual Obligations and Contingencies above, note 5, Refining Joint Venture, and note 16, Guarantees and Contingencies, in the financial statements. Foreign Operations: The Corporation conducts exploration and production activities in the United Kingdom, Norway, Denmark, Russia, Equatorial Guinea, Algeria, Azerbaijan, Gabon, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Libya and other countries. Therefore, the Corporation is subject to the risks associated with foreign operations. These exposures include political risk (including tax law changes) and currency risk. HOVENSA L.L.C., owned 50% by the Corporation and 50% by Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), owns and operates a refinery in the Virgin Islands. In the past, there have been political disruptions in Venezuela that reduced the availability of Venezuelan crude oil used in refining operations, however, these disruptions did not have a material adverse effect on the Corporations financial position. The Corporation has a note receivable of $212 million at December 31, 2005 from a subsidiary of PDVSA. All payments are current and the Corporation anticipates collection of the remaining balance. Subsequent Events In January 2006, the Corporation, in conjunction with its Oasis Group partners, re entered its former oil and gas production operations in the Waha concessions in Libya. The re entry terms include a 25 year extension of the concessions, in which the Corporation will hold an 8.16% interest, and a payment by the Corporation to the Libyan National Oil Corporation of $260 million. In addition, the Corporation will make a payment of $106 million related to certain investments in fixed assets made since 1986. The Corporation estimates its net share of 2006 production from Libya will average approximately 20,000 to 25,000 boepd. In January 2006, the Corporation acquired a 55% working interest in the deepwater section of the West Med Block in Egypt for $413 million. The Corporation has a 25 year development lease for the West Med Block, which contains four existing natural gas discoveries and additional exploration opportunities. In 2006, the Corporation will complete the sale of its interests in certain producing properties located in the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico for $404 million, before purchase price adjustments. The net book value of these assets held for sale of approximately $70 million has been recorded in other current assets at December 31, 2005. The Corporation estimates that it will record an after tax gain of $160 million to $180 million in the first quarter on the sale of these assets. 31 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities on the Corporations balance sheet and revenues and expenses on the income statement. The accounting methods used can affect net income, stockholders equity and various financial statement ratios. However, the Corporations accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity. Accounting for Exploration and Development Costs: Exploration and production activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses, brokers fees and other related costs, are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are capitalized. The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found. Exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and (2) sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. If either of those criteria is not met, or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the capitalized well costs are charged to expense. Indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include: commitment of project personnel, active negotiations for sales contracts with customers, negotiations with governments, operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors. Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves: The determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities. The estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations, the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment, as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets. The Corporations oil and gas reserves are calculated in accordance with SEC regulations and interpretations and the requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board. For reserves to be booked as proved they must be commercially producible, government and project operator approvals must be obtained and depending on the amount of the project cost, senior management or the board of directors, must commit to fund the project. The Corporations oil and gas reserve estimation and reporting process involves an annual independent third party reserve determination as well as internal technical appraisals of reserves. The Corporation maintains its own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties. The Corporations technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells, performance reviews, new technical data and other studies. To provide consistency throughout the Corporation, standard reserve estimation guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and approval practices are used. The internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management reviews the estimates. The oil and gas reserve estimates reported in the Supplementary Oil and Gas Data in accordance with FAS No. 69 are determined independently by the consulting firm of DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&M) and are consistent with internal estimates. Annually, the Corporation provides D&M with engineering, geological and geophysical data, actual production histories and other information necessary for the reserve determination. The Corporations and D&Ms technical staffs meet to review and discuss the information provided. Senior management and the Board of Directors review the final reserve estimates issued by D&M. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Goodwill: As explained below there are significant differences in the way long lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing. The Corporation reviews long lived assets, including oil and gas fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered. Long lived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows (the field level for oil and gas assets) and are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying amounts of the long lived assets are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted future net cash flow estimates, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The 32 Table of Contents amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows. In the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future net cash flows is based on managements best estimate of future prices, which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices, applied to projected production volumes of individual fields and discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks involved. The projected production volumes represent reserves, including probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures. The production volumes, prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information. Oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, since the standardized measure requires the use of actual prices on the last day of the year. The Corporations impairment tests of long lived exploration and production producing assets are based on its best estimates of future production volumes (including recovery factors), selling prices, operating and capital costs and the timing of future production, which are updated each time an impairment test is performed. The Corporation could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields were reduced. Significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas selling prices could also result in asset impairments. In accordance with FAS No. 142, the Corporations goodwill is not amortized, but must be tested for impairment annually at a reporting unit level. The reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed. The Corporations goodwill is assigned to the exploration and production operating segment and it expects that the benefits of goodwill will be recovered through the operation of that segment. The Corporations fair value estimate of the exploration and production segment is the sum of: (1) the discounted anticipated cash flows of producing assets and known developments, (2) the estimated risked present value of exploration assets, and (3) an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential synergies including cost savings, access to new business opportunities, enterprise control, improved processes and increased market share. The Corporation also considers the relative market valuation of similar exploration and production companies. The determination of the fair value of the exploration and production operating segment depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves, future prices, timing of future net cash flows and market premiums. Significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of the exploration and production operating segment that could result in an impairment of goodwill. Because there are significant differences in the way long lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing, there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned to the exploration and production segment. Segments: The Corporation has two operating segments, exploration and production and marketing and refining. Management has determined that these are its operating segments because, in accordance with FAS No. 131, these are the segments of the Corporation (i) that engage in business activities from which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred, (ii) whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Corporations chief operating decision maker (CODM) to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance and (iii) for which discrete financial information is available. The Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation, is the CODM as defined in FAS No. 131, because he is responsible for performing the functions within the Corporation of allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, the Corporations operating segments. Hedging: The Corporation may use futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination, to reduce the effects of fluctuations in crude oil, natural gas and refined product prices. Related hedge gains or losses are an integral part of the selling or purchase prices. Generally, these derivatives are designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges) and the changes in fair 33 Table of Contents value are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. These transactions meet the requirements for hedge accounting, including correlation. The Corporations hedges are tested prospectively before they are executed and both prospectively and retrospectively on an on going basis to ensure they continue to qualify for hedge accounting. The prospective and retrospective effectiveness calculations are performed using a historical simulation model. The simulation utilizes historical observable market data consisting of futures curves and spot prices. At December 31, 2005, the Corporation has $1,304 million of deferred hedging losses, after income taxes, included in accumulated other comprehensive income. The Corporation reclassifies hedging gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings at the time the hedged transactions are recognized. The ineffective portion of hedges is included in current earnings. The Corporations remaining derivatives, including foreign currency contracts, are not designated as hedges and the change in fair value is included in income currently. Income Taxes: Judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements. The Corporation has net operating loss carryforwards in several jurisdictions, including the United States, and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses. Additionally, the Corporation has deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities. Regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized. If it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized. In evaluating realizability of deferred tax assets, the Corporation refers to the reversal periods for temporary differences, available carryforward periods for net operating losses, estimates of future taxable income, the availability of tax planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets and other factors. Estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the Corporations internal business forecasts. New Accounting Standard: In 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board reissued Statement No. 123, Share Based Payment (FAS 123R). This standard requires that compensation expense for all stock based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, be recognized in the income statement based on fair values. The Corporation adopted FAS 123R as of January 1, 2006. The actual cost of expensing stock options in 2006 and future periods will be based on a number of factors, including the amount of options granted, the terms of such awards and the stock price at the time of grant. The Corporation estimates that the cost of unvested options at December 31, 2005 and the annual grant of employee stock options in February 2006, will increase compensation expense in 2006 by approximately $30 million, before income taxes. Awards of restricted common stock are expensed over the vesting period under existing accounting requirements and will continue to be expensed under FAS 123R. Environment, Health and Safety The Corporation has implemented a values based, socially responsible strategy focused on improving environment, health and safety performance and making a positive impact on communities. The strategy is supported by the Corporations environment, health, safety and social responsibility (EHS & SR) policies and by environment and safety management systems that help protect the Corporations workforce, customers and local communities. The Corporations management systems are designed to uphold or exceed international standards and are intended to promote internal consistency, adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in EHS & SR performance. Improved performance may, in the short term, increase the Corporations operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to assets, reputation and license to operate. In addition to enhanced EHS & SR performance, improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be captured as collateral benefits from investments in EHS & SR. While overall governance is the responsibility of senior management, the Corporation has programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance, audit facilities, train employees and to generally meet corporate EHS & SR goals. 34 Table of Contents The production of motor and other fuels in the United States and elsewhere has faced increasing regulatory pressures in recent years. In 2004, new regulations went into effect that have already significantly reduced gasoline sulfur content and additional regulations to reduce the allowable sulfur content in diesel fuel went into effect in 2006. Additional reductions in gasoline and fuel oil sulfur content are under consideration. Fuels production will likely continue to be subject to more stringent regulation in future years and as such may require additional capital expenditures. Estimated capital expenditures necessary to comply with low sulfur gasoline requirements at Port Reading will approximate $75 million, $23 million of which was spent in 2005. The remainder is expected to be spent in 2006. Capital expenditures to comply with low sulfur gasoline and diesel fuel requirements at HOVENSA are presently expected to be approximately $410 million in total, $160 million of which has already been spent. Capital expenditures for low sulfur requirements are expected to be $200 million in 2006, with the remainder in 2007. HOVENSA plans to finance these capital expenditures through cash flow from operations. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 eliminates the Clean Air Acts mandatory oxygen content requirement for reformulated gasoline and imposes on refiners a requirement to use specific quantities of renewable content in gasoline. Many states have also enacted bans on the use of MTBE in gasoline, many of which will take effect in 2007 2009. As a result, several companies have announced their intention to cease using MTBE, since it will no longer be needed in reformulated gasoline to comply with the Clean Air Act and does not meet the new renewable content requirement. In response to these changes in the gasoline marketplace, the Corporation and HOVENSA will phase out the use of ether based oxygenates in the spring of 2006. The phase out may adversely affect the amount and type of fuels produced at HOVENSA and Port Reading. Both companies are reviewing the most cost effective means to replace ether unit processing capabilities, which may necessitate additional capital investments. The Corporation and HOVENSA are preparing to meet the renewable content requirement for gasoline and do not anticipate that the impact of this requirement will be significant. As described in Item 3 Legal Proceedings, in 2003 the Corporation and HOVENSA began discussions with the U.S. EPA regarding the EPAs Petroleum Refining Initiative (PRI). The PRI is an ongoing program that is designed to reduce certain air emissions at all U.S. refineries. Since 2000, the EPA has entered into settlements addressing these emissions with petroleum refining companies that control over 77% of the domestic refining capacity. Negotiations with the EPA are continuing and depending on the outcome of these discussions, the Corporation and HOVENSA may experience increased capital expenditures and operating expenses related to air emissions controls. Settlements with other refiners allow for controls to be phased in over several years. HOVENSA is constructing a new wastewater treatment system at the refinery. This project will significantly enhance the refinerys ability to treat wastewater and better protect the marine environment of St. Croix. The cost to complete the project is approximately $120 million, of which $32 million has already been incurred. The Corporation recognizes the worldwide concern about the environmental and social impact of air emissions. On a global scale, climate change is an issue that has prompted much public debate and has a potential impact on future economic growth and development. The Corporation has undertaken a program to assess, monitor and reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane. The challenges associated with this program may be significant, not only from the standpoint of technical feasibility, but also from the perspective of adequately measuring the Corporations greenhouse gas inventory. The Corporation has recently completed a revised monitoring protocol which will allow for better measurement and control of greenhouse gases. The Corporation expects continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation related primarily to existing conditions. Sites where corrective action may be necessary include gasoline stations, terminals, onshore exploration and production facilities, refineries (including solid waste management units under permits issued pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act) and, although not currently significant, Superfund sites where the Corporation has been named a potentially responsible party. 35 Table of Contents The Corporation accrues for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable. At year end 2005, the Corporations reserve for its estimated environmental liability was approximately $77 million. The Corporation expects that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites. The Corporations remediation spending was $15 million in 2005, $12 million in 2004 and $12 million in 2003. Capital expenditures for facilities, primarily to comply with federal, state and local environmental standards, other than for low sulfur projects discussed above, were $3 million in 2005, $1 million in 2004 and $7 million in 2003. Forward Looking Information Certain sections of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, including references to the Corporations future results of operations and financial position, liquidity and capital resources, capital expenditures, oil and gas production, tax rates, debt repayment, hedging, derivative, market risk and environmental disclosures, off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations and contingencies include forward looking information. Forward looking disclosures are based on the Corporations current understanding and assessment of these activities and reasonable assumptions about the future. Actual results may differ from these disclosures because of changes in market conditions, government actions and other factors. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk In the normal course of its business, the Corporation is exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the price of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and electricity, as well as to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. In the disclosures that follow, these operations are referred to as non trading activities. The Corporation also has trading operations, principally through a 50% voting interest in a trading partnership. These activities are also exposed to commodity risks primarily related to the prices of crude oil, natural gas and refined products. The following describes how these risks are controlled and managed. Controls: The Corporation maintains a control environment under the direction of its chief risk officer and through its corporate risk policy, which the Corporations senior management has approved. Controls include volumetric, term and value at risk limits. In addition, the chief risk officer must approve the use of new instruments or commodities. Risk limits are monitored daily and exceptions are reported to business units and to senior management. The Corporations risk management department also performs independent verifications of sources of fair values and validations of valuation models. These controls apply to all of the Corporations non trading and trading activities, including the consolidated trading partnership. The Corporations treasury department administers foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs. Instruments: The Corporation primarily uses forward commodity contracts, foreign exchange forward contracts, futures, swaps, options and energy commodity based securities in its non trading and trading activities. These contracts are widely traded instruments mainly with standardized terms. The following describes these instruments and how the Corporation uses them: Forward Commodity Contracts: The forward purchase and sale of commodities is performed as part of the Corporations normal activities. At settlement date, the notional value of the contract is exchanged for physical delivery of the commodity. Forward contracts that are designated as normal purchase and sale contracts under FAS No. 133 are excluded from the quantitative market risk disclosures. In some cases, physical purchase and sale contracts are used as trading instruments and are included in trading results. Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts: Forward contracts include forward purchase contracts for both the British pound sterling and the Danish kroner. These foreign currency contracts commit the Corporation to purchase a fixed amount of pound sterling and kroner at a predetermined exchange rate on a certain date. 36 Table of Contents Futures: The Corporation uses exchange traded futures contracts on a number of different underlying energy commodities. These contracts are settled daily with the relevant exchange and are subject to exchange position limits. Swaps: The Corporation uses financially settled swap contracts with third parties as part of its hedging and trading activities. Cash flows from swap contracts are determined based on underlying commodity prices and are typically settled over the life of the contract. Options: Options on various underlying energy commodities include exchange traded and third party contracts and have various exercise periods. As a seller of options, the Corporation receives a premium at the outset and bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the commodity underlying the option. As a purchaser of options, the Corporation pays a premium at the outset and has the right to participate in the favorable price movements in the underlying commodities. These premiums are a component of the fair value of the options. Energy Commodity Based Securities: Securities where the price is based on the price of an underlying energy commodity. These securities may be issued by a company or government. Value at Risk: The Corporation uses value at risk to monitor and control commodity risk within its trading and non trading activities. The value at risk model uses historical simulation and the results represent the potential loss in fair value over one day at a 95% confidence level. The model captures both first and second order sensitivities for options. The following table summarizes the value at risk results for trading and non trading activities. These results may vary from time to time as strategies change in trading activities or hedging levels change in non trading activities. Trading Non Trading Activities Activities (Millions of dollars) 2005 At December 31 $ 18 $ 93 Average for the year 11 111 High during the year 18 127 Low during the year 7 93 2004 At December 31 $ 17 $ 108 Average for the year 12 90 High during the year 17 111 Low during the year 7 52 Non Trading: The Corporations non trading activities may include hedging of crude oil and natural gas production. Futures and swaps are used to fix the selling prices of a portion of the Corporations future production and the related gains or losses are an integral part of the Corporations selling prices. Following is a summary of the Corporations outstanding crude oil hedges at December 31, 2005: Brent Crude Oil Average Thousands of Maturity Selling Price Barrels per Day 2006 $ 28.10 30 2007 25.85 24 2008 25.56 24 2009 25.54 24 2010 25.78 24 2011 26.37 24 2012 26.90 24 37 Table of Contents There were no hedges of WTI crude oil or natural gas production at year end. As market conditions change, the Corporation may adjust its hedge percentages. The Corporation also markets energy commodities including refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity. The Corporation uses futures and swaps to manage the risk in its marketing activities.
