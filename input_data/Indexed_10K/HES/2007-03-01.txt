Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview The Corporation is a global integrated energy company that operates in two segments, Exploration and Production (E&P) and Marketing and Refining (M&R). The E&P segment explores for, develops, produces, purchases, transports and sells crude oil and natural gas. The M&R segment manufactures, purchases, transports, trades and markets refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity. Net income in 2006 was $1,916 million compared with $1,242 million in 2005 and $977 million in 2004. Diluted earnings per share were $6.07 in 2006 compared with $3.98 in 2005 and $3.19 in 2004. Exploration and Production The Corporations strategy for the E&P segment is to profitably grow reserves and production in a sustainable and financially disciplined manner. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Corporations total proved reserves were 1,243 million and 1,093 million barrels of oil equivalent. The following table summarizes the components of proved reserves as of December 31: 2006 2005 Crude oil and condensate (millions of barrels) U.S. 138 17 % 124 18 % International 694 83 568 82 Total 832 100 % 692 100 % Natural gas (millions of mcf) U.S. 236 10 % 282 12 % International 2,230 90 2,124 88 Total 2,466 100 % 2,406 100 % E&P net income was $1,763 million in 2006, $1,058 million in 2005 and $762 million in 2004. The improved results were primarily driven by higher average crude oil selling prices during the reporting period and lower hedged crude oil volumes in 2006. See further discussion in Comparison of Results on page 24. Production totaled 359,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in 2006, 335,000 boepd in 2005 and 342,000 boepd in 2004. The Corporation estimates that production will be approximately 370,000 boepd to 380,000 boepd in 2007. During 2006, the Corporation commenced production from four new field developments: The Atlantic (Hess 25%) and Cromarty (Hess 90%) natural gas fields in the United Kingdom came onstream in June 2006 and produced at a combined net rate of approximately 95,000 mcf per day in the second half of the year. The Okume Complex development (Hess 85%) in Equatorial Guinea commenced production in December. Additional development activities are planned throughout 2007. The Corporation estimates that its net share of 2007 production will average approximately 20,000 boepd. First production from the Phu Horm onshore gas project (Hess 35%) in Thailand commenced in November. The Corporation estimates that its net share of 2007 production will average approximately 30,000 mcf per day. Phase 2 production from the ACG fields (Hess 2.7%) in Azerbaijan also commenced during 2006. The Corporation has several additional development projects that will also increase production in the future: Development of the Shenzi field (Hess 28%) in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico was sanctioned and first production is anticipated in the second half of 2009. 20 Table of Contents The Genghis Khan field (Hess 28%) was acquired by the Shenzi partners in February 2007. The field is part of the same geologic structure as the Shenzi development and first production is anticipated in the second half of 2007. The Ujung Pangkah field (Hess 75%) in Indonesia is scheduled to commence production of natural gas by mid 2007 under an existing gas sales agreement for 440 million mcf (gross) over a 20 year period with an expected plateau rate of 100,000 mcf per day (gross). The Corporations plans for Ujung Pangkah in 2007 also include drilling additional development wells and the commencement of a crude oil development project. Capital investments in the JDA (Hess 50%) will be made during 2007 which will be primarily focused on facilities expansion and development drilling associated with the anticipated commencement of additional contracted gas sales of 400,000 mcf per day (gross) in 2008. It is anticipated that production associated with these additional gas sales will begin ramping up in the fourth quarter of 2007. Development of the residual oil zone at the Seminole San Andres Unit (Hess 34.3%) in the Permian Basin is expected to commence in 2007 and production is anticipated to begin in 2009. During 2006, the Corporations exploration program had several successes, particularly in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico: An exploration well on the Corporations Pony prospect on Green Canyon Block 468 (Hess 100%) in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico encountered 475 feet of oil saturated sandstone in Miocene age reservoirs. Drilling of an appraisal sidetrack well on the Pony Prospect was completed in January 2007 which encountered 280 feet of oil saturated sandstone in Miocene age reservoirs after penetrating 60% of its geological objective. Drilling of the sidetrack well was stopped for mechanical reasons after successfully recovering 450 feet of conventional core. The Corporation is currently drilling an appraisal well about 7,400 feet northwest of the discovery well. On the Tubular Bells prospect (Hess 20%) in the Mississippi Canyon area of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico a successful appraisal well encountered hydrocarbons approximately 5 miles from the initial discovery well. The operator intends to drill two sidetrack wells in 2007 which will further delineate the field. In addition, during 2006, the Corporation made the following acquisitions and also disposed of several producing properties: In January 2006, the Corporation, in conjunction with its Oasis Group partners, re entered its former oil and gas production operations in the Waha concessions (Hess 8.16%) in Libya. The re entry terms include a 25 year extension of the concessions and payments by the Corporation to the Libyan National Oil Corporation of $359 million. The Corporations net share of 2006 production from Libya averaged 23,000 barrels of oil per day. The Corporation acquired a 55% working interest in the deepwater section of the West Mediterranean Block 1 Concession (the West Med Block) in Egypt for $413 million. The Corporation has a 25 year development lease for the West Med Block, which contains four existing natural gas discoveries and additional exploration opportunities. During 2006, the Corporation completed the sale of its interests in certain producing properties in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico and certain U.S. Gulf Coast oil and gas producing assets. These asset sales generated total proceeds of $444 million after closing adjustments and an aggregate after tax gain of $236 million ($369 million before income taxes). Total net production from assets sold was approximately 8,000 boepd at the time of sale. Marketing and Refining The Corporations strategy for the M&R segment is to deliver consistent financial performance and generate free cash flow. M&R net income was $390 million in 2006, $515 million in 2005 and $451 million in 2004. Total Marketing and Refining earnings decreased in 2006 due to lower margins on refined product sales. Refining 21 Table of Contents operations contributed net income of $236 million in 2006, $346 million in 2005 and $302 million in 2004. Profitability in 2006 was adversely affected by lower refined product margins. Refining facilities at the HOVENSA joint venture and at Port Reading performed reliably in 2006 with the exception of 22 days of unplanned downtime at HOVENSA early in the year. The Corporation received cash distributions from HOVENSA totaling $400 million in 2006 and $275 million in 2005. In 2006, the Corporations Port Reading facility completed its $72 million program for complying with low sulfur gasoline requirements. Capital expenditures to comply with low sulfur gasoline and diesel fuel requirements at HOVENSA are estimated to be approximately $420 million, of which $360 million has been incurred through the end of 2006 with the remainder to be spent in 2007. Marketing earnings were $108 million in 2006, $136 million in 2005 and $112 million in 2004. During 2006 and 2005, the Corporation selectively expanded its energy marketing business by acquiring natural gas and electricity customer accounts. Liquidity and Capital and Exploratory Expenditures Net cash provided by operating activities was $3,491 million in 2006 compared with $1,840 million in 2005. At December 31, 2006, cash and cash equivalents totaled $383 million compared with $315 million at December 31, 2005. Total debt was $3,772 million at December 31, 2006 compared with $3,785 million at December 31, 2005. The Corporations debt to capitalization ratio at December 31, 2006 was 31.7% compared with 37.6% at the end of 2005. The Corporation has debt maturities of $27 million in 2007 and $28 million in 2008. Capital and exploratory expenditures were as follows for the years ended December 31: 2006 2005 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and Production United States $ 908 $ 353 International 2,979 2,031 Total Exploration and Production 3,887 2,384 Marketing, Refining and Corporate 169 106 Total Capital and Exploratory Expenditures $ 4,056 $ 2,490 Exploration expenses charged to income included above: United States $ 110 $ 89 International 102 60 $ 212 $ 149 The Corporation anticipates $4.0 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures in 2007, of which $3.9 billion relates to E&P operations. These expenditures include $371 million for the acquisition of a 28% interest in the Genghis Khan development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. 22 Table of Contents Consolidated Results of Operations The after tax results by major operating activity are summarized below: 2006 2005 2004 (Millions of dollars, except per share data) Exploration and Production $ 1,763 $ 1,058 $ 755 Marketing and Refining 390 515 451 Corporate (110 ) (191 ) (85 ) Interest expense (127 ) (140 ) (151 ) Income from continuing operations 1,916 1,242 970 Discontinued operations 7 Net income $ 1,916 $ 1,242 $ 977 Income per share from continuing operations diluted* $ 6.07 $ 3.98 $ 3.17 Net income per share diluted* $ 6.07 $ 3.98 $ 3.19 * Per share amounts in all periods reflect the impact of a 3 for 1 stock split on May 31, 2006. In the discussion that follows, the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after tax basis. Management reviews segment earnings on an after tax basis and uses after tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings. Management believes that after tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre tax amount. After tax amounts are determined by applying the appropriate income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre tax amounts. The following items of income (expense), on an after tax basis, are included in net income: 2006 2005 2004 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and Production Gains from asset sales $ 236 $ 41 $ 54 Income tax adjustments (45 ) 11 19 Accrued office closing costs (18 ) (9 ) Hurricane related costs (26 ) Legal settlement 11 Marketing and Refining LIFO inventory liquidation 32 12 Charge related to customer bankruptcy (8 ) Corporate Tax on repatriated earnings (72 ) Premiums on bond repurchases (26 ) Income tax adjustments 13 Insurance accrual (13 ) $ 173 $ (37 ) $ 76 The items in the table above are explained, and the pre tax amounts are shown, on pages 26 through 29. 23 Table of Contents Comparison of Results Exploration and Production Following is a summarized income statement of the Corporations Exploration and Production operations: 2006 2005 2004 (Millions of dollars) Sales and other operating revenues $ 6,524 $ 4,210 $ 3,416 Non operating income 428 94 90 Total revenues 6,952 4,304 3,506 Costs and expenses Production expenses, including related taxes 1,250 1,007 825 Exploration expenses, including dry holes and lease impairment 552 397 287 General, administrative and other expenses 209 140 150 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 1,159 965 918 Total costs and expenses 3,170 2,509 2,180 Results of operations from continuing operations before income taxes 3,782 1,795 1,326 Provision for income taxes 2,019 737 571 Results from continuing operations 1,763 1,058 755 Discontinued operations 7 Results of operations $ 1,763 $ 1,058 $ 762 After considering the Exploration and Production items in the table on page 23, the remaining changes in Exploration and Production earnings are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices, production volumes, operating costs, exploration expenses and income taxes, as discussed below. Selling prices: Higher average crude oil selling prices and reduced hedge positions increased Exploration and Production revenues by approximately $1,900 million in 2006 compared with 2005. In 2005, the change in average selling prices increased revenues by approximately $870 million compared with 2004. The Corporations average selling prices were as follows: 2006 2005 2004 Crude oil per barrel (including hedging) United States $ 60.45 $ 32.64 $ 27.42 Europe 56.19 33.13 26.18 Africa 51.18 32.10 26.35 Asia and other 61.52 54.71 38.36 Worldwide 55.31 33.38 26.70 Crude oil per barrel (excluding hedging) United States $ 60.45 $ 51.16 $ 38.56 Europe 58.46 52.22 37.57 Africa 62.80 51.70 37.07 Asia and other 61.52 54.71 38.36 Worldwide 60.41 51.94 37.64 24 Table of Contents 2006 2005 2004 Natural gas liquids per barrel United States $ 46.22 $ 38.50 $ 29.50 Europe 47.30 37.13 27.44 Worldwide 46.59 38.08 28.81 Natural gas per mcf United States $ 6.59 $ 7.93 $ 5.18 Europe 6.20 5.29 3.96 Asia and other 4.05 4.02 3.90 Worldwide 5.50 5.65 4.31 The after tax impacts of hedging reduced earnings by $285 million ($449 million before income taxes) in 2006, $989 million ($1,582 million before income taxes) in 2005 and $583 million ($935 million before income taxes) in 2004. Production and sales volumes: The Corporations crude oil and natural gas production was 359,000 boepd in 2006, 335,000 boepd in 2005 and 342,000 boepd in 2004. The Corporation anticipates that its 2007 production will average between 370,000 and 380,000 boepd. The Corporations net daily worldwide production was as follows: 2006 2005 2004 Crude oil (thousands of barrels per day) United States 36 44 44 Europe 109 110 119 Africa 85 67 61 Asia and other 12 7 4 Total 242 228 228 Natural gas liquids (thousands of barrels per day) United States 10 12 12 Europe 5 4 6 Total 15 16 18 Natural gas (thousands of mcf per day) United States 110 137 171 Europe 283 274 319 Asia and other 219 133 85 Total 612 544 575 Barrels of oil equivalent* (thousands of barrels per day) 359 335 342 * Reflects natural gas production converted on the basis of relative energy content (six mcf equals one barrel). Crude oil and natural gas production in the United States was lower in 2006 due to asset sales and natural decline. Production in Europe was comparable in 2006 and 2005, reflecting increased production from Russia and new production from the Atlantic and Cromarty natural gas fields in the United Kingdom, which offset lower production due to maintenance and natural decline. Increased crude oil production in Africa in 2006 was primarily due to production from Libya. Natural gas production in Asia was higher in 2006 due to increased production from the JDA. 25 Table of Contents Higher sales volumes increased revenue by approximately $400 million in 2006 compared with 2005. Decreased sales volumes resulted in lower revenue of approximately $80 million in 2005 compared with 2004. Operating costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization: Cash operating costs, consisting of production expenses and general and administrative expenses, increased by $322 million in 2006 and $147 million in 2005 compared with the corresponding amounts in prior years, excluding the charges for vacated leased office space and hurricane related costs discussed below. Production expenses increased in 2006 and 2005, principally reflecting higher maintenance expenses, increased costs of services, materials and fuel and higher production taxes resulting from higher oil prices. Production expenses also increased in 2006 due to the re entry into Libya and continued expansion of operations in Russia and the JDA. Depreciation, depletion and amortization charges were higher in 2006, principally reflecting increased production volumes and higher per barrel rates, due to new production from the Atlantic and Cromarty fields and higher asset retirement obligations. Depreciation, depletion and amortization charges were higher in 2005 versus 2004, principally due to higher per barrel rates. Cash operating costs per barrel of oil equivalent were $10.92 in 2006, $9.07 in 2005 and $7.67 in 2004. Cash operating costs for 2007 are estimated to be in the range of $12.00 to $13.00 per barrel, reflecting industry wide cost increases and the timing of achieving peak production from new fields. Depreciation, depletion and amortization costs per barrel of oil equivalent were $8.85 in 2006, $7.88 in 2005 and $7.34 in 2004. Depreciation, depletion and related costs for 2007 are expected to be in the range of $10.00 to $11.00 per barrel. The anticipated increase is due to new fields, including the Okume Complex, which has allocated acquisition cost in its depreciable base. Exploration expenses: Exploration expenses were higher in 2006, primarily reflecting higher dry hole costs. Exploration expenses were higher in 2005 compared with 2004 as a result of increased drilling and seismic activity. Income Taxes: The effective income tax rate for Exploration and Production operations was 53% in 2006, 41% in 2005 and 43% in 2004. After considering the items in the table below, the effective income tax rates were 54% in 2006, 42% in 2005 and 46% in 2004. The increase in the 2006 effective income tax rate was primarily due to taxes on Libyan operations and the increase in the supplementary tax on petroleum operations in the United Kingdom from 10% to 20%. During 2006, the Algerian government amended its hydrocarbon tax laws effective August 1, 2006 and the Corporation recorded a net charge of $6 million for the estimated impact of the tax. The effective income tax rate for E&P operations in 2007 is expected to be in the range of 52% to 56%. Other: After tax foreign currency gains were $10 million ($21 million before income taxes) in 2006, $20 million ($3 million loss before income taxes) in 2005, and $6 million ($29 million before income taxes) in 2004. Reported Exploration and Production earnings include the following items of income (expense) before and after income taxes: Before Income Taxes After Income Taxes 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 (Millions of dollars) Gains from asset sales $ 369 $ 48 $ 55 $ 236 $ 41 $ 54 Income tax adjustments (45 ) 11 19 Accrued office closing costs (30 ) (15 ) (18 ) (9 ) Hurricane related costs (40 ) (26 ) Legal settlement 19 11 $ 339 $ 27 $ 40 $ 173 $ 37 $ 64 2006: The gains from asset sales relate to the sale of certain United States oil and gas producing properties located in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico and onshore Gulf Coast. The accrued office closing cost relates to vacated leased office space in the United Kingdom. The income tax adjustment represents a one time adjustment to the Corporations deferred tax liability resulting from an increase in the supplementary tax on petroleum operations in the United Kingdom from 10% to 20%. 26 Table of Contents 2005: The gains from asset sales represent the disposal of non producing properties in the United Kingdom and the exchange of a mature North Sea asset for an increased interest in the Pangkah development in Indonesia. The Corporation incurred incremental expenses in 2005, principally repair costs and higher insurance premiums, as a result of hurricane damage in the Gulf of Mexico that are included in production expenses in the income statement. The income tax adjustment reflects the effect on deferred income taxes of a reduction in the income tax rate in Denmark and a tax settlement in the United Kingdom. The legal settlement reflects the favorable resolution of contingencies on a prior year asset sale, which is reflected in non operating income in the income statement. 2004: The Corporation recognized gains from the sales of an office building in Scotland, a non producing property in Malaysia and two mature Gulf of Mexico properties. It also recorded foreign income tax benefits resulting from a change in tax law and a tax settlement. The Corporation recorded an after tax charge for vacated leased office space in the United Kingdom and severance costs, which is reflected in general and administrative expenses in the income statement. The Corporations future Exploration and Production earnings may be impacted by external factors, such as political risk, volatility in the selling prices of crude oil and natural gas, reserve and production changes, industry cost inflation, exploration expenses, the effects of weather and changes in foreign exchange and income tax rates. Marketing and Refining Earnings from Marketing and Refining activities amounted to $390 million in 2006, $515 million in 2005 and $451 million in 2004. After considering the Marketing and Refining items in the table on page 23, the earnings amounted to $390 million in 2006, $491 million in 2005 and $439 million in 2004 and are discussed in the paragraphs below. The Corporations downstream operations include HOVENSA, a 50% owned refining joint venture with a subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) that is accounted for using the equity method. Additional Marketing and Refining activities include a fluid catalytic cracking facility in Port Reading, New Jersey, as well as retail gasoline stations, energy marketing and trading operations. Refining: Refining earnings, which consist of the Corporations share of HOVENSAs results, Port Reading earnings, interest income on a note receivable from PDVSA and other miscellaneous items were $236 million in 2006, $346 million in 2005 and $302 million in 2004. The Corporations share of HOVENSAs net income was $125 million ($203 million before income taxes) in 2006 and $231 million ($376 million before income taxes) in 2005 and $216 million ($244 million before income taxes) in 2004. The lower earnings in 2006 were principally due to lower refined product margins. Refined product margins were higher in 2005 compared with 2004. In 2006 and 2005, the Corporation provided income taxes at the Virgin Islands statutory rate of 38.5% on HOVENSAs income and the interest income on the note receivable from PDVSA. In 2004, income taxes on HOVENSAs earnings were partially offset by available loss carryforwards. In 2006, the fluid catalytic cracking unit was shutdown for approximately 22 days of unscheduled maintenance. During 2005, a crude unit and the fluid catalytic cracking unit at HOVENSA were each shutdown for approximately 30 days of scheduled maintenance. Cash distributions from HOVENSA were $400 million in 2006, $275 million in 2005 and $88 million in 2004. Pre tax interest on the PDVSA note was $15 million, $20 million and $25 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Interest income is reflected in non operating income in the income statement. At December 31, 2006, the remaining balance of the PDVSA note was $137 million, which is scheduled to be fully repaid by February 2009. Port Readings after tax earnings were $99 million in 2006, $100 million in 2005 and $60 million in 2004. Higher refined product sales volumes were offset by lower margins in 2006 compared with 2005. Refined product margins were higher in 2005 compared with 2004. In 2005, the Port Reading facility was shutdown for 36 days of planned maintenance. 27 Table of Contents The following table summarizes refinery utilization rates: Refinery Refinery Utilization Capacity 2006 2005 2004 (Thousands of barrels per day) HOVENSA Crude 500 89.7% 92.2% 96.7% Fluid catalytic cracker 150 84.3% 81.9% 92.9% Coker 58 84.3% 92.8% 94.5% Port Reading 65 97.4% 85.3% 83.4% Marketing: Marketing operations, which consist principally of retail gasoline and energy marketing activities, generated income of $108 million in 2006, $112 million in 2005 and $100 million in 2004, excluding the income from liquidation of LIFO inventories and the charge related to a customer bankruptcy described below. The decrease in 2006 primarily reflects lower margins on refined product sales. The increase in 2005 was primarily due to higher margins and increased sales volumes compared with 2004. Total refined product sales volumes were 459,000 barrels per day in 2006, 456,000 barrels per day in 2005 and 428,000 barrels per day in 2004. The Corporation has a 50% voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades energy commodities and energy derivatives. The Corporation also takes trading positions for its own account. The Corporations after tax results from trading activities, including its share of the earnings of the trading partnership, amounted to income of $46 million in 2006, $33 million in 2005 and $37 million in 2004. Before income taxes, the trading income amounted to $83 million in 2006, $60 million in 2005 and $72 million in 2004 and is included in operating revenues in the income statement. Marketing expenses increased due to higher expenses resulting from an increased number of retail convenience stores, growth in energy marketing operations, and higher utility and compensation related costs. Reported Marketing and Refining earnings include the following items of income (expense) before and after income taxes: Before Income Taxes After Income Taxes 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 (Millions of dollars) LIFO inventory liquidation $ $ 51 $ 20 $ $ 32 $ 12 Charge related to customer bankruptcy (13 ) (8 ) $ $ 38 $ 20 $ $ 24 $ 12 In 2005 and 2004, Marketing and Refining earnings include income from the liquidation of prior year LIFO inventories. In 2005, earnings include a charge resulting from the bankruptcy of a customer in the utility industry, which is included in marketing expenses. The Corporations future Marketing and Refining earnings may be impacted by volatility in Marketing and Refining margins, competitive industry conditions, government regulatory changes, credit risk and supply and demand factors, including the effects of weather. 28 Table of Contents Corporate The following table summarizes corporate expenses: 2006 2005 2004 (Millions of dollars) Corporate expenses (excluding the items listed below) $ 156 $ 119 $ 116 Income taxes (benefits) on the above (46 ) (26 ) (31 ) 110 93 85 Items affecting comparability between periods, after tax Tax on repatriated earnings 72 Premiums on bond repurchases 26 Income tax adjustments (13 ) Insurance accrual 13 Net corporate expenses $ 110 $ 191 $ 85 Excluding the items affecting comparability between periods, the increase in corporate expenses in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily reflects the expensing of stock options commencing January 1, 2006 and increases in insurance costs. Recurring after tax corporate expenses in 2007 are estimated to be in the range of $115 to $125 million. In 2005, the American Jobs Creation Act provided for a one time reduction in the income tax rate to 5.25% on the remittance of eligible dividends from foreign subsidiaries to a United States parent. The Corporation repatriated $1.9 billion of previously unremitted foreign earnings resulting in the recognition of an income tax provision of $72 million. The pre tax amount of bond repurchase premiums in 2005 was $39 million and is reflected in non operating income in the income statement. The pre tax amount of the 2004 corporate insurance accrual was $20 million and is reflected in non operating income. Interest After tax interest expense was as follows: 2006 2005 2004 (Millions of dollars) Total interest incurred $ 301 $ 304 $ 295 Less capitalized interest 100 80 54 Interest expense before income taxes 201 224 241 Less income taxes 74 84 90 After tax interest expense $ 127 $ 140 $ 151 After tax interest expense in 2007 is expected to be in the range of $170 to $180 million, principally reflecting an anticipated decrease in capitalized interest due to the achievement of first production from several development projects. Sales and Other Operating Revenues Sales and other operating revenues totaled $28,067 million in 2006, an increase of 23% compared with 2005. The increase reflects higher selling prices of crude oil, higher sales volumes and reduced crude oil hedge positions in Exploration and Production activities and higher selling prices and sales volumes in marketing activities. In 2005, sales and other operating revenues totaled $22,747 million, an increase of 36% compared with 2004. This increase principally reflects higher selling prices of crude oil and natural gas in Exploration and Production and higher 29 Table of Contents selling prices and sales volumes in marketing activities. The change in cost of goods sold in each year reflects the change in sales volumes and prices of refined products and purchased natural gas. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table sets forth certain relevant measures of the Corporations liquidity and capital resources as of December 31: 2006 2005 (Millions of dollars) Cash and cash equivalents $ 383 $ 315 Current portion of long term debt $ 27 $ 26 Total debt $ 3,772 $ 3,785 Stockholders equity $ 8,111 $ 6,286 Debt to capitalization ratio* 31.7 % 37.6 % * Total debt as a percentage of the sum of total debt plus stockholders equity. Cash Flows The following table sets forth a summary of the Corporations cash flows: 2006 2005 2004 (Millions of dollars) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 3,491 $ 1,840 $ 1,903 Investing activities (3,289 ) (2,255 ) (1,371 ) Financing activities (134 ) (147 ) (173 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 68 $ (562 ) $ 359 Operating Activities: In 2006, net cash provided by operating activities, including changes in operating assets and liabilities, was $3,491 million, an increase of $1,651 million from 2005, principally reflecting higher earnings, changes in working capital accounts and increased distributions from HOVENSA. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,840 million in 2005 compared with $1,903 million in 2004. The change was due to higher earnings in 2005, offset by a decrease from changes in operating assets and liabilities, principally working capital, of $408 million. The Corporation received cash distributions from HOVENSA of $400 million in 2006, $275 million in 2005 and $88 million in 2004. Investing Activities: The following table summarizes the Corporations capital expenditures: 2006 2005 2004 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and Production Exploration $ 590 $ 229 $ 168 Production and development 2,164 1,598 1,204 Acquisitions (including leasehold) 921 408 62 3,675 2,235 1,434 Marketing, Refining and Corporate 169 106 87 Total $ 3,844 $ 2,341 $ 1,521 Capital expenditures in 2006 include payments of $359 million to acquire the Corporations former oil and gas production operations in the Waha concessions in Libya and $413 million to acquire a 55% working interest in the West Med Block in Egypt. 30 Table of Contents Proceeds from asset sales in 2006 totaled $444 million, including the sale of the Corporations interests in certain producing properties in the Permian Basin and onshore U.S. Gulf Coast. Proceeds from asset sales were $74 million and $57 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, principally from the sale of non producing properties. Financing Activities: The Corporation reduced debt by $13 million in 2006, $50 million in 2005 and $106 million in 2004. The net reductions in debt in 2006, 2005 and 2004 were funded by available cash and cash flow from operations. In 2005, bond repurchases of $600 million were funded by borrowings on the revolving credit facility in connection with the repatriation of foreign earnings to the United States. Dividends paid were $161 million in 2006, $159 million in 2005 and $157 million in 2004. The Corporation received proceeds from the exercise of stock options totaling $40 million, $62 million and $90 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Future Capital Requirements and Resources The Corporation anticipates $4.0 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures in 2007, of which $3.9 billion relates to Exploration and Production operations. The Corporation has maturities of long term debt of $27 million in 2007 and $28 million in 2008. The Corporation anticipates that it can fund its 2007 operations, including capital expenditures, dividends, pension contributions and required debt repayments, with existing cash on hand, cash flow from operations and its available credit facilities. During 2006, the Corporation amended and restated its existing syndicated, revolving credit facility (the facility) to increase the credit line to $3.0 billion from $2.5 billion and extend the term to May 2011 from December 2009. The facility can be used for borrowings and letters of credit. At December 31, 2006, the Corporation has $2.7 billion available under this facility. The Corporation has a 364 day asset backed credit facility securitized by certain accounts receivable from its Marketing and Refining operations, which are sold to a wholly owned subsidiary. Under the terms of this financing arrangement, the Corporation has the ability to borrow up to $800 million, subject to the availability of sufficient levels of eligible receivables. At December 31, 2006, the Corporation has $318 million in outstanding borrowings under this facility which was collateralized by approximately $1,100 million of receivables. These receivables are not available to pay the general obligations of the Corporation before repayment of outstanding borrowings under the asset backed facility. The Corporation has additional unused lines of credit of approximately $370 million, primarily for letters of credit, under uncommitted arrangements with banks. The Corporation also has a shelf registration under which it may issue additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or preferred stock. Outstanding letters of credit at December 31, were as follows: 2006 2005 (Millions of dollars) Lines of Credit Revolving credit facility $ 1 $ 28 Committed short term letter of credit facilities 1,875 1,675 Uncommitted lines 1,603 982 $ 3,479 $ 2,685 Loan agreement covenants allow the Corporation to borrow up to an additional $9.7 billion for the construction or acquisition of assets at December 31, 2006. The Corporation has the ability to borrow up to an additional $2.2 billion of secured debt at December 31, 2006 under the loan agreement covenants. At December 31, 2006, the maximum amount of dividends or stock repurchases that can be paid from borrowings under the loan agreement covenants is $3.7 billion. 31 Table of Contents Credit Ratings There are three major credit rating agencies that rate the Corporations debt. Two credit agencies have assigned an investment grade rating to the Corporations debt and one agency has rated it below investment grade. The interest rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment if the Corporations credit rating changes. In addition, if any one of the three rating agencies were to reduce their rating on the Corporations senior unsecured debt, margin requirements with non trading and trading counterparties at December 31, 2006 would increase by up to approximately $140 million. Contractual Obligations and Contingencies Following is a table showing aggregated information about certain contractual obligations at December 31, 2006: Payments Due by Period 2008 and 2010 and Total 2007 2009 2011 Thereafter (Millions of dollars) Long term debt(a) $ 3,772 $ 27 $ 171 $ 1,340 $ 2,234 Operating leases 2,471 630 567 198 1,076 Purchase obligations Supply commitments 25,800 8,381 8,990 8,429 (b ) Capital expenditures 1,109 809 263 37 Operating expenses 794 477 187 89 41 Other long term liabilities 1,316 65 285 220 746 (a) At December 31, 2006, the Corporations debt bears interest at a weighted average rate of 7.0%. (b) The Corporation intends to continue purchasing refined product supply from HOVENSA. Estimated future purchases amount to approximately $4.2 billion annually using year end 2006 prices. In the preceding table, the Corporations supply commitments include its estimated purchases of 50% of HOVENSAs production of refined products, after anticipated sales by HOVENSA to unaffiliated parties. The value of future supply commitments will fluctuate based on prevailing market prices at the time of purchase, the actual output from HOVENSA, and the level of sales to unaffiliated parties. Also included are term purchase agreements at market prices for additional gasoline necessary to supply the Corporations retail marketing system and feedstocks for the Port Reading refining facility. In addition, the Corporation has commitments to purchase refined products, natural gas and electricity for use in supplying contracted customers in its energy marketing business. These commitments were computed based on year end market prices. The table also reflects that portion of the Corporations planned $4 billion capital investment program for 2007 that is contractually committed at December 31, 2006. Obligations for operating expenses include commitments for transportation, seismic purchases, oil and gas production expenses and other normal business expenses. Other long term liabilities reflect contractually committed obligations on the balance sheet at December 31, including asset retirement obligations and pension plan funding requirements. At December 31, 2006, the Corporation had a remaining accrual of $49 million for vacated leased office space costs. In 2006, the Corporation recorded an additional $30 million charge for vacated leased office space ($18 million after income taxes) and made payments of $12 million. At December 31, 2005, the accrual was $31 million after reduction for payments of $8 million during 2005. The Corporation has a contingent purchase obligation, expiring in April 2010, to acquire the remaining interest in WilcoHess, a retail gasoline station joint venture, for approximately $140 million as of December 31, 2006. The Corporation guarantees the payment of up to 50% of HOVENSAs crude oil purchases from suppliers other than PDVSA. The amount of the Corporations guarantee fluctuates based on the volume of crude oil purchased and related prices and at December 31, 2006, amounted to $229 million. In addition, the Corporation has 32 Table of Contents agreed to provide funding up to a maximum of $15 million to the extent HOVENSA does not have funds to meet its senior debt obligations. At December 31, 2006, the Corporation has $3,427 million of letters of credit principally relating to accrued liabilities with hedging and trading counterparties recorded on its balance sheet. In addition, the Corporation is contingently liable under letters of credit and under guarantees of the debt of other entities directly related to its business, as follows: Total (Millions of dollars) Letters of credit $ 52 Guarantees 301 * $ 353 * Includes $15 million HOVENSA debt and $229 million crude oil purchase guarantees discussed above. The remainder relates to a loan guarantee of $57 million for an oil pipeline in which the Corporation owns a 2.36% interest. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Corporation has leveraged leases not included in its balance sheet, primarily related to retail gasoline stations that the Corporation operates. The net present value of these leases is $490 million at December 31, 2006 compared with $480 million at December 31, 2005. The Corporations December 31, 2006 debt to capitalization ratio would increase from 31.7% to 34.4% if these leases were included as debt. See also Contractual Obligations and Contingencies above, note 5, Refining Joint Venture, and note 16, Guarantees and Contingencies, in the notes to the financial statements. Stock Split On May 3, 2006, the Corporations shareholders voted to increase the number of authorized common shares from 200 million to 600 million and the board of directors declared a three for one stock split. The stock split was completed in the form of a stock dividend that was issued on May 31, 2006 to shareholders of record on May 17, 2006. The common share par value remained at $1.00 per share. All common share and per share amounts in the financial statements and notes and managements discussion and analysis are on an after split basis for all periods presented. Foreign Operations The Corporation conducts exploration and production activities in the United Kingdom, Norway, Denmark, Equatorial Guinea, Algeria, Malaysia, Thailand, Russia, Gabon, Azerbaijan, Indonesia, Libya, Egypt and other countries. Therefore, the Corporation is subject to the risks associated with foreign operations. These exposures include political risk (including tax law changes) and currency risk. HOVENSA L.L.C., owned 50% by the Corporation and 50% by Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), owns and operates a refinery in the United States Virgin Islands. In the past, there have been political disruptions in Venezuela that reduced the availability of Venezuelan crude oil used in refining operations; however, these disruptions did not have a material adverse effect on the Corporations financial position. The Corporation has a note receivable of $137 million at December 31, 2006 from a subsidiary of PDVSA. All payments are current and the Corporation anticipates collection of the remaining balance. Subsequent Events In February 2007, the Corporation completed the acquisition of a 28% interest in the Genghis Khan oil and gas development located in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico on Green Canyon Blocks 652 and 608 for $371 million. The Genghis Khan development is part of the same geologic structure as the Shenzi development (Hess 28%) and first production from this development is expected in the second half of 2007. 33 Table of Contents Accounting Policies Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities on the Corporations balance sheet and revenues and expenses on the income statement. The accounting methods used can affect net income, stockholders equity and various financial statement ratios. However, the Corporations accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity. Accounting for Exploration and Development Costs: Exploration and production activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses, brokers fees and other related costs, are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are capitalized. The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found. Exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and (2) sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. If either of those criteria is not met, or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the capitalized well costs are charged to expense. Indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include: commitment of project personnel, active negotiations for sales contracts with customers, negotiations with governments, operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors. Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves: The determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities. The estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations, the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment, as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill. The Corporations oil and gas reserves are calculated in accordance with SEC regulations and interpretations and the requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board. For reserves to be booked as proved they must be commercially producible, government and project operator approvals must be obtained and depending on the amount of the project cost, senior management or the board of directors, must commit to fund the project. The Corporations oil and gas reserve estimation and reporting process involves an annual independent third party reserve determination as well as internal technical appraisals of reserves. The Corporation maintains its own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties. The Corporations technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells, performance reviews, new technical data and other studies. To provide consistency throughout the Corporation, standard reserve estimation guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and approval practices are used. The internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management reviews the estimates. The oil and gas reserve estimates reported in the Supplementary Oil and Gas Data in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 69 Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing Activities (FAS No. 69) are determined independently by the consulting firm of DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&M) and are consistent with internal estimates. Annually, the Corporation provides D&M with engineering, geological and geophysical data, actual production histories and other information necessary for the reserve determination. The Corporations and D&Ms technical staffs meet to review and discuss the information provided. Senior management and the Board of Directors review the final reserve estimates issued by D&M. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Goodwill: As explained below there are significant differences in the way long lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing. The Corporation reviews long lived assets, including oil and gas fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered. Long lived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows (the field level for oil and gas assets) and are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying amounts of the long lived assets are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted future net cash flow 34 Table of Contents estimates, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows. In the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future net cash flows is based on managements best estimate of future prices, which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices, applied to projected production volumes of individual fields and discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks involved. The projected production volumes represent reserves, including probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures. The production volumes, prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information. Oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, since the standardized measure requires the use of actual prices on the last day of the year. The Corporations impairment tests of long lived Exploration and Production producing assets are based on its best estimates of future production volumes (including recovery factors), selling prices, operating and capital costs and the timing of future production, which are updated each time an impairment test is performed. The Corporation could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields were reduced. Significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas selling prices could also result in asset impairments. In accordance with FAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (FAS No. 142), the Corporations goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter at a reporting unit level. The reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed. The Corporations goodwill is assigned to the Exploration and Production operating segment and it expects that the benefits of goodwill will be recovered through the operation of that segment. The Corporations fair value estimate of the Exploration and Production segment is the sum of: (1) the discounted anticipated cash flows of producing assets and known developments, (2) the estimated risk adjusted present value of exploration assets, and (3) an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential synergies including cost savings, access to new business opportunities, enterprise control, improved processes and increased market share. The Corporation also considers the relative market valuation of similar Exploration and Production companies. The determination of the fair value of the Exploration and Production operating segment depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves, future prices, timing of future net cash flows and market premiums. Significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of the Exploration and Production operating segment that could result in an impairment of goodwill. Because there are significant differences in the way long lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing, there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned to the Exploration and Production segment. Segments: The Corporation has two operating segments, Exploration and Production and Marketing and Refining. Management has determined that these are its operating segments because, in accordance with FAS No. 131 Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information (FAS No. 131), these are the segments of the Corporation (i) that engage in business activities from which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred, (ii) whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Corporations chief operating decision maker (CODM) to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance and (iii) for which discrete financial information is available. The Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation, is the CODM as defined in FAS No. 131, because he is responsible for performing the functions within the Corporation of allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, the Corporations operating segments. Derivatives: The Corporation utilizes derivative instruments for both non trading and trading activities. In non trading activities, the Corporation uses futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and electricity, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In trading activities, the Corporation, principally through a consolidated 35 Table of Contents partnership, trades energy commodities derivatives, including futures, forwards, options and swaps, based on expectations of future market conditions. All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the Corporations balance sheet. The Corporations policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative. The changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges under FAS No. 133 are recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges) or hedges of firm commitments (fair value hedges). The effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings. The change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives that are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges are tested for effectiveness prospectively before they are executed and both prospectively and retrospectively on an on going basis to determine whether they continue to qualify for hedge accounting. The prospective and retrospective effectiveness calculations are performed using either historical simulation or other statistical models, which utilize historical observable market data consisting of futures curves and spot prices. Income Taxes: Judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements. The Corporation has net operating loss carryforwards in several jurisdictions, including the United States, and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses. Additionally, the Corporation has deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities. Regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized. If it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized. In evaluating realizability of deferred tax assets, the Corporation refers to the reversal periods for temporary differences, available carryforward periods for net operating losses, estimates of future taxable income, the availability of tax planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets and other factors. Estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the Corporations internal business forecasts. Changes in Accounting Policies Effective January 1, 2006, the Corporation adopted the provisions of FAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment (FAS No. 123R). FAS No. 123R requires that the fair value of all stock based compensation to employees, including grants of stock options, be expensed over the vesting period. Through December 31, 2005, the Corporation used the intrinsic value method to account for employee stock options. Because the exercise prices of employee stock options equaled or exceeded the market price of the stock on the date of grant, the Corporation did not recognize compensation expense under the intrinsic value method. See note 9, Share Based Compensation, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (FAS No. 158). FAS No. 158 requires recognition on the balance sheet of the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation. As required, the Corporation prospectively adopted the provisions of FAS No. 158 on December 31, 2006. See note 11, Retirement Plans, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In September 2006, the FASB issued Staff Position (FSP) AUG AIR 1, Accounting for Planned Major Maintenance Activities. This FSP eliminates the previously acceptable accrue in advance method of accounting for planned major maintenance. As a result, the Corporation will retrospectively change its method of accounting for 36 Table of Contents refinery turnarounds on January 1, 2007, the effective date of this pronouncement, to recognize expenses associated with refinery turnarounds when such costs are incurred. Under the retrospective method of adoption, the Corporation expects to increase 2006 earnings by approximately $4 million, reduce 2005 earnings by approximately $16 million and increase retained earnings as of January 1, 2005 by approximately $66 million. In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). FIN 48 prescribes the financial statement recognition and measurement criteria for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also requires additional disclosures related to uncertain income tax positions. As required, the Corporation will adopt the provisions of FIN 48 effective January 1, 2007. The Corporation has not concluded its evaluation of the impact of adopting FIN 48 on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (FAS No. 157). FAS No. 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy, which applies broadly to financial and non financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value under other authoritative accounting pronouncements. Additionally, the standard requires increased disclosure of the methods of determining fair value. The Corporation is currently evaluating the impact of adoption on its financial statements and, as required, the Corporation will adopt the provisions of FAS No. 157 effective January 1, 2008. Environment, Health and Safety The Corporation has implemented a values based, socially responsible strategy focused on improving environment, health and safety performance and making a positive impact on communities. The strategy is supported by the Corporations environment, health, safety and social responsibility (EHS & SR) policies and by environment and safety management systems that help protect the Corporations workforce, customers and local communities. The Corporations management systems are designed to uphold or exceed international standards and are intended to promote internal consistency, adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in EHS & SR performance. Improved performance may, in the short term, increase the Corporations operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to assets, reputation and license to operate. In addition to enhanced EHS & SR performance, improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be captured as collateral benefits from investments in EHS & SR. The Corporation has programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance, audit facilities, train employees and to generally meet corporate EHS & SR goals. The production of motor and other fuels in the United States and elsewhere has faced increasing regulatory pressures in recent years. In 2004, new regulations went into effect that have already significantly reduced gasoline sulfur content and additional regulations to reduce the allowable sulfur content in diesel fuel went into effect in 2006. Additional reductions in gasoline and fuel oil sulfur content are under consideration. Fuels production will likely continue to be subject to more stringent regulation in future years and as such may require additional capital expenditures. Capital expenditures necessary to comply with low sulfur gasoline requirements at Port Reading were $72 million, of which $23 million was spent in 2005 and the remainder was spent in 2006. Capital expenditures to comply with low sulfur gasoline and diesel fuel requirements at HOVENSA are presently expected to be approximately $420 million in total, $360 million of which has already been spent and the remainder is expected to be spent in 2007. HOVENSA has and continues to plan to finance these capital expenditures through cash flow from operations. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 eliminated the Clean Air Acts mandatory oxygen content requirement for reformulated gasoline and imposes on refiners a requirement to use specific quantities of renewable content in gasoline. Many states have also enacted bans on the use of MTBE in gasoline, many of which will take effect between 2007 and 2009. As a result, several companies have announced their intention to cease using MTBE, since it will no longer be needed in reformulated gasoline to comply with the Clean Air Act and does not meet the new renewable content requirement. In response to these changes in the gasoline marketplace, the Corporation and HOVENSA phased out the use of ether based oxygenates during 2006. Both companies are reviewing the most cost effective means to replace ether unit processing capabilities, which may necessitate additional capital investments. 37 Table of Contents As described in Item 3 Legal Proceedings, in 2003 the Corporation and HOVENSA began discussions with the U.S. EPA regarding the EPAs Petroleum Refining Initiative (PRI). The PRI is an ongoing program that is designed to reduce certain air emissions at all U.S. refineries. Since 2000, the EPA has entered into settlements addressing these emissions with petroleum refining companies that control over 77% of the domestic refining capacity. Negotiations with the EPA are continuing and depending on the outcome of these discussions, the Corporation and HOVENSA may experience increased capital expenditures and operating expenses related to air emissions controls. Settlements with other refiners allow for controls to be phased in over several years. HOVENSA is constructing a new wastewater treatment system at the refinery. This project will significantly enhance the refinerys ability to treat wastewater and better protect the marine environment of St. Croix. The cost to complete the project is approximately $120 million, of which $55 million has already been incurred. The Corporation has undertaken a program to assess, monitor and reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane. The challenges associated with this program are significant, not only from the standpoint of technical feasibility, but also from the perspective of adequately measuring the Corporations greenhouse gas inventory. The Corporation has completed a revised monitoring protocol which will allow for better measurement of greenhouse gases and is conducting an independently verified audit of its emissions. Once completed, the monitoring protocol will allow for better control of these emissions and assist the Corporation in complying with any future regulatory restrictions. The Corporation expects continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation related primarily to existing conditions. Sites where corrective action may be necessary include gasoline stations, terminals, onshore exploration and production facilities, refineries (including solid waste management units under permits issued pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act) and, although not currently significant, Superfund sites where the Corporation has been named a potentially responsible party. The Corporation accrues for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable. At year end 2006, the Corporations reserve for its estimated environmental liability was approximately $75 million. The Corporation expects that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites. The Corporations remediation spending was $15 million in 2006 and 2005 and $12 million in 2004. Capital expenditures for facilities, primarily to comply with federal, state and local environmental standards, other than for low sulfur projects discussed above, were $22 million in 2006, $3 million in 2005 and $1 million in 2004. Forward Looking Information Certain sections of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, including references to the Corporations future results of operations and financial position, liquidity and capital resources, capital expenditures, oil and gas production, tax rates, debt repayment, hedging, derivative, market risk and environmental disclosures, off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations and contingencies include forward looking information. Forward looking disclosures are based on the Corporations current understanding and assessment of these activities and reasonable assumptions about the future. Actual results may differ from these disclosures because of changes in market conditions, government actions and other factors. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk In the normal course of its business, the Corporation is exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the price of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and electricity, as well as to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. In the disclosures that follow, these operations are referred to as non trading activities. The Corporation also has trading operations, principally through a 50% voting interest in a trading partnership. These activities are also exposed to commodity risks primarily related to the prices of crude oil, natural gas and refined products. The following describes how these risks are controlled and managed. Controls: The Corporation maintains a control environment under the direction of its chief risk officer and through its corporate risk policy, which the Corporations senior management has approved. Controls include 38 Table of Contents volumetric, term and value at risk limits. In addition, the chief risk officer must approve the use of new instruments or commodities. Risk limits are monitored daily and exceptions are reported to business units and to senior management. The Corporations risk management department also performs independent verifications of sources of fair values and validations of valuation models. These controls apply to all of the Corporations non trading and trading activities, including the consolidated trading partnership. The Corporations treasury department administers foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs. Instruments: The Corporation primarily uses forward commodity contracts, foreign exchange forward contracts, futures, swaps, options and energy commodity based securities in its non trading and trading activities. These contracts are generally widely traded instruments with standardized terms. The following describes these instruments and how the Corporation uses them: Forward Commodity Contracts: The forward purchase and sale of commodities is performed as part of the Corporations normal activities. At settlement date, the notional value of the contract is exchanged for physical delivery of the commodity. Forward contracts that are designated as normal purchase and sale contracts under FAS No. 133 are excluded from the quantitative market risk disclosures. Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts: Forward contracts include forward purchase contracts for both the British pound sterling and the Danish kroner. These foreign currency contracts commit the Corporation to purchase a fixed amount of pound sterling and kroner at a predetermined exchange rate on a certain date. Exchange Traded Contracts: The Corporation uses exchange traded contracts, including futures, on a number of different underlying energy commodities. These contracts are settled daily with the relevant exchange and may be subject to exchange position limits. Swaps: The Corporation uses financially settled swap contracts with third parties as part of its hedging and trading activities. Cash flows from swap contracts are determined based on underlying commodity prices and are typically settled over the life of the contract. Options: Options on various underlying energy commodities include exchange traded and third party contracts and have various exercise periods. As a seller of options, the Corporation receives a premium at the outset and bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the commodity underlying the option. As a purchaser of options, the Corporation pays a premium at the outset and has the right to participate in the favorable price movements in the underlying commodities. These premiums are a component of the fair value of the options. Energy Securities: Energy securities include energy related equity or debt securities issued by a company or government or related derivatives on these securities. Value at Risk: The Corporation uses value at risk to monitor and control commodity risk within its trading and non trading activities. The value at risk model uses historical simulation and the results represent the potential loss in fair value over one day at a 95% confidence level. The model captures both first and second order sensitivities for options. The following table summarizes the value at risk results for trading and non trading activities. These 39 Table of Contents results may vary from time to time as strategies change in trading activities or hedging levels change in non trading activities.

The Corporation uses futures and swaps to manage the risk in its marketing activities. Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at December 31, 2006 includes after tax unrealized deferred losses of $1,338 million primarily related to crude oil contracts used as hedges of exploration and production sales. The pre tax amount of deferred hedge losses is reflected in accounts payable and the related income tax benefits are recorded as deferred tax assets on the balance sheet. The Corporation uses foreign exchange contracts to reduce its exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates by entering into forward purchase contracts for both the British pound sterling and the Danish kroner. At December 31, 2006, the Corporation had $729 million of notional value foreign exchange contracts maturing in 2007. The fair value of the foreign exchange contracts was a receivable of $51 million at December 31, 2006.

The Corporations outstanding debt of $3,772 million has a fair value of $4,105 million at December 31, 2006. A 15% decrease in the rate of interest would increase the fair value of debt by approximately $300 million at December 31, 2006. Trading: In trading activities, the Corporation is exposed to changes in crude oil, natural gas and refined product prices.
