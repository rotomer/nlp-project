Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview The Corporation is a global integrated energy company that operates in two segments, Exploration and Production (EP) and Marketing and Refining (MR). The EP segment explores for, develops, produces, purchases, transports and sells crude oil and natural gas. The MR segment manufactures, purchases, transports, trades and markets refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity. Net income in 2007 was $1,832 million compared with $1,920 million in 2006 and $1,226 million in 2005. Diluted earnings per share were $5.74 in 2007 compared with $6.08 in 2006 and $3.93 in 2005. A table of items affecting comparability between periods is shown on page 21. Exploration and Production The Corporations strategy for the EP segment is to profitably grow reserves and production in a sustainable and financially disciplined manner. The Corporations total proved reserves were 1,330 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) at December 31, 2007 compared with 1,243 million boe at December 31, 2006 and 1,093 million boe at December 31, 2005. Total proved reserves at year end 2007 increased 87 million boe or 7% from the end of 2006. EP net income was $1,842 million in 2007, $1,763 million in 2006 and $1,058 million in 2005. The improved results in 2007 as compared to 2006 were primarily driven by higher average crude oil selling prices and increased crude oil and natural gas production. See further discussion in Comparison of Results on page 21. Production averaged 377,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in 2007 compared with 359,000 boepd in 2006 and 335,000 boepd in 2005. Production in 2007 increased 18,000 boepd or 5% from 2006 reflecting the following developments: The Okume Complex in Equatorial Guinea (Hess 85%), which commenced production in December 2006, exhibited strong reservoir performance and facilities uptime during the year. In January 2008, production reached design capacity of 60,000 boepd, gross (approximately 40,000 boepd, net). The Ujung Pangkah Field (Hess 75%) in Indonesia commenced natural gas production in April 2007. The Corporations net share of production from the field ramped up to an average of 69,000 mcf per day in the fourth quarter of 2007. The Atlantic (Hess 25%) and Cromarty (Hess 90%) natural gas fields in the United Kingdom North Sea, which came onstream in June 2006, contributed to the Corporations year over year production growth. Production from the Cromarty Field was shut in during the summer when natural gas prices were seasonally lower and then full production re commenced in October at higher prices. The Corporation benefited from a full year of natural gas production from Sinphuhorm (Hess 35%) located onshore Thailand, which commenced production in the fourth quarter of 2006, and from production growth in Azerbaijan and Russia. The Snohvit Field located offshore Norway (Hess 3.26%) commenced natural gas production in September 2007 and the Genghis Khan Field in the Gulf of Mexico (Hess 28%) started crude oil production in October 2007. In 2008, the Corporation expects total worldwide production of approximately 380,000 boepd to 390,000 boepd. During the year, the Corporation progressed development projects that will add to its production in future years: The expansion of offshore facilities and installation of wellhead platforms was completed in the fourth quarter at Block A 18 of the Joint Development Area of Malaysia and Thailand (JDA) (Hess 50%). Full Phase 2 production is expected in the second half of 2008. 18 Table of Contents The Shenzi development (Hess 28%) in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico progressed with the installation of tension leg platform tendon piles and hull fabrication. First production is expected to commence in mid 2009. Development of the residual oil zone at the Seminole San Andres Unit (Hess 34.3%) in the Permian Basin commenced and is advancing as planned. Production is expected to start up in 2009. Development of the Ujung Pangkah crude oil project commenced and facilities engineering and construction continue on schedule. Production from this Phase 2 oil project is expected to commence in 2009. The Jambi Merang natural gas project (Hess 25%) in Indonesia was sanctioned during the year. During 2007, the Corporations exploration activities included: The Corporation gained access to new exploration acreage including two offshore blocks on the Australian Northwest Shelf, licenses WA 390 P (Hess 100%) and nearby WA 404 P (Hess 50%) with total gross acreage of approximately 1.5 million acres. Additionally, more than 125,000 net undeveloped acres were added in the Bakken trend of North Dakota. On the Pony prospect on Green Canyon Block 468 (Hess 100%) in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico a sidetrack from the original discovery well was successfully completed in the first quarter and a second appraisal well is being drilled about 1.5 miles northwest of the original discovery well. At the Tubular Bells discovery (Hess 20%) on Mississippi Canyon Block 682 in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico a successful sidetrack well was completed during the first quarter of 2007 and a further appraisal well was spud in October 2007. During 2007, the Corporation completed the following acquisition and divestiture transactions: In February 2007, the Corporation completed the acquisition of a 28% interest in the Genghis Khan oil and gas development located in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico on Green Canyon Blocks 652 and 608, which is part of the same geological structure as the Shenzi development. In the second quarter, interests in the Scott Telford fields located offshore United Kingdom were sold for $93 million resulting in an after tax gain of $15 million ($21 million before income taxes). The Corporations share of production from the Scott Telford fields was approximately 6,500 boepd at the time of sale. Marketing and Refining The Corporations strategy for the MR segment is to deliver consistent operating performance and generate free cash flow. MR net income was $300 million in 2007, $394 million in 2006 and $499 million in 2005. Profitability in 2007 and 2006 was adversely affected by lower average margins. Refining operations contributed net income of $193 million in 2007, $240 million in 2006 and $330 million in 2005. The Corporation received cash distributions from HOVENSA, a 50% owned refining joint venture with a subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), totaling $300 million in 2007, $400 million in 2006 and $275 million in 2005. Gross crude runs at HOVENSA averaged 454,000 barrels per day in 2007 compared with 448,000 barrels per day in 2006 and 461,000 barrels per day in 2005. In 2007, HOVENSA successfully completed the first turnaround of its delayed coking unit. The Port Reading refinery operated at an average of 61,000 barrels per day in 2007 versus 63,000 barrels per day in 2006 and 55,000 barrels per day in 2005. Marketing earnings were $83 million in 2007, $108 million in 2006 and $136 million in 2005. Total refined product sales volumes averaged 451,000 barrels per day in 2007 compared with 459,000 barrels per day in 2006 and 456,000 barrels per day in 2005. Liquidity and Capital and Exploratory Expenditures Net cash provided by operating activities was $3,507 million in 2007, $3,491 million in 2006 and $1,840 million in 2005, principally reflecting increasing earnings. At December 31, 2007, cash and cash equivalents totaled $607 million compared with $383 million at December 31, 2006. Total debt was 19 Table of Contents $3,980 million at December 31, 2007 compared with $3,772 million at December 31, 2006. The Corporations debt to capitalization ratio at December 31, 2007 was 28.9% compared with 31.6% at the end of 2006. The Corporation has debt maturities of $62 million in 2008 and $143 million in 2009. Capital and exploratory expenditures were as follows for the years ended December 31: 2007 2006 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and Production United States $ 1,603 $ 908 International 2,183 2,979 Total Exploration and Production 3,786 3,887 Marketing, Refining and Corporate 140 169 Total Capital and Exploratory Expenditures $ 3,926 $ 4,056 Exploration expenses charged to income included above: United States $ 192 $ 110 International 156 102 Total exploration expenses charged to income included above $ 348 $ 212 The Corporation anticipates $4.4 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures in 2008, of which $4.3 billion relates to EP operations. Consolidated Results of Operations The after tax results by major operating activity are summarized below: 2007 2006 2005 (Millions of dollars, except per share data) Exploration and Production $ 1,842 $ 1,763 $ 1,058 Marketing and Refining 300 394 499 Corporate (150 ) (110 ) (191 ) Interest expense (160 ) (127 ) (140 ) Net income $ 1,832 $ 1,920 $ 1,226 Net income per share diluted $ 5.74 $ 6.08 $ 3.93 In the discussion that follows, the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after tax basis. Management reviews segment earnings on an after tax basis and uses after tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings. Management believes that after tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre tax amount. After tax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre tax amounts. 20 Table of Contents The following items of income (expense), on an after tax basis, are included in net income: 2007 2006 2005 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and Production Gains from asset sales $ 15 $ 236 $ 41 Asset impairments (56 ) Estimated production imbalance settlements (33 ) Income tax adjustments (45 ) 11 Accrued office closing costs (18 ) Hurricane related costs (26 ) Legal settlement 11 Marketing and Refining LIFO inventory liquidations 24 32 Charge related to customer bankruptcy (8 ) Corporate Estimated MTBE litigation (25 ) Tax on repatriated earnings (72 ) Premiums on bond repurchases (26 ) $ (75 ) $ 173 $ (37 ) The items in the table above are explained, and the pre tax amounts are shown, on pages 24 through 27. Comparison of Results Exploration and Production Following is a summarized income statement of the Corporations Exploration and Production operations: 2007 2006 2005 (Millions of dollars) Sales and other operating revenues* $ 7,498 $ 6,524 $ 4,210 Other income 65 428 94 Total revenues 7,563 6,952 4,304 Costs and expenses Production expenses, including related taxes 1,581 1,250 1,007 Exploration expenses, including dry holes and lease impairment 515 552 397 General, administrative and other expenses 257 209 140 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 1,503 1,159 965 Total costs and expenses 3,856 3,170 2,509 Results of operations from continuing operations before income taxes 3,707 3,782 1,795 Provision for income taxes 1,865 2,019 737 Results of operations $ 1,842 $ 1,763 $ 1,058 * Amounts differ from EP operating revenues in Note 16 Segment Information primarily due to the exclusion of sales of hydrocarbons purchased from third parties. 21 Table of Contents After considering the Exploration and Production items in the table on page 21, the remaining changes in Exploration and Production earnings are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices, production volumes, operating costs, exploration expenses and income taxes, as discussed below. Selling prices: Higher average selling prices, primarily crude oil, increased Exploration and Production revenues by approximately $740 million in 2007 compared with 2006. In 2006, the increase in average crude oil selling prices and reduced hedge positions increased revenues by approximately $1,900 million compared with 2005. The Corporations average selling prices were as follows: 2007 2006 2005 Crude oil per barrel (including hedging) United States $ 69.23 $ 60.45 $ 32.64 Europe 60.99 56.19 33.13 Africa 62.04 51.18 32.10 Asia and other 72.17 61.52 54.71 Worldwide 63.44 55.31 33.38 Crude oil per barrel (excluding hedging) United States $ 69.23 $ 60.45 $ 51.16 Europe 60.99 58.46 52.22 Africa 71.71 62.80 51.70 Asia and other 72.17 61.52 54.71 Worldwide 67.79 60.41 51.94 Natural gas liquids per barrel United States $ 51.89 $ 46.22 $ 38.50 Europe 57.20 47.30 37.13 Worldwide 53.72 46.59 38.08 Natural gas per mcf United States $ 6.67 $ 6.59 $ 7.93 Europe 6.13 6.20 5.29 Asia and other 4.71 4.05 4.02 Worldwide 5.60 5.50 5.65 The after tax impacts of hedging reduced earnings by $244 million ($399 million before income taxes) in 2007, $285 million ($449 million before income taxes) in 2006 and $989 million ($1,582 million before income taxes) in 2005. Production and sales volumes: The Corporations crude oil and natural gas production was 377,000 boepd in 2007 compared with 359,000 boepd in 2006 and 335,000 boepd in 2005. The Corporation anticipates that its 2008 production will average between 380,000 and 390,000 boepd. 22 Table of Contents The Corporations net daily worldwide production was as follows: 2007 2006 2005 Crude oil (thousands of barrels per day) United States 31 36 44 Europe 93 109 110 Africa 115 85 67 Asia and other 21 12 7 Total 260 242 228 Natural gas liquids (thousands of barrels per day) United States 10 10 12 Europe 5 5 4 Total 15 15 16 Natural gas (thousands of mcf per day) United States 88 110 137 Europe 259 283 274 Asia and other 266 219 133 Total 613 612 544 Barrels of oil equivalent* (thousands of barrels per day) 377 359 335 * Reflects natural gas production converted on the basis of relative energy content (six mcf equals one barrel). United States: Crude oil and natural gas production was lower in 2007 compared with 2006 and 2005, principally due to natural decline and asset sales. Europe: Crude oil production in 2007 was lower than in 2006, reflecting natural decline, facilities work on three North Sea fields, and the sale of the Corporations interests in the Scott and Telford fields in the United Kingdom. These decreases were partially offset by increased production in Russia. Decreased natural gas production in 2007 compared with 2006 was principally due to lower nominations related to the shut down of a non operated pipeline in the North Sea and natural decline, partially offset by higher production from the Atlantic and Cromarty natural gas fields in the United Kingdom which commenced in June 2006. Production in Europe was comparable in 2006 and 2005, reflecting increased production from Russia and new production from the Atlantic and Cromarty fields, which offset lower production due to maintenance and natural decline. Africa: Crude oil production increased in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily due to the start up of the Okume Complex in Equatorial Guinea in December 2006. Production in 2006 was higher than 2005 levels, principally due to production from Libya, which the Corporation re entered in January 2006. Asia and other: Crude oil production increased in 2007 versus 2006, reflecting a combination of an increased entitlement and higher production in Azerbaijan. Higher natural gas production in 2007 compared with 2006 was principally due to new production from the Sinphuhorm onshore gas project in Thailand which commenced in November 2006 and new production from the Ujung Pangkah Field in Indonesia which commenced in April 2007. These increases were partially offset by the planned shut down of the JDA to install facilities required for Phase 2 gas sales. Natural gas production was higher in 2006 compared with 2005 due to increased production from the JDA. Sales volumes: Higher sales volumes increased revenue by approximately $240 million in 2007 compared with 2006 and $400 million in 2006 compared with 2005. Operating costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization: Cash operating costs, consisting of production expenses and general and administrative expenses, increased by $409 million in 2007 and $322 million in 2006 compared with the corresponding amounts in prior years (excluding the charges for 23 Table of Contents vacated leased office space and hurricane related costs in 2006). The increases in 2007 and 2006 were primarily due to higher production volumes, increased costs of services and materials, higher employee costs and increased production taxes. Cash operating costs per barrel of oil equivalent were $13.36 in 2007, $10.92 in 2006 and $9.07 in 2005. Cash operating costs in 2008 are estimated to be in the range of $14.00 to $15.00 per barrel of oil equivalent. Excluding the pre tax amount of the 2007 asset impairments, depreciation, depletion and amortization charges increased by $232 million and $194 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increases were primarily due to higher production volumes and per barrel costs. Depreciation, depletion and amortization costs per barrel of oil equivalent were $10.11 in 2007, $8.85 in 2006 and $7.88 in 2005. Depreciation, depletion and amortization costs for 2008 are expected to be in the range of $12.50 to $13.50 per barrel. Exploration expenses: Exploration expenses were lower in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily reflecting lower dry hole costs, partially offset by increased costs related to seismic studies. Exploration expenses were higher in 2006 compared with 2005, principally reflecting higher dry hole costs. Income taxes: The effective income tax rate for Exploration and Production operations was 50% in 2007, 53% in 2006 and 41% in 2005. After considering the items in the table below, the effective income tax rates were 50% in 2007, 54% in 2006 and 42% in 2005. The effective income tax rate increased beginning in 2006 due to the Corporations re entry into Libya and the increase in the supplementary tax on petroleum operations in the United Kingdom from 10% to 20%. The effective income tax rate for EP operations in 2008 is expected to be in the range of 47% to 51%. Other: The after tax foreign currency loss was $7 million in 2007, compared with a gain of $10 million in 2006 and $20 million in 2005. Reported Exploration and Production earnings include the following items of income (expense) before and after income taxes: Before Income Taxes After Income Taxes 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 (Millions of dollars) Gains from asset sales $ 21 $ 369 $ 48 $ 15 $ 236 $ 41 Asset impairments (112 ) (56 ) Estimated production imbalance settlements (64 ) (33 ) Income tax adjustments (45 ) 11 Accrued office closing costs (30 ) (18 ) Hurricane related costs (40 ) (26 ) Legal settlement 19 11 $ (155 ) $ 339 $ 27 $ (74 ) $ 173 $ 37 2007: The gain from asset sales relates to the sale of the Corporations interests in the Scott and Telford fields located in the United Kingdom North Sea. The charge for asset impairments relates to two mature fields in the United Kingdom North Sea. The pre tax amount of this charge is reflected in depreciation, depletion and amortization. The estimated production imbalance settlements represent a charge for adjustments to prior meter readings at two offshore fields, which are recorded as a reduction of sales and other operating revenues. 2006: The gains from asset sales relate to the sale of certain United States oil and gas producing properties located in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico and onshore Gulf Coast. The accrued office closing cost relates to vacated leased office space in the United Kingdom. The related expenses are reflected principally in general and administrative expenses. The income tax adjustment represents a one time adjustment to the Corporations deferred tax liability resulting from an increase in the supplementary tax on petroleum operations in the United Kingdom from 10% to 20%. 2005: The gains from asset sales represent the disposal of non producing properties in the United Kingdom and the exchange of a mature North Sea asset for an increased interest in the Ujung Pangkah Field in Indonesia. The Corporation recorded incremental production expenses in 2005, principally repair costs and higher insurance 24 Table of Contents premiums, as a result of hurricane damage in the Gulf of Mexico. The income tax adjustment reflects the effect on deferred income taxes of a reduction in the income tax rate in Denmark and a tax settlement in the United Kingdom. The legal settlement reflects the favorable resolution of contingencies on a prior year asset sale, which is recorded in other income in the income statement. The Corporations future Exploration and Production earnings may be impacted by external factors, such as political risk, volatility in the selling prices of crude oil and natural gas, reserve and production changes, industry cost inflation, exploration expenses, the effects of weather and changes in foreign exchange and income tax rates. Marketing and Refining Earnings from Marketing and Refining activities amounted to $300 million in 2007, $394 million in 2006 and $499 million in 2005. After considering the Marketing and Refining items in the table on page 21, the earnings amounted to $276 million in 2007, $394 million in 2006 and $475 million in 2005 and are discussed in the paragraphs below. The Corporations downstream operations include its 50% interest in HOVENSA, which is accounted for using the equity method. Additional Marketing and Refining activities include a fluid catalytic cracking facility in Port Reading, New Jersey, as well as retail gasoline stations, energy marketing and trading operations. Refining: Refining earnings, which consist of the Corporations share of HOVENSAs results, Port Reading earnings, interest income on a note receivable from PDVSA and results of other miscellaneous operating activities were $193 million in 2007, $240 million in 2006 and $330 million in 2005. The Corporations share of HOVENSAs net income was $108 million ($176 million before income taxes) in 2007, $124 million ($201 million before income taxes) in 2006 and $227 million ($370 million before income taxes) in 2005. The lower earnings in 2007 and 2006 compared to the respective prior years were principally due to lower refining margins. During 2007, the coker unit at HOVENSA was shutdown for approximately 30 days for a scheduled turnaround. Certain related processing units were also included in this turnaround. In 2006, the fluid catalytic cracking unit at HOVENSA was shutdown for approximately 22 days of unscheduled maintenance. During 2005, a crude unit and the fluid catalytic cracking unit at HOVENSA were each shutdown for approximately 30 days of scheduled maintenance. Cash distributions from HOVENSA were $300 million in 2007, $400 million in 2006 and $275 million in 2005. Pre tax interest income on the PDVSA note was $9 million, $15 million and $20 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Interest income is reflected in other income in the income statement. At December 31, 2007, the remaining balance of the PDVSA note was $76 million, which is scheduled to be fully repaid by February 2009. Port Readings after tax earnings were $75 million in 2007, $104 million in 2006 and $88 million in 2005. Refined product margins were lower in 2007 compared with 2006. Higher refined product sales volumes were offset by lower margins in 2006 compared with 2005. In 2005, the Port Reading facility was shutdown for 36 days of planned maintenance. The following table summarizes refinery utilization rates: Refinery Refinery Utilization Capacity 2007 2006 2005 (Thousands of barrels per day) HOVENSA Crude 500 90.8% 89.7% 92.2% Fluid catalytic cracker 150 87.1% 84.3% 81.9% Coker 58 83.4% 84.3% 92.8% Port Reading 65 93.2% 97.4% 85.3% Marketing: Marketing operations, which consist principally of retail gasoline and energy marketing activities, generated income of $59 million in 2007, $108 million in 2006 and $112 million in 2005, excluding income from liquidations of LIFO inventories and the charge related to a customer bankruptcy described on page 26. 25 Table of Contents The decreases in 2007 and 2006 primarily reflect lower margins on refined product sales. Total refined product sales volumes were 451,000 barrels per day in 2007, 459,000 barrels per day in 2006 and 456,000 barrels per day in 2005. Total energy marketing natural gas sales volumes, including utility and spot sales, were approximately 1.9 million mcf per day in 2007, 1.8 million mcf per day in 2006 and 1.7 million mcf per day in 2005. In addition, energy marketing sold electricity volumes at the rate of 2,800, 1,400 and 500 megawatts (round the clock) in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Corporation has a 50% voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades energy commodities and energy derivatives. The Corporation also takes trading positions for its own account. The Corporations after tax results from trading activities, including its share of the earnings of the trading partnership, amounted to income of $24 million in 2007, $46 million in 2006 and $33 million in 2005. Marketing expenses were comparable in 2007 and 2006, but increased in 2006 compared with 2005, due to higher expenses from an increased number of retail convenience stores, growth in energy marketing operations and increased utility and compensation related costs. Reported Marketing and Refining earnings include the following items of income (expense) before and after income taxes: Before Income Taxes After Income Taxes 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 (Millions of dollars) LIFO inventory liquidations $ 38 $ $ 51 $ 24 $ $ 32 Charge related to customer bankruptcy (13 ) (8 ) $ 38 $ $ 38 $ 24 $ $ 24 In 2007 and 2005, Marketing and Refining earnings include income from the liquidation of prior year LIFO inventories. In 2005, Marketing and Refining earnings also include a charge resulting from the bankruptcy of a customer in the utility industry, which is included in marketing expenses. The Corporations future Marketing and Refining earnings may be impacted by volatility in margins, competitive industry conditions, government regulatory changes, credit risk and supply and demand factors, including the effects of weather. Corporate The following table summarizes corporate expenses: 2007 2006 2005 (Millions of dollars) Corporate expenses (excluding the items listed below) $ 187 $ 156 $ 119 Income taxes (benefits) on the above (62 ) (46 ) (26 ) 125 110 93 Items affecting comparability between periods, after tax Estimated MTBE litigation 25 Tax on repatriated earnings 72 Premiums on bond repurchases 26 Net corporate expenses $ 150 $ 110 $ 191 Excluding the items affecting comparability between periods, the increase in corporate expenses in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily reflects higher employee related costs, including stock based compensation. The increase in corporate expenses in 2006 compared with 2005 principally reflects the expensing of stock options 26 Table of Contents commencing January 1, 2006 and increases in insurance costs. Recurring after tax corporate expenses in 2008 are estimated to be in the range of $130 to $140 million. In 2007, Corporate expenses include a charge of $25 million ($40 million before income taxes) related to MTBE litigation. The pre tax amount of this charge is recorded in general and administrative expenses. In 2005, the American Jobs Creation Act provided for a one time reduction in the income tax rate to 5.25% on the remittance of eligible dividends from foreign subsidiaries to a United States parent. The Corporation repatriated $1.9 billion of previously unremitted foreign earnings resulting in the recognition of an income tax provision of $72 million. The pre tax amount of bond repurchase premiums in 2005 was $39 million, which was recorded in other income in the income statement. Interest After tax interest expense was as follows: 2007 2006 2005 (Millions of dollars) Total interest incurred $ 306 $ 301 $ 304 Less capitalized interest 50 100 80 Interest expense before income taxes 256 201 224 Less income taxes 96 74 84 After tax interest expense $ 160 $ 127 $ 140 The decrease in capitalized interest in 2007 reflects the completion of several development projects in 2007 and the latter portion of 2006. After tax interest expense in 2008 is expected to be in the range of $165 to $175 million, principally reflecting lower capitalized interest. Sales and Other Operating Revenues Sales and other operating revenues totaled $31,647 million in 2007, an increase of 13% compared with 2006. The increase reflects higher selling prices and sales volumes of crude oil, higher refined product selling prices and increased sales volumes in electricity. In 2006, sales and other operating revenues totaled $28,067 million, an increase of 23% compared with 2005. The increase reflects higher selling prices of crude oil, higher sales volumes and reduced crude oil hedge positions in Exploration and Production activities and higher selling prices and sales volumes in marketing activities. The change in cost of goods sold in each year principally reflects the change in sales volumes and prices of refined products and purchased natural gas and electricity. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table sets forth certain relevant measures of the Corporations liquidity and capital resources as of December 31: 2007 2006 (Millions of dollars) Cash and cash equivalents $ 607 $ 383 Current portion of long term debt $ 62 $ 27 Total debt $ 3,980 $ 3,772 Stockholders equity $ 9,774 $ 8,147 Debt to capitalization ratio* 28.9 % 31.6 % * Total debt as a percentage of the sum of total debt plus stockholders equity. 27 Table of Contents Cash Flows The following table sets forth a summary of the Corporations cash flows: 2007 2006 2005 (Millions of dollars) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 3,507 $ 3,491 $ 1,840 Investing activities (3,474 ) (3,289 ) (2,255 ) Financing activities 191 (134 ) (147 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 224 $ 68 $ (562 ) Operating Activities: Net cash provided by operating activities, including changes in operating assets and liabilities, was comparable in 2007 and 2006. Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $3,491 million in 2006 from $1,840 million in 2005, principally reflecting higher earnings, changes in working capital accounts and increased distributions from HOVENSA. The Corporation received cash distributions from HOVENSA of $300 million in 2007, $400 million in 2006 and $275 million in 2005. Investing Activities: The following table summarizes the Corporations capital expenditures: 2007 2006 2005 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and Production Exploration $ 371 $ 590 $ 229 Production and development 2,605 2,164 1,598 Acquisitions (including leaseholds) 462 921 408 3,438 3,675 2,235 Marketing, Refining and Corporate 140 169 106 Total $ 3,578 $ 3,844 $ 2,341 Capital expenditures in 2007 include the acquisition of a 28% interest in the Genghis Khan Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico for $371 million. In 2006, capital expenditures included payments of $359 million to re enter the Corporations former oil and gas production operations in the Waha concessions in Libya and $413 million to acquire a 55% working interest in the West Med Block in Egypt. In 2007 the Corporation received proceeds of $93 million for the sale of its interests in the Scott and Telford fields located in the United Kingdom. Proceeds from asset sales in 2006 totaled $444 million, including the sale of the Corporations interests in certain producing properties in the Permian Basin and onshore U.S. Gulf Coast. Proceeds from asset sales were $74 million in 2005, principally from the sale of non producing properties. Financing Activities: During 2007, net borrowings were $208 million. The Corporation reduced debt by $13 million in 2006 and $50 million in 2005. In 2005, bond repurchases of $600 million were funded by borrowings on the revolving credit facility in connection with the repatriation of foreign earnings to the United States. Common stock dividends paid were $127 million in 2007. Total common and preferred stock dividends paid were $161 million in 2006 and $159 million in 2005. The Corporation received net proceeds from the exercise of stock options totaling $110 million, $40 million and $62 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Future Capital Requirements and Resources The Corporation anticipates $4.4 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures in 2008, of which $4.3 billion relates to Exploration and Production operations. The Corporation has maturities of long term debt of $62 million in 2008 and $143 million in 2009. The Corporation anticipates that it can fund its 2008 operations, including capital 28 Table of Contents expenditures, dividends, pension contributions and required debt repayments, with existing cash on hand, projected cash flow from operations and its available credit facilities. The Corporation maintains a $3.0 billion syndicated, revolving credit facility (the facility), substantially all of which is committed through May 2012. The facility can be used for borrowings and letters of credit. At December 31, 2007, outstanding borrowings under the facility were $220 million and additional available borrowing capacity under the facility was $2,780 million. The Corporation has a 364 day asset backed credit facility securitized by certain accounts receivable from its Marketing and Refining operations, which are sold to a wholly owned subsidiary. Under the terms of this financing arrangement, the Corporation has the ability to borrow up to $800 million, subject to the availability of sufficient levels of eligible receivables. At December 31, 2007, the Corporation had $250 million in outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit of $534 million which were collateralized by $1,336 million of Marketing and Refining accounts receivable. These receivables are not available to pay the general obligations of the Corporation before repayment of outstanding borrowings under the asset backed facility. At December 31, 2007, $600 million of outstanding borrowings under short term credit facilities are classified as long term based on the Corporations available capacity under the committed revolving credit facility. These borrowings consist of the $250 million under the asset backed credit facility described above, $300 million under a short term committed facility and $50 million under uncommitted lines at December 31, 2007. The Corporation also has a shelf registration under which it may issue additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or preferred stock. Outstanding letters of credit at December 31, were as follows: 2007 2006 (Millions of dollars) Revolving credit facility $ $ 1 Asset backed credit facility 534 Committed short term letter of credit facilities 995 1,875 Uncommitted lines 1,510 1,603 $ 3,039 $ 3,479 A loan agreement covenant based on the Corporations debt to equity ratio allows the Corporation to borrow up to an additional $12.3 billion for the construction or acquisition of assets at December 31, 2007. The Corporation has the ability to borrow up to an additional $2.6 billion of secured debt at December 31, 2007 under the loan agreement covenants. Credit Ratings There are three major credit rating agencies that rate the Corporations debt. All three agencies have currently assigned an investment grade rating to the Corporations debt. The interest rates and facility fees charged on the Corporations borrowing arrangements and margin requirements from non trading and trading counterparties are subject to adjustment if the Corporations credit rating changes. 29 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Contingencies Following is a table showing aggregated information about certain contractual obligations at December 31, 2007: Payments Due by Period 2009 and 2011 and Total 2008 2010 2012 Thereafter (Millions of dollars) Long term debt(a) $ 3,980 $ 62 $ 172 $ 1,543 $ 2,203 Operating leases 3,233 382 849 588 1,414 Purchase obligations Supply commitments 38,548 9,805 14,560 14,058 125 (b) Capital expenditures 1,951 1,118 833 Operating expenses 977 537 230 105 105 Other long term liabilities 1,579 98 481 222 778 (a) At December 31, 2007, the Corporations debt bears interest at a weighted average rate of 7.0%. (b) The Corporation intends to continue purchasing refined product supply from HOVENSA. Estimated future purchases amount to approximately $7.0 billion annually using year end 2007 prices. In the preceding table, the Corporations supply commitments include its estimated purchases of 50% of HOVENSAs production of refined products, after anticipated sales by HOVENSA to unaffiliated parties. The value of future supply commitments will fluctuate based on prevailing market prices at the time of purchase, the actual output from HOVENSA, and the level of sales to unaffiliated parties. Also included are term purchase agreements at market prices for additional gasoline necessary to supply the Corporations retail marketing system and feedstocks for the Port Reading refining facility. In addition, the Corporation has commitments to purchase refined products, natural gas and electricity for use in supplying contracted customers in its energy marketing business. These commitments were computed based on year end market prices. The table also reflects future capital expenditures, including a portion of the Corporations planned $4.4 billion capital investment program for 2008, that is contractually committed at December 31, 2007. Obligations for operating expenses include commitments for transportation, seismic purchases, oil and gas production expenses and other normal business expenses. Other long term liabilities reflect contractually committed obligations on the balance sheet at December 31, 2007, including asset retirement obligations, pension plan funding requirements and anticipated obligations for uncertain income tax positions. The Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries lease gasoline stations, drilling rigs, tankers, office space and other assets for varying periods under leases accounted for as operating leases. During 2007, the Corporation entered into a lease agreement for a new drillship and related support services for use in its global deepwater exploration and development activities beginning in the middle of 2009. The total payments under this five year contract will approximate $950 million. The Corporation has a contingent purchase obligation, expiring in April 2010, to acquire the remaining interest in WilcoHess, a retail gasoline station joint venture, for approximately $150 million as of December 31, 2007. The Corporation guarantees the payment of up to 50% of HOVENSAs crude oil purchases from suppliers other than PDVSA. The amount of the Corporations guarantee fluctuates based on the volume of crude oil purchased and related prices and at December 31, 2007 amounted to $277 million. In addition, the Corporation has agreed to provide funding up to a maximum of $15 million to the extent HOVENSA does not have funds to meet its senior debt obligations. At December 31, 2007, the Corporation has issued $2,978 million of letters of credit principally relating to accrued liabilities with hedging and trading counterparties recorded on its balance sheet. In addition, the 30 Table of Contents Corporation is contingently liable under letters of credit and under guarantees of the debt of other entities directly related to its business, as follows: Total (Millions of dollars) Letters of credit $ 61 Guarantees 292 * $ 353 * Includes $277 million for the HOVENSA crude oil purchases guarantee and the $15 million guarantee on HOVENSAs debt which are discussed on page 30. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Corporation has leveraged leases not included in its balance sheet, primarily related to retail gasoline stations that the Corporation operates. The net present value of these leases is $493 million at December 31, 2007 compared with $490 million at December 31, 2006. The Corporations December 31, 2007 debt to capitalization ratio would increase from 28.9% to 31.4% if these leases were included as debt. See also Contractual Obligations and Contingencies on page 30, Note 4, Refining Joint Venture, and Note 15, Guarantees and Contingencies, in the notes to the financial statements. Stock Split On May 3, 2006, the Corporations shareholders voted to increase the number of authorized common shares from 200 million to 600 million and the board of directors declared a three for one stock split. The stock split was completed in the form of a stock dividend that was issued on May 31, 2006. The common share par value remained at $1.00 per share. All common share and per share amounts in the financial statements and notes and managements discussion and analysis are on an after split basis for all periods presented. Foreign Operations The Corporation conducts exploration and production activities principally in Algeria, Australia, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Denmark, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Ghana, Indonesia, Libya, Malaysia, Norway, Russia, Thailand, the United Kingdom and the United States. Therefore, the Corporation is subject to the risks associated with foreign operations. These exposures include political risk (including tax law changes) and currency risk. HOVENSA owns and operates a refinery in the United States Virgin Islands. In 2002, there was a political disruption in Venezuela that reduced the availability of Venezuelan crude oil used in refining operations; however, this disruption did not have a material adverse effect on the Corporations financial position. The Corporation has a note receivable of $76 million at December 31, 2007 from a subsidiary of PDVSA. All payments are current and the Corporation anticipates collection of the remaining balance. See also Item 1A. Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations. Accounting Policies Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities on the Corporations balance sheet and revenues and expenses on the income statement. The accounting methods used can affect net income, stockholders equity and various financial statement ratios. However, the Corporations accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity. Accounting for Exploration and Development Costs: Exploration and production activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses, brokers fees and other related costs, are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration 31 Table of Contents expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are capitalized. The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found. Exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and (2) sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. If either of those criteria is not met, or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the capitalized well costs are charged to expense. Indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include: commitment of project personnel, active negotiations for sales contracts with customers, negotiations with governments, operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors. Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves: The determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities. The estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations, the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment, as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill. The Corporations oil and gas reserves are calculated in accordance with SEC regulations and interpretations and the requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board. For reserves to be booked as proved they must be commercially producible, government and project operator approvals must be obtained and, depending on the amount of the project cost, senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project. The Corporations oil and gas reserve estimation and reporting process involves an annual independent third party reserve determination as well as internal technical appraisals of reserves. The Corporation maintains its own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties. The Corporations technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells, performance reviews, new technical data and other studies. To provide consistency throughout the Corporation, standard reserve estimation guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and approval practices are used. The internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management reviews the estimates. The oil and gas reserve estimates reported in the Supplementary Oil and Gas Data in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 69 Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing Activities (FAS No. 69) are determined independently by the consulting firm of DeGolyer and MacNaughton (DM) and are consistent with internal estimates. Annually, the Corporation provides DM with engineering, geological and geophysical data, actual production histories and other information necessary for the reserve determination. The Corporations and DMs technical staffs meet to review and discuss the information provided. Senior management and the Board of Directors review the final reserve estimates issued by DM. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Goodwill: As explained below there are significant differences in the way long lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing. The Corporation reviews long lived assets, including oil and gas fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered. Long lived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows (the field level for oil and gas assets) and are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying amounts of the long lived assets are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted future net cash flow estimates, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows. In the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future net cash flows is based on managements best estimate of future prices, which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices, applied to projected production volumes of individual fields and discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks involved. The projected production volumes represent reserves, including probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures. The production volumes, prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information. Oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, since the standardized measure requires the use of actual prices on the last day of the year. 32 Table of Contents The Corporations impairment tests of long lived Exploration and Production producing assets are based on its best estimates of future production volumes (including recovery factors), selling prices, operating and capital costs, the timing of future production and other factors, which are updated each time an impairment test is performed. The Corporation could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease, crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly. In accordance with FAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (FAS No. 142), the Corporations goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter at a reporting unit level, which is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. The reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed. The Corporations goodwill is assigned to the Exploration and Production operating segment and it expects that the benefits of goodwill will be recovered through the operation of that segment. The Corporations fair value estimate of the Exploration and Production segment is the sum of: (1) the discounted anticipated cash flows of producing assets and known developments, (2) the estimated risk adjusted present value of exploration assets, and (3) an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential synergies including cost savings, access to new business opportunities, enterprise control, improved processes and increased market share. The Corporation also considers the relative market valuation of similar Exploration and Production companies. The determination of the fair value of the Exploration and Production operating segment depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves, future prices, timing of future net cash flows and market premiums. Significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of the Exploration and Production operating segment that could result in an impairment of goodwill. Because there are significant differences in the way long lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing, there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned to the Exploration and Production segment. Asset Retirement Obligations: The Corporation has material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain exploration and production locations. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the Corporation recognizes a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations. In addition, the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligations is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated. The Corporation capitalizes such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred. In order to measure these obligations, the Corporation estimates the fair value of the obligations by discounting the future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations. In determining these estimates, the Corporation is required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement, timing of settlement, interpretation of legal requirements, inflationary factors and discount rate. In addition, there are other external factors which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including: changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements, fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates and advances in technology. As a result, the Corporations estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above. Changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values. Derivatives: The Corporation utilizes derivative instruments for both non trading and trading activities. In non trading activities, the Corporation uses futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and electricity, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In trading activities, the Corporation, principally through a consolidated partnership, trades energy commodities and derivatives, including futures, forwards, options and swaps, based on expectations of future market conditions. All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the Corporations balance sheet. The Corporations policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative. The changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges under FAS No. 133 are recognized currently in 33 Table of Contents earnings. Derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges) or hedges of firm commitments (fair value hedges). The effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings. The change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives that are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges are tested for effectiveness prospectively before they are executed and both prospectively and retrospectively on an on going basis to determine whether they continue to qualify for hedge accounting. The prospective and retrospective effectiveness calculations are performed using either historical simulation or other statistical models, which utilize historical observable market data consisting of futures curves and spot prices. Income Taxes: Judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements. These judgements include the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when management believes that it is more likely than not, that based on the technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. The Corporation has net operating loss carryforwards in several jurisdictions, including the United States, and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses. Additionally, the Corporation has deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities. Regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized. If it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized. In evaluating realizability of deferred tax assets, the Corporation refers to the reversal periods for temporary differences, available carryforward periods for net operating losses, estimates of future taxable income, the availability of tax planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets and other factors. Estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the Corporations internal business forecasts. The Corporation does not provide for deferred U.S. income taxes applicable to undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Changes in Accounting Policies Effective January 1, 2007, the Corporation adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Staff Position (FSP) AUG AIR 1, Accounting for Planned Major Maintenance Activities. This FSP eliminated the previously acceptable accrue in advance method of accounting for planned major maintenance. As a result, the Corporation retrospectively changed its method of accounting to recognize expenses associated with refinery turnarounds when such costs are incurred. The impact of adopting this FSP increased previously reported 2006 earnings by $4 million ($.01 per diluted share). In addition, previously reported 2005 net income decreased by $16 million ($.05 per diluted share) and retained earnings as of January 1, 2005 increased by approximately $48 million. All 2007, 2006 and 2005 financial information reflects this retrospective accounting change. Effective January 1, 2007, the Corporation adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). FIN 48 prescribes the financial statement recognition and measurement criteria for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also requires additional disclosures related to uncertain income tax positions. See Note 11, Income Taxes for further information. Recently Issued Accounting Standard In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (FAS No. 157). FAS No. 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosure of a fair value hierarchy, which applies to financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value under other authoritative accounting pronouncements. The standard also requires additional disclosure about the methods of determining fair value. The Corporation as 34 Table of Contents required, will prospectively adopt the provisions of FAS No. 157 effective January 1, 2008. The Corporation believes that the impact of adopting FAS No. 157 on net income will not be material. In addition, the Corporation expects to record a reduction in the after tax charge reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income relating to the crude oil hedging program of approximately $160 million, after income taxes. Environment, Health and Safety The Corporation has implemented a values based, socially responsible strategy focused on improving environment, health and safety performance and making a positive impact on communities. The strategy is supported by the Corporations environment, health, safety and social responsibility (EHS SR) policies and by environment and safety management systems that help protect the Corporations workforce, customers and local communities. The Corporations management systems are designed to uphold or exceed international standards and are intended to promote internal consistency, adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in EHS SR performance. Improved performance may, in the short term, increase the Corporations operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to assets, reputation and license to operate. In addition to enhanced EHS SR performance, improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be realized as collateral benefits from investments in EHS SR. The Corporation has programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance, audit facilities, train employees, prevent and manage risks and emergencies and to generally meet corporate EHS SR goals. The production of motor and other fuels in the United States and elsewhere has faced increasing regulatory pressures in recent years. In 2006, additional regulations to reduce the allowable sulfur content in diesel fuel went into effect. Additional reductions in gasoline and fuel oil sulfur content are under consideration. Fuels production will likely continue to be subject to more stringent regulation in future years and as such may require additional capital expenditures. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 imposes on refiners a requirement to use specific quantities of renewable content in gasoline. The 2007 Energy Policy Act expanded requirements on the use of renewable content and included several technology forcing provisions. Many states have also enacted or are considering biofuels mandates, which, in combination with national legislation may affect the Registrants markets for fuels. As described in Item 3 Legal Proceedings, in 2003 the Corporation and HOVENSA began discussions with the U.S. EPA regarding the EPAs Petroleum Refining Initiative (PRI). The PRI is an ongoing program that is designed to reduce certain air emissions at all U.S. refineries. Since 2000, the EPA has entered into settlements addressing these emissions with petroleum refining companies that control over 80% of the domestic refining capacity. Negotiations with the EPA are continuing and depending on the outcome of these discussions, the Corporation and HOVENSA may experience increased capital expenditures and operating expenses related to air emissions controls. Settlements with other refiners allow for controls to be phased in over several years. The Corporation has undertaken a program to assess, monitor and reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane. The challenges associated with this program are significant, not only from the standpoint of technical feasibility, but also from the perspective of adequately measuring the Corporations greenhouse gas inventory. The Corporation has completed a revised monitoring protocol which will allow for better measurement of greenhouse gases and has completed an independently verified audit of its emissions. The monitoring protocol in conjunction with the Corporations recently formulated Climate Change Network will allow for better control of these emissions and assist the Corporation in developing policies and programs to reduce these emissions and comply with any future regulatory restrictions. The Corporation expects continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation related primarily to existing conditions. Sites where corrective action may be necessary include gasoline stations, terminals, onshore exploration and production facilities, refineries (including solid waste management units under permits issued pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act) and, although not currently significant, Superfund sites where the Corporation has been named a potentially responsible party. The Corporation accrues for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable. At year end 2007, the Corporations reserve for estimated environmental liabilities was approximately $60 million. The Corporation expects that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites. The Corporations remediation spending 35 Table of Contents was $23 million in 2007 and $15 million in 2006 and 2005. Capital expenditures incurred over several years to comply with low sulfur gasoline and diesel fuel requirements totaled approximately $400 million at HOVENSA and approximately $70 million at Port Reading. Capital expenditures for facilities, primarily to comply with federal, state and local environmental standards, other than for the low sulfur requirements, were $22 million in 2007 and 2006 and $3 million in 2005. Forward Looking Information Certain sections of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, including references to the Corporations future results of operations and financial position, liquidity and capital resources, capital expenditures, oil and gas production, tax rates, debt repayment, hedging, derivative, market risk and environmental disclosures, off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations and contingencies include forward looking information. Forward looking disclosures are based on the Corporations current understanding and assessment of these activities and reasonable assumptions about the future. Actual results may differ from these disclosures because of changes in market conditions, government actions and other factors. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk In the normal course of its business, the Corporation is exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the price of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and electricity, as well as to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. In the disclosures that follow, these operations are referred to as non trading activities. The Corporation also has trading operations, principally through a 50% voting interest in a trading partnership. These activities are also exposed to commodity risks primarily related to the prices of crude oil, natural gas and refined products. The following describes how these risks are controlled and managed. Controls: The Corporation maintains a control environment under the direction of its chief risk officer and through its corporate risk policy, which the Corporations senior management has approved. Controls include volumetric, term and value at risk limits. In addition, the chief risk officer must approve the use of new instruments or commodities. Risk limits are monitored daily and exceptions are reported to business units and to senior management. The Corporations risk management department also performs independent verifications of sources of fair values and validations of valuation models. These controls apply to all of the Corporations non trading and trading activities, including the consolidated trading partnership. The Corporations treasury department is responsible for administering foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs. Instruments: The Corporation primarily uses forward commodity contracts, foreign exchange forward contracts, futures, swaps, options and energy commodity based securities in its non trading and trading activities. These contracts are generally widely traded instruments with standardized terms. The following describes these instruments and how the Corporation uses them: Forward Commodity Contracts: The Corporation enters into contracts for the forward purchase and sale of commodities. At settlement date, the notional value of the contract is exchanged for physical delivery of the commodity. Forward contracts that are designated as normal purchase and sale contracts under FAS No. 133 are excluded from the quantitative market risk disclosures. Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts: Forward contracts include forward purchase contracts for both the British pound sterling and the Danish kroner. These foreign currency contracts commit the Corporation to purchase a fixed amount of pound sterling and kroner at a predetermined exchange rate on a certain date. Exchange Traded Contracts: The Corporation uses exchange traded contracts, including futures, on a number of different underlying energy commodities. These contracts are settled daily with the relevant exchange and may be subject to exchange position limits. Swaps: The Corporation uses financially settled swap contracts with third parties as part of its hedging and trading activities. Cash flows from swap contracts are determined based on underlying commodity prices and are typically settled over the life of the contract. 36 Table of Contents Options: Options on various underlying energy commodities include exchange traded and third party contracts and have various exercise periods. As a seller of options, the Corporation receives a premium at the outset and bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the commodity underlying the option. As a purchaser of options, the Corporation pays a premium at the outset and has the right to participate in the favorable price movements in the underlying commodities. These premiums are a component of the fair value of the options. Energy Securities: Energy securities include energy related equity or debt securities issued by a company or government or related derivatives on these securities. Value at Risk: The Corporation uses value at risk to monitor and control commodity risk within its trading and non trading activities. The value at risk model uses historical simulation and the results represent the potential loss in fair value over one day at a 95% confidence level. The model captures both first and second order sensitivities for options. The following table summarizes the value at risk results for trading and non trading activities. These results may vary from time to time as strategies change in trading activities or hedging levels change in non trading activities.

The fair value of the foreign exchange contracts was a payable of $1 million at December 31, 2007.

The Corporations outstanding debt of $3,980 million has a fair value of $4,263 million at December 31, 2007. A 15% decrease in the rate of interest would increase the fair value of debt by approximately $200 million at December 31, 2007. Trading: In trading activities, the Corporation is exposed to changes in crude oil, natural gas and refined product prices. The trading partnership in which the Corporation has a 50% voting interest trades energy commodities, securities and derivatives. The accounts of the partnership are consolidated with those of the Corporation. The Corporation also takes trading positions for its own account. The information that follows represents 100% of the trading partnership and the Corporations proprietary trading accounts. Gains or losses from sales of physical products are recorded at the time of sale. Total realized gains on trading activities for 2007 amounted to $303 million ($721 million in 2006).
