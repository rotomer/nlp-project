Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview The Corporation is a global integrated energy company that operates in two segments, Exploration and Production (EP) and Marketing and Refining (MR). The EP segment explores for, develops, produces, purchases, transports and sells crude oil and natural gas. The MR segment manufactures, purchases, transports, trades and markets refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity. Net income in 2008 was $2,360 million compared with $1,832 million in 2007 and $1,920 million in 2006. Diluted earnings per share were $7.24 in 2008 compared with $5.74 in 2007 and $6.08 in 2006. A table of items affecting comparability between periods is shown on page 21. Exploration and Production The Corporations strategy for the EP segment is to profitably grow reserves and production in a sustainable and financially disciplined manner. The Corporations total proved reserves were 1,432 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) at December 31, 2008 compared with 1,330 million boe at December 31, 2007 and 1,243 million boe at December 31, 2006. Total proved reserves at year end 2008 increased 102 million boe or 8% from the end of 2007. EP net income was $2,423 million in 2008, $1,842 million in 2007 and $1,763 million in 2006. The improved results in 2008 as compared to 2007 were primarily driven by higher average crude oil selling prices. At December 31, 2008, crude oil selling prices were significantly below the average prices in 2008. Production averaged 381,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in 2008 compared with 377,000 boepd in 2007 and 359,000 boepd in 2006. Production in 2008 increased 4,000 boepd or 1% from 2007. In 2009, the Corporation currently estimates total worldwide production to be approximately 380,000 boepd to 390,000 boepd. During 2008, the Corporation progressed the following development projects that will add to its production in future years: In November 2008, upon the commissioning of a third party gas export pipeline to Thailand, Phase 2 gas sales commenced at Block A 18 of the Joint Development Area of Malaysia and Thailand (JDA) (Hess 50%). In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, development of the Shenzi Field (Hess 28%) progressed. Tension leg platform tendons, hull and topsides were installed and flowlines were laid and tested. First production is expected in the second quarter of 2009. Additional production from a Phase 2 oil project at the Ujung Pangkah Field (Hess 75%) in Indonesia is expected in mid 2009. Development of a residual oil zone advanced at the Seminole San Andres Unit (Hess 34%) with the installation of facilities and equipment. During 2008, the Corporations exploration activities included: In the Pony prospect on Green Canyon Block 468 (Hess 100%) in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the Corporation successfully completed drilling an appraisal well. The Corporation is evaluating development options for Pony. At the Corporations Tubular Bells prospect (Hess 20%) located in the Mississippi Canyon area of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, a third well was successfully drilled during 2008. The operator is evaluating development options for Tubular Bells. The Corporation completed drilling its initial four exploration wells of a 16 well commitment on the WA Block 390 P offshore Western Australia (Hess 100%). Three of the four wells discovered natural gas and the Corporation plans to drill five additional exploration wells in 2009. The operator of the WA Block 404 P (Hess 50%) offshore Western Australia plans to drill three exploration wells in 2009. 19 Table of Contents The Corporation drilled a successful exploration well in Area 54 offshore Libya (Hess 100%). The Corporation intends to obtain 3D seismic in Area 54 and further drilling is planned. The Corporation drilled a successful exploration well on the West Med Block (Hess 55%) in Egypt, which encountered natural gas and crude oil. The Corporation is currently conducting engineering studies and further exploratory drilling is planned. The operator commenced drilling of an exploration well on the BM S 22 Block (Hess 40%) in the Santos Basin offshore Brazil and filed a Notice of Discovery with the regulators on January 16, 2009. The Corporation was successful in acquiring new deepwater blocks in the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico and the offshore Semai V exploration block in Indonesia. Marketing and Refining The Corporations strategy for the MR segment is to deliver consistent operating performance and generate free cash flow. MR net income was $277 million in 2008, $300 million in 2007 and $394 million in 2006. Earnings in 2008 and 2007 reflect lower average margins compared to the prior periods. Refining operations contributed net income of $73 million in 2008, $193 million in 2007 and $240 million in 2006. The Corporation received cash distributions from HOVENSA totaling $50 million in 2008, $300 million in 2007 and $400 million in 2006. Gross crude runs at HOVENSA averaged 441,000 barrels per day in 2008 compared with 454,000 barrels per day in 2007 and 448,000 barrels per day in 2006. In 2007, HOVENSA successfully completed the first turnaround of its delayed coker unit. The Port Reading refinery operated at an average of 64,000 barrels per day in 2008 versus 61,000 barrels per day in 2007 and 63,000 barrels per day in 2006. Marketing earnings were $240 million in 2008, $83 million in 2007 and $108 million in 2006. Total refined product sales volumes averaged 472,000 barrels per day in 2008 compared with 451,000 barrels per day in 2007 and 459,000 barrels per day in 2006. Liquidity and Capital and Exploratory Expenditures Net cash provided by operating activities was $4,567 million in 2008, $3,507 million in 2007 and $3,491 million in 2006, principally reflecting increased earnings. At December 31, 2008, cash and cash equivalents totaled $908 million compared with $607 million at December 31, 2007. Total debt was $3,955 million at December 31, 2008 compared with $3,980 million at December 31, 2007. The Corporations debt to capitalization ratio at December 31, 2008 was 24.3% compared with 28.9% at the end of 2007. The Corporation has debt maturities of $143 million in 2009 and $31 million in 2010. In February 2009, the Corporation issued $250 million of 5 year notes with a coupon of 7% and $1 billion of 10 year notes with a coupon of 8.125%. Capital and exploratory expenditures were as follows for the years ended December 31: 2008 2007 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and Production United States $ 2,164 $ 1,603 International 2,477 2,183 Total Exploration and Production 4,641 3,786 Marketing, Refining and Corporate 187 140 Total Capital and Exploratory Expenditures $ 4,828 $ 3,926 Exploration expenses charged to income included above: United States $ 211 $ 192 International 179 156 Total exploration expenses charged to income included above $ 390 $ 348 20 Table of Contents The Corporation anticipates $3.2 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures in 2009, of which $3.1 billion relates to EP operations. Consolidated Results of Operations The after tax results by major operating activity are summarized below: 2008 2007 2006 (Millions of dollars, except per share data) Exploration and Production $ 2,423 $ 1,842 $ 1,763 Marketing and Refining 277 300 394 Corporate (173 ) (150 ) (110 ) Interest expense (167 ) (160 ) (127 ) Net income $ 2,360 $ 1,832 $ 1,920 Net income per share diluted $ 7.24 $ 5.74 $ 6.08 In the discussion that follows, the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after tax basis. Management reviews segment earnings on an after tax basis and uses after tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings. Management believes that after tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre tax amount. After tax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre tax amounts. The following table summarizes, on an after tax basis, items of income (expense) that are included in net income and affect comparability between periods. The items in the table below are explained, and the pre tax amounts are shown, on pages 25 through 27. 2008 2007 2006 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and Production $ (26 ) $ (74 ) $ 173 Marketing and Refining 24 Corporate (25 ) $ (26 ) $ (75 ) $ 173 21 Table of Contents Comparison of Results Exploration and Production Following is a summarized income statement of the Corporations Exploration and Production operations: 2008 2007 2006 (Millions of dollars) Sales and other operating revenues* $ 9,806 $ 7,498 $ 6,524 Other, net (167 ) 65 428 Total revenues and non operating income 9,639 7,563 6,952 Costs and expenses Production expenses, including related taxes 1,872 1,581 1,250 Exploration expenses, including dry holes and lease impairment 725 515 552 General, administrative and other expenses 302 257 209 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 1,952 1,503 1,159 Total costs and expenses 4,851 3,856 3,170 Results of operations from continuing operations before income taxes 4,788 3,707 3,782 Provision for income taxes 2,365 1,865 2,019 Results of operations $ 2,423 $ 1,842 $ 1,763 * Amounts differ from EP operating revenues in Note 17 Segment Information primarily due to the exclusion of sales of hydrocarbons purchased from third parties. After considering the Exploration and Production items in the table on page 21, the remaining changes in Exploration and Production earnings are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices, production volumes, operating costs, exploration expenses, foreign exchange, and income taxes, as discussed below. Selling prices: Higher average selling prices increased Exploration and Production revenues by approximately $2,100 million in 2008 compared with 2007. At December 31, 2008, the selling prices of crude oil and natural gas had decreased significantly from the average 2008 selling prices indicated below. In 2007, an increase in average crude oil selling prices and reduced hedge positions compared with 2006 increased revenues by approximately $740 million. 22 Table of Contents The Corporations average selling prices were as follows: 2008 2007 2006 Crude oil per barrel (including hedging) United States $ 96.82 $ 69.23 $ 60.45 Europe 78.75 60.99 56.19 Africa 78.72 62.04 51.18 Asia and other 97.07 72.17 61.52 Worldwide 82.04 63.44 55.31 Crude oil per barrel (excluding hedging) United States $ 96.82 $ 69.23 $ 60.45 Europe 78.75 60.99 58.46 Africa 93.57 71.71 62.80 Asia and other 97.07 72.17 61.52 Worldwide 89.23 67.79 60.41 Natural gas liquids per barrel United States $ 64.98 $ 51.89 $ 46.22 Europe 74.63 57.20 47.30 Worldwide 67.61 53.72 46.59 Natural gas per mcf (including hedging) United States $ 8.61 $ 6.67 $ 6.59 Europe 9.44 6.13 6.20 Asia and other 5.24 4.71 4.05 Worldwide 7.17 5.60 5.50 Natural gas per mcf (excluding hedging) United States $ 8.61 $ 6.67 $ 6.59 Europe 9.79 6.13 6.20 Asia and other 5.24 4.71 4.05 Worldwide 7.30 5.60 5.50 The after tax impacts of hedging reduced earnings by $423 million ($685 million before income taxes) in 2008, $244 million ($399 million before income taxes) in 2007 and $285 million ($449 million before income taxes) in 2006. In October 2008, the Corporation closed its Brent crude oil hedge positions by entering into offsetting contracts with the same counterparty covering 24,000 barrels per day from 2009 through 2012 at a per barrel price of $86.95 each year. The deferred after tax loss as of the date the hedge positions were closed will be recorded in earnings as the contracts mature. The estimated annual after tax loss from the closed positions will be approximately $335 million from 2009 through 2012. The pretax amounts will continue to be recorded as a reduction of revenue and allocated to the selling prices of the Corporations African production. Production and sales volumes: The Corporations crude oil and natural gas production was 381,000 boepd in 2008 compared with 377,000 boepd in 2007 and 359,000 boepd in 2006. The Corporation currently estimates that its 2009 production will average between 380,000 and 390,000 boepd. 23 Table of Contents The Corporations net daily worldwide production was as follows: 2008 2007 2006 Crude oil (thousands of barrels per day) United States 32 31 36 Europe 83 93 109 Africa 124 115 85 Asia and other 13 21 12 Total 252 260 242 Natural gas liquids (thousands of barrels per day) United States 10 10 10 Europe 4 5 5 Total 14 15 15 Natural gas (thousands of mcf per day) United States 78 88 110 Europe 255 259 283 Asia and other 356 266 219 Total 689 613 612 Barrels of oil equivalent* (thousands of barrels per day) 381 377 359 * Reflects natural gas production converted on the basis of relative energy content (six mcf equals one barrel). United States: Crude oil production in the United States was higher in 2008 compared with 2007, principally due to production from new wells in North Dakota and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. This increased production was partially offset by the impact of hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. Natural gas production was lower in 2008, primarily reflecting hurricane downtime and natural decline. Hurricane impacts reduced full year 2008 production by an estimated 7,000 boepd. At December 31, 2008, approximately 15,000 boepd remained shut in from the hurricanes and this production is expected to be brought back on line by the end of the first quarter of 2009. Crude oil and natural gas production in 2007 decreased compared with 2006 principally due to natural decline and asset sales. Europe: Crude oil production in 2008 was lower than in 2007, due to temporary shut ins at three North Sea fields, cessation of production at the mature Fife, Fergus, Flora and Angus Fields, and natural decline. These decreases were partially offset by increased production in Russia. Crude oil production in 2007 was lower than in 2006, reflecting natural decline, facilities work on three North Sea fields, and the sale of the Corporations interests in the Scott and Telford Fields in the United Kingdom, partially offset by higher Russian production. Natural gas production was comparable in 2008 and 2007, but decreased in 2007 compared with 2006 principally due to lower nominations related to the shut down of a non operated pipeline and natural decline. The decreases were partially offset by higher natural gas production from the Atlantic and Cromarty Fields in the United Kingdom which commenced in June 2006. Africa: Crude oil production increased in 2008 compared with 2007, primarily due to higher production at the Okume Complex in Equatorial Guinea, partially offset by a lower entitlement to Algerian production. Crude oil production increased in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily due to the start up of the Okume Complex in December 2006. Asia and other: The change in crude oil production from 2006 through 2008 principally reflects changes to the Corporations entitlement to production in Azerbaijan. The increase in 2007 compared with 2006 also reflects increased gross production from the fields in Azerbaijan. Natural gas production increased in 2008 compared with 2007 due to increased production from Block A 18 in the Joint Development Area of Malaysia and Thailand (JDA) and a full year of production from the Ujung Pangkah Field in Indonesia. Higher natural gas 24 Table of Contents production in 2007 compared with 2006 was principally due to new production from the Sinphuhorm onshore gas project in Thailand which commenced in November 2006 and production from the Ujung Pangkah Field which commenced in April 2007. These increases were partially offset by the planned shut down of the JDA to install facilities required for Phase 2 gas sales. Sales volumes: Higher sales volumes and other operating revenues increased revenue by approximately $200 million in 2008 compared with 2007 and $240 million in 2007 compared with 2006. Operating costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization: Cash operating costs, consisting of production expenses and general and administrative expenses, increased by $321 million in 2008 and $409 million in 2007 compared with the corresponding amounts in prior years (excluding the charges for hurricane related costs in 2008 and vacated leased office space in 2006 that are discussed below). The increases in 2008 and 2007 were primarily due to higher production volumes, increased production taxes (due to higher realized selling prices), increased costs of services and materials and higher employee costs. Cash operating costs per barrel of oil equivalent were $15.49 in 2008, $13.36 in 2007 and $10.92 in 2006. Cash operating costs in 2009 are estimated to be in the range of $15.00 to $16.00 per barrel of oil equivalent. Excluding the pre tax amount of asset impairments, depreciation, depletion and amortization charges increased by $531 million and $232 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increases were primarily due to higher production volumes and per barrel costs. Depreciation, depletion and amortization costs per barrel of oil equivalent were $13.79 in 2008, $10.11 in 2007 and $8.85 in 2006. Depreciation, depletion and amortization costs for 2009 are estimated to be in the range of $13.00 to $14.00 per barrel. Exploration expenses: Exploration expenses were higher in 2008 compared with 2007, principally due to higher dry hole costs. Exploration expenses were lower in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily reflecting lower dry hole costs, partially offset by increased seismic studies. Income taxes: After considering the items in the table below, the effective income tax rates for Exploration and Production operations were 49% in 2008, 50% in 2007 and 54% in 2006. The effective income tax rate for EP operations in 2009 is estimated to be in the range of 57% to 61%. The increase from the 2008 effective rate largely reflects the impact of Libyan taxes in a lower commodity price environment. Foreign Exchange: The after tax foreign currency loss was $84 million in 2008, compared with a loss of $7 million in 2007 and a gain of $10 million in 2006. The increased foreign currency loss reflects the effect of significant exchange rate movements in the fourth quarter of 2008 on the remeasurement of assets, liabilities and foreign currency forward contracts by certain foreign businesses. Reported Exploration and Production earnings include the following items of income (expense) before and after income taxes: Before Income Taxes After Income Taxes 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2006 (Millions of dollars) Gains from asset sales $ $ 21 $ 369 $ $ 15 $ 236 Asset impairments (30 ) (112 ) (17 ) (56 ) Hurricane related costs (15 ) (9 ) Estimated production imbalance settlements (64 ) (33 ) Accrued office closing costs (30 ) (18 ) Income tax adjustments (45 ) $ (45 ) $ (155 ) $ 339 $ (26 ) $ (74 ) $ 173 2008: The charge for asset impairments relates to mature fields in the United States and the United Kingdom North Sea. The pre tax amount of this charge is reflected in depreciation, depletion and amortization. The hurricane costs relate to expenses associated with Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in the Gulf of Mexico and are recorded in production expenses. 25 Table of Contents 2007: The gain from asset sales relates to the sale of the Corporations interests in the Scott and Telford fields in the United Kingdom North Sea. The charge for asset impairments relates to two mature fields also in the United Kingdom North Sea. The estimated production imbalance settlements represent a charge for adjustments to prior meter readings at two offshore fields, which are recorded as a reduction of sales and other operating revenues. 2006: The gains from asset sales relate to the sale of certain United States oil and gas producing properties located in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico and onshore Gulf Coast. The accrued office closing cost relates to vacated leased office space in the United Kingdom. The related expenses are reflected principally in general and administrative expenses. The income tax adjustment represents a one time adjustment to the Corporations deferred tax liability resulting from an increase in the supplementary tax on petroleum operations in the United Kingdom from 10% to 20%. The Corporations future Exploration and Production earnings may be impacted by external factors, such as political risk, volatility in the selling prices of crude oil and natural gas, reserve and production changes, industry cost inflation, exploration expenses, the effects of weather and changes in foreign exchange and income tax rates. Marketing and Refining Earnings from Marketing and Refining activities amounted to $277 million in 2008, $300 million in 2007 and $394 million in 2006. After considering the liquidation of LIFO inventories reflected in the table on page 21 and discussed below, the earnings were $277 million, $276 million and $394 million, respectively. Refining: Refining earnings, which consist of the Corporations share of HOVENSAs results, Port Reading earnings, interest income on a note receivable from PDVSA and results of other miscellaneous operating activities, were $73 million in 2008, $193 million in 2007, and $240 million in 2006. The Corporations share of HOVENSAs net income was $27 million ($44 million before income taxes) in 2008, $108 million ($176 million before income taxes) in 2007 and $124 million ($201 million before income taxes) in 2006. The lower earnings in 2008 and 2007, compared with the respective prior years, were principally due to lower refining margins. The 2008 utilization rate for the fluid catalytic cracking unit at HOVENSA reflects lower utilization due to weak refining margins, planned and unplanned maintenance of certain units, and a refinery wide shut down for Hurricane Omar. In 2007, the coker unit at HOVENSA was shutdown for approximately 30 days for a scheduled turnaround. Certain related processing units were also included in this turnaround. In 2006, the fluid catalytic cracking unit at HOVENSA was shutdown for approximately 22 days of unscheduled maintenance. Cash distributions received by the Corporation from HOVENSA were $50 million in 2008, $300 million in 2007 and $400 million in 2006. Pre tax interest income on the PDVSA note was $4 million, $9 million and $15 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Interest income is reflected in other income in the income statement. At December 31, 2008, the remaining balance of the PDVSA note was $15 million, which was fully repaid in February 2009. Port Reading and other after tax refining earnings were $43 million in 2008, $79 million in 2007 and $107 million in 2006, also reflecting lower refining margins. The following table summarizes refinery utilization rates: Refinery Refinery Utilization Capacity 2008 2007 2006 (Thousands of barrels per day) HOVENSA Crude 500 88.2% 90.8% 89.7% Fluid catalytic cracker 150 72.7% 87.1% 84.3% Coker 58 92.4% 83.4% 84.3% Port Reading 70 * 90.7% 93.2% 97.4% * Refinery utilization in 2007 and 2006 is based on capacity of 65 thousand barrels per day. 26 Table of Contents Marketing: Marketing operations, which consist principally of retail gasoline and energy marketing activities, generated income of $240 million in 2008, $59 million in 2007 and $108 million in 2006, excluding income from the liquidation of LIFO inventories in 2007 totaling $38 million before income taxes ($24 million after income taxes). The increase in 2008 primarily reflects higher margins on refined product sales, including sales of retail gasoline operations. Refined product margins were lower in 2007 compared with 2006. Total refined product sales volumes were 472,000 barrels per day in 2008, 451,000 barrels per day in 2007 and 459,000 barrels per day in 2006. Total energy marketing natural gas sales volumes, including utility and spot sales, were approximately 2.0 million mcf per day in 2008, 1.9 million mcf per day in 2007 and 1.8 million mcf per day in 2006. In addition, energy marketing sold electricity volumes at the rate of 3,200, 2,800 and 1,400 megawatts (round the clock) in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Corporation has a 50% voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades energy commodities and energy derivatives. The Corporation also takes trading positions for its own account. The Corporations after tax results from trading activities, including its share of the earnings of the trading partnership, amounted to a loss of $36 million in 2008, compared with earnings of $24 million in 2007 and $46 million in 2006. Marketing expenses increased in 2008, principally reflecting growth in energy marketing activities, higher credit card fees in retail gasoline operations, and increased transportation costs. The Corporations future Marketing and Refining earnings may be impacted by external factors, including volatility in margins, competitive industry conditions, government regulations, credit risk, and supply and demand factors, including the effects of weather. Corporate The following table summarizes corporate expenses: 2008 2007 2006 (Millions of dollars) Corporate expenses (excluding the item described below) $ 260 $ 187 $ 156 Income taxes (benefits) on the above (87 ) (62 ) (46 ) 173 125 110 Item affecting comparability between periods, after tax Estimated MTBE litigation 25 Net corporate expenses $ 173 $ 150 $ 110 Excluding the item affecting comparability between periods, the increase in corporate expenses in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily reflects losses on pension related investments, higher employee costs, and higher professional fees. The increase in net corporate expenses in 2007 compared with 2006 principally reflects higher employee costs, including stock based compensation. Recurring after tax corporate expenses in 2009 are estimated to be in the range of $165 to $175 million. In 2007, Corporate expenses include a charge of $25 million ($40 million before income taxes) related to MTBE litigation. The pre tax amount of this charge is recorded in general and administrative expenses. 27 Table of Contents Interest After tax interest expense was as follows: 2008 2007 2006 (Millions of dollars) Total interest incurred $ 274 $ 306 $ 301 Less capitalized interest 7 50 100 Interest expense before income taxes 267 256 201 Less income taxes 100 96 74 After tax interest expense $ 167 $ 160 $ 127 The decrease in interest incurred in 2008 principally reflects lower average debt. The decrease in capitalized interest in 2008 reflects the completion of several development projects in 2007 and 2006. Interest expense in each period includes the cost of letters of credit primarily issued to counterparties in hedging and trading activities. After tax interest expense in 2009 is expected to be in the range of $230 to $240 million. See Future Capital Requirements and Resources for discussion of a $1,250 million note issuance in the first quarter of 2009. Sales and Other Operating Revenues Sales and other operating revenues totaled $41,165 million in 2008, an increase of 30% compared with 2007. In 2007, sales and other operating revenues totaled $31,647 million, an increase of 13% compared with 2006. The increase in each year reflects higher selling prices and sales volumes of crude oil, higher refined product selling prices and increased sales volumes of electricity. The change in cost of goods sold in each year principally reflects the change in sales volumes and prices of refined products and purchased natural gas and electricity. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table sets forth certain relevant measures of the Corporations liquidity and capital resources as of December 31: 2008 2007 (Millions of dollars) Cash and cash equivalents $ 908 $ 607 Current portion of long term debt $ 143 $ 62 Total debt $ 3,955 $ 3,980 Stockholders equity $ 12,307 $ 9,774 Debt to capitalization ratio* 24.3 % 28.9 % * Total debt as a percentage of the sum of total debt plus stockholders equity. 28 Table of Contents Cash Flows The following table sets forth a summary of the Corporations cash flows: 2008 2007 2006 (Millions of dollars) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 4,567 $ 3,507 $ 3,491 Investing activities (4,444 ) (3,474 ) (3,289 ) Financing activities 178 191 (134 ) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 301 $ 224 $ 68 Operating Activities: Net cash provided by operating activities, including changes in operating assets and liabilities, increased to $4,567 million in 2008 from $3,507 million in 2007, reflecting increased earnings. Operating cash flow was comparable in 2007 and 2006. The Corporation received cash distributions from HOVENSA of $50 million in 2008, $300 million in 2007 and $400 million in 2006. Investing Activities: The following table summarizes the Corporations capital expenditures: 2008 2007 2006 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and Production Exploration $ 744 $ 371 $ 590 Production and development 2,523 2,605 2,164 Acquisitions (including leaseholds) 984 462 921 4,251 3,438 3,675 Marketing, Refining and Corporate 187 140 169 Total $ 4,438 $ 3,578 $ 3,844 Capital expenditures in 2008 include leasehold acquisitions in the United States of $600 million and $210 million for the acquisition of the remaining 22.5% interest in the Corporations Gabonese subsidiary. In 2008, the Corporation also selectively expanded its energy marketing business by acquiring fuel oil, natural gas, and electricity customer accounts, and a terminal and related assets, for an aggregate of approximately $100 million. In 2007, capital expenditures include the acquisition of a 28% interest in the Genghis Khan Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico for $371 million. In 2006, capital expenditures included payments of $359 million to re enter the Corporations former oil and gas production operations in the Waha concessions in Libya and $413 million to acquire a 55% working interest in the West Med Block in Egypt. In 2007, the Corporation received proceeds of $93 million for the sale of its interests in the Scott and Telford fields located in the United Kingdom. Proceeds from asset sales in 2006 totaled $444 million, including the sale of the Corporations interests in certain producing properties in the Permian Basin and onshore U.S. Gulf Coast. Financing Activities: During 2008, net repayments of debt were $32 million compared with net borrowings of $208 million in 2007. In 2006, the Corporation reduced debt by $13 million. Total common and preferred stock dividends paid were $130 million, $127 million and $161 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Corporation received net proceeds from the exercise of stock options, including related income tax benefits, of $340 million, $110 million and $40 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Future Capital Requirements and Resources The Corporation anticipates $3.2 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures in 2009, of which $3.1 billion relates to Exploration and Production operations. Of the total EP amount, $1.4 billion is for production and $900 million is for developments, with the remainder for exploration. The anticipated 2009 capital program 29 Table of Contents represents a decrease of approximately $1.6 billion from 2008, primarily as a result of lower crude oil selling prices. The Corporation also has maturities of long term debt of $143 million in 2009. The Corporation anticipates that it can fund its 2009 operations, including planned capital expenditures, dividends, pension contributions and required debt repayments, with existing cash on hand, projected cash flow from operations and available credit facilities. Crude oil and natural gas prices are volatile and difficult to predict in the near term as a result of the recent global economic recession. In addition, unplanned increases in the Corporations capital expenditure program could occur. The Corporation will take steps as necessary to protect its financial flexibility, and may pursue other sources of liquidity, including the issuance of debt or equity securities, or asset sales. The table below summarizes the capacity, usage, and remaining availability of the Corporations borrowing and letter of credit facilities at December 31, 2008 (in millions): Expiration Letters of Remaining Date Capacity Borrowings Credit Issued Total Used Capacity Revolving credit facility May 2012* $ 3,000 $ 350 $ 176 $ 526 $ 2,474 Asset backed credit facility October 2009 500 500 500 Committed lines Various** 1,993 1,973 1,973 20 Uncommitted lines Various 1,686 1,686 1,686 Total $ 7,179 $ 850 $ 3,835 $ 4,685 $ 2,494 * $75 million of capacity expires in May 2011. ** Committed lines have expiration dates ranging from 2009 through 2011. The Corporation maintains a $3.0 billion syndicated, revolving credit facility (the facility), of which $2,925 million is committed through May 2012. The facility can be used for borrowings and letters of credit. At December 31, 2008, additional available capacity under the facility was $2,474 million. The Corporation has a 364 day asset backed credit facility securitized by certain accounts receivable from its Marketing and Refining operations. Under the terms of this financing arrangement, the Corporation has the ability to borrow or issue letters of credit up to $500 million, subject to the availability of sufficient levels of eligible receivables. At December 31, 2008, outstanding borrowings under this facility were collateralized by $1,249 million of accounts receivable, which are held by a wholly owned subsidiary. These receivables are not available to pay the general obligations of the Corporation before repayment of outstanding borrowings under the asset backed facility. At December 31, 2008, $500 million of outstanding borrowings under the asset backed credit facility are classified as long term based on the Corporations available capacity under the committed revolving credit facility. In February 2009, the Corporation issued $250 million of 5 year senior unsecured notes with a coupon of 7% and $1 billion of 10 year senior unsecured notes with a coupon of 8.125%. The majority of the proceeds were used to repay revolving credit debt and outstanding borrowings on other credit facilities. The remainder of the proceeds is available for working capital and other corporate purposes. The Corporation also has a shelf registration under which it may issue additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or preferred stock. A loan agreement covenant based on the Corporations debt to equity ratio allows the Corporation to borrow up to an additional $16.6 billion for the construction or acquisition of assets at December 31, 2008. The Corporation has the ability to borrow up to an additional $2.8 billion of secured debt at December 31, 2008 under the loan agreement covenants. In order to reduce credit risk, the Corporation has agreements with counterparties to exchange collateral which is determined based on the fair values of positions held under these agreements. The Corporations $3.8 billion of letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2008 were primarily issued to satisfy collateral requirements. Additionally, the Corporation has posted cash collateral of approximately $394 million and has received cash 30 Table of Contents collateral of approximately $705 million from its hedging and trading counterparties. Changes in commodity prices can have a material impact on collateral requirements under these agreements. Credit Ratings There are three major credit rating agencies that rate the Corporations debt. All three agencies have currently assigned an investment grade rating to the Corporations debt. The interest rates and facility fees charged on the Corporations credit facilities, as well as margin requirements from non trading and trading counterparties, are subject to adjustment if the Corporations credit rating changes. Contractual Obligations and Contingencies Following is a table showing aggregated information about certain contractual obligations at December 31, 2008: Payments Due by Period 2010 and 2012 and Total 2009 2011 2013 Thereafter (Millions of dollars) Long term debt* $ 3,955 $ 143 $ 733 $ 907 $ 2,172 Operating leases 3,561 551 725 638 1,647 Purchase obligations Supply commitments 24,252 8,602 8,204 7,344 102 ** Capital expenditures 1,356 929 427 Operating expenses 1,011 486 321 77 127 Other long term liabilities 2,011 134 474 93 1,310 * At December 31, 2008, the Corporations debt bears interest at a weighted average rate of 6.7%. ** The Corporation intends to continue purchasing refined product supply from HOVENSA. Estimated future purchases amount to approximately $4.0 billion annually using year end 2008 prices. In the preceding table, the Corporations supply commitments include its estimated purchases of 50% of HOVENSAs production of refined products, after anticipated sales by HOVENSA to unaffiliated parties. The value of future supply commitments will fluctuate based on prevailing market prices at the time of purchase, the actual output from HOVENSA, and the level of sales to unaffiliated parties. Also included are term purchase agreements at market prices for additional gasoline necessary to supply the Corporations retail marketing system and feedstocks for the Port Reading refining facility. In addition, the Corporation has commitments to purchase refined products, natural gas and electricity to supply contracted customers in its energy marketing business. These commitments were computed based on year end market prices. The table also reflects future capital expenditures, including a portion of the Corporations planned $3.2 billion capital investment program for 2009 that is contractually committed at December 31, 2008. Obligations for operating expenses include commitments for transportation, seismic purchases, oil and gas production expenses and other normal business expenses. Other long term liabilities reflect contractually committed obligations on the balance sheet at December 31, 2008, including asset retirement obligations, pension plan liabilities and anticipated obligations for uncertain income tax positions. The Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries lease gasoline stations, drilling rigs, tankers, office space and other assets for varying periods under leases accounted for as operating leases. During 2007, the Corporation entered into a lease agreement for a new drillship and related support services for use in its global deepwater exploration and development activities beginning in the middle of 2009. The total payments under this five year contract are expected to be approximately $950 million. The Corporation has a contingent purchase obligation, expiring in April 2010, to acquire the remaining interest in WilcoHess, a retail gasoline station joint venture, for approximately $175 million as of December 31, 2008. The Corporation guarantees the payment of up to 50% of HOVENSAs crude oil purchases from certain suppliers other than PDVSA. The amount of the Corporations guarantee fluctuates based on the volume of crude oil 31 Table of Contents purchased and related prices and at December 31, 2008 amounted to $78 million. In addition, the Corporation has agreed to provide funding up to a maximum of $15 million to the extent HOVENSA does not have funds to meet its senior debt obligations. The Corporation is contingently liable under letters of credit and under guarantees of the debt of other entities directly related to its business, as follows: Total (Millions of dollars) Letters of credit $ 126 Guarantees 93 $ 219 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Corporation has leveraged leases not included in its balance sheet, primarily related to retail gasoline stations that the Corporation operates. The net present value of these leases is $491 million at December 31, 2008 compared with $493 million at December 31, 2007. The Corporations December 31, 2008 debt to capitalization ratio would increase from 24.3% to 26.5% if these leases were included as debt. See also Note 4, Refining Joint Venture, and Note 16, Guarantees and Contingencies, in the notes to the financial statements. Foreign Operations The Corporation conducts exploration and production activities principally in Algeria, Australia, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Denmark, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Ghana, Indonesia, Libya, Malaysia, Norway, Peru, Russia, Thailand, the United Kingdom and the United States. Therefore, the Corporation is subject to the risks associated with foreign operations, including political risk, tax law changes, and currency risk. HOVENSA owns and operates a refinery in the United States Virgin Islands. In 2002, there was a political disruption in Venezuela that reduced the availability of Venezuelan crude oil used in refining operations; however, this disruption did not have a material adverse effect on the Corporations financial position. See also Item 1A. Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations. Accounting Policies Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities on the Corporations balance sheet and revenues and expenses on the income statement. The accounting methods used can affect net income, stockholders equity and various financial statement ratios. However, the Corporations accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity. Accounting for Exploration and Development Costs: Exploration and production activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses, brokers fees and other related costs, are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are capitalized. The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found. Exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and (2) sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. If either of those criteria is not met, or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the 32 Table of Contents capitalized well costs are charged to expense. Indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include: commitment of project personnel, active negotiations for sales contracts with customers, negotiations with governments, operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors. Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves: The determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities. The estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations, the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment, as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill. The Corporations oil and gas reserves are calculated in accordance with SEC regulations and interpretations and the requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board. For reserves to be booked as proved they must be commercially producible, government and project operator approvals must be obtained and, depending on the amount of the project cost, senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project. The Corporations oil and gas reserve estimation and reporting process involves an annual independent third party reserve determination as well as internal technical appraisals of reserves. The Corporation maintains its own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties. The Corporations technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells, performance reviews, new technical data and other studies. To provide consistency throughout the Corporation, standard reserve estimation guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and approval practices are used. The internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management review. The oil and gas reserve estimates reported in the Supplementary Oil and Gas Data in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) 69 Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing Activities (FAS 69) are determined independently by the consulting firm of DeGolyer and MacNaughton (DM) and are consistent with internal estimates. Annually, the Corporation provides DM with engineering, geological and geophysical data, actual production histories and other information necessary for the reserve determination. The Corporations and DMs technical staffs meet to review and discuss the information provided. Senior management and the Board of Directors review the final reserve estimates issued by DM. On December 31, 2008, the Securities and Exchange Commission published a final rule which revises its oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements. The revisions are effective for filings on Form 10 K for fiscal years ending December 31, 2009. The Corporation is evaluating the impact of these requirements on its oil and gas reserve estimates and disclosures. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Goodwill: As explained below there are significant differences in the way long lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing. The Corporation reviews long lived assets, including oil and gas fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered. Long lived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying amounts of the long lived assets are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted future net cash flow estimates, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows. In the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future net cash flows is based on managements best estimate of future prices, which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices, applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a risk adjusted rate, The projected production volumes represent reserves, including probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures. The production volumes, prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information. Oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, since the standardized measure requires the use of actual prices on the last day of the year. The Corporations impairment tests of long lived Exploration and Production producing assets are based on its best estimates of future production volumes (including recovery factors), selling prices, operating and capital costs, the timing of future production and other factors, which are updated each time an impairment test is performed. The 33 Table of Contents Corporation could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease, crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly. In accordance with FAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, the Corporations goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level, which is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. The impairment test is conducted annually in the fourth quarter or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable. The reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed. The Corporations goodwill is assigned to the Exploration and Production operating segment and it expects that the benefits of goodwill will be recovered through the operation of that segment. The Corporations fair value estimate of the Exploration and Production segment is the sum of: (1) the discounted anticipated cash flows of producing assets and known developments, (2) the estimated risk adjusted present value of exploration assets, and (3) an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential synergies including cost savings, access to new business opportunities, enterprise control, improved processes and increased market share. The Corporation also considers the relative market valuation of similar Exploration and Production companies. The determination of the fair value of the Exploration and Production operating segment depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves, future prices, timing of future net cash flows and market premiums. Significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of the Exploration and Production operating segment that could result in an impairment of goodwill. Because there are significant differences in the way long lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing, there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned to the Exploration and Production segment. Asset Retirement Obligations: The Corporation has material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain exploration and production locations. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the Corporation recognizes a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations. In addition, the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligations is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated. The Corporation capitalizes such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred. In order to measure these obligations, the Corporation estimates the fair value of the obligations by discounting the future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations. In determining these estimates, the Corporation is required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement, timing of settlement, interpretation of legal requirements, inflationary factors and discount rate. In addition, there are other external factors which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including: changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements, fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates, and advances in technology. As a result, the Corporations estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above. Changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values. Derivatives: The Corporation utilizes derivative instruments for both non trading and trading activities. In non trading activities, the Corporation uses futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and electricity, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In trading activities, the Corporation, principally through a consolidated partnership, trades energy commodities and derivatives, including futures, forwards, options and swaps, based on expectations of future market conditions. All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the Corporations balance sheet. The Corporations policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative. The changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges under FAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, are recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges) or hedges of firm commitments (fair 34 Table of Contents value hedges). The effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings. The change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives that are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges are tested for effectiveness prospectively before they are executed and both prospectively and retrospectively on an on going basis to determine whether they continue to qualify for hedge accounting. The prospective and retrospective effectiveness calculations are performed using either historical simulation or other statistical models, which utilize historical observable market data consisting of futures curves and spot prices. Fair Value Measurements: The Corporations derivative instruments and supplemental pension plan investments are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period. In determining fair value, the Corporation uses various valuation approaches, including the market and income approaches. The Corporations fair value measurements also include non performance risk and time value of money considerations. Counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances, and the Corporations credit is considered for accrued liabilities. The Corporation adopted the provisions of FAS 157, Fair Value Measurements (FAS 157), effective January 1, 2008. FAS 157 establishes a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the input, which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market (Level 1) to estimates determined using related market data (Level 3). Multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value, however, the level of fair value for each financial asset or liability is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy. Details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are as follows: Fair value measurements based on Level 1 inputs: Measurements that are most observable are based on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained from the principal markets in which they are traded. Closing prices are both readily available and representative of fair value. Market transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to assure liquidity. The fair value of certain of the Corporations exchange traded futures and options are considered Level 1. In addition, fair values for the majority of the Corporations supplemental pension plan investments are considered Level 1, since they are determined using quotations from national securities exchanges. Fair value measurements based on Level 2 inputs: Measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered Level 2. Measurements based on Level 2 inputs include over the counter derivative instruments that are priced on an exchange traded curve, but have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange traded contracts. The Corporation utilizes fair value measurements based on Level 2 inputs for certain forwards, swaps and options. The liability related to the Corporations crude oil hedges is classified as Level 2. Fair value measurements based on Level 3 inputs: Measurements that are least observable are estimated from related market data, determined from sources with little or no market activity for comparable contracts or are positions with longer durations. For example, in its energy marketing business, the Corporation sells natural gas and electricity to customers and offsets the price exposure by purchasing forward contracts. The fair value of these sales and purchases may be based on specific prices at less liquid delivered locations, which are classified as Level 3. Income Taxes: Judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements. These judgements include the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when management believes that it is more likely than not, that based on the technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. 35 Table of Contents The Corporation has net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in several jurisdictions, including the United States, and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits. Additionally, the Corporation has deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities. Regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized. If it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized. In evaluating realizability of deferred tax assets, the Corporation refers to the reversal periods for temporary differences, available carryforward periods for net operating losses and credit carryforwards, estimates of future taxable income, the availability of tax planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets and other factors. Estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the Corporations internal business forecasts. The Corporation does not provide for deferred U.S. income taxes applicable to undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Retirement Plans: The Corporation has funded non contributory defined benefit pension plans and an unfunded supplemental pension plan. In accordance with FAS 158, Employers Accounting For Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (FAS 158), the Corporation recognizes on the balance sheet the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans. The determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations; expected long term rates of return on plan assets; and rate of future increases in compensation levels. These assumptions represent estimates made by the Corporation, some of which can be affected by external factors. For example, the discount rate used to estimate the Corporations projected benefit obligation is based on a portfolio of high quality, fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations, while the expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category, weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category. Changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on the amounts reported in the Corporations financial statements. Changes in Accounting Policies As discussed on page 35, the Corporation adopted FAS 157 effective January 1, 2008. The impact of adopting FAS 157 was not material to the Corporations results of operations. Upon adoption, the Corporation recorded a reduction in the net deferred hedge losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income, which increased stockholders equity by $193 million, after income taxes. Effective December 31, 2008, the Corporation applied the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force 08 5, Issuers Accounting for Liabilities Measured at Fair Value with a Third Party Credit Enhancement (EITF 08 5). Upon adoption, the Corporation revalued certain derivative liabilities collateralized by letters of credit to reflect the Corporations credit rating rather than the credit rating of the issuing bank. The adoption resulted in an increase in sales and other operating revenues of approximately $13 million and an increase in other comprehensive income of approximately $78 million, with a corresponding decrease in derivative liabilities recorded within accounts payable. Recently Issued Accounting Standard In December 2007, the FASB issued FAS 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51 (FAS 160). FAS 160 changes the accounting for and reporting of noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary. The Corporation will adopt the provisions of FAS 160 effective January 1, 2009 and estimates that adoption will result in a decrease in other long term liabilities and an increase in stockholders equity of approximately $85 million. Environment, Health and Safety The Corporation has implemented a values based, socially responsible strategy focused on improving environment, health and safety performance and making a positive impact on communities. The strategy is supported by the Corporations environment, health, safety and social responsibility (EHS SR) policies and by 36 Table of Contents environment and safety management systems that help protect the Corporations workforce, customers and local communities. The Corporations management systems are designed to uphold or exceed international standards and are intended to promote internal consistency, adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in EHS SR performance. Improved performance may, in the short term, increase the Corporations operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to assets, reputation and license to operate. In addition to enhanced EHS SR performance, improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be realized as collateral benefits from investments in EHS SR. The Corporation has programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance, audit facilities, train employees, prevent and manage risks and emergencies and to generally meet corporate EHS SR goals. The Corporation and HOVENSA produce and the Corporation distributes fuel oils in the United States. Proposals by state regulatory agencies and legislatures have been made that would require a lower sulfur content of fuel oils. If adopted, these proposals could require capital expenditures by the Registrant and HOVENSA to meet the required sulfur content standards. As described in Item 3 Legal Proceedings, in 2003 the Corporation and HOVENSA began discussions with the U.S. EPA regarding the EPAs Petroleum Refining Initiative (PRI). The PRI is an ongoing program that is designed to reduce certain air emissions at all U.S. refineries. Since 2000, the EPA has entered into settlements addressing these emissions with petroleum refining companies that control nearly 90% of the domestic refining capacity. Negotiations with the EPA are continuing and substantial progress has been made toward resolving this matter for both the Corporation and HOVENSA. While the effect on the Corporation of the Petroleum Refining Initiative cannot be estimated until a final settlement is reached and entered by a court, additional future capital expenditures and operating expenses will likely be incurred over a number of years. The amount of penalties, if any, is not expected to be material to the Corporation. The Corporation has undertaken a program to assess, monitor and reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane. The Corporation recognizes that climate change is a global environmental concern with potentially significant consequences for society and the energy industry. The Corporation is committed to the responsible management of greenhouse gas emissions from our existing assets and future developments and is developing and implementing a strategy to control our carbon emissions. The Corporation will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation. Sites where corrective action may be necessary include gasoline stations, terminals, onshore exploration and production facilities, refineries (including solid waste management units under permits issued pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act) and, although not currently significant, Superfund sites where the Corporation has been named a potentially responsible party. The Corporation accrues for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable. At year end 2008, the Corporations reserve for estimated environmental liabilities was approximately $61 million. The Corporation expects that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites. The Corporations remediation spending was $23 million in 2008, $23 million in 2007 and $15 million in 2006. Capital expenditures for facilities, primarily to comply with federal, state and local environmental standards, other than for the low sulfur requirements, were $15 million in 2008 and $22 million in 2007 and 2006. Forward Looking Information Certain sections of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, including references to the Corporations future results of operations and financial position, liquidity and capital resources, capital expenditures, oil and gas production, tax rates, debt repayment, hedging, derivative, market risk and environmental disclosures, off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations and contingencies include forward looking information. Forward looking disclosures are based on the Corporations current understanding and assessment of these activities and reasonable assumptions about the future. Actual results may differ from these disclosures because of changes in market conditions, government actions and other factors. 37 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk In the normal course of its business, the Corporation is exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the price of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and electricity, as well as to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. In the disclosures that follow, these operations are referred to as non trading activities. The Corporation also has trading operations, principally through a 50% voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades energy commodities. These activities are also exposed to commodity risks primarily related to the prices of crude oil, natural gas and refined products. The following describes how these risks are controlled and managed. Controls: The Corporation maintains a control environment under the direction of its chief risk officer and through its corporate risk policy, which the Corporations senior management has approved. Controls include volumetric, term and value at risk limits. In addition, the chief risk officer must approve the use of new instruments or commodities. Risk limits are monitored daily and exceptions are reported to business units and to senior management. The Corporations risk management department also performs independent verifications of sources of fair values and validations of valuation models. These controls apply to all of the Corporations non trading and trading activities, including the consolidated trading partnership. The Corporations treasury department is responsible for administering foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs. Instruments: The Corporation primarily uses forward commodity contracts, foreign exchange forward contracts, futures, swaps, options and energy commodity based securities in its non trading and trading activities. These contracts are generally widely traded instruments with standardized terms. The following describes these instruments and how the Corporation uses them: Forward Commodity Contracts: The Corporation enters into contracts for the forward purchase and sale of commodities. At settlement date, the notional value of the contract is exchanged for physical delivery of the commodity. Forward contracts that are designated as normal purchase and sale contracts under FAS 133 are excluded from the quantitative market risk disclosures. Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts: The Corporation enters into forward contracts primarily for the British pound, the Norwegian krone, and the Danish krone, which commit the Corporation to buy or sell a fixed amount of these currencies at a predetermined exchange rate on a future date. Exchange Traded Contracts: The Corporation uses exchange traded contracts, including futures, on a number of different underlying energy commodities. These contracts are settled daily with the relevant exchange and may be subject to exchange position limits. Swaps: The Corporation uses financially settled swap contracts with third parties as part of its hedging and trading activities. Cash flows from swap contracts are determined based on underlying commodity prices and are typically settled over the life of the contract. Options: Options on various underlying energy commodities include exchange traded and third party contracts and have various exercise periods. As a seller of options, the Corporation receives a premium at the outset and bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the commodity underlying the option. As a purchaser of options, the Corporation pays a premium at the outset and has the right to participate in the favorable price movements in the underlying commodities. These premiums are a component of the fair value of the options. Energy Securities: Energy securities include energy related equity or debt securities issued by a company or government or related derivatives on these securities. 38 Table of Contents Value at Risk: The Corporation uses value at risk to monitor and control commodity risk within its trading and non trading activities. The value at risk model uses historical simulation and the results represent the potential loss in fair value over one day at a 95% confidence level. The model captures both first and second order sensitivities for options. The following table summarizes the value at risk results for trading and non trading activities. These results may vary from time to time as strategies change in trading activities or hedging levels change in non trading activities. Trading Non trading Activities Activities (Millions of dollars) 2008 At December 31 $ 17 $ 13 Average 13 90 High 17 140 Low 11 13 2007 At December 31 $ 10 $ 72 Average 12 63 High 13 72 Low 10 54 Non trading: The Corporations non trading activities may include hedging of crude oil and natural gas production. Futures and swaps are used to fix the selling prices of a portion of the Corporations future production and the related gains or losses are an integral part of the Corporations selling prices. In October 2008, the Corporation closed its Brent crude oil hedge positions by entering into offsetting contracts with the same counterparty covering 24,000 barrels per day from 2009 through 2012 at a per barrel price of $86.95 each year. The after tax deferred losses related to closed crude oil contracts will be recorded in earnings as the contracts mature. There were no hedges of WTI crude oil or natural gas production at December 31, 2008. The Corporation also markets energy commodities including refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity. The Corporation uses futures, swaps and options to manage the risk in its marketing activities. Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at December 31, 2008 includes after tax deferred losses of $1,478 million primarily related to closed crude oil contracts that were used as hedges of exploration and production sales. The Corporation uses foreign exchange contracts to reduce its exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates by entering into forward contracts for various currencies including the British pound, the Norwegian krone and the Danish krone. At December 31, 2008, the Corporation had $896 million of notional value foreign exchange contracts maturing in 2009. The fair value of the foreign exchange contracts was a payable of $75 million at December 31, 2008. The change in fair value of the foreign exchange contracts from a 20% change in exchange rates is estimated to be approximately $165 million at December 31, 2008. The Corporations outstanding debt of $3,955 million has a fair value of $3,883 million at December 31, 2008. A 15% decrease in the rate of interest would increase the fair value of debt by approximately $85 million at December 31, 2008. Trading: In trading activities, the Corporation is primarily exposed to changes in crude oil, natural gas and refined product prices. The trading partnership in which the Corporation has a 50% voting interest trades energy commodities, securities and derivatives. The accounts of the partnership are consolidated with those of the Corporation. The Corporation also takes trading positions for its own account. The information that follows represents 100% of the trading partnership and the Corporations proprietary trading accounts. 39 Table of Contents Gains or losses from sales of physical products are recorded at the time of sale. Total realized gains (losses) on trading activities amounted to $(317) million in 2008 and $303 million in 2007. Derivative trading transactions are marked to market and unrealized gains or losses are reflected in income currently. The following table provides an assessment of the factors affecting the changes in fair value of trading activities and represents 100% of the trading partnership and other trading activities. 2008 2007 (Millions of dollars) Fair value of contracts outstanding at the beginning of the year $ 154 $ 365 Change in fair value of contracts outstanding at the beginning of the year and still outstanding at the end of year (257 ) 193 Reversal of fair value for contracts closed during the year 42 (230 ) Fair value of contracts entered into during the year and still outstanding 925 (174 ) Fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the year $ 864 $ 154 The Corporation measures fair value and summarizes the sources of fair value for derivatives in accordance with the provisions of FAS 157.
