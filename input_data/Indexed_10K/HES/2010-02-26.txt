Item 1A. Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations Our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant risk factors, including those described below. The risk factors described below could negatively affect our operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, and as a result, holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments. It is possible additional risks relating to our securities may be described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in the future. Commodity Price Risk: Our estimated proved reserves, revenue, operating cash flows, operating margins, future earnings and trading operations are highly dependent on the prices of crude oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products, which are influenced by numerous factors beyond our control. Historically these prices have been very volatile and most recently have been affected by changes in demand associated with the global economic downturn. The major foreign oil producing countries, including members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), exert considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products. Their ability or inability to agree on a common policy on rates of production and other matters has a significant impact on the oil markets. The commodities trading markets may also influence the selling prices of crude oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products. To the extent that we engage in hedging activities to mitigate commodity price volatility, we may not realize the benefit of price increases above the hedged price. Changes in commodity prices can also have a material impact on collateral and margin requirements under our derivative contracts. In addition, we utilize significant bank credit facilities to support these collateral and margin requirements. An inability to renew or replace such credit facilities as they mature would negatively impact our liquidity. Technical Risk: We own or have access to a finite amount of oil and gas reserves which will be depleted over time. Replacement of oil and gas reserves is subject to successful exploration drilling, development activities, and enhanced recovery programs. Therefore, future oil and gas production is dependent on technical success in finding and developing additional hydrocarbon reserves. Exploration activity involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and geophysical data, which does not always successfully predict the presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Drilling risks include unexpected adverse conditions, irregularities in pressure or formations, equipment failure, blowouts and weather interruptions. Future developments may be affected by unforeseen reservoir conditions which negatively affect recovery factors or flow rates. The costs of drilling and development activities have increased in recent years which could negatively affect expected economic returns. Reserve replacement can also be achieved through acquisition. Although due diligence is used in evaluating acquired oil and gas properties, similar risks may be encountered in the production of oil and gas on properties acquired from others. 11 Table of Contents Oil and Gas Reserves and Discounted Future Net Cash Flow Risks: Numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues from those reserves. Actual future production, oil and gas prices, revenues, taxes, capital expenditures, operating expenses, and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities and future net revenues of our proved reserves. In addition, reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward revisions based on production performance, purchases or sales of properties, results of future development, prevailing oil and gas prices, production sharing contracts, which may decrease reserves as crude oil and natural gas prices increase, and other factors. Political Risk: Federal, state, local, territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims, expropriation or nationalization of property, mandatory government participation, cancellation or amendment of contract rights, and changes in import regulations, limitations on access to exploration and development opportunities, as well as other political developments may affect our operations. Some of the international areas in which we operate and the partners with whom we operate, are politically less stable than other areas and partners. The threat of terrorism around the world also poses additional risks to the operations of the oil and gas industry. We market motor fuels through lessee dealers and wholesalers in certain states where legislation prohibits producers or refiners of crude oil from directly engaging in retail marketing of motor fuels. Similar legislation has been periodically proposed in various other states. Environmental Risk: Our oil and gas operations, like those of the industry, are subject to environmental risk such as oil spills, produced water spills, gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage. Our operations are also subject to numerous United States federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. Non compliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative, civil or criminal penalties, remedial clean ups and natural resource damages or other liabilities. In addition, increasingly stringent environmental regulations, particularly relating to the production of motor and other fuels have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general. Climate Change Risk: We recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern. Continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national, regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions. These agreements and measures may require significant equipment modifications, operational changes, taxes, or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of greenhouse gases from our operations, as a result of which we may incur substantial capital expenditures and compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs. In addition, we manufacture petroleum fuels, which through normal customer use result in the emission of greenhouse gases. Regulatory initiatives to reduce the use of these fuels may reduce our sales of, and revenues from, these products. Finally, to the extent that climate change may result in more extreme weather related events, we could experience increased costs related to prevention, maintenance and remediation of affected operations in addition to costs and lost revenues related to delays and shutdowns. Competitive Risk: The petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital intensive. We encounter competition from numerous companies in each of our activities, including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas, and in purchasing and marketing of refined products, natural gas and electricity. Many competitors, including national oil companies, are larger and have substantially greater resources. We are also in competition with producers and marketers of other forms of energy. Increased competition for worldwide oil and gas assets has significantly increased the cost of acquisitions. In addition, competition for drilling services, technical expertise and equipment has, in the recent past, affected the availability of technical personnel and drilling rigs and has therefore increased capital and operating costs. Catastrophic Risk: Although we maintain a level of insurance coverage consistent with industry practices against property and casualty losses, our oil and gas operations are subject to unforeseen occurrences which may damage or destroy assets or interrupt operations. Examples of catastrophic risks include hurricanes, fires, explosions and blowouts. These occurrences have affected us from time to time. 12 Table of Contents Item 3. Legal Proceedings The Corporation, along with many other companies engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline, has been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) in gasoline. A series of similar lawsuits, many involving water utilities or governmental entities, were filed in jurisdictions across the United States against producers of MTBE and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing MTBE, including the Corporation. The principal allegation in all cases is that gasoline containing MTBE is a defective product and that these parties are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of MTBE. In 2008, the majority of the cases against the Corporation were settled. In February 2010, the Corporation reached an agreement in principle to settle all but three of the remaining cases. The three unresolved cases consist of two cases that have been consolidated for pre trial purposes in the Southern District of New York as part of a multi district litigation proceeding and an action brought in state court by the State of New Hampshire. In 2007, a pre tax charge of $40 million was recorded to cover all of the known MTBE cases against the Corporation. Over the last several years, many refiners have entered into consent agreements to resolve the United States Environmental Protection Agencys (EPA) assertions that refining facilities were modified or expanded without complying with New Source Review regulations that require permits and new emission controls in certain circumstances and other regulations that impose emissions control requirements. These consent agreements, which arise out of an EPA enforcement initiative focusing on petroleum refiners and utilities, have typically imposed substantial civil fines and penalties and required (i) significant capital expenditures to install emissions control equipment over a three to eight year time period and (ii) changes to operations which resulted in increased operating costs. The capital expenditures, penalties and supplemental environmental projects for individual refineries covered by the settlements can vary significantly, depending on the size and configuration of the refinery, the circumstances of the alleged modifications and whether the refinery has previously installed more advanced pollution controls. The EPA initially contacted the Corporation and HOVENSA regarding the Petroleum Refinery Initiative in August 2003. Negotiations with the EPA and the relevant states and the Virgin Islands are continuing and substantial progress has been made toward resolving this matter for both the Corporation and HOVENSA. While the effect on the Corporation of the Petroleum Refining Initiative cannot be estimated until a final settlement is reached and entered by a court, additional significant future capital expenditures and operating expenses will likely be incurred by HOVENSA over a number of years. The amount of penalties, if any, is not expected to be material. On September 13, 2007, HOVENSA received a Notice Of Violation (NOV) pursuant to section 113(a)(i) of the Clean Air Act (Act) from the EPA finding that HOVENSA failed to obtain proper permitting for the construction and operation of its delayed coking unit in accordance with applicable law and regulations. HOVENSA believes it properly obtained all necessary permits for this project. The NOV states that the EPA has authority to issue an administrative order assessing penalties for violation of the Act. HOVENSA has entered into discussions with the EPA to reach resolution of this matter. The Corporation does not believe that this matter will result in material liability to HOVENSA or the Corporation. In December 2006, HOVENSA received a NOV from the EPA alleging non compliance with emissions limits in a permit issued by the Virgin Islands Department of Planning and Natural Resources (DPNR) for the two process heaters in the delayed coking unit. The NOV was issued in response to a voluntary investigation and submission by HOVENSA regarding potential non compliance with the permit emissions limits for two pollutants. Any exceedances were minor from the perspective of the amount of pollutants emitted in excess of the limits. HOVENSA has entered into discussions with the appropriate governmental agencies to reach resolution of this matter and does not believe that it will result in material liability to HOVENSA or the Corporation. The Corporation received a directive from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) to remediate contamination in the sediments of the lower Passaic River and NJDEP is also seeking natural resource damages. The directive, insofar as it affects the Corporation, relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in Newark, New Jersey now owned by the Corporation. The Corporation and over 70 companies entered into an Administrative Order on Consent with the EPA to study the same contamination. NJDEP has also sued several other companies linked to a facility considered by the State to be the largest contributor to river 13 Table of Contents contamination. In January 2009, these companies added third party defendants, including the Corporation, to that case. In June 2007, the EPA issued a draft study which evaluated six alternatives for early action, with costs ranging from $900 million to $2.3 billion. Based on adverse comments from the Corporation and others, the EPA is reevaluating its alternatives. In addition, the federal trustees for natural resources have begun a separate assessment of damages to natural resources in the Passaic River. Given the ongoing studies, remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at this time. Based on currently known facts and circumstances, the Corporation does not believe that this matter will result in material liability because its terminal could not have contributed contamination along most of the rivers length and did not store or use contaminants which are of the greatest concern in the river sediments, and because there are numerous other parties who will likely share in the cost of remediation and damages. In July 2004, Hess Oil Virgin Islands Corp. (HOVIC), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Corporation, and HOVENSA, each received a letter from the Commissioner of the Virgin Islands Department of Planning and Natural Resources and Natural Resources Trustees, advising of the Trustees intention to bring suit against HOVIC and HOVENSA under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). The letter alleges that HOVIC and HOVENSA are potentially responsible for damages to natural resources arising from releases of hazardous substances from the HOVENSA Oil Refinery. HOVENSA currently owns and operates a petroleum refinery on the south shore of St. Croix, United States Virgin Islands, which had been operated by HOVIC until October 1998. An action was filed on May 5, 2005 in the District Court of the Virgin Islands against HOVENSA, HOVIC and other companies that operated industrial facilities on the south shore of St. Croix asserting that the defendants are liable under CERCLA and territorial statutory and common law for damages to natural resources. HOVIC and HOVENSA do not believe that this matter will result in a material liability as they believe that they have strong defenses to this complaint, and they intend to vigorously defend this matter. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) notified the Corporation that on July 21, 2005 it commenced a private investigation into payments made to the government of Equatorial Guinea or to officials and persons affiliated with officials of the government of Equatorial Guinea. In 2009, the SEC advised that it had completed its investigation and did not intend to recommend enforcement action against the Corporation. The Corporation periodically receives notices from EPA that it is a potential responsible party under the Superfund legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites. Under this legislation, all potentially responsible parties are jointly and severally liable. For certain sites, EPAs claims or assertions of liability against the Corporation relating to these sites have not been fully developed. With respect to the remaining sites, EPAs claims have been settled, or a proposed settlement is under consideration, in all cases for amounts that are not material. The ultimate impact of these proceedings, and of any related proceedings by private parties, on the business or accounts of the Corporation cannot be predicted at this time due to the large number of other potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of clean up cost estimates, but is not expected to be material. The Corporation is from time to time involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings, including proceedings relating to other environmental matters. Although the ultimate outcome of these proceedings cannot be ascertained at this time and some of them may be resolved adversely to the Corporation, no such proceeding is required to be disclosed under applicable rules of the SEC. In managements opinion, based upon currently known facts and circumstances, such proceedings in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Corporation. 14 Table of Contents Item 4.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview The Corporation is a global integrated energy company that operates in two segments, Exploration and Production (EP) and Marketing and Refining (MR). The EP segment explores for, develops, produces, purchases, transports and sells crude oil and natural gas. The MR segment manufactures refined petroleum products and purchases, markets and trades, refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity. Net income in 2009 was $740 million compared with $2,360 million in 2008 and $1,832 million in 2007. Diluted earnings per share were $2.27 in 2009 compared with $7.24 in 2008 and $5.74 in 2007. A table of items affecting comparability between periods is shown on page 20. Exploration and Production The Corporations strategy for the EP segment is to profitably grow reserves and production in a sustainable and financially disciplined manner. The Corporations total proved reserves were 1,437 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) at December 31, 2009 compared with 1,432 million boe at December 31, 2008 and 1,330 million boe at December 31, 2007. Total proved reserves additions for 2009 were 157 million boe. These additions replaced approximately 103% of the Corporations 2009 production. EP net income was $1,042 million in 2009, $2,423 million in 2008 and $1,842 million in 2007. Average realized crude oil selling prices were $51.62 per barrel in 2009, $82.04 in 2008, and $63.44 in 2007, including the impact of hedging. The variance in EP earnings between years was primarily driven by the fluctuations in average realized crude oil selling prices. Production averaged 408,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in 2009 compared with 381,000 boepd in 2008 and 377,000 boepd in 2007. Production in 2009 increased 27,000 boepd or 7% from 2008. In 2010, the Corporation currently estimates total worldwide production will average between 400,000 and 410,000 boepd. The following is an update of significant EP activities during 2009: In March, production commenced at the Shenzi Field (Hess 28%) in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Net production from Shenzi averaged approximately 25,000 boepd for 2009. The Corporation sanctioned the Bakken shale play development in the Williston Basin of North Dakota. The Corporation plans to expand production facilities and increase the rig count to 10 from 3 over the next 18 months, and invest about $1 billion per year over the next five years. As a result, the Corporation projects an increase in net production from approximately 10,000 boepd in 2009 to approximately 80,000 boepd in 2015. In December 2009, the Corporation agreed to a strategic exchange of all of its interests in Gabon and the Clair Field (Hess 9%) in the United Kingdom for an additional 28% interest in the Valhall Field (currently Hess 28%) and an additional 25% interest in the Hod Field (currently Hess 25%), which are both offshore Norway. The transaction which has an effective date of January 1, 2010, is subject to various regulatory and other approvals. In addition, the partners are in discussions regarding the applicability of pre emption to this transaction. In the Carnarvon basin offshore Western Australia, the Corporation drilled seven exploration wells in 2009 on WA 390 P Block (Hess 100%), six of which were natural gas discoveries. Through December 31, 2009, the Corporation has drilled 11 of the 16 commitment wells on the block, nine of which were natural gas discoveries. The Corporation plans to drill the remaining five commitment wells on the block in 2010. On WA 404 P Block (Hess 50%), the operator completed a successful exploration well in 2009 and plans to drill the remaining eight commitment wells in 2010. In January 2010, the operator announced that the first well of the 2010 program discovered natural gas. At the Pony prospect on Green Canyon Block 468 (Hess 100%) in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, engineering and design work for field development progressed during 2009. The Corporation plans to drill an appraisal well on Green Canyon Block 469 in 2010. Two exploration wells were completed on Block BM S 22 (Hess 40%) offshore Brazil. A notice of discovery was filed for the first well and the second well was expensed. In 2010, the operator of BM S 22 18 Table of Contents plans to commence drilling of a third exploration well in the second half of the year. In 2009, the Corporation also drilled an exploration well on BM ES 30, which was expensed. The Corporation successfully flow tested the discovery well in exploration Area 54 (Hess 100%) offshore Libya and subsequently drilled and successfully flow tested a down dip appraisal well on the block. In 2010, the Corporation plans to reprocess 3D seismic, integrating acquired well information and will continue technical and commercial evaluation of the block. The Corporation acquired rights to explore a total of more than 80,000 net acres in the Marcellus gas shale formation in Pennsylvania. The Corporation is operator and holds a 100% interest on approximately 50,000 acres and holds a 50% non operated interest in the remaining acreage. Exploration drilling activity is expected to commence in 2010. Marketing and Refining The Corporations strategy for the MR segment is to deliver consistent operating performance and generate free cash flow. MR net income was $127 million in 2009, $277 million in 2008 and $300 million in 2007. The declining earnings were due to lower average margins, which include the effect of the global economic downturn that began in 2008 and continued into 2009. Refining operations contributed net income (loss) of $(87) million in 2009, $73 million in 2008 and $193 million in 2007. Marketing earnings were $168 million in 2009, $240 million in 2008 and $83 million in 2007. Liquidity and Capital and Exploratory Expenditures Net cash provided by operating activities was $3,046 million in 2009, $4,688 million in 2008 and $3,627 million in 2007, principally reflecting fluctuations in earnings. At December 31, 2009, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1,362 million compared with $908 million at December 31, 2008. Total debt was $4,467 million at December 31, 2009 compared with $3,955 million at December 31, 2008. In February 2009, the Corporation issued $250 million of 5 year senior unsecured notes with a coupon of 7% and $1 billion of 10 year senior unsecured notes with a coupon of 8.125%. The majority of the proceeds were used to repay debt under the revolving credit facility and outstanding borrowings on other credit facilities. In December 2009, the Corporation issued $750 million of 30 year bonds at a coupon of 6% and tendered for $662 million of bonds due in August 2011. The Corporation completed the repurchase of $546 million of the 2011 bonds in December 2009 and repurchased the remaining $116 million of these bonds in January 2010. The Corporations debt to capitalization ratio at December 31, 2009 was 24.8% compared with 24.2% at the end of 2008. Capital and exploratory expenditures were as follows for the years ended December 31: 2009 2008 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and Production United States $ 1,200 $ 2,164 International 1,927 2,477 Total Exploration and Production 3,127 4,641 Marketing, Refining and Corporate 118 187 Total Capital and Exploratory Expenditures $ 3,245 $ 4,828 Exploration expenses charged to income included above: United States $ 144 $ 211 International 183 179 Total exploration expenses charged to income included above $ 327 $ 390 The Corporation anticipates investing $4.1 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures in 2010, substantially all of which relates to EP operations. 19 Table of Contents Consolidated Results of Operations The after tax results by major operating activity are summarized below: 2009 2008 2007 (Millions of dollars, except per share data) Exploration and Production $ 1,042 $ 2,423 $ 1,842 Marketing and Refining 127 277 300 Corporate (205 ) (173 ) (150 ) Interest expense (224 ) (167 ) (160 ) Net income attributable to Hess Corporation $ 740 $ 2,360 $ 1,832 Net income per share diluted $ 2.27 $ 7.24 $ 5.74 The following table summarizes, on an after tax basis, items of income (expense) that are included in net income and affect comparability between periods.

Management believes that after tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre tax amount. After tax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre tax amounts. Comparison of Results Exploration and Production Following is a summarized income statement of the Corporations EP operations: 2009 2008 2007 (Millions of dollars) Sales and other operating revenues* $ 6,835 $ 9,806 $ 7,498 Other, net 207 (167 ) 65 Total revenues and non operating income 7,042 9,639 7,563 Costs and expenses Production expenses, including related taxes 1,805 1,872 1,581 Exploration expenses, including dry holes and lease impairment 829 725 515 General, administrative and other expenses 255 302 257 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 2,167 1,952 1,503 Total costs and expenses 5,056 4,851 3,856 Results of operations before income taxes 1,986 4,788 3,707 Provision for income taxes 944 2,365 1,865 Results of operations attributable to Hess Corporation $ 1,042 $ 2,423 $ 1,842 * Amounts differ from EP operating revenues in Note 16, Segment Information, primarily due to the exclusion of sales of hydrocarbons purchased from third parties. 20 Table of Contents After considering the EP items in the table on page 23, the remaining changes in EP earnings are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices, production volumes, operating costs, exploration expenses, foreign exchange, and income taxes, as discussed below. Selling prices: Lower average selling prices reduced EP revenues by approximately $4,000 million in 2009 compared with 2008. Higher average selling prices increased EP revenues by approximately $2,100 million in 2008 compared with 2007. The Corporations average selling prices were as follows: 2009 2008 2007 Crude oil per barrel (including hedging) United States $ 60.67 $ 96.82 $ 69.23 Europe 47.02 78.75 60.99 Africa 48.91 78.72 62.04 Asia and other 63.01 97.07 72.17 Worldwide 51.62 82.04 63.44 Crude oil per barrel (excluding hedging) United States $ 60.67 $ 96.82 $ 69.23 Europe 47.02 78.75 60.99 Africa 60.79 93.57 71.71 Asia and other 63.01 97.07 72.17 Worldwide 56.74 89.23 67.79 Natural gas liquids per barrel United States $ 36.57 $ 64.98 $ 51.89 Europe 43.23 74.63 57.20 Worldwide 38.47 67.61 53.72 Natural gas per mcf (including hedging) United States $ 3.36 $ 8.61 $ 6.67 Europe 5.15 9.44 6.13 Asia and other 5.06 5.24 4.71 Worldwide 4.85 7.17 5.60 Natural gas per mcf (excluding hedging) United States $ 3.36 $ 8.61 $ 6.67 Europe 5.15 9.79 6.13 Asia and other 5.06 5.24 4.71 Worldwide 4.85 7.30 5.60 In October 2008, the Corporation closed its Brent crude oil hedges, covering 24,000 barrels per day from 2009 though 2012, by entering into offsetting contracts with the same counterparty. The deferred after tax loss as of the date the hedge positions were closed will be recorded in earnings as the contracts mature. The estimated annual after tax loss from the closed positions will be approximately $335 million from 2010 through 2012. Crude oil hedges reduced EP earnings by $337 million ($533 million before income taxes) in 2009. Crude oil and natural gas hedges reduced EP earnings by $423 million ($685 million before income taxes) in 2008 and $244 million ($399 million before income taxes) in 2007. Production and sales volumes: The Corporations crude oil and natural gas production was 408,000 boepd in 2009 compared with 381,000 boepd in 2008 and 377,000 boepd in 2007. The Corporation currently estimates that its 2010 production will average between 400,000 and 410,000 boepd. 21 Table of Contents The Corporations net daily worldwide production was as follows (in thousands): 2009 2008 2007 Crude oil (barrels per day) United States 60 32 31 Europe 83 83 93 Africa 120 124 115 Asia and other 16 13 21 Total 279 252 260 Natural gas liquids (barrels per day) United States 11 10 10 Europe 3 4 5 Total 14 14 15 Natural gas (mcf per day) United States 93 78 88 Europe 151 255 259 Asia and other 446 356 266 Total 690 689 613 Barrels of oil equivalent* (barrels per day) 408 381 377 * Reflects natural gas production converted on the basis of relative energy content (six mcf equals one barrel). United States: Crude oil and natural gas production in the United States was higher in 2009 compared with 2008, primarily due to new production from the Shenzi Field and production resuming after the 2008 hurricanes. Crude oil production was slightly higher in 2008 compared with 2007, principally due to production from new wells in North Dakota and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, largely offset by the impact of hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. Natural gas production was lower in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily reflecting hurricane downtime and natural decline. Hurricane impacts reduced full year 2008 production by an estimated 7,000 boepd. Europe: Crude oil production was comparable in 2009 and 2008, as higher production in Russia offset lower production in the United Kingdom North Sea. Crude oil production in 2008 was lower than in 2007, due to temporary shut ins at three North Sea fields, the cessation of production at the Fife, Fergus, Flora and Angus fields, and natural decline. These decreases were partially offset by increased production in Russia. Natural gas production was lower in 2009 compared with 2008, primarily due to decline at the Atlantic and Cromarty fields. Africa: Crude oil production decreased in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to lower production from the Ceiba Field. Crude oil production increased in 2008 compared with 2007, primarily due to higher production at the Okume Complex, partially offset by a lower entitlement to Algerian production. Asia and other: Natural gas production in 2009 was higher than in 2008, primarily due to a full year of Phase 2 gas sales from the Joint Development Area of Malaysia/Thailand (JDA). Natural gas production increased in 2008 compared with 2007 due to increased production from Block A 18 in the JDA and a full year of production from the Ujung Pangkah Field in Indonesia. The decrease in crude oil production in 2008 from 2007 principally reflects changes to the Corporations entitlement to production in Azerbaijan. Sales volumes: Higher sales volumes and other operating revenues increased revenue by approximately $1,030 million in 2009 compared with 2008 and $200 million in 2008 compared with 2007. Operating costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization: Excluding the impact of items affecting comparability explained on page 23, cash operating costs, consisting of production expenses and general and administrative expenses, decreased by $119 million in 2009 and increased by $321 million in 2008 compared with the corresponding amounts in the prior years. The decrease in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to lower 22 Table of Contents production taxes (due to lower realized selling prices), the cessation of production at several North Sea fields, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by the impact of higher production volumes. The increase in costs in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to increased production taxes (due to higher realized selling prices), increased cost of services and materials and higher employee costs. Excluding the impact of items affecting comparability, depreciation, depletion and amortization charges increased by $192 million in 2009 and $531 million in 2008, compared with the corresponding amounts in the prior years. The increases in 2009 and 2008 were primarily due to higher production volumes and per barrel costs, reflecting higher finding and development costs. Excluding items affecting comparability between periods, unit costs were as follows. Cash operating costs per barrel of oil equivalent were $13.70 in 2009, $15.49 in 2008 and $13.36 in 2007. Cash operating costs in 2010 are estimated to be in the range of $15 to $16 per barrel of oil equivalent. Depreciation, depletion and amortization costs per barrel of oil equivalent were $14.19 in 2009, $13.79 in 2008 and $10.11 in 2007. Depreciation, depletion and amortization costs for 2010 are estimated to be in the range of $14.50 to $15.50 per barrel of oil equivalent. Exploration expenses: Exploration expenses increased in 2009 from 2008, primarily due to higher dry hole costs and lease amortization, partially offset by lower geological and seismic expense. Exploration expenses increased in 2008 compared to 2007, mainly due to higher dry hole costs. Income taxes: Excluding the impact of items affecting comparability, the effective income tax rates for EP operations were 48% in 2009, 49% in 2008 and 50% in 2007. The effective income tax rate for EP operations in 2010 is estimated to be in the range of 47% to 51%. Foreign Exchange: The after tax foreign currency losses were $10 million in 2009, $80 million in 2008 and $7 million in 2007. The foreign currency loss in 2008 reflects the net effect of significant exchange rate movements in the fourth quarter of 2008 on the remeasurement of assets, liabilities and foreign currency forward contracts by certain foreign businesses. Reported EP earnings include the following items affecting comparability of income (expense) before and after income taxes: Before Income Taxes After Income Taxes 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2007 (Millions of dollars) Royalty dispute resolution $ 143 $ $ $ 89 $ $ Gains from asset sales 21 15 Reductions in carrying values of assets (77 ) (30 ) (112 ) (44 ) (17 ) (56 ) Hurricane related costs (15 ) (9 ) Estimated production imbalance settlements (64 ) (33 ) $ 66 $ (45 ) $ (155 ) $ 45 $ (26 ) $ (74 ) 2009: In October 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court decided it would not review the decision of the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals against the U.S. Minerals Management Service relating to royalty relief under the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995. As a result, the Corporation recognized an after tax gain of $89 million to reverse all previously recorded royalties covering the periods from 2003 to 2009. The pre tax gain of $143 million is reported in Other, net within the Statement of Consolidated Income. After tax charges of $44 million ($77 million before income taxes) were recorded to impair the carrying values of production equipment and two short lived fields in the United Kingdom North Sea, and to write down materials inventories in Equatorial Guinea and the United States. The pre tax amount of the impairment charges totaling $52 million were reported in Depreciation, depletion and amortization and the majority of the $25 million in inventory write downs was reported in Production expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income. 23 Table of Contents 2008: The charge for asset impairments relates to mature fields in the United States and the United Kingdom North Sea. The hurricane costs relate to expenses associated with Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in the Gulf of Mexico and are recorded in Production expenses. 2007: The gain from asset sales relates to the sale of the Corporations interests in the Scott and Telford fields in the United Kingdom North Sea. The charge for asset impairments relates to two mature fields also in the United Kingdom North Sea. The estimated production imbalance settlements represent a charge for adjustments to prior meter readings at two offshore fields, which are recorded as a reduction of Sales and other operating revenues. The Corporations future EP earnings may be impacted by external factors, such as volatility in the selling prices of crude oil and natural gas, reserve and production changes, political risk, industry costs, exploration expenses, the effects of weather and changes in foreign exchange and income tax rates. Marketing and Refining Earnings from MR activities amounted to $127 million in 2009, $277 million in 2008 and $300 million in 2007. Excluding the items affecting comparability reflected in the table on page 20 and discussed below, the earnings were $115 million, $277 million and $276 million, respectively. Refining: Refining earnings (losses), which consist of the Corporations share of HOVENSAs results, Port Reading earnings, interest income on a note receivable from PDVSA and results of other miscellaneous operating activities, were $(87) million in 2009 (including a benefit of $12 million due to an income tax adjustment), $73 million in 2008, and $193 million in 2007. The Corporations share of HOVENSAs results was a loss of $141 million ($229 million before income taxes) in 2009, and income of $27 million ($44 million before income taxes) in 2008 and $108 million ($176 million before income taxes) in 2007. The declining earnings were principally due to lower refining margins. The 2009 and 2008 utilization rates for HOVENSA reflect weaker refining margins and planned and unplanned maintenance. The 2008 utilization rates also reflect a refinery wide shut down for Hurricane Omar. In 2007, the coker unit at HOVENSA was shutdown for approximately 30 days for a scheduled turnaround. Certain related processing units were also included in this turnaround. In January 2010, HOVENSA commenced a turnaround of its FCC unit which is expected to take approximately 40 days. The Corporations estimated share of HOVENSAs turnaround expenses after income taxes is expected to be approximately $20 million. Cash distributions received by the Corporation from HOVENSA were $50 million in 2008 and $300 million in 2007. In 2009, the remaining balance on the note issued by PDVSA at inception of the joint venture was fully repaid. Other after tax refining earnings, principally from Port Reading operations, were $43 million in both 2009 and 2008 and $79 million in 2007, reflecting lower margins. The Corporation is planning a turnaround for the Port Reading refining facility in the second quarter of 2010, which is expected to take approximately 35 days. The estimated after tax expenses for the Port Reading turnaround are approximately $25 million. The following table summarizes refinery utilization rates: Refinery Refinery Utilization Capacity 2009 2008 2007 (Thousands of barrels per day) HOVENSA Crude 500 80.3% 88.2% 90.8% Fluid catalytic cracker 150 70.2% 72.7% 87.1% Coker 58 81.6% 92.4% 83.4% Port Reading 70 90.2% 90.7% 93.2% Marketing: Marketing operations, which consist principally of retail gasoline and energy marketing activities, generated income of $168 million in 2009, $240 million in 2008 and $83 million in 2007, including income from the liquidation of LIFO inventories in 2007 totaling $24 million ($38 million before income taxes). 24 Table of Contents The decrease in earnings in 2009 compared with 2008 reflects lower margins in a weak economic environment. The increase in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily reflects higher margins on refined product sales, including sales of retail gasoline operations. The table below summarizes marketing sales volumes: 2009 2008 2007 Refined product sales (thousands of barrels per day) 473 472 451 Natural gas (thousands of mcf per day) 2,010 1,955 1,890 Electricity (megawatts round the clock) 4,306 3,152 2,821 The Corporation has a 50% voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades energy commodities and energy derivatives. The Corporation also takes trading positions for its own account. The Corporations after tax results from trading activities, including its share of the results of the trading partnership, amounted to earnings of $46 million in 2009, a loss of $36 million in 2008 and earnings of $24 million in 2007. Marketing expenses decreased in 2009 as compared with 2008, principally reflecting lower retail credit card fees. Marketing expenses increased in 2008 compared with 2007, due to growth in energy marketing activities, higher retail credit card fees, and increased transportation costs. The Corporations future MR earnings may be impacted by external factors, such as volatility in margins, competitive industry conditions, government regulations, credit risk, and supply and demand factors, including the effects of weather. Corporate The following table summarizes corporate expenses: 2009 2008 2007 (Millions of dollars) Corporate expenses $ 227 $ 260 $ 187 Income taxes (benefits) (82 ) (87 ) (62 ) After tax corporate expenses 145 173 125 Items affecting comparability between periods, after tax 60 25 Net corporate expenses $ 205 $ 173 $ 150 Excluding items affecting comparability between periods, the decrease in corporate expenses in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily reflects gains on supplemental pension related investments, together with lower employee and professional costs, partly offset by higher bank facility fees. The increase in corporate expenses in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily reflects losses on supplemental pension related investments and higher employee and professional costs. After tax corporate expenses in 2010 are estimated to be in the range of $160 to $170 million. In 2009, the Corporation recorded after tax charges of $34 million ($54 million before income taxes) related to the repurchase of $546 million in notes that were scheduled to mature in 2011 and $26 million ($42 million before income taxes) relating to retirement benefits and employee severance costs. The pre tax charge in connection with the debt repurchase was recorded in Other, net, and the pre tax amount of the retirement benefits and severance costs was recorded in General and administrative expenses within the Statement of Consolidated Income. In 2007, Corporate expenses included a charge of $25 million ($40 million before income taxes) related to MTBE litigation. The pre tax amount of this charge was recorded in General and administrative expenses. 25 Table of Contents Interest Interest expense was as follows: 2009 2008 2007 (Millions of dollars) Total interest incurred $ 366 $ 274 $ 306 Less capitalized interest 6 7 50 Interest expense before income taxes 360 267 256 Less income taxes 136 100 96 After tax interest expense $ 224 $ 167 $ 160 The increase in interest expense primarily reflects higher debt and fees for letters of credit. The decrease in capitalized interest in 2009 and 2008 compared to 2007 reflects the completion of several development projects in 2007. After tax interest expense in 2010 is expected to be in the range of $220 to $230 million. Sales and Other Operating Revenues Sales and other operating revenues totaled $29,614 million in 2009, a decrease of 28% compared with 2008. In 2008, sales and other operating revenues totaled $41,134 million, an increase of 30% compared with 2007. The fluctuations in each year primarily reflect changes in crude oil and refined product selling prices. The change in cost of goods sold in each year principally reflects the change in sales volumes and prices of refined products and purchased natural gas and electricity. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table sets forth certain relevant measures of the Corporations liquidity and capital resources as of December 31: 2009 2008 (Millions of dollars) Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,362 $ 908 Current portion of long term debt $ 148 $ 143 Total debt $ 4,467 $ 3,955 Total equity $ 13,528 $ 12,391 Debt to capitalization ratio* 24.8 % 24.2 % * Total debt as a percentage of the sum of total debt plus equity. Cash Flows The following table sets forth a summary of the Corporations cash flows: 2009 2008 2007 (Millions of dollars) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 3,046 $ 4,688 $ 3,627 Investing activities (2,924 ) (4,444 ) (3,474 ) Financing activities 332 57 71 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 454 $ 301 $ 224 Operating Activities: Net cash provided by operating activities, including changes in operating assets and liabilities, was $3,046 million in 2009 compared with $4,688 million in 2008, reflecting lower earnings. Operating 26 Table of Contents cash flow increased to $4,688 million in 2008 from $3,627 million in 2007, primarily reflecting increased earnings. The Corporation received cash distributions from HOVENSA of $50 million in 2008 and $300 million in 2007. Investing Activities: The following table summarizes the Corporations capital expenditures: 2009 2008 2007 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and Production Exploration $ 611 $ 744 $ 371 Production and development 1,927 2,523 2,605 Acquisitions (including leaseholds) 262 984 462 2,800 4,251 3,438 Marketing, Refining and Corporate 118 187 140 Total $ 2,918 $ 4,438 $ 3,578 Capital expenditures in 2009 include acquisitions of $188 million for unproved leaseholds and $74 million for a 50% interest in blocks PM301 and PM302 in Malaysia, which are adjacent to Block A 18 of the JDA. Capital expenditures in 2008 include $600 million for leasehold acquisitions in the United States and $210 million for the acquisition of the remaining 22.5% interest in the Corporations Gabonese subsidiary. In 2008, the Corporation also selectively expanded its energy marketing business by acquiring fuel oil, natural gas, and electricity customer accounts, and a terminal and related assets, for an aggregate of approximately $100 million. In 2007, capital expenditures include the acquisition of a 28% interest in the Genghis Khan Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico for $371 million. In 2007, the Corporation received proceeds of $93 million for the sale of its interests in the Scott and Telford fields located in the United Kingdom. Financing Activities: During 2009, net proceeds from borrowings were $447 million. In February 2009, the Corporation issued $250 million of 5 year senior unsecured notes with a coupon of 7% and $1 billion of 10 year senior unsecured notes with a coupon of 8.125%. The majority of the proceeds were used to repay debt under the revolving credit facility and outstanding borrowings on other credit facilities. In December 2009, the Corporation issued $750 million of 30 year bonds with a coupon of 6% and tendered for the $662 million of bonds due in August 2011. The Corporation completed the repurchase of $546 million of the 2011 bonds in December 2009. The remaining $116 million of 2011 bonds, classified as Current maturities of long term debt at December 31, 2009, was redeemed in January 2010, resulting in a charge of approximately $11 million ($7 million after income taxes). During 2008, net repayments of debt were $32 million, compared with net borrowings of $208 million in 2007. Total common stock dividends paid were $131 million, $130 million and $127 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Corporation received net proceeds from the exercise of stock options, including related income tax benefits, of $18 million, $340 million and $111 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Future Capital Requirements and Resources The Corporation anticipates investing a total of approximately $4.1 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures during 2010, substantially all of which is targeted for EP operations. In the Corporations MR operations, refining margins are currently weak, which have adversely affected HOVENSAs liquidity position. The Corporation intends to provide its share of any necessary financial support for HOVENSA. The Corporation expects to fund its 2010 operations, including capital expenditures, dividends, pension contributions and required debt repayments and any necessary financial support for HOVENSA, with existing cash on hand, cash flow from operations and its available credit facilities. Crude oil prices, natural gas prices and refining margins are volatile and difficult to predict. In addition, unplanned increases in the Corporations capital expenditure program could occur. If conditions were to change, such as a significant decrease in commodity prices or an unexpected increase in capital expenditures, the Corporation would take steps to protect its financial flexibility and may pursue other sources of liquidity, including the issuance of debt securities, the issuance of equity securities, and or asset sales. 27 Table of Contents The table below summarizes the capacity, usage, and available capacity of the Corporations borrowing and letter of credit facilities at December 31, 2009 (in millions): Expiration Letters of Available Date Capacity Borrowings Credit Issued Total Used Capacity Revolving credit facility May 2012(a) $ 3,000 $ $ $ $ 3,000 Asset backed credit facility July 2010(b) 741 500 500 241 Committed lines Various(c) 2,115 1,155 1,155 960 Uncommitted lines Various(c) 1,192 1,192 1,192 Total $ 7,048 $ $ 2,847 $ 2,847 $ 4,201 (a) $75 million expires in May 2011. (b) Total capacity of $1.0 billion subject to the amount of eligible receivables posted as collateral. (c) Committed and uncommitted lines have expiration dates primarily through 2010. The Corporation maintains a $3.0 billion syndicated, revolving credit facility (the facility), of which $2,925 million is committed through May 2012. The facility can be used for borrowings and letters of credit. At December 31, 2009, available capacity under the facility was $3.0 billion. The Corporation has a 364 day asset backed credit facility securitized by certain accounts receivable from its MR operations. At December 31, 2009, under the terms of this financing arrangement, the Corporation has the ability to borrow or issue letters of credit of up to $1.0 billion, subject to the availability of sufficient levels of eligible receivables. At December 31, 2009, outstanding letters of credit under this facility were collateralized by a total of $1,326 million of accounts receivable, which are held by a wholly owned subsidiary. These receivables are only available to pay the general obligations of the Corporation after satisfaction of the outstanding obligations under the asset backed facility. The Corporation also has a shelf registration under which it may issue additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or preferred stock. A loan agreement covenant based on the Corporations debt to capitalization ratio allows the Corporation to borrow up to an additional $18.1 billion for the construction or acquisition of assets at December 31, 2009. The Corporation has the ability to borrow up to an additional $3.7 billion of secured debt at December 31, 2009 under the loan agreement covenants. The Corporations $2,847 million in letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2009 were primarily issued to satisfy margin requirements. See also Note 14, Risk Management and Trading Activities. Credit Ratings There are three major credit rating agencies that rate the Corporations debt. All three agencies have currently assigned an investment grade rating to the Corporations debt. The interest rates and facility fees charged on some of the Corporations credit facilities, as well as margin requirements from risk management and trading counterparties, are subject to adjustment if the Corporations credit rating changes. 28 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Contingencies Following is a table showing aggregated information about certain contractual obligations at December 31, 2009: Payments Due by Period 2011 and 2013 and Total 2010 2012 2014 Thereafter (Millions of dollars) Long term debt* $ 4,467 $ 148 $ 66 $ 370 $ 3,883 Operating leases 3,282 482 695 677 1,428 Purchase obligations Supply commitments** 37,870 13,158 12,546 12,118 48 Capital expenditures 939 745 191 2 1 Operating expenses 937 457 276 70 134 Other long term liabilities 2,095 145 366 199 1,385 * At December 31, 2009, the Corporations debt bears interest at a weighted average rate of 7.3%. ** The Corporation intends to continue purchasing refined product supply from HOVENSA. Estimated future purchases amount to approximately $6.0 billion annually using year end 2009 prices, which have been included in the table through 2014. In the preceding table, the Corporations supply commitments include its estimated purchases of 50% of HOVENSAs production of refined products, after anticipated sales by HOVENSA to unaffiliated parties. The value of future supply commitments will fluctuate based on prevailing market prices at the time of purchase, the actual output from HOVENSA, and the level of sales to unaffiliated parties. Also included are term purchase agreements at market prices for additional gasoline necessary to supply the Corporations retail marketing system and feedstocks for the Port Reading refining facility. In addition, the Corporation has commitments to purchase refined products, natural gas and electricity to supply contracted customers in its energy marketing business. These commitments were computed based predominately on year end market prices. The table also reflects future capital expenditures, including the portion of the Corporations planned $4.1 billion capital investment program for 2010 that is contractually committed at December 31, 2009. Obligations for operating expenses include commitments for transportation, seismic purchases, oil and gas production expenses and other normal business expenses. Other long term liabilities reflect contractually committed obligations on the balance sheet at December 31, 2009, including asset retirement obligations, pension plan liabilities and anticipated obligations for uncertain income tax positions. The Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries lease gasoline stations, drilling rigs, tankers, office space and other assets for varying periods under leases accounted for as operating leases. The Corporation entered into a lease agreement for a new drillship and related support services for use in its global deepwater exploration and development activities. The total payments under this five year contract are expected to be approximately $950 million. The Corporation took delivery of the drillship in the fourth quarter of 2009. The Corporation has a contingent purchase obligation, expiring in April 2012, to acquire the remaining interest in WilcoHess, a retail gasoline station joint venture, for approximately $184 million as of December 31, 2009. The Corporation guarantees the payment of up to 50% of HOVENSAs crude oil purchases from certain suppliers other than PDVSA. The amount of the Corporations guarantee fluctuates based on the volume of crude oil purchased and related prices and at December 31, 2009 it amounted to $121 million. In addition, the Corporation has agreed to provide funding up to a maximum of $15 million to the extent HOVENSA does not have funds to meet its senior debt obligations. 29 Table of Contents The Corporation is contingently liable under letters of credit and under guarantees of the debt of other entities directly related to its business at December 31, 2009 as shown below: Total (Millions of dollars) Letters of credit $ 100 Guarantees 136 $ 236 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Corporation has leveraged leases not included in its balance sheet, primarily related to retail gasoline stations that the Corporation operates. The net present value of these leases is $412 million at December 31, 2009 compared with $491 million at December 31, 2008. The Corporations December 31, 2009 debt to capitalization ratio would increase from 24.8% to 26.5% if these leases were included as debt. See also Note 4, Refining Joint Venture, and Note 15, Guarantees and Contingencies, in the notes to the financial statements. Foreign Operations The Corporation conducts exploration and production activities outside the United States, principally in Algeria, Australia, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Ghana, Indonesia, Libya, Malaysia, Norway, Peru, Russia, Thailand, and the United Kingdom. Therefore, the Corporation is subject to the risks associated with foreign operations, including political risk, tax law changes, and currency risk. See also Item 1A. Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations. Accounting Policies Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities on the Corporations balance sheet and revenues and expenses on the income statement. The accounting methods used can affect net income, equity and various financial statement ratios. However, the Corporations accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity. Accounting for Exploration and Development Costs: Exploration and production activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses, brokers fees and other related costs, are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are capitalized. The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found. Exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and (2) sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. If either of those criteria is not met, or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the capitalized well costs are charged to expense. Indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include: commitment of project personnel, active negotiations for sales contracts with customers, negotiations with governments, operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors. Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves: The SEC revised its oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements effective for year end 2009 reporting. In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) revised its accounting standard on oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosures. The determination of estimated 30 Table of Contents proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities. The estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations, the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment, as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill. For reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. In addition, government and project operator approvals must be obtained and, depending on the amount of the project cost, senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project. The Corporation maintains its own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties. The Corporations technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells, performance reviews, new technical data and other studies. To provide consistency throughout the Corporation, standard reserve estimation guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and approval practices are used. The internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management review. The Corporation also engaged an independent third party consulting firm to audit approximately 80% of the Corporations total proved reserves. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Goodwill: As explained below there are significant differences in the way long lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing. The Corporation reviews long lived assets, including oil and gas fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered. Long lived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying amounts of the long lived assets are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted future net cash flow estimates, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows. In the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future net cash flows is based on managements best estimate of future prices, which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices, applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a risk adjusted rate. The projected production volumes represent reserves, including probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures. The production volumes, prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information. Oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve month average prices. The Corporations impairment tests of long lived EP producing assets are based on its best estimates of future production volumes (including recovery factors), selling prices, operating and capital costs, the timing of future production and other factors, which are updated each time an impairment test is performed. The Corporation could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease, crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly. The Corporations goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level, which is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. The impairment test is conducted annually in the fourth quarter or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable. The reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed. The Corporations goodwill is assigned to the EP operating segment and it expects that the benefits of goodwill will be recovered through the operation of that segment. The Corporations fair value estimate of the EP segment is the sum of: (1) the discounted anticipated cash flows of producing assets and known developments, (2) the estimated risk adjusted present value of exploration assets, and (3) an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential synergies including cost savings, access to new business opportunities, enterprise control, improved processes and increased market share. The Corporation also considers the relative market valuation of similar Exploration and Production companies. 31 Table of Contents The determination of the fair value of the EP segment depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves, future prices, timing of future net cash flows and market premiums. Significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of the EP segment that could result in an impairment of goodwill. As there are significant differences in the way long lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing, there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned to the EP segment. Income Taxes: Judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements. These judgments include the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when management believes that it is more likely than not, that based on the technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. The Corporation has net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in several jurisdictions, including the United States, and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits. Additionally, the Corporation has deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities. Regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized. If it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized. In evaluating realizability of deferred tax assets, the Corporation refers to the reversal periods for temporary differences, available carryforward periods for net operating losses and credit carryforwards, estimates of future taxable income, the availability of tax planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets and other factors. Estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the Corporations internal business forecasts. Additionally, the Corporation has income taxes which have been deferred on intercompany transactions eliminated in consolidation related to transfers of property, plant and equipment remaining within the consolidated group. The amortization of these income taxes deferred on intercompany transactions will occur ratably with the recovery through depletion and depreciation of the carrying value of these assets. The Corporation does not provide for deferred U.S. income taxes for that portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Fair Value Measurements: The Corporations derivative instruments and supplemental pension plan investments are recorded at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period. The Corporation uses various valuation approaches in determining fair value, including the market and income approaches. The Corporations fair value measurements also include non performance risk and time value of money considerations. Counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances, and the Corporations credit is considered for accrued liabilities. The Corporation determines fair value in accordance with the FASB fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy that categorizes the sources of inputs, which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market (Level 1) to estimates determined using related market data (Level 3). Multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value, however, the level of fair value is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy. Inputs include discounted cash flow calculations and other unobservable data. The Corporation also records certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value. These fair value measurements include assets and liabilities recorded in connection with business combinations, the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and long lived assets and goodwill measured at fair value in an impairment assessment. Details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values are as follows: Fair value measurements based on Level 1 inputs: Measurements that are most observable are based on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained from the principal markets in which they are traded. Closing prices are both readily available and representative of fair value. Market transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to assure liquidity. The fair value of certain of the Corporations exchange traded futures and options are considered Level 1. 32 Table of Contents Fair value measurements based on Level 2 inputs: Measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered Level 2. Measurements based on Level 2 inputs include over the counter derivative instruments that are priced on an exchange traded curve but have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange traded contracts. The Corporation utilizes fair value measurements based on Level 2 inputs for certain forwards, swaps and options. The liability related to the Corporations crude oil hedges is classified as Level 2. Fair value measurements based on Level 3 inputs: Measurements that are least observable are estimated from related market data determined from sources with little or no market activity for comparable contracts or are positions with longer durations. For example, in its energy marketing business, the Corporation sells natural gas and electricity to customers and offsets the price exposure by purchasing forward contracts. The fair value of these sales and purchases may be based on specific prices at less liquid delivered locations, which are classified as Level 3. Fair values determined using discounted cash flows are also classified as Level 3. Derivatives: The Corporation utilizes derivative instruments for both risk management and trading activities. In risk management activities, the Corporation uses futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and electricity, as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. In trading activities, the Corporation, principally through a consolidated partnership, trades energy commodities and derivatives, including futures, forwards, options and swaps, based on expectations of future market conditions. All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the Corporations balance sheet. The Corporations policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative. The changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges) or hedges of firm commitments (fair value hedges). The effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings. The change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives that are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges are tested for effectiveness prospectively before they are executed and both prospectively and retrospectively on an on going basis to determine whether they continue to qualify for hedge accounting. The prospective and retrospective effectiveness calculations are performed using either historical simulation or other statistical models, which utilize historical observable market data consisting of futures curves and spot prices. Retirement Plans: The Corporation has funded non contributory defined benefit pension plans and an unfunded supplemental pension plan. The Corporation recognizes on the balance sheet the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans. The determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations; expected long term rates of return on plan assets; and rate of future increases in compensation levels. These assumptions represent estimates made by the Corporation, some of which can be affected by external factors. For example, the discount rate used to estimate the Corporations projected benefit obligation is based on a portfolio of high quality, fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations, while the expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category, weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category. Changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on the amounts reported in the Corporations financial statements. Asset Retirement Obligations: The Corporation has material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain exploration and production locations. In accordance with 33 Table of Contents generally accepted accounting principles, the Corporation recognizes a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations. In addition, the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligations is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated. The Corporation capitalizes such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred. In order to measure these obligations, the Corporation estimates the fair value of the obligations by discounting the future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations. In determining these estimates, the Corporation is required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement, timing of settlement, interpretation of legal requirements, inflationary factors and discount rate. In addition, there are other external factors which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including: changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements, fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates, and advances in technology. As a result, the Corporations estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above. Changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values. Changes in Accounting Policies The FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) became effective on July 1, 2009. The ASC combined multiple sources of authoritative accounting literature into a single source of authoritative GAAP organized by accounting topic. Since the ASC was not intended to change existing GAAP, the only impact on the Corporations financial statements was that specific references to accounting principles have been changed to refer to the ASC. Effective January 1, 2009, the Corporation adopted the FASB accounting standard for the accounting for and reporting of noncontrolling interests in a consolidated subsidiary (ASC 810 Consolidation, originally issued as FAS 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51). As required, the Corporation retrospectively applied the presentation and disclosure requirements of this standard. At December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 noncontrolling interests of $144 million and $84 million, respectively, have been classified as a component of equity. Prior to adoption, noncontrolling interests were classified in Other liabilities. Net income (loss) attributable to the noncontrolling interests must also be separately reported in the Statement of Consolidated Income. Certain other amounts in the consolidated financial statements and footnotes have been reclassified to conform with the presentation requirements of this standard. Effective January 1, 2009, the Corporation adopted the FASB accounting standard that expanded the qualitative, quantitative and credit risk disclosure requirements related to an entitys use of derivative instruments (ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging, originally issued as FAS 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities). See Note 14, Risk Management and Trading Activities, for these disclosures. Effective January 1, 2009, the Corporation also adopted the FASB staff position that requires the application of the fair value measurement and disclosure provisions to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis (ASC 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, originally issued as FASB Staff Position No. 157 2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157). Such fair value measurements are determined based on the same fair value hierarchy of inputs required to measure the fair value of financial assets and liabilities. The impact of this accounting standard was not material to the Corporations consolidated financial statements. Effective June 30, 2009, the Corporation adopted the FASB accounting standard which provides guidance on the accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued (ASC 855 Subsequent Events, originally issued as FAS 165, Subsequent Events). The adoption of this standard did not impact the Corporations existing practice of evaluating subsequent events through the date the financial statements are issued. In January 2010, the FASB adopted an accounting standards update (ASU) Extractive Activities Oil and Gas (ASC 932 Oil and Gas Reserve Estimation and Disclosures) which is effective for financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2009 and amends the requirements for oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosures. The objective of the ASU was to align accounting standards with the previously issued SEC requirements on oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure. The main provisions of the ASU are to expand the definition of oil and gas producing activities to include the extraction of resources which are saleable as synthetic oil or gas, to change the price assumption used for reserve estimation and future cash flows to a twelve month average from the year end 34 Table of Contents price and to amend the geographic disclosure requirements for reporting reserves and other supplementary oil and gas data. See the Supplementary Oil and Gas Data for these disclosures. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In June 2009, the FASB amended existing accounting standards to eliminate the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity (ASC 860 Transfers and Servicing, originally issued as FAS 166, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140), which did not require consolidation under existing GAAP. The FASB also amended existing accounting standards to limit the circumstances in which transferred financial assets should be derecognized (ASC 810 Consolidation, originally issued as FAS 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. FIN 46(R)). The amended standards require additional analysis of variable interest entities to determine if consolidation is necessary. The adoption of these standards will not have a material impact on the Corporations financial statements. As required, the Corporation will adopt the provisions of these standards effective January 1, 2010. Environment, Health and Safety The Corporation has a values based, socially responsible strategy focused on improving environment, health and safety performance and making a positive impact on communities where it does business. The strategy is reflected in the Corporations environment, health, safety and social responsibility (EHS SR) policies and by environment and safety management systems that help protect the Corporations workforce, customers and local communities. The Corporations management systems are designed to uphold or exceed international standards and are intended to promote internal consistency, adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in EHS SR performance. Improved performance may, in the short term, increase the Corporations operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to assets, reputation and license to operate. In addition to enhanced EHS SR performance, improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be realized as collateral benefits from investments in EHS SR. The Corporation has programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance, audit facilities, train employees, prevent and manage risks and emergencies and to generally meet corporate EHS SR goals. The Corporation and HOVENSA produce and the Corporation distributes fuel oils in the United States. Proposals by state regulatory agencies and legislatures have been made that would require a lower sulfur content of fuel oils. If adopted, these proposals could require capital expenditures by the Corporation and HOVENSA to meet the required sulfur content standards. As described in Item 3, Legal Proceedings, in 2003 the Corporation and HOVENSA began discussions with the U.S. EPA regarding the EPAs Petroleum Refining Initiative (PRI). The PRI is an ongoing program that is designed to reduce certain air emissions at all U.S. refineries. Since 2000, the EPA has entered into settlements addressing these emissions with petroleum refining companies that control over 90% of the domestic refining capacity. Negotiations with the EPA are continuing and substantial progress has been made toward resolving this matter for both the Corporation and HOVENSA. While the effect on the Corporation of the Petroleum Refining Initiative cannot be estimated until a final settlement is reached and entered by a court, additional significant future capital expenditures and operating expenses will likely be incurred by HOVENSA over a number of years. The amount of penalties, if any, is not expected to be material. The Corporation has undertaken a program to assess, monitor and reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane. The Corporation recognizes that climate change is a global environmental concern. The Corporation is committed to the responsible management of greenhouse gas emissions from our existing assets and future developments and is implementing a strategy to control our carbon emissions. The Corporation will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation. Sites where corrective action may be necessary include gasoline stations, terminals, onshore exploration and production facilities, refineries (including solid waste management units under permits issued pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act) and, although not currently significant, Superfund sites where the Corporation has been named a potentially responsible party. 35 Table of Contents The Corporation accrues for environmental assessment and remediation expenditures for known sites when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable. At year end 2009, the Corporations reserve for estimated environmental liabilities was approximately $55 million. The Corporations environmental assessment and remediation expenditures were approximately $11 million in each of the years 2009, 2008 and 2007. The Corporation expects that existing reserves for environmental liabilities are sufficient for costs to assess and remediate known sites. The Corporation anticipates capital expenditures for facilities, primarily to comply with federal, state and local environmental standards, of approximately $50 million in 2010. Forward Looking Information Certain sections of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, including references to the Corporations future results of operations and financial position, liquidity and capital resources, capital expenditures, oil and gas production, tax rates, debt repayment, hedging, derivative, market risk and environmental disclosures, off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations and contingencies include forward looking information. Forward looking disclosures are based on the Corporations current understanding and assessment of these activities and reasonable assumptions about the future. Actual results may differ from these disclosures because of changes in market conditions, government actions and other factors. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk In the normal course of its business, the Corporation is exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the price of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and electricity, as well as to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. The Corporation also has trading operations, principally through a 50% voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades energy commodities and energy derivatives. These activities are also exposed to commodity risks primarily related to the prices of crude oil, natural gas and refined products. The following describes how these risks are controlled and managed. Controls: The Corporation maintains a control environment under the direction of its chief risk officer and through its corporate risk policy, which the Corporations senior management has approved. Controls include volumetric, term and value at risk limits. The chief risk officer must approve the use of new instruments or commodities. Risk limits are monitored and reported on daily to business units and to senior management. The Corporations risk management department also performs independent verifications of sources of fair values and validations of valuation models. These controls apply to all of the Corporations risk management and trading activities, including the consolidated trading partnership. The Corporations treasury department is responsible for administering foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs. The Corporation uses value at risk to monitor and control commodity risk within its trading and risk management activities. The value at risk model uses historical simulation and the results represent the potential loss in fair value over one day at a 95% confidence level. The model captures both first and second order sensitivities for options. Results may vary from time to time as strategies change in trading activities or hedging levels change in risk management activities. Instruments: The Corporation primarily uses forward commodity contracts, foreign exchange forward contracts, futures, swaps, options and energy commodity based securities in its risk management and trading activities. These contracts are generally widely traded instruments with standardized terms. The following describes these instruments and how the Corporation uses them: Forward Commodity Contracts: The Corporation enters into contracts for the forward purchase and sale of commodities. At settlement date, the notional value of the contract is exchanged for physical delivery of the commodity. Forward contracts that are deemed normal purchase and sale contracts are excluded from the quantitative market risk disclosures. Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts: The Corporation enters into forward contracts primarily for the British pound, the Euro, and the Thai Baht, which commit the Corporation to buy or sell a fixed amount of these currencies at a predetermined exchange rate on a future date. 36 Table of Contents Exchange Traded Contracts: The Corporation uses exchange traded contracts, including futures, on a number of different underlying energy commodities. These contracts are settled daily with the relevant exchange and may be subject to exchange position limits. Swaps: The Corporation uses financially settled swap contracts with third parties as part of its hedging and trading activities. Cash flows from swap contracts are determined based on underlying commodity prices and are typically settled over the life of the contract. Options: Options on various underlying energy commodities include exchange traded and third party contracts and have various exercise periods. As a seller of options, the Corporation receives a premium at the outset and bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the commodity underlying the option. As a purchaser of options, the Corporation pays a premium at the outset and has the right to participate in the favorable price movements in the underlying commodities. These premiums are a component of the fair value of the options. Energy Securities: Energy securities include energy related equity or debt securities issued by a company or government or related derivatives on these securities. Risk Management Activities Energy marketing activities: In its energy marketing activities, the Corporation sells refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity principally to commercial and industrial businesses at fixed and floating prices for varying periods of time. Commodity contracts such as futures, forwards, swaps and options together with physical assets, such as storage, are used to obtain supply and reduce margin volatility or lower costs related to sales contracts with customers. Corporate risk management: Corporate risk management activities include transactions designed to reduce risk in the selling prices of crude oil or natural gas produced by the Corporation or to reduce exposure to foreign currency or interest rate movements. Generally, futures, swaps or option strategies may be used to reduce risk in the selling price of a portion of the Corporations crude oil or natural gas production. Forward contracts may also be used to purchase certain currencies in which the Corporation does business with the intent of reducing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Interest rate swaps may also be used, generally to convert fixed rate interest payments to floating. The Corporation uses foreign exchange contracts to reduce its exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates by entering into formal contracts for various currencies including the British pound, the Euro and the Thai baht. At December 31, 2009 the Corporation had a payable of $16 million related to foreign exchange contracts maturing in 2010. The fair value of the foreign exchange contracts was also a payable of $16 million at December 31, 2009. The change in fair value of the foreign exchange contracts from a 20% strengthening of the US dollar exchange rate is estimated to be approximately $172 million at December 31, 2009. The Corporations debt of $4,467 million has a fair value of $5,073 million at December 31, 2009. A 15% decrease in the rate of interest would increase the fair value of debt by approximately $120 million at December 31, 2009.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview The Corporation is a global integrated energy company that operates in two segments, Exploration and Production (EP) and Marketing and Refining (MR). The EP segment explores for, develops, produces, purchases, transports and sells crude oil and natural gas. The MR segment manufactures refined petroleum products and purchases, markets and trades, refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity. Net income in 2009 was $740 million compared with $2,360 million in 2008 and $1,832 million in 2007. Diluted earnings per share were $2.27 in 2009 compared with $7.24 in 2008 and $5.74 in 2007. A table of items affecting comparability between periods is shown on page 20. Exploration and Production The Corporations strategy for the EP segment is to profitably grow reserves and production in a sustainable and financially disciplined manner. The Corporations total proved reserves were 1,437 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) at December 31, 2009 compared with 1,432 million boe at December 31, 2008 and 1,330 million boe at December 31, 2007. Total proved reserves additions for 2009 were 157 million boe. These additions replaced approximately 103% of the Corporations 2009 production. EP net income was $1,042 million in 2009, $2,423 million in 2008 and $1,842 million in 2007. Average realized crude oil selling prices were $51.62 per barrel in 2009, $82.04 in 2008, and $63.44 in 2007, including the impact of hedging. The variance in EP earnings between years was primarily driven by the fluctuations in average realized crude oil selling prices. Production averaged 408,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in 2009 compared with 381,000 boepd in 2008 and 377,000 boepd in 2007. Production in 2009 increased 27,000 boepd or 7% from 2008. In 2010, the Corporation currently estimates total worldwide production will average between 400,000 and 410,000 boepd. The following is an update of significant EP activities during 2009: In March, production commenced at the Shenzi Field (Hess 28%) in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Net production from Shenzi averaged approximately 25,000 boepd for 2009. The Corporation sanctioned the Bakken shale play development in the Williston Basin of North Dakota. The Corporation plans to expand production facilities and increase the rig count to 10 from 3 over the next 18 months, and invest about $1 billion per year over the next five years. As a result, the Corporation projects an increase in net production from approximately 10,000 boepd in 2009 to approximately 80,000 boepd in 2015. In December 2009, the Corporation agreed to a strategic exchange of all of its interests in Gabon and the Clair Field (Hess 9%) in the United Kingdom for an additional 28% interest in the Valhall Field (currently Hess 28%) and an additional 25% interest in the Hod Field (currently Hess 25%), which are both offshore Norway. The transaction which has an effective date of January 1, 2010, is subject to various regulatory and other approvals. In addition, the partners are in discussions regarding the applicability of pre emption to this transaction. In the Carnarvon basin offshore Western Australia, the Corporation drilled seven exploration wells in 2009 on WA 390 P Block (Hess 100%), six of which were natural gas discoveries. Through December 31, 2009, the Corporation has drilled 11 of the 16 commitment wells on the block, nine of which were natural gas discoveries. The Corporation plans to drill the remaining five commitment wells on the block in 2010. On WA 404 P Block (Hess 50%), the operator completed a successful exploration well in 2009 and plans to drill the remaining eight commitment wells in 2010. In January 2010, the operator announced that the first well of the 2010 program discovered natural gas. At the Pony prospect on Green Canyon Block 468 (Hess 100%) in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, engineering and design work for field development progressed during 2009. The Corporation plans to drill an appraisal well on Green Canyon Block 469 in 2010. Two exploration wells were completed on Block BM S 22 (Hess 40%) offshore Brazil. A notice of discovery was filed for the first well and the second well was expensed. In 2010, the operator of BM S 22 18 Table of Contents plans to commence drilling of a third exploration well in the second half of the year. In 2009, the Corporation also drilled an exploration well on BM ES 30, which was expensed. The Corporation successfully flow tested the discovery well in exploration Area 54 (Hess 100%) offshore Libya and subsequently drilled and successfully flow tested a down dip appraisal well on the block. In 2010, the Corporation plans to reprocess 3D seismic, integrating acquired well information and will continue technical and commercial evaluation of the block. The Corporation acquired rights to explore a total of more than 80,000 net acres in the Marcellus gas shale formation in Pennsylvania. The Corporation is operator and holds a 100% interest on approximately 50,000 acres and holds a 50% non operated interest in the remaining acreage. Exploration drilling activity is expected to commence in 2010. Marketing and Refining The Corporations strategy for the MR segment is to deliver consistent operating performance and generate free cash flow. MR net income was $127 million in 2009, $277 million in 2008 and $300 million in 2007. The declining earnings were due to lower average margins, which include the effect of the global economic downturn that began in 2008 and continued into 2009. Refining operations contributed net income (loss) of $(87) million in 2009, $73 million in 2008 and $193 million in 2007. Marketing earnings were $168 million in 2009, $240 million in 2008 and $83 million in 2007. Liquidity and Capital and Exploratory Expenditures Net cash provided by operating activities was $3,046 million in 2009, $4,688 million in 2008 and $3,627 million in 2007, principally reflecting fluctuations in earnings. At December 31, 2009, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1,362 million compared with $908 million at December 31, 2008. Total debt was $4,467 million at December 31, 2009 compared with $3,955 million at December 31, 2008. In February 2009, the Corporation issued $250 million of 5 year senior unsecured notes with a coupon of 7% and $1 billion of 10 year senior unsecured notes with a coupon of 8.125%. The majority of the proceeds were used to repay debt under the revolving credit facility and outstanding borrowings on other credit facilities. In December 2009, the Corporation issued $750 million of 30 year bonds at a coupon of 6% and tendered for $662 million of bonds due in August 2011. The Corporation completed the repurchase of $546 million of the 2011 bonds in December 2009 and repurchased the remaining $116 million of these bonds in January 2010. The Corporations debt to capitalization ratio at December 31, 2009 was 24.8% compared with 24.2% at the end of 2008. Capital and exploratory expenditures were as follows for the years ended December 31: 2009 2008 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and Production United States $ 1,200 $ 2,164 International 1,927 2,477 Total Exploration and Production 3,127 4,641 Marketing, Refining and Corporate 118 187 Total Capital and Exploratory Expenditures $ 3,245 $ 4,828 Exploration expenses charged to income included above: United States $ 144 $ 211 International 183 179 Total exploration expenses charged to income included above $ 327 $ 390 The Corporation anticipates investing $4.1 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures in 2010, substantially all of which relates to EP operations. 19 Table of Contents Consolidated Results of Operations The after tax results by major operating activity are summarized below: 2009 2008 2007 (Millions of dollars, except per share data) Exploration and Production $ 1,042 $ 2,423 $ 1,842 Marketing and Refining 127 277 300 Corporate (205 ) (173 ) (150 ) Interest expense (224 ) (167 ) (160 ) Net income attributable to Hess Corporation $ 740 $ 2,360 $ 1,832 Net income per share diluted $ 2.27 $ 7.24 $ 5.74 The following table summarizes, on an after tax basis, items of income (expense) that are included in net income and affect comparability between periods. The items in the table below are explained on pages 23 through 25. 2009 2008 2007 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and Production $ 45 $ (26 ) $ (74 ) Marketing and Refining 12 24 Corporate (60 ) (25 ) $ (3 ) $ (26 ) $ (75 ) In the discussion that follows, the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after tax basis. Management reviews segment earnings on an after tax basis and uses after tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings. Management believes that after tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre tax amount. After tax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre tax amounts. Comparison of Results Exploration and Production Following is a summarized income statement of the Corporations EP operations: 2009 2008 2007 (Millions of dollars) Sales and other operating revenues* $ 6,835 $ 9,806 $ 7,498 Other, net 207 (167 ) 65 Total revenues and non operating income 7,042 9,639 7,563 Costs and expenses Production expenses, including related taxes 1,805 1,872 1,581 Exploration expenses, including dry holes and lease impairment 829 725 515 General, administrative and other expenses 255 302 257 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 2,167 1,952 1,503 Total costs and expenses 5,056 4,851 3,856 Results of operations before income taxes 1,986 4,788 3,707 Provision for income taxes 944 2,365 1,865 Results of operations attributable to Hess Corporation $ 1,042 $ 2,423 $ 1,842 * Amounts differ from EP operating revenues in Note 16, Segment Information, primarily due to the exclusion of sales of hydrocarbons purchased from third parties. 20 Table of Contents After considering the EP items in the table on page 23, the remaining changes in EP earnings are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices, production volumes, operating costs, exploration expenses, foreign exchange, and income taxes, as discussed below. Selling prices: Lower average selling prices reduced EP revenues by approximately $4,000 million in 2009 compared with 2008. Higher average selling prices increased EP revenues by approximately $2,100 million in 2008 compared with 2007. The Corporations average selling prices were as follows: 2009 2008 2007 Crude oil per barrel (including hedging) United States $ 60.67 $ 96.82 $ 69.23 Europe 47.02 78.75 60.99 Africa 48.91 78.72 62.04 Asia and other 63.01 97.07 72.17 Worldwide 51.62 82.04 63.44 Crude oil per barrel (excluding hedging) United States $ 60.67 $ 96.82 $ 69.23 Europe 47.02 78.75 60.99 Africa 60.79 93.57 71.71 Asia and other 63.01 97.07 72.17 Worldwide 56.74 89.23 67.79 Natural gas liquids per barrel United States $ 36.57 $ 64.98 $ 51.89 Europe 43.23 74.63 57.20 Worldwide 38.47 67.61 53.72 Natural gas per mcf (including hedging) United States $ 3.36 $ 8.61 $ 6.67 Europe 5.15 9.44 6.13 Asia and other 5.06 5.24 4.71 Worldwide 4.85 7.17 5.60 Natural gas per mcf (excluding hedging) United States $ 3.36 $ 8.61 $ 6.67 Europe 5.15 9.79 6.13 Asia and other 5.06 5.24 4.71 Worldwide 4.85 7.30 5.60 In October 2008, the Corporation closed its Brent crude oil hedges, covering 24,000 barrels per day from 2009 though 2012, by entering into offsetting contracts with the same counterparty. The deferred after tax loss as of the date the hedge positions were closed will be recorded in earnings as the contracts mature. The estimated annual after tax loss from the closed positions will be approximately $335 million from 2010 through 2012. Crude oil hedges reduced EP earnings by $337 million ($533 million before income taxes) in 2009. Crude oil and natural gas hedges reduced EP earnings by $423 million ($685 million before income taxes) in 2008 and $244 million ($399 million before income taxes) in 2007. Production and sales volumes: The Corporations crude oil and natural gas production was 408,000 boepd in 2009 compared with 381,000 boepd in 2008 and 377,000 boepd in 2007. The Corporation currently estimates that its 2010 production will average between 400,000 and 410,000 boepd. 21 Table of Contents The Corporations net daily worldwide production was as follows (in thousands): 2009 2008 2007 Crude oil (barrels per day) United States 60 32 31 Europe 83 83 93 Africa 120 124 115 Asia and other 16 13 21 Total 279 252 260 Natural gas liquids (barrels per day) United States 11 10 10 Europe 3 4 5 Total 14 14 15 Natural gas (mcf per day) United States 93 78 88 Europe 151 255 259 Asia and other 446 356 266 Total 690 689 613 Barrels of oil equivalent* (barrels per day) 408 381 377 * Reflects natural gas production converted on the basis of relative energy content (six mcf equals one barrel). United States: Crude oil and natural gas production in the United States was higher in 2009 compared with 2008, primarily due to new production from the Shenzi Field and production resuming after the 2008 hurricanes. Crude oil production was slightly higher in 2008 compared with 2007, principally due to production from new wells in North Dakota and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, largely offset by the impact of hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. Natural gas production was lower in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily reflecting hurricane downtime and natural decline. Hurricane impacts reduced full year 2008 production by an estimated 7,000 boepd. Europe: Crude oil production was comparable in 2009 and 2008, as higher production in Russia offset lower production in the United Kingdom North Sea. Crude oil production in 2008 was lower than in 2007, due to temporary shut ins at three North Sea fields, the cessation of production at the Fife, Fergus, Flora and Angus fields, and natural decline. These decreases were partially offset by increased production in Russia. Natural gas production was lower in 2009 compared with 2008, primarily due to decline at the Atlantic and Cromarty fields. Africa: Crude oil production decreased in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to lower production from the Ceiba Field. Crude oil production increased in 2008 compared with 2007, primarily due to higher production at the Okume Complex, partially offset by a lower entitlement to Algerian production. Asia and other: Natural gas production in 2009 was higher than in 2008, primarily due to a full year of Phase 2 gas sales from the Joint Development Area of Malaysia/Thailand (JDA). Natural gas production increased in 2008 compared with 2007 due to increased production from Block A 18 in the JDA and a full year of production from the Ujung Pangkah Field in Indonesia. The decrease in crude oil production in 2008 from 2007 principally reflects changes to the Corporations entitlement to production in Azerbaijan. Sales volumes: Higher sales volumes and other operating revenues increased revenue by approximately $1,030 million in 2009 compared with 2008 and $200 million in 2008 compared with 2007. Operating costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization: Excluding the impact of items affecting comparability explained on page 23, cash operating costs, consisting of production expenses and general and administrative expenses, decreased by $119 million in 2009 and increased by $321 million in 2008 compared with the corresponding amounts in the prior years. The decrease in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to lower 22 Table of Contents production taxes (due to lower realized selling prices), the cessation of production at several North Sea fields, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by the impact of higher production volumes. The increase in costs in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to increased production taxes (due to higher realized selling prices), increased cost of services and materials and higher employee costs. Excluding the impact of items affecting comparability, depreciation, depletion and amortization charges increased by $192 million in 2009 and $531 million in 2008, compared with the corresponding amounts in the prior years. The increases in 2009 and 2008 were primarily due to higher production volumes and per barrel costs, reflecting higher finding and development costs. Excluding items affecting comparability between periods, unit costs were as follows. Cash operating costs per barrel of oil equivalent were $13.70 in 2009, $15.49 in 2008 and $13.36 in 2007. Cash operating costs in 2010 are estimated to be in the range of $15 to $16 per barrel of oil equivalent. Depreciation, depletion and amortization costs per barrel of oil equivalent were $14.19 in 2009, $13.79 in 2008 and $10.11 in 2007. Depreciation, depletion and amortization costs for 2010 are estimated to be in the range of $14.50 to $15.50 per barrel of oil equivalent. Exploration expenses: Exploration expenses increased in 2009 from 2008, primarily due to higher dry hole costs and lease amortization, partially offset by lower geological and seismic expense. Exploration expenses increased in 2008 compared to 2007, mainly due to higher dry hole costs. Income taxes: Excluding the impact of items affecting comparability, the effective income tax rates for EP operations were 48% in 2009, 49% in 2008 and 50% in 2007. The effective income tax rate for EP operations in 2010 is estimated to be in the range of 47% to 51%. Foreign Exchange: The after tax foreign currency losses were $10 million in 2009, $80 million in 2008 and $7 million in 2007. The foreign currency loss in 2008 reflects the net effect of significant exchange rate movements in the fourth quarter of 2008 on the remeasurement of assets, liabilities and foreign currency forward contracts by certain foreign businesses. Reported EP earnings include the following items affecting comparability of income (expense) before and after income taxes: Before Income Taxes After Income Taxes 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2007 (Millions of dollars) Royalty dispute resolution $ 143 $ $ $ 89 $ $ Gains from asset sales 21 15 Reductions in carrying values of assets (77 ) (30 ) (112 ) (44 ) (17 ) (56 ) Hurricane related costs (15 ) (9 ) Estimated production imbalance settlements (64 ) (33 ) $ 66 $ (45 ) $ (155 ) $ 45 $ (26 ) $ (74 ) 2009: In October 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court decided it would not review the decision of the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals against the U.S. Minerals Management Service relating to royalty relief under the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995. As a result, the Corporation recognized an after tax gain of $89 million to reverse all previously recorded royalties covering the periods from 2003 to 2009. The pre tax gain of $143 million is reported in Other, net within the Statement of Consolidated Income. After tax charges of $44 million ($77 million before income taxes) were recorded to impair the carrying values of production equipment and two short lived fields in the United Kingdom North Sea, and to write down materials inventories in Equatorial Guinea and the United States. The pre tax amount of the impairment charges totaling $52 million were reported in Depreciation, depletion and amortization and the majority of the $25 million in inventory write downs was reported in Production expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income. 23 Table of Contents 2008: The charge for asset impairments relates to mature fields in the United States and the United Kingdom North Sea. The hurricane costs relate to expenses associated with Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in the Gulf of Mexico and are recorded in Production expenses. 2007: The gain from asset sales relates to the sale of the Corporations interests in the Scott and Telford fields in the United Kingdom North Sea. The charge for asset impairments relates to two mature fields also in the United Kingdom North Sea. The estimated production imbalance settlements represent a charge for adjustments to prior meter readings at two offshore fields, which are recorded as a reduction of Sales and other operating revenues. The Corporations future EP earnings may be impacted by external factors, such as volatility in the selling prices of crude oil and natural gas, reserve and production changes, political risk, industry costs, exploration expenses, the effects of weather and changes in foreign exchange and income tax rates. Marketing and Refining Earnings from MR activities amounted to $127 million in 2009, $277 million in 2008 and $300 million in 2007. Excluding the items affecting comparability reflected in the table on page 20 and discussed below, the earnings were $115 million, $277 million and $276 million, respectively. Refining: Refining earnings (losses), which consist of the Corporations share of HOVENSAs results, Port Reading earnings, interest income on a note receivable from PDVSA and results of other miscellaneous operating activities, were $(87) million in 2009 (including a benefit of $12 million due to an income tax adjustment), $73 million in 2008, and $193 million in 2007. The Corporations share of HOVENSAs results was a loss of $141 million ($229 million before income taxes) in 2009, and income of $27 million ($44 million before income taxes) in 2008 and $108 million ($176 million before income taxes) in 2007. The declining earnings were principally due to lower refining margins. The 2009 and 2008 utilization rates for HOVENSA reflect weaker refining margins and planned and unplanned maintenance. The 2008 utilization rates also reflect a refinery wide shut down for Hurricane Omar. In 2007, the coker unit at HOVENSA was shutdown for approximately 30 days for a scheduled turnaround. Certain related processing units were also included in this turnaround. In January 2010, HOVENSA commenced a turnaround of its FCC unit which is expected to take approximately 40 days. The Corporations estimated share of HOVENSAs turnaround expenses after income taxes is expected to be approximately $20 million. Cash distributions received by the Corporation from HOVENSA were $50 million in 2008 and $300 million in 2007. In 2009, the remaining balance on the note issued by PDVSA at inception of the joint venture was fully repaid. Other after tax refining earnings, principally from Port Reading operations, were $43 million in both 2009 and 2008 and $79 million in 2007, reflecting lower margins. The Corporation is planning a turnaround for the Port Reading refining facility in the second quarter of 2010, which is expected to take approximately 35 days. The estimated after tax expenses for the Port Reading turnaround are approximately $25 million. The following table summarizes refinery utilization rates: Refinery Refinery Utilization Capacity 2009 2008 2007 (Thousands of barrels per day) HOVENSA Crude 500 80.3% 88.2% 90.8% Fluid catalytic cracker 150 70.2% 72.7% 87.1% Coker 58 81.6% 92.4% 83.4% Port Reading 70 90.2% 90.7% 93.2% Marketing: Marketing operations, which consist principally of retail gasoline and energy marketing activities, generated income of $168 million in 2009, $240 million in 2008 and $83 million in 2007, including income from the liquidation of LIFO inventories in 2007 totaling $24 million ($38 million before income taxes). 24 Table of Contents The decrease in earnings in 2009 compared with 2008 reflects lower margins in a weak economic environment. The increase in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily reflects higher margins on refined product sales, including sales of retail gasoline operations. The table below summarizes marketing sales volumes: 2009 2008 2007 Refined product sales (thousands of barrels per day) 473 472 451 Natural gas (thousands of mcf per day) 2,010 1,955 1,890 Electricity (megawatts round the clock) 4,306 3,152 2,821 The Corporation has a 50% voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades energy commodities and energy derivatives. The Corporation also takes trading positions for its own account. The Corporations after tax results from trading activities, including its share of the results of the trading partnership, amounted to earnings of $46 million in 2009, a loss of $36 million in 2008 and earnings of $24 million in 2007. Marketing expenses decreased in 2009 as compared with 2008, principally reflecting lower retail credit card fees. Marketing expenses increased in 2008 compared with 2007, due to growth in energy marketing activities, higher retail credit card fees, and increased transportation costs. The Corporations future MR earnings may be impacted by external factors, such as volatility in margins, competitive industry conditions, government regulations, credit risk, and supply and demand factors, including the effects of weather. Corporate The following table summarizes corporate expenses: 2009 2008 2007 (Millions of dollars) Corporate expenses $ 227 $ 260 $ 187 Income taxes (benefits) (82 ) (87 ) (62 ) After tax corporate expenses 145 173 125 Items affecting comparability between periods, after tax 60 25 Net corporate expenses $ 205 $ 173 $ 150 Excluding items affecting comparability between periods, the decrease in corporate expenses in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily reflects gains on supplemental pension related investments, together with lower employee and professional costs, partly offset by higher bank facility fees. The increase in corporate expenses in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily reflects losses on supplemental pension related investments and higher employee and professional costs. After tax corporate expenses in 2010 are estimated to be in the range of $160 to $170 million. In 2009, the Corporation recorded after tax charges of $34 million ($54 million before income taxes) related to the repurchase of $546 million in notes that were scheduled to mature in 2011 and $26 million ($42 million before income taxes) relating to retirement benefits and employee severance costs. The pre tax charge in connection with the debt repurchase was recorded in Other, net, and the pre tax amount of the retirement benefits and severance costs was recorded in General and administrative expenses within the Statement of Consolidated Income. In 2007, Corporate expenses included a charge of $25 million ($40 million before income taxes) related to MTBE litigation. The pre tax amount of this charge was recorded in General and administrative expenses. 25 Table of Contents Interest Interest expense was as follows: 2009 2008 2007 (Millions of dollars) Total interest incurred $ 366 $ 274 $ 306 Less capitalized interest 6 7 50 Interest expense before income taxes 360 267 256 Less income taxes 136 100 96 After tax interest expense $ 224 $ 167 $ 160 The increase in interest expense primarily reflects higher debt and fees for letters of credit. The decrease in capitalized interest in 2009 and 2008 compared to 2007 reflects the completion of several development projects in 2007. After tax interest expense in 2010 is expected to be in the range of $220 to $230 million. Sales and Other Operating Revenues Sales and other operating revenues totaled $29,614 million in 2009, a decrease of 28% compared with 2008. In 2008, sales and other operating revenues totaled $41,134 million, an increase of 30% compared with 2007. The fluctuations in each year primarily reflect changes in crude oil and refined product selling prices. The change in cost of goods sold in each year principally reflects the change in sales volumes and prices of refined products and purchased natural gas and electricity. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table sets forth certain relevant measures of the Corporations liquidity and capital resources as of December 31: 2009 2008 (Millions of dollars) Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,362 $ 908 Current portion of long term debt $ 148 $ 143 Total debt $ 4,467 $ 3,955 Total equity $ 13,528 $ 12,391 Debt to capitalization ratio* 24.8 % 24.2 % * Total debt as a percentage of the sum of total debt plus equity. Cash Flows The following table sets forth a summary of the Corporations cash flows: 2009 2008 2007 (Millions of dollars) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 3,046 $ 4,688 $ 3,627 Investing activities (2,924 ) (4,444 ) (3,474 ) Financing activities 332 57 71 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 454 $ 301 $ 224 Operating Activities: Net cash provided by operating activities, including changes in operating assets and liabilities, was $3,046 million in 2009 compared with $4,688 million in 2008, reflecting lower earnings. Operating 26 Table of Contents cash flow increased to $4,688 million in 2008 from $3,627 million in 2007, primarily reflecting increased earnings. The Corporation received cash distributions from HOVENSA of $50 million in 2008 and $300 million in 2007. Investing Activities: The following table summarizes the Corporations capital expenditures: 2009 2008 2007 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and Production Exploration $ 611 $ 744 $ 371 Production and development 1,927 2,523 2,605 Acquisitions (including leaseholds) 262 984 462 2,800 4,251 3,438 Marketing, Refining and Corporate 118 187 140 Total $ 2,918 $ 4,438 $ 3,578 Capital expenditures in 2009 include acquisitions of $188 million for unproved leaseholds and $74 million for a 50% interest in blocks PM301 and PM302 in Malaysia, which are adjacent to Block A 18 of the JDA. Capital expenditures in 2008 include $600 million for leasehold acquisitions in the United States and $210 million for the acquisition of the remaining 22.5% interest in the Corporations Gabonese subsidiary. In 2008, the Corporation also selectively expanded its energy marketing business by acquiring fuel oil, natural gas, and electricity customer accounts, and a terminal and related assets, for an aggregate of approximately $100 million. In 2007, capital expenditures include the acquisition of a 28% interest in the Genghis Khan Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico for $371 million. In 2007, the Corporation received proceeds of $93 million for the sale of its interests in the Scott and Telford fields located in the United Kingdom. Financing Activities: During 2009, net proceeds from borrowings were $447 million. In February 2009, the Corporation issued $250 million of 5 year senior unsecured notes with a coupon of 7% and $1 billion of 10 year senior unsecured notes with a coupon of 8.125%. The majority of the proceeds were used to repay debt under the revolving credit facility and outstanding borrowings on other credit facilities. In December 2009, the Corporation issued $750 million of 30 year bonds with a coupon of 6% and tendered for the $662 million of bonds due in August 2011. The Corporation completed the repurchase of $546 million of the 2011 bonds in December 2009. The remaining $116 million of 2011 bonds, classified as Current maturities of long term debt at December 31, 2009, was redeemed in January 2010, resulting in a charge of approximately $11 million ($7 million after income taxes). During 2008, net repayments of debt were $32 million, compared with net borrowings of $208 million in 2007. Total common stock dividends paid were $131 million, $130 million and $127 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Corporation received net proceeds from the exercise of stock options, including related income tax benefits, of $18 million, $340 million and $111 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Future Capital Requirements and Resources The Corporation anticipates investing a total of approximately $4.1 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures during 2010, substantially all of which is targeted for EP operations. In the Corporations MR operations, refining margins are currently weak, which have adversely affected HOVENSAs liquidity position. The Corporation intends to provide its share of any necessary financial support for HOVENSA. The Corporation expects to fund its 2010 operations, including capital expenditures, dividends, pension contributions and required debt repayments and any necessary financial support for HOVENSA, with existing cash on hand, cash flow from operations and its available credit facilities. Crude oil prices, natural gas prices and refining margins are volatile and difficult to predict. In addition, unplanned increases in the Corporations capital expenditure program could occur. If conditions were to change, such as a significant decrease in commodity prices or an unexpected increase in capital expenditures, the Corporation would take steps to protect its financial flexibility and may pursue other sources of liquidity, including the issuance of debt securities, the issuance of equity securities, and or asset sales. 27 Table of Contents The table below summarizes the capacity, usage, and available capacity of the Corporations borrowing and letter of credit facilities at December 31, 2009 (in millions): Expiration Letters of Available Date Capacity Borrowings Credit Issued Total Used Capacity Revolving credit facility May 2012(a) $ 3,000 $ $ $ $ 3,000 Asset backed credit facility July 2010(b) 741 500 500 241 Committed lines Various(c) 2,115 1,155 1,155 960 Uncommitted lines Various(c) 1,192 1,192 1,192 Total $ 7,048 $ $ 2,847 $ 2,847 $ 4,201 (a) $75 million expires in May 2011. (b) Total capacity of $1.0 billion subject to the amount of eligible receivables posted as collateral. (c) Committed and uncommitted lines have expiration dates primarily through 2010. The Corporation maintains a $3.0 billion syndicated, revolving credit facility (the facility), of which $2,925 million is committed through May 2012. The facility can be used for borrowings and letters of credit. At December 31, 2009, available capacity under the facility was $3.0 billion. The Corporation has a 364 day asset backed credit facility securitized by certain accounts receivable from its MR operations. At December 31, 2009, under the terms of this financing arrangement, the Corporation has the ability to borrow or issue letters of credit of up to $1.0 billion, subject to the availability of sufficient levels of eligible receivables. At December 31, 2009, outstanding letters of credit under this facility were collateralized by a total of $1,326 million of accounts receivable, which are held by a wholly owned subsidiary. These receivables are only available to pay the general obligations of the Corporation after satisfaction of the outstanding obligations under the asset backed facility. The Corporation also has a shelf registration under which it may issue additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or preferred stock. A loan agreement covenant based on the Corporations debt to capitalization ratio allows the Corporation to borrow up to an additional $18.1 billion for the construction or acquisition of assets at December 31, 2009. The Corporation has the ability to borrow up to an additional $3.7 billion of secured debt at December 31, 2009 under the loan agreement covenants. The Corporations $2,847 million in letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2009 were primarily issued to satisfy margin requirements. See also Note 14, Risk Management and Trading Activities. Credit Ratings There are three major credit rating agencies that rate the Corporations debt. All three agencies have currently assigned an investment grade rating to the Corporations debt. The interest rates and facility fees charged on some of the Corporations credit facilities, as well as margin requirements from risk management and trading counterparties, are subject to adjustment if the Corporations credit rating changes. 28 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Contingencies Following is a table showing aggregated information about certain contractual obligations at December 31, 2009: Payments Due by Period 2011 and 2013 and Total 2010 2012 2014 Thereafter (Millions of dollars) Long term debt* $ 4,467 $ 148 $ 66 $ 370 $ 3,883 Operating leases 3,282 482 695 677 1,428 Purchase obligations Supply commitments** 37,870 13,158 12,546 12,118 48 Capital expenditures 939 745 191 2 1 Operating expenses 937 457 276 70 134 Other long term liabilities 2,095 145 366 199 1,385 * At December 31, 2009, the Corporations debt bears interest at a weighted average rate of 7.3%. ** The Corporation intends to continue purchasing refined product supply from HOVENSA. Estimated future purchases amount to approximately $6.0 billion annually using year end 2009 prices, which have been included in the table through 2014. In the preceding table, the Corporations supply commitments include its estimated purchases of 50% of HOVENSAs production of refined products, after anticipated sales by HOVENSA to unaffiliated parties. The value of future supply commitments will fluctuate based on prevailing market prices at the time of purchase, the actual output from HOVENSA, and the level of sales to unaffiliated parties. Also included are term purchase agreements at market prices for additional gasoline necessary to supply the Corporations retail marketing system and feedstocks for the Port Reading refining facility. In addition, the Corporation has commitments to purchase refined products, natural gas and electricity to supply contracted customers in its energy marketing business. These commitments were computed based predominately on year end market prices. The table also reflects future capital expenditures, including the portion of the Corporations planned $4.1 billion capital investment program for 2010 that is contractually committed at December 31, 2009. Obligations for operating expenses include commitments for transportation, seismic purchases, oil and gas production expenses and other normal business expenses. Other long term liabilities reflect contractually committed obligations on the balance sheet at December 31, 2009, including asset retirement obligations, pension plan liabilities and anticipated obligations for uncertain income tax positions. The Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries lease gasoline stations, drilling rigs, tankers, office space and other assets for varying periods under leases accounted for as operating leases. The Corporation entered into a lease agreement for a new drillship and related support services for use in its global deepwater exploration and development activities. The total payments under this five year contract are expected to be approximately $950 million. The Corporation took delivery of the drillship in the fourth quarter of 2009. The Corporation has a contingent purchase obligation, expiring in April 2012, to acquire the remaining interest in WilcoHess, a retail gasoline station joint venture, for approximately $184 million as of December 31, 2009. The Corporation guarantees the payment of up to 50% of HOVENSAs crude oil purchases from certain suppliers other than PDVSA. The amount of the Corporations guarantee fluctuates based on the volume of crude oil purchased and related prices and at December 31, 2009 it amounted to $121 million. In addition, the Corporation has agreed to provide funding up to a maximum of $15 million to the extent HOVENSA does not have funds to meet its senior debt obligations. 29 Table of Contents The Corporation is contingently liable under letters of credit and under guarantees of the debt of other entities directly related to its business at December 31, 2009 as shown below: Total (Millions of dollars) Letters of credit $ 100 Guarantees 136 $ 236 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Corporation has leveraged leases not included in its balance sheet, primarily related to retail gasoline stations that the Corporation operates. The net present value of these leases is $412 million at December 31, 2009 compared with $491 million at December 31, 2008. The Corporations December 31, 2009 debt to capitalization ratio would increase from 24.8% to 26.5% if these leases were included as debt. See also Note 4, Refining Joint Venture, and Note 15, Guarantees and Contingencies, in the notes to the financial statements. Foreign Operations The Corporation conducts exploration and production activities outside the United States, principally in Algeria, Australia, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Ghana, Indonesia, Libya, Malaysia, Norway, Peru, Russia, Thailand, and the United Kingdom. Therefore, the Corporation is subject to the risks associated with foreign operations, including political risk, tax law changes, and currency risk. See also Item 1A. Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations. Accounting Policies Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities on the Corporations balance sheet and revenues and expenses on the income statement. The accounting methods used can affect net income, equity and various financial statement ratios. However, the Corporations accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity. Accounting for Exploration and Development Costs: Exploration and production activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses, brokers fees and other related costs, are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are capitalized. The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found. Exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and (2) sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. If either of those criteria is not met, or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the capitalized well costs are charged to expense. Indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include: commitment of project personnel, active negotiations for sales contracts with customers, negotiations with governments, operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors. Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves: The SEC revised its oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements effective for year end 2009 reporting. In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) revised its accounting standard on oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosures. The determination of estimated 30 Table of Contents proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities. The estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations, the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment, as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill. For reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. In addition, government and project operator approvals must be obtained and, depending on the amount of the project cost, senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project. The Corporation maintains its own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties. The Corporations technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells, performance reviews, new technical data and other studies. To provide consistency throughout the Corporation, standard reserve estimation guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and approval practices are used. The internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management review. The Corporation also engaged an independent third party consulting firm to audit approximately 80% of the Corporations total proved reserves. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Goodwill: As explained below there are significant differences in the way long lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing. The Corporation reviews long lived assets, including oil and gas fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered. Long lived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying amounts of the long lived assets are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted future net cash flow estimates, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows. In the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future net cash flows is based on managements best estimate of future prices, which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices, applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a risk adjusted rate. The projected production volumes represent reserves, including probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures. The production volumes, prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information. Oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve month average prices. The Corporations impairment tests of long lived EP producing assets are based on its best estimates of future production volumes (including recovery factors), selling prices, operating and capital costs, the timing of future production and other factors, which are updated each time an impairment test is performed. The Corporation could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease, crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly. The Corporations goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level, which is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. The impairment test is conducted annually in the fourth quarter or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable. The reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed. The Corporations goodwill is assigned to the EP operating segment and it expects that the benefits of goodwill will be recovered through the operation of that segment. The Corporations fair value estimate of the EP segment is the sum of: (1) the discounted anticipated cash flows of producing assets and known developments, (2) the estimated risk adjusted present value of exploration assets, and (3) an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential synergies including cost savings, access to new business opportunities, enterprise control, improved processes and increased market share. The Corporation also considers the relative market valuation of similar Exploration and Production companies. 31 Table of Contents The determination of the fair value of the EP segment depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves, future prices, timing of future net cash flows and market premiums. Significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of the EP segment that could result in an impairment of goodwill. As there are significant differences in the way long lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing, there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned to the EP segment. Income Taxes: Judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements. These judgments include the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when management believes that it is more likely than not, that based on the technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. The Corporation has net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in several jurisdictions, including the United States, and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits. Additionally, the Corporation has deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities. Regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized. If it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized. In evaluating realizability of deferred tax assets, the Corporation refers to the reversal periods for temporary differences, available carryforward periods for net operating losses and credit carryforwards, estimates of future taxable income, the availability of tax planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets and other factors. Estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the Corporations internal business forecasts. Additionally, the Corporation has income taxes which have been deferred on intercompany transactions eliminated in consolidation related to transfers of property, plant and equipment remaining within the consolidated group. The amortization of these income taxes deferred on intercompany transactions will occur ratably with the recovery through depletion and depreciation of the carrying value of these assets. The Corporation does not provide for deferred U.S. income taxes for that portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Fair Value Measurements: The Corporations derivative instruments and supplemental pension plan investments are recorded at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period. The Corporation uses various valuation approaches in determining fair value, including the market and income approaches. The Corporations fair value measurements also include non performance risk and time value of money considerations. Counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances, and the Corporations credit is considered for accrued liabilities. The Corporation determines fair value in accordance with the FASB fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy that categorizes the sources of inputs, which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market (Level 1) to estimates determined using related market data (Level 3). Multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value, however, the level of fair value is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy. Inputs include discounted cash flow calculations and other unobservable data. The Corporation also records certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value. These fair value measurements include assets and liabilities recorded in connection with business combinations, the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and long lived assets and goodwill measured at fair value in an impairment assessment. Details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values are as follows: Fair value measurements based on Level 1 inputs: Measurements that are most observable are based on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained from the principal markets in which they are traded. Closing prices are both readily available and representative of fair value. Market transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to assure liquidity. The fair value of certain of the Corporations exchange traded futures and options are considered Level 1. 32 Table of Contents Fair value measurements based on Level 2 inputs: Measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered Level 2. Measurements based on Level 2 inputs include over the counter derivative instruments that are priced on an exchange traded curve but have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange traded contracts. The Corporation utilizes fair value measurements based on Level 2 inputs for certain forwards, swaps and options. The liability related to the Corporations crude oil hedges is classified as Level 2. Fair value measurements based on Level 3 inputs: Measurements that are least observable are estimated from related market data determined from sources with little or no market activity for comparable contracts or are positions with longer durations. For example, in its energy marketing business, the Corporation sells natural gas and electricity to customers and offsets the price exposure by purchasing forward contracts. The fair value of these sales and purchases may be based on specific prices at less liquid delivered locations, which are classified as Level 3. Fair values determined using discounted cash flows are also classified as Level 3. Derivatives: The Corporation utilizes derivative instruments for both risk management and trading activities. In risk management activities, the Corporation uses futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and electricity, as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. In trading activities, the Corporation, principally through a consolidated partnership, trades energy commodities and derivatives, including futures, forwards, options and swaps, based on expectations of future market conditions. All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the Corporations balance sheet. The Corporations policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative. The changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges) or hedges of firm commitments (fair value hedges). The effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings. The change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives that are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges are tested for effectiveness prospectively before they are executed and both prospectively and retrospectively on an on going basis to determine whether they continue to qualify for hedge accounting. The prospective and retrospective effectiveness calculations are performed using either historical simulation or other statistical models, which utilize historical observable market data consisting of futures curves and spot prices. Retirement Plans: The Corporation has funded non contributory defined benefit pension plans and an unfunded supplemental pension plan. The Corporation recognizes on the balance sheet the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans. The determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations; expected long term rates of return on plan assets; and rate of future increases in compensation levels. These assumptions represent estimates made by the Corporation, some of which can be affected by external factors. For example, the discount rate used to estimate the Corporations projected benefit obligation is based on a portfolio of high quality, fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations, while the expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category, weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category. Changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on the amounts reported in the Corporations financial statements. Asset Retirement Obligations: The Corporation has material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain exploration and production locations. In accordance with 33 Table of Contents generally accepted accounting principles, the Corporation recognizes a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations. In addition, the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligations is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated. The Corporation capitalizes such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred. In order to measure these obligations, the Corporation estimates the fair value of the obligations by discounting the future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations. In determining these estimates, the Corporation is required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement, timing of settlement, interpretation of legal requirements, inflationary factors and discount rate. In addition, there are other external factors which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including: changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements, fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates, and advances in technology. As a result, the Corporations estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above. Changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values. Changes in Accounting Policies The FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) became effective on July 1, 2009. The ASC combined multiple sources of authoritative accounting literature into a single source of authoritative GAAP organized by accounting topic. Since the ASC was not intended to change existing GAAP, the only impact on the Corporations financial statements was that specific references to accounting principles have been changed to refer to the ASC. Effective January 1, 2009, the Corporation adopted the FASB accounting standard for the accounting for and reporting of noncontrolling interests in a consolidated subsidiary (ASC 810 Consolidation, originally issued as FAS 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51). As required, the Corporation retrospectively applied the presentation and disclosure requirements of this standard. At December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 noncontrolling interests of $144 million and $84 million, respectively, have been classified as a component of equity. Prior to adoption, noncontrolling interests were classified in Other liabilities. Net income (loss) attributable to the noncontrolling interests must also be separately reported in the Statement of Consolidated Income. Certain other amounts in the consolidated financial statements and footnotes have been reclassified to conform with the presentation requirements of this standard. Effective January 1, 2009, the Corporation adopted the FASB accounting standard that expanded the qualitative, quantitative and credit risk disclosure requirements related to an entitys use of derivative instruments (ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging, originally issued as FAS 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities). See Note 14, Risk Management and Trading Activities, for these disclosures. Effective January 1, 2009, the Corporation also adopted the FASB staff position that requires the application of the fair value measurement and disclosure provisions to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis (ASC 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, originally issued as FASB Staff Position No. 157 2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157). Such fair value measurements are determined based on the same fair value hierarchy of inputs required to measure the fair value of financial assets and liabilities. The impact of this accounting standard was not material to the Corporations consolidated financial statements. Effective June 30, 2009, the Corporation adopted the FASB accounting standard which provides guidance on the accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued (ASC 855 Subsequent Events, originally issued as FAS 165, Subsequent Events). The adoption of this standard did not impact the Corporations existing practice of evaluating subsequent events through the date the financial statements are issued. In January 2010, the FASB adopted an accounting standards update (ASU) Extractive Activities Oil and Gas (ASC 932 Oil and Gas Reserve Estimation and Disclosures) which is effective for financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2009 and amends the requirements for oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosures. The objective of the ASU was to align accounting standards with the previously issued SEC requirements on oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure. The main provisions of the ASU are to expand the definition of oil and gas producing activities to include the extraction of resources which are saleable as synthetic oil or gas, to change the price assumption used for reserve estimation and future cash flows to a twelve month average from the year end 34 Table of Contents price and to amend the geographic disclosure requirements for reporting reserves and other supplementary oil and gas data. See the Supplementary Oil and Gas Data for these disclosures. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In June 2009, the FASB amended existing accounting standards to eliminate the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity (ASC 860 Transfers and Servicing, originally issued as FAS 166, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140), which did not require consolidation under existing GAAP. The FASB also amended existing accounting standards to limit the circumstances in which transferred financial assets should be derecognized (ASC 810 Consolidation, originally issued as FAS 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. FIN 46(R)). The amended standards require additional analysis of variable interest entities to determine if consolidation is necessary. The adoption of these standards will not have a material impact on the Corporations financial statements. As required, the Corporation will adopt the provisions of these standards effective January 1, 2010. Environment, Health and Safety The Corporation has a values based, socially responsible strategy focused on improving environment, health and safety performance and making a positive impact on communities where it does business. The strategy is reflected in the Corporations environment, health, safety and social responsibility (EHS SR) policies and by environment and safety management systems that help protect the Corporations workforce, customers and local communities. The Corporations management systems are designed to uphold or exceed international standards and are intended to promote internal consistency, adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in EHS SR performance. Improved performance may, in the short term, increase the Corporations operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to assets, reputation and license to operate. In addition to enhanced EHS SR performance, improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be realized as collateral benefits from investments in EHS SR. The Corporation has programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance, audit facilities, train employees, prevent and manage risks and emergencies and to generally meet corporate EHS SR goals. The Corporation and HOVENSA produce and the Corporation distributes fuel oils in the United States. Proposals by state regulatory agencies and legislatures have been made that would require a lower sulfur content of fuel oils. If adopted, these proposals could require capital expenditures by the Corporation and HOVENSA to meet the required sulfur content standards. As described in Item 3, Legal Proceedings, in 2003 the Corporation and HOVENSA began discussions with the U.S. EPA regarding the EPAs Petroleum Refining Initiative (PRI). The PRI is an ongoing program that is designed to reduce certain air emissions at all U.S. refineries. Since 2000, the EPA has entered into settlements addressing these emissions with petroleum refining companies that control over 90% of the domestic refining capacity. Negotiations with the EPA are continuing and substantial progress has been made toward resolving this matter for both the Corporation and HOVENSA. While the effect on the Corporation of the Petroleum Refining Initiative cannot be estimated until a final settlement is reached and entered by a court, additional significant future capital expenditures and operating expenses will likely be incurred by HOVENSA over a number of years. The amount of penalties, if any, is not expected to be material. The Corporation has undertaken a program to assess, monitor and reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane. The Corporation recognizes that climate change is a global environmental concern. The Corporation is committed to the responsible management of greenhouse gas emissions from our existing assets and future developments and is implementing a strategy to control our carbon emissions. The Corporation will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation. Sites where corrective action may be necessary include gasoline stations, terminals, onshore exploration and production facilities, refineries (including solid waste management units under permits issued pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act) and, although not currently significant, Superfund sites where the Corporation has been named a potentially responsible party. 35 Table of Contents The Corporation accrues for environmental assessment and remediation expenditures for known sites when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable. At year end 2009, the Corporations reserve for estimated environmental liabilities was approximately $55 million. The Corporations environmental assessment and remediation expenditures were approximately $11 million in each of the years 2009, 2008 and 2007. The Corporation expects that existing reserves for environmental liabilities are sufficient for costs to assess and remediate known sites. The Corporation anticipates capital expenditures for facilities, primarily to comply with federal, state and local environmental standards, of approximately $50 million in 2010. Forward Looking Information Certain sections of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, including references to the Corporations future results of operations and financial position, liquidity and capital resources, capital expenditures, oil and gas production, tax rates, debt repayment, hedging, derivative, market risk and environmental disclosures, off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations and contingencies include forward looking information. Forward looking disclosures are based on the Corporations current understanding and assessment of these activities and reasonable assumptions about the future. Actual results may differ from these disclosures because of changes in market conditions, government actions and other factors. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk In the normal course of its business, the Corporation is exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the price of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and electricity, as well as to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. The Corporation also has trading operations, principally through a 50% voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades energy commodities and energy derivatives. These activities are also exposed to commodity risks primarily related to the prices of crude oil, natural gas and refined products. The following describes how these risks are controlled and managed. Controls: The Corporation maintains a control environment under the direction of its chief risk officer and through its corporate risk policy, which the Corporations senior management has approved. Controls include volumetric, term and value at risk limits. The chief risk officer must approve the use of new instruments or commodities. Risk limits are monitored and reported on daily to business units and to senior management. The Corporations risk management department also performs independent verifications of sources of fair values and validations of valuation models. These controls apply to all of the Corporations risk management and trading activities, including the consolidated trading partnership. The Corporations treasury department is responsible for administering foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs. The Corporation uses value at risk to monitor and control commodity risk within its trading and risk management activities. The value at risk model uses historical simulation and the results represent the potential loss in fair value over one day at a 95% confidence level. The model captures both first and second order sensitivities for options. Results may vary from time to time as strategies change in trading activities or hedging levels change in risk management activities. Instruments: The Corporation primarily uses forward commodity contracts, foreign exchange forward contracts, futures, swaps, options and energy commodity based securities in its risk management and trading activities. These contracts are generally widely traded instruments with standardized terms. The following describes these instruments and how the Corporation uses them: Forward Commodity Contracts: The Corporation enters into contracts for the forward purchase and sale of commodities. At settlement date, the notional value of the contract is exchanged for physical delivery of the commodity. Forward contracts that are deemed normal purchase and sale contracts are excluded from the quantitative market risk disclosures. Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts: The Corporation enters into forward contracts primarily for the British pound, the Euro, and the Thai Baht, which commit the Corporation to buy or sell a fixed amount of these currencies at a predetermined exchange rate on a future date. 36 Table of Contents Exchange Traded Contracts: The Corporation uses exchange traded contracts, including futures, on a number of different underlying energy commodities. These contracts are settled daily with the relevant exchange and may be subject to exchange position limits. Swaps: The Corporation uses financially settled swap contracts with third parties as part of its hedging and trading activities. Cash flows from swap contracts are determined based on underlying commodity prices and are typically settled over the life of the contract. Options: Options on various underlying energy commodities include exchange traded and third party contracts and have various exercise periods. As a seller of options, the Corporation receives a premium at the outset and bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the commodity underlying the option. As a purchaser of options, the Corporation pays a premium at the outset and has the right to participate in the favorable price movements in the underlying commodities. These premiums are a component of the fair value of the options. Energy Securities: Energy securities include energy related equity or debt securities issued by a company or government or related derivatives on these securities. Risk Management Activities Energy marketing activities: In its energy marketing activities, the Corporation sells refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity principally to commercial and industrial businesses at fixed and floating prices for varying periods of time. Commodity contracts such as futures, forwards, swaps and options together with physical assets, such as storage, are used to obtain supply and reduce margin volatility or lower costs related to sales contracts with customers. Corporate risk management: Corporate risk management activities include transactions designed to reduce risk in the selling prices of crude oil or natural gas produced by the Corporation or to reduce exposure to foreign currency or interest rate movements. Generally, futures, swaps or option strategies may be used to reduce risk in the selling price of a portion of the Corporations crude oil or natural gas production. Forward contracts may also be used to purchase certain currencies in which the Corporation does business with the intent of reducing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Interest rate swaps may also be used, generally to convert fixed rate interest payments to floating. The Corporation uses foreign exchange contracts to reduce its exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates by entering into formal contracts for various currencies including the British pound, the Euro and the Thai baht. At December 31, 2009 the Corporation had a payable of $16 million related to foreign exchange contracts maturing in 2010. The fair value of the foreign exchange contracts was also a payable of $16 million at December 31, 2009. The change in fair value of the foreign exchange contracts from a 20% strengthening of the US dollar exchange rate is estimated to be approximately $172 million at December 31, 2009. The Corporations debt of $4,467 million has a fair value of $5,073 million at December 31, 2009. A 15% decrease in the rate of interest would increase the fair value of debt by approximately $120 million at December 31, 2009.
