Item 1A. Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations Our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant risk factors, including those described below. The risk factors described below could negatively affect our operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, and as a result, holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments. It is possible additional risks relating to our securities may be described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in the future. Our business and operating results are highly dependent on the market prices of crude oil, natural gas, refined petroleum products and electricity, which can be very volatile. Our estimated proved reserves, revenue, operating cash flows, operating margins, future earnings and trading operations are highly dependent on the prices of crude oil, natural gas, refined petroleum products and electricity, which are influenced by numerous factors beyond our control. Historically these prices have been very volatile. The major foreign oil producing countries, including members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), exert considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products. Their ability or inability to agree on a common policy on rates of production and other matters has a significant impact on the oil markets. The commodities trading markets as well as other supply and demand factors may also influence the selling prices of crude oil, natural gas, refined petroleum products and electricity. To the extent that we engage in hedging activities to mitigate commodity price volatility, we may not realize the benefit of price increases above the hedged price. Changes in commodity prices can also have a material impact on collateral and margin requirements under our derivative contracts. In addition, we utilize significant bank credit facilities to support these collateral and margin requirements. An inability to renew or replace such credit facilities as they mature would negatively impact our liquidity. If we fail to successfully increase our reserves, our future crude oil and natural gas production will be adversely impacted. We own or have access to a finite amount of oil and gas reserves which will be depleted over time. Replacement of oil and gas production and reserves, including proved undeveloped reserves, is subject to successful exploration drilling, development activities, and enhanced recovery programs. Therefore, future oil and gas production is dependent on technical success in finding and developing additional hydrocarbon reserves. Exploration activity involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and geophysical data, which does not always successfully predict the presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Drilling risks include 14 Table of Contents unexpected adverse conditions, irregularities in pressure or formations, equipment failure, blowouts and weather interruptions. Future developments may be affected by unforeseen reservoir conditions which negatively affect recovery factors or flow rates. The costs of drilling and development activities have increased in recent years which could negatively affect expected economic returns. Reserve replacement can also be achieved through acquisition. Although due diligence is used in evaluating acquired oil and gas properties, similar risks may be encountered in the production of oil and gas on properties acquired from others. There are inherent uncertainties in estimating quantities of proved reserves and discounted future net cash flow, and actual quantities may be lower than estimated. Numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues from those reserves. Actual future production, oil and gas prices, revenues, taxes, capital expenditures, operating expenses, and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities of our proved reserves and the related future net revenues. In addition, reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward revisions based on production performance, purchases or sales of properties, results of future development, prevailing oil and gas prices, production sharing contracts, which may decrease reserves as crude oil and natural gas prices increase, and other factors. We are subject to changing laws and regulations and other governmental actions that can significantly and adversely affect our business. Federal, state, local, territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims, expropriation or nationalization of property, mandatory government participation, cancellation or amendment of contract rights, and changes in import and export regulations, limitations on access to exploration and development opportunities, as well as other political developments may affect our operations. We also market motor fuels through lessee dealers and wholesalers in certain states where legislation prohibits producers or refiners of crude oil from directly engaging in retail marketing of motor fuels. Similar legislation has been periodically proposed in various other states. As a result of the accident in April 2010 at the BP operated Macondo prospect in the Gulf of Mexico (in which the Corporation was not a participant) and the ensuing significant oil spill, a temporary drilling moratorium was imposed in the Gulf of Mexico. While this moratorium has since been lifted, significant new regulations have been imposed and further legislation and regulations may be proposed, including an increase in the potential liability in the event of an oil spill. Uncertainty continues to exist as to the conditions under which future drilling in the Gulf of Mexico will occur. However, the new regulatory environment is expected to result in a longer permitting process and higher costs. Political instability in areas where we operate can adversely affect our business. Some of the international areas in which we operate, and the partners with whom we operate, are politically less stable than other areas and partners. Current political unrest in North Africa and the Middle East may affect our operations in these areas as well as oil and gas markets generally. The threat of terrorism around the world also poses additional risks to the operations of the oil and gas industry. Our oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks and environmental laws and regulations that can result in significant costs and liabilities. Our oil and gas operations, like those of the industry, are subject to environmental risk such as oil spills, produced water spills, gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage. For example, the accident at the BP operated Macondo prospect in April 2010 resulted in a significant release of crude oil which caused extensive environmental and economic damage. Our operations are also subject to numerous United States federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. Non compliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative, civil or criminal penalties, remedial clean ups and natural resource damages or other liabilities. In addition, increasingly stringent environmental regulations, particularly relating to the production of motor and other fuels, have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general. Concerns have been raised in certain jurisdictions where we have operations concerning the safety and environmental impact of the drilling and development of unconventional oil and gas resources, particularly using the process of hydraulic fracturing. While we believe that these operations can be conducted safely and with minimal impact on the environment, regulatory bodies are responding to these concerns and may impose temporary moratoriums and new regulations on such drilling operations that would likely have the effect of delaying and increasing the cost of such operations. 15 Table of Contents Concerns about climate change may result in significant operational changes and expenditures and reduced demand for our products. We recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern. Continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national, regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions. These agreements and measures may require significant equipment modifications, operational changes, taxes, or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of greenhouse gases from our operations, which may result in substantial capital expenditures and compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs. In addition, we manufacture petroleum fuels, which through normal customer use result in the emission of greenhouse gases. Regulatory initiatives to reduce the use of these fuels may reduce our sales of, and revenues from, these products. Finally, to the extent that climate change may result in more extreme weather related events, we could experience increased costs related to prevention, maintenance and remediation of affected operations in addition to costs and lost revenues related to delays and shutdowns. Our industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than us. The petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital intensive. We encounter competition from numerous companies in each of our activities, including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas, and in purchasing and marketing of refined products, natural gas and electricity. Many competitors, including national oil companies, are larger and have substantially greater resources. We are also in competition with producers and marketers of other forms of energy. Increased competition for worldwide oil and gas assets has significantly increased the cost of acquisitions. In addition, competition for drilling services, technical expertise and equipment has, in the recent past, affected the availability of technical personnel and drilling rigs, resulting in increased capital and operating costs. Catastrophic events, whether naturally occurring or man made, may materially affect our operations and financial conditions. Our oil and gas operations are subject to unforeseen occurrences which have affected us from time to time and which may damage or destroy assets, interrupt operations and have other significant adverse effects. Examples of catastrophic risks include hurricanes, fires, explosions and blowouts, such as the accident at the Macondo prospect operated by BP in the Gulf of Mexico. Although we maintain a level of insurance coverage consistent with industry practices against property and casualty losses, there can be no assurance that such insurance will adequately protect the Corporation against liability from all potential consequences and damages. Moreover, some forms of insurance may be unavailable in the future or be available only on terms that are deemed economically unacceptable. Item 3. Legal Proceedings The Corporation, along with many other companies engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline, has been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) in gasoline. A series of similar lawsuits, many involving water utilities or governmental entities, were filed in jurisdictions across the United States against producers of MTBE and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing MTBE, including the Corporation. The principal allegation in all cases is that gasoline containing MTBE is a defective product and that these parties are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of MTBE. In 2008, the majority of the cases against the Corporation were settled. In 2010, additional cases were settled, and three new cases were filed. The six unresolved cases consist of five cases that have been consolidated for pre trial purposes in the Southern District of New York as part of a multi district litigation proceeding and an action brought in state court by the State of New Hampshire. In 2007, a pre tax charge of $40 million was recorded to cover all of the known MTBE cases against the Corporation. Over the last several years, many refiners have entered into consent agreements to resolve the United States Environmental Protection Agencys (EPA) assertions that refining facilities were modified or expanded without complying with New Source Review regulations that require permits and new emission controls in certain circumstances and other regulations that impose emissions control requirements. These consent agreements, which arise out of an EPA enforcement initiative focusing on petroleum refiners and utilities, have typically imposed substantial civil fines and penalties and required (i) significant capital expenditures to install emissions control equipment over a three to eight year time period and (ii) changes to operations which resulted in increased operating costs. The capital expenditures, penalties and supplemental environmental projects for individual 16 Table of Contents refineries covered by the settlements can vary significantly, depending on the size and configuration of the refinery, the circumstances of the alleged modifications and whether the refinery has previously installed more advanced pollution controls. In January 2011, HOVENSA signed a Consent Decree with EPA to resolve its claims. Under the terms of the Consent Decree, HOVENSA will pay a penalty of approximately $5 million and spend approximately $700 million over the next 10 years to install equipment and implement additional operating procedures at the HOVENSA refinery to reduce emissions. In addition, the Consent Decree requires HOVENSA to spend approximately $5 million to fund an environmental project to be determined at a later date by the Virgin Islands and $500,000 to assist the Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority with monitoring. The Consent Decree has been lodged with the United States District Court for the Virgin Islands and approval is pending. In addition, substantial progress has been made towards resolving this matter for the Port Reading refining facility, which is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Corporations financial position or results of operations. On September 13, 2007, HOVENSA received a Notice Of Violation (NOV) pursuant to section 113(a)(i) of the Clean Air Act (Act) from the EPA finding that HOVENSA failed to obtain proper permitting for the construction and operation of its delayed coking unit in accordance with applicable law and regulations. HOVENSA believes it properly obtained all necessary permits for this project. The NOV states that the EPA has authority to issue an administrative order assessing penalties for violation of the Act. This matter is resolved by the Consent Decree discussed above, provided that the Consent Decree is entered by the court. In December 2006, HOVENSA received a NOV from the EPA alleging non compliance with emissions limits in a permit issued by the Virgin Islands Department of Planning and Natural Resources (DPNR) for the two process heaters in the delayed coking unit. The NOV was issued in response to a voluntary investigation and submission by HOVENSA regarding potential non compliance with the permit emissions limits for two pollutants. Any exceedances were minor from the perspective of the amount of pollutants emitted in excess of the limits. This matter is resolved by the Consent Decree discussed above, provided that the Consent Decree is entered by the court. On December 16, 2010, the Virgin Islands Department of Planning and Natural Resources commenced four separate enforcement actions against HOVENSA by issuance of documents titled Notice Of Violation, Order For Corrective Action, Notice Of Assessment Of Civil Penalty, Notice Of Opportunity For Hearing (the NOVs). The NOVs assert violations of Virgin Islands Air Pollution Control laws and regulations arising out of air release incidents at the HOVENSA refinery in 2009 and 2010 and propose total penalties of $1,355,000. HOVENSA intends to vigorously defend this matter. The Corporation received a directive from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) to remediate contamination in the sediments of the lower Passaic River and NJDEP is also seeking natural resource damages. The directive, insofar as it affects the Corporation, relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in Newark, New Jersey now owned by the Corporation. The Corporation and over 70 companies entered into an Administrative Order on Consent with the EPA to study the same contamination. NJDEP has also sued several other companies linked to a facility considered by the State to be the largest contributor to river contamination. In January 2009, these companies added third party defendants, including the Corporation, to that case. In June 2007, the EPA issued a draft study which evaluated six alternatives for early action, with costs ranging from $900 million to $2.3 billion. Based on adverse comments from the Corporation and others, the EPA is reevaluating its alternatives. In addition, the federal trustees for natural resources have begun a separate assessment of damages to natural resources in the Passaic River. Given the ongoing studies, remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at this time. Based on currently known facts and circumstances, the Corporation does not believe that this matter will result in a material liability because its terminal could not have contributed contamination along most of the rivers length and did not store or use contaminants which are of the greatest concern in the river sediments, and because there are numerous other parties who will likely share in the cost of remediation and damages. In July 2004, Hess Oil Virgin Islands Corp. (HOVIC), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Corporation, and HOVENSA, each received a letter from the Commissioner of the Virgin Islands Department of Planning and Natural Resources and Natural Resources Trustees, advising of the Trustees intention to bring suit against HOVIC and HOVENSA under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). The letter alleges that HOVIC and HOVENSA are potentially responsible for damages to natural resources arising 17 Table of Contents from releases of hazardous substances from the HOVENSA Refinery, which had been operated by HOVIC until October 1998. An action was filed on May 5, 2005 in the District Court of the Virgin Islands against HOVENSA, HOVIC and other companies that operated industrial facilities on the south shore of St. Croix asserting that the defendants are liable under CERCLA and territorial statutory and common law for damages to natural resources. HOVIC and HOVENSA do not believe that this matter will result in a material liability as they believe that they have strong defenses to this complaint, and they intend to vigorously defend this matter. The Corporation periodically receives notices from EPA that it is a potential responsible party under the Superfund legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites. Under this legislation, all potentially responsible parties are jointly and severally liable. For certain sites, EPAs claims or assertions of liability against the Corporation relating to these sites have not been fully developed. With respect to the remaining sites, EPAs claims have been settled, or a proposed settlement is under consideration, in all cases for amounts that are not material. The ultimate impact of these proceedings, and of any related proceedings by private parties, on the business or accounts of the Corporation cannot be predicted at this time due to the large number of other potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of clean up cost estimates, but is not expected to be material. The Corporation is from time to time involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings, including proceedings relating to other environmental matters. The Corporation cannot predict with certainty if, how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief, if any, may be, particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages. Numerous issues may need to be resolved, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters before a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated for any proceeding. Subject to the foregoing, in managements opinion, based upon currently known facts and circumstances, the outcome of such proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Corporation, although the outcome of such proceedings could be material to the Corporations results of operations and cash flows for a particular period depending on, among other things, the level of the Corporations net income for such period. 18 Table of Contents PART II Item 5.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview The Corporation is a global integrated energy company that operates in two segments, Exploration and Production (EP) and Marketing and Refining (MR). The EP segment explores for, develops, produces, purchases, transports and sells crude oil and natural gas. The MR segment manufactures refined petroleum products and purchases, markets and trades refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity. Net income in 2010 was $2,125 million compared with $740 million in 2009 and $2,360 million in 2008. Diluted earnings per share were $6.47 in 2010 compared with $2.27 in 2009 and $7.24 in 2008. A table of items affecting comparability between periods is shown on page 25. Exploration and Production The Corporations strategy for the EP segment is to profitably grow reserves and production in a sustainable and financially disciplined manner. The Corporations total proved reserves were 1,537 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) at December 31, 2010 compared with 1,437 million boe at December 31, 2009 and 1,432 million boe at December 31, 2008. EP earnings were $2,736 million in 2010, $1,042 million in 2009 and $2,423 million in 2008. Average realized crude oil selling prices were $66.20 per barrel in 2010, $51.62 in 2009, and $82.04 in 2008, including the impact of hedging. Production averaged 418,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in 2010, an increase of 10,000 boepd or 2.5% from 2009. Production averaged 408,000 boepd in 2009, an increase of 27,000 boepd or 7% from 381,000 boepd in 2008. The Corporation estimates that total worldwide production will average between 415,000 and 425,000 boepd in 2011. The following is an update of significant EP activities during 2010: In December, the Corporation acquired approximately 167,000 net acres in the Bakken oil shale play (Bakken) in North Dakota for $1,075 million in cash from TRZ Energy, LLC. The Corporation also completed the acquisition of American Oil Gas Inc. (American Oil Gas) through the issuance of approximately 8.6 million shares of the Corporations stock, which further increased its acreage position in the Bakken by approximately 85,000 net acres. After these acquisitions, the Corporation holds more than 900,000 net acres in the Bakken. The properties acquired are located near the Corporations existing acreage. In September, the Corporation completed the exchange of its interests in Gabon and the Clair Field in the United Kingdom for additional interests in the Valhall and Hod fields of 28% and 25%, respectively. This non monetary exchange, which was recorded at fair value, resulted in a pre tax gain of $1,150 million ($1,072 million after income taxes). The Corporation also completed the acquisition of an additional 8% interest in the Valhall Field and 13% interest in the Hod Field for $507 million in cash. As a result of these transactions, the Corporations interests in the Valhall and Hod fields increased to 64% and 63%, respectively. In the fourth quarter, the Corporation completed the acquisition of an additional 20% interest in the Tubular Bells oil and gas field in the Gulf of Mexico for approximately $40 million. The Corporation now has a 40% working interest and is operator of the field. In January, the Corporation completed the sale of its interest in the Jambi Merang natural gas development project in Indonesia (Hess 25%) for cash proceeds of $183 million. The transaction resulted in a gain of $58 million. In March, the Corporation agreed to the sale of its interests in a package of natural gas production and transportation assets in the United Kingdom North Sea. The package includes the Corporations interests in the Easington Catchment Area (Hess 30%), the Bacton Area (Hess 23%), the Everest Field (Hess 19%), the Lomond Field (Hess 17%) and the Central Area Transmission System (CATS) pipeline (Hess 18%). In February 2011, the Corporation completed the sale of the producing assets for approximately $350 million, 22 Table of Contents after closing adjustments. The sale of the Corporations interest in the CATS pipeline is expected to close in the second quarter of 2011. In September, the Corporation recorded an impairment charge and dry hole expense totaling $554 million before income taxes ($347 million after income taxes) to reduce the carrying value of unproved property and suspended well costs relating to its 55% interest in the West Mediterranean Block 1 Concession (West Med Block), located offshore Egypt. In the Carnarvon basin offshore Western Australia, the Corporation drilled 4 exploration wells in 2010 on WA 390 P Block (Hess 100%). The Corporation has drilled all 16 commitment wells on the block, 13 of which were natural gas discoveries. In the fourth quarter of 2010, the Corporation commenced an appraisal program that includes further drilling and flow testing certain wells. On the Pony project in Green Canyon Block 468 (Hess 100%) in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the Corporation has signed a non binding agreement in principle with the owners on the adjacent Green Canyon Block 512 that outlines a proposal to jointly develop the Pony and Knotty Head fields. The Corporation also spud and subsequently suspended an appraisal well on the Pony prospect in 2010. The Corporation is planning to resume drilling of the Pony appraisal well in 2011 contingent upon receipt of necessary drilling permits. In November, the third exploration well was spud on Block BM S 22 (Hess 40%) offshore Brazil which encountered noncommercial quantities of hydrocarbons. As a result, dry hole expenses totaling $111 million ($72 million after tax) were recorded relating to this well and the previously suspended Azulo well, which was drilled in 2009. Gulf of Mexico Update: In April 2010, an accident occurred on the Transocean Deepwater Horizon drilling rig at the BP p.l.c. (BP) operated Macondo prospect in the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in loss of life, the sinking of the rig and a significant crude oil spill. The Corporation was not a participant in the well. As a result of the accident, a temporary drilling moratorium was imposed in the Gulf of Mexico. In October 2010, the drilling moratorium was lifted by the United States Department of the Interiors Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE) provided operators complied with all rules and requirements, including a series of new drilling and safety rules issued by BOEMRE. The Corporation is currently evaluating the impact of these new requirements on its activities in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as seeking approvals for plans and permits submitted in connection with planned activities. However, the new regulatory environment is expected to result in a longer permitting process and higher costs. The moratorium impacted development drilling at the Shenzi Field, in which the Corporation has a 28% interest. A production well that was being drilled was suspended and the drilling of a second production well that was planned for 2010 was postponed. The Corporation estimates that these delays reduced 2010 production by approximately 2,000 boepd and will likely reduce 2011 production by approximately 4,000 boepd. In 2010, the Corporations only operated drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico, the Stena Forth, left the Pony project on Green Canyon 469 as part of a preexisting agreement for a one well farm out of the rig to another operator. In January 2011, the BOEMRE announced that supplementary environmental reviews will not be required of 13 companies to resume work on the 16 wells that were in progress when the moratorium took effect, including the aforementioned suspended Shenzi and Pony wells. However, these projects must comply with the new safety rules and regulations before work can resume. As a result, the Corporation does not anticipate that it will be able to re commence these operations before the second half of 2011. Additionally, the Corporation has filed Suspension of Operations (SOO) applications with the BOEMRE for several exploration block licenses in the Gulf of Mexico that are due to expire in 2011 and may file additional applications as deemed necessary. These SOO applications seek approval for extension of the lease expiration terms due to circumstances outside the control of the Corporation that have delayed activities required to hold the licenses. 23 Table of Contents Marketing and Refining The Corporations strategy for the MR segment is to deliver consistent operating performance and generate free cash flow. MR earnings (losses) were $(231) million in 2010, $127 million in 2009 and $277 million in 2008. Refining operations generated losses of $445 million in 2010 and $87 million in 2009 and income of $73 million in 2008. Refining results for 2010 include an after tax impairment charge of $289 million ($300 million pre tax) to reduce the carrying value of the Corporations investment in HOVENSA L.L.C. to the estimated fair value. The refining results in 2010 and 2009 also reflect weak refining margins and lower volumes. Marketing earnings were $215 million in 2010, $168 million in 2009 and $240 million in 2008. Liquidity and Capital and Exploratory Expenditures Net cash provided by operating activities was $4,530 million in 2010, $3,046 million in 2009 and $4,688 million in 2008, principally reflecting fluctuations in earnings. At December 31, 2010, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1,608 million compared with $1,362 million at December 31, 2009. Total debt was $5,583 million at December 31, 2010 compared with $4,467 million at December 31, 2009. In August 2010, the Corporation issued $1,250 million of 30 year fixed rate notes with a coupon of 5.6% that are scheduled to mature in 2041. The proceeds were used for the acquisition of additional acreage in the Bakken and additional interests in the Valhall and Hod fields. In January 2010, the Corporation completed the repurchase of the remaining $116 million of notes that were scheduled to mature in 2011. The Corporations debt to capitalization ratio at December 31, 2010 was 24.9% compared with 24.8% at the end of 2009. Capital and exploratory expenditures were as follows for the years ended December 31: 2010 2009 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and Production United States $ 2,935 $ 1,200 International 2,822 1,927 Total Exploration and Production 5,757 3,127 Marketing, Refining and Corporate 98 118 Total capital and exploratory expenditures $ 5,855 $ 3,245 Exploration expenses charged to income included above: United States $ 154 $ 144 International 209 183 Total exploration expenses charged to income included above $ 363 $ 327 The Corporation anticipates investing $5.6 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures in 2011, substantially all of which relates to EP operations. Consolidated Results of Operations The after tax results by major operating activity are summarized below: 2010 2009 2008 (Millions of dollars, except per share data) Exploration and Production $ 2,736 $ 1,042 $ 2,423 Marketing and Refining (231 ) 127 277 Corporate (159 ) (205 ) (173 ) Interest expense (221 ) (224 ) (167 ) Net income attributable to Hess Corporation $ 2,125 $ 740 $ 2,360 Net income per share diluted $ 6.47 $ 2.27 $ 7.24 24 Table of Contents The following table summarizes, on an after tax basis, items of income (expense) that are included in net income and affect comparability between periods. The items in the table below are explained on pages 28 through 31. 2010 2009 2008 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and Production $ 732 $ 45 $ (26 ) Marketing and Refining (289 ) 12 Corporate (7 ) (60 ) $ 436 $ (3 ) $ (26 ) In the discussion that follows, the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after tax basis. Management reviews segment earnings on an after tax basis and uses after tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings. Management believes that after tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre tax amount. After tax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre tax amounts. Comparison of Results Exploration and Production Following is a summarized income statement of the Corporations EP operations: 2010 2009 2008 (Millions of dollars) Sales and other operating revenues* $ 8,744 $ 6,835 $ 9,806 Other, net 1,233 207 (167 ) Total revenues and non operating income 9,977 7,042 9,639 Costs and expenses Production expenses, including related taxes 1,924 1,805 1,872 Exploration expenses, including dry holes and lease impairment 865 829 725 General, administrative and other expenses 281 255 302 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 2,222 2,113 1,922 Asset impairments 532 54 30 Total costs and expenses 5,824 5,056 4,851 Results of operations before income taxes 4,153 1,986 4,788 Provision for income taxes 1,417 944 2,365 Results of operations attributable to Hess Corporation $ 2,736 $ 1,042 $ 2,423 * Amounts differ from EP operating revenues in Note 18, Segment Information, primarily due to the exclusion of sales of hydrocarbons purchased from third parties. After considering the EP items in the table on page 28, the remaining changes in EP earnings are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices, production and sales volumes, operating costs, exploration expenses, foreign exchange, and income taxes, as discussed below. Selling prices: Higher average selling prices increased EP revenues by approximately $1,775 million in 2010 compared with 2009. Lower average selling prices reduced EP revenues by approximately $4,000 million in 2009 compared with 2008. 25 Table of Contents The Corporations average selling prices were as follows: 2010 2009 2008 Crude oil per barrel (including hedging) United States $ 75.02 $ 60.67 $ 96.82 Europe 58.11 47.02 78.75 Africa 65.02 48.91 78.72 Asia 79.23 63.01 97.07 Worldwide 66.20 51.62 82.04 Crude oil per barrel (excluding hedging) United States $ 75.02 $ 60.67 $ 96.82 Europe 58.11 47.02 78.75 Africa 78.31 60.79 93.57 Asia 79.23 63.01 97.07 Worldwide 71.40 56.74 89.23 Natural gas liquids per barrel United States $ 47.92 $ 36.57 $ 64.98 Europe 59.23 43.23 74.63 Asia 63.50 46.48 Worldwide 50.49 38.47 67.61 Natural gas per mcf (including hedging) United States $ 3.70 $ 3.36 $ 8.61 Europe 6.23 5.15 9.44 Asia and other 5.93 5.06 5.24 Worldwide 5.63 4.85 7.17 Natural gas per mcf (excluding hedging) United States $ 3.70 $ 3.36 $ 8.61 Europe 6.23 5.15 9.79 Asia and other 5.93 5.06 5.24 Worldwide 5.63 4.85 7.30 In October 2008, the Corporation closed its Brent crude oil hedges, covering 24,000 barrels per day from 2009 though 2012, by entering into offsetting contracts with the same counterparty. The deferred after tax loss as of the date the hedge positions were closed will be recorded in earnings as the contracts mature. The estimated annual after tax loss from the closed positions will be approximately $330 million in 2011 and 2012. Crude oil hedges reduced EP earnings by $338 million ($533 million before income taxes) in 2010 and $337 million ($533 million before income taxes) in 2009. Crude oil and natural gas hedges reduced EP earnings by $423 million ($685 million before income taxes) in 2008. Production and sales volumes: The Corporations crude oil and natural gas production was 418,000 boepd in 2010 compared with 408,000 boepd in 2009 and 381,000 boepd in 2008. Approximately 73% in 2010, 72% in 2009 and 70% in 2008 of the Corporations production was from crude oil and natural gas liquids. The Corporation currently estimates that its 2011 production will average between 415,000 and 425,000 boepd, after a reduction of approximately 4,000 boepd due to drilling delays at the Shenzi Field in the Gulf of Mexico as well as the effect of the sale in February 2011 of natural gas producing assets in the United Kingdom North Sea. 26 Table of Contents The Corporations net daily worldwide production was as follows: 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Crude oil (barrels per day) United States 75 60 32 Europe 88 83 83 Africa 113 120 124 Asia 13 16 13 Total 289 279 252 Natural gas liquids (barrels per day) United States 14 11 10 Europe 3 3 4 Asia 1 Total 18 14 14 Natural gas (mcf per day) United States 108 93 78 Europe 134 151 255 Asia and other 427 446 356 Total 669 690 689 Barrels of oil equivalent* (barrels per day) 418 408 381 * Reflects natural gas production converted on the basis of relative energy content (six mcf equals one barrel). Barrel of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence as the equivalent price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis has been substantially lower than the corresponding price for crude oil over the recent past. See the average selling prices in the table above. United States: Crude oil and natural gas production in the United States was higher in 2010 compared with 2009, primarily due to production from the Shenzi, Llano, Conger and Bakken fields. Crude oil and natural gas production was higher in 2009 compared with 2008, primarily due to new production from the Shenzi Field and production resuming after the 2008 hurricanes. Hurricane impacts reduced full year 2008 production by an estimated 7,000 boepd. Europe: Crude oil production was higher in 2010 compared with 2009, due to higher production in Russia and an increase in Norway following the acquisition of additional interests in the Valhall and Hod fields, partially offset by lower production in the United Kingdom North Sea following the exchange of Clair for additional Norway interests. Crude oil production was comparable in 2009 and 2008, as higher production in Russia offset lower production in the United Kingdom North Sea. Natural gas production was lower in 2010 compared with 2009, primarily due to downtime at certain United Kingdom gas fields. Natural gas production was lower in 2009 compared with 2008, primarily due to decline and subsequent cessation of production at the Atlantic and Cromarty fields. Africa: Crude oil production decreased in 2010 compared with 2009 following the exchange of Gabon for additional interests in the Valhall and Hod fields in Norway in the third quarter and lower entitlement to Algerian production. Crude oil production decreased in 2009 compared with 2008, primarily due to lower production from the Ceiba Field. Asia and other: Natural gas production in 2010 was lower than in 2009, primarily due to downtime at the Pangkah Field and a temporary shut in at the Bumi Field in the Joint Development Area of Malaysia/Thailand (JDA). Natural gas production in 2009 was higher than in 2008, primarily due to a full year of Phase 2 sales from JDA. The decrease in crude oil production in 2010 from 2009 principally reflects changes to the Corporations entitlement to production in Azerbaijan. 27 Table of Contents Sales volumes: Higher sales volumes and other operating revenues increased revenue by approximately $135 million in 2010 compared with 2009 and $1,030 million in 2009 compared with 2008. Operating costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization: Cash operating costs, consisting of production expenses and general and administrative expenses, increased by $145 million in 2010 compared with 2009 and decreased by $114 million in 2009 compared with 2008. The increase in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily due to higher production taxes as a result of higher selling prices. The decrease in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to lower production taxes (due to lower realized selling prices), the cessation of production at several United Kingdom North Sea fields, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by the impact of higher production volumes. Depreciation, depletion and amortization charges increased by $109 million in 2010 and $191 million in 2009, compared with the corresponding amounts in prior years. The increases in both 2010 and 2009 were primarily due to higher production volumes and per barrel costs, reflecting higher finding and development costs. Excluding items affecting comparability between periods, cash operating costs per barrel of oil equivalent were $14.45 in 2010, $13.70 in 2009 and $15.49 in 2008. Cash operating costs in 2011 are estimated to be in the range of $15.00 to $16.00 per barrel of oil equivalent. Depreciation, depletion and amortization costs per barrel of oil equivalent were $14.56 in 2010, $14.19 in 2009 and $13.79 in 2008. Depreciation, depletion and amortization costs for 2011 are estimated to be in the range of $14.50 to $15.50 per barrel of oil equivalent. Effective December 31, 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued updated standards for oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure. The new rules allow, among other changes, the use of permitted technology in determining oil and gas reserve estimates. Since it was not practical to calculate reserve estimates under both the old and the new reserve estimation standards, it was not possible to precisely measure the effect of adopting the new SEC requirements on total proved reserves at December 31, 2009. However, the Corporation estimates that applying the new rules increased income during 2010 by approximately $80 million, after income taxes, due to lower depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. Exploration expenses: Exploration expenses increased in 2010 from 2009, primarily due to higher lease amortization. Exploration expenses increased in 2009 compared to 2008, mainly due to higher dry hole costs and lease amortization. Income taxes: Excluding the impact of items affecting comparability, the effective income tax rates for EP operations were 44% in 2010, 48% in 2009 and 49% in 2008. The effective income tax rate for EP operations in 2011 is estimated to be in the range of 45% to 49%. Foreign Exchange: The after tax foreign currency losses were $9 million in 2010, $10 million in 2009 and $80 million in 2008. The foreign currency loss in 2008 reflects the net effect of significant exchange rate movements in the fourth quarter of 2008 on the remeasurement of assets, liabilities and foreign currency forward contracts by certain foreign businesses. Reported EP earnings include the following items affecting comparability of income (expense) before and after income taxes: Before Income Taxes After Income Taxes 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 (Millions of dollars) Gains on asset sales $ 1,208 $ $ $ 1,130 $ $ Royalty dispute resolution 143 89 Asset impairments (532 ) (54 ) (30 ) (334 ) (26 ) (17 ) Dry hole expense (101 ) (64 ) Reductions in carrying values of assets (23 ) (18 ) Hurricane related costs (15 ) (9 ) $ 575 $ 66 $ (45 ) $ 732 $ 45 $ (26 ) 28 Table of Contents 2010: The Corporation completed the exchange of its interests in Gabon and the Clair Field in the United Kingdom for additional interests of 28% and 25%, respectively, in the Valhall and Hod fields in Norway. This non monetary transaction, which was recorded at fair value, resulted in a pre tax gain of $1,150 million ($1,072 million after income taxes). The Corporation also completed the sale of its interest in the Jambi Merang natural gas development project in Indonesia for a gain of $58 million. The Corporation recorded a charge of $532 million ($334 million after income taxes) to fully impair the carrying value of its 55% interest in the West Med Block, located offshore Egypt. This interest was acquired in 2006 and included four natural gas discoveries and additional exploration prospects. The Corporation and its partners subsequently explored and further evaluated the area, made a fifth discovery, conducted development planning, and held negotiations with the Egyptian authorities to amend the existing gas sales agreement. In September 2010, the Corporation and its partners notified the Egyptian authorities of their decision to cease exploration activities and to relinquish a significant portion of the block. As a result, the Corporation fully impaired the carrying value of its interests in the West Med Block. The Corporation recorded $101 million ($64 million after income taxes) of dry hole expenses related to previously suspended well costs on the West Med Block offshore Egypt and Block BM S 22 offshore Brazil, both of which were drilled prior to 2010. 2009: The U.S. Supreme Court decided it would not review the decision of the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals against the U.S. Minerals Management Service (predecessor to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement) relating to royalty relief under the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995. As a result, the Corporation recognized after tax income of $89 million to reverse all previously recorded royalties covering the periods from 2003 to 2009. The pre tax amount of $143 million was reported in Other, net in the Statement of Consolidated Income. The Corporation recorded total asset impairment charges of $54 million ($26 million after income taxes) to reduce the carrying value of two short lived fields in the United Kingdom North Sea. Pre tax charges of approximately $25 million ($18 million after income taxes) were recorded to impair the carrying values of production equipment and to write down materials inventories in Equatorial Guinea and the United States. The pre tax amount of most of the inventory write downs was reported in Production expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income. 2008: Pre tax charges of $30 million ($17 million after income taxes) were recorded to impair the carrying values of mature fields in the United States and the United Kingdom North Sea. Pre tax charges of $15 million ($9 million after income taxes) were recorded to expense costs associated with Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in the Gulf of Mexico. The pre tax amount of the charges totaling $15 million were reported in Production expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income. The Corporations future EP earnings may be impacted by external factors, such as volatility in the selling prices of crude oil and natural gas, reserve and production changes, exploration expenses, industry cost inflation, changes in foreign exchange rates and income tax rates, the effects of weather, political risk, environmental risk and catastrophic risk. In addition, as a result of the oil spill in 2010 at the BP operated Macondo prospect in the Gulf of Mexico, there have been and there may be further changes in laws and regulations that could impact the Corporations future drilling operations and increase its potential liability in the event of an oil spill. For a more comprehensive description of the risks that may affect the Corporations EP business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations. Marketing and Refining Earnings (losses) from MR activities amounted to $(231) million in 2010, $127 million in 2009 and $277 million in 2008. Excluding the items affecting comparability reflected in the table on page 25 and discussed below, the earnings were $58 million, $115 million and $277 million, respectively. 29 Table of Contents Refining: Refining earnings (losses), which consist of the Corporations share of HOVENSAs results, Port Reading earnings and results of other miscellaneous operating activities, were $(445) million in 2010 (including the $289 million after tax impairment charge discussed below), $(87) million in 2009 (including a benefit of $12 million due to an income tax adjustment) and $73 million in 2008. In December 2010, the Corporation recorded an impairment charge of $300 million before income taxes ($289 million after income taxes) to reduce the carrying value of its equity investment in HOVENSA, which was recorded in Income (loss) from equity investment in HOVENSA L.L.C. The investment had been adversely affected by consecutive annual operating losses resulting from continued weak refining margins and refinery utilization, and a fourth quarter 2010 debt rating downgrade. As a result of a strategic assessment in 2010, HOVENSA decided to lower crude oil refining capacity from 500,000 to 350,000 barrels per day. The Corporation performed an impairment analysis and concluded that its investment had experienced an other than temporary decline in value. For discussion of the impairment charge, see Note 4, Refining Joint Venture in the notes to the financial statements on page 59. As a result of cumulative net operating losses in the last two years, the Corporation is not recognizing a full income tax benefit on the impairment charge. The Corporations share of HOVENSAs results was a loss of $138 million in 2010 ($222 million before income taxes) excluding the impairment charge, a loss of $142 million ($229 million before income taxes) in 2009, and income of $27 million ($44 million before income taxes) in 2008. These results reflect lower refining margins and lower sales volumes. The 2010 and 2009 utilization rates for HOVENSA reflect weaker refining margins and planned and unplanned maintenance. The 2008 utilization rates also reflect a refinery wide shut down for Hurricane Omar. During 2010, the fluid catalytic cracking unit at HOVENSA was shut down for a scheduled turnaround. The Corporations share of HOVENSAs turnaround expenses was approximately $20 million after income taxes. Other after tax refining results, principally from Port Reading operations, were a loss of $18 million in 2010 and income of $43 million in both 2009 and 2008. During 2010, the Port Reading refining facility was shutdown for 41 days for a scheduled turnaround. The after tax expenses for the Port Reading turnaround were approximately $30 million. The turnaround expenses are included in Other operating expenses, in the Statement of Consolidated Income. The following table summarizes refinery utilization rates: Refinery Refinery Utilization Capacity 2010 2009 2008 (Thousands of barrels per day) HOVENSA Crude 500 78.0 % 80.3 % 88.2 % Fluid catalytic cracker 150 66.5 % 70.2 % 72.7 % Coker 58 78.3 % 81.6 % 92.4 % Port Reading 70 78.1 % 90.2 % 90.7 % In January 2011, HOVENSA announced plans to shut down certain older and smaller processing units on the west side of its refinery, which will reduce the refinerys crude oil distillation capacity from 500,000 to 350,000 barrels per day, with no impact on the capacity of its coker or FCC unit. This reconfiguration, which is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2011, is being undertaken to improve efficiency, reliability and competitiveness. Marketing: Marketing operations, which consist principally of retail gasoline and energy marketing activities, generated income of $215 million in 2010, $168 million in 2009 and $240 million in 2008. The increase in earnings in 2010 compared with 2009 reflects improved margins from the weak economic environment in 2009. 30 Table of Contents The table below summarizes marketing sales volumes: 2010 2009 2008 Refined product sales (thousands of barrels per day) 471 473 472 Natural gas (thousands of mcf per day) 2,016 2,010 1,955 Electricity (megawatts round the clock) 4,140 4,306 3,152 The Corporation has a 50% voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades energy commodities and energy derivatives. The Corporation also takes trading positions for its own account. The Corporations after tax results from trading activities, including its share of the results of the trading partnership, amounted to a loss of $1 million in 2010, earnings of $46 million in 2009 and a loss of $36 million in 2008. Marketing expenses increased in 2010 compared with 2009 and decreased in 2009 as compared with 2008, principally reflecting changes in retail credit card fees. The Corporations future MR earnings may be impacted by supply and demand factors, volatility in margins, credit risks, the effects of weather, competitive industry conditions, political risk, environmental risk and catastrophic risk. For a more comprehensive description of the risks that may affect the Corporations MR business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations. Corporate The following table summarizes corporate expenses: 2010 2009 2008 (Millions of dollars) Corporate expenses (excluding items affecting comparability) $ 256 $ 227 $ 260 Income taxes (benefits) (104 ) (82 ) (87 ) Net corporate expenses 152 145 173 Items affecting comparability between periods, after tax 7 60 Total corporate expenses, after tax $ 159 $ 205 $ 173 Excluding items affecting comparability between periods, the increase in corporate expenses in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily reflects higher employee and insurance costs, and bank facility fees. The decrease in corporate expenses in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily reflects gains on supplemental pension related investments and lower employee and professional costs. After tax corporate expenses in 2011 are estimated to be in the range of $165 to $175 million. In 2009, the Corporation recorded pre tax charges of $54 million ($34 million after income taxes) related to the repurchase of $546 million in fixed rate notes that were scheduled to mature in 2011 and $42 million ($26 million after income taxes) relating to retirement benefits and employee severance costs. In 2010, the Corporation recorded a pre tax charge of $11 million ($7 million after income taxes) related to the repurchase of the remaining $116 million of notes that were scheduled to mature in 2011. The pre tax charges in connection with the debt repurchases were recorded in Other, net, and the pre tax amounts of the retirement benefits and severance costs were recorded in General and administrative expenses within the Statement of Consolidated Income. 31 Table of Contents Interest Interest expense was as follows: 2010 2009 2008 (Millions of dollars) Total interest incurred $ 366 $ 366 $ 274 Less capitalized interest 5 6 7 Interest expense before income taxes 361 360 267 Less income taxes 140 136 100 After tax interest expense $ 221 $ 224 $ 167 Interest expense was comparable in 2010 and 2009. The increase in interest expense in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily reflects higher debt and fees for letters of credit. After tax interest expense in 2011 is expected to be in the range of $240 to $250 million. Sales and Other Operating Revenues Sales and other operating revenues totaled $33,862 million in 2010, $29,614 million in 2009 and $41,134 million in 2008. In 2010, sales and other operating revenues increased by 14% compared with 2009. In 2009, sales and other operating revenues decreased by 28% compared with 2008. The fluctuations in each year primarily reflect changes in crude oil and refined product selling prices. The change in cost of goods sold in each year principally reflects the change in sales volumes and purchase prices of refined products, natural gas and electricity. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table sets forth certain relevant measures of the Corporations liquidity and capital resources as of December 31: 2010 2009 (Millions of dollars) Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,608 $ 1,362 Short term debt and current maturities of long term debt $ 46 $ 148 Total debt $ 5,583 $ 4,467 Total equity $ 16,809 $ 13,528 Debt to capitalization ratio* 24.9 % 24.8 % * Total debt as a percentage of the sum of total debt plus equity. Cash Flows The following table sets forth a summary of the Corporations cash flows: 2010 2009 2008 (Millions of dollars) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 4,530 $ 3,046 $ 4,688 Investing activities (5,259 ) (2,924 ) (4,444 ) Financing activities 975 332 57 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 246 $ 454 $ 301 32 Table of Contents Operating Activities: Net cash provided by operating activities, including changes in operating assets and liabilities, was $4,530 million in 2010 compared with $3,046 million in 2009, reflecting higher earnings. Operating cash flow decreased to $3,046 million in 2009 from $4,688 million in 2008 reflecting lower earnings. Investing Activities: The following table summarizes the Corporations capital expenditures: 2010 2009 2008 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and Production Exploration $ 552 $ 611 $ 744 Production and development 2,592 1,927 2,523 Acquisitions (including leaseholds) 2,250 262 984 5,394 2,800 4,251 Marketing, Refining and Corporate 98 118 187 Total $ 5,492 $ 2,918 $ 4,438 Capital expenditures in 2010 include acquisitions of 167,000 net acres in the Bakken oil shale play in North Dakota from TRZ Energy, LLC for $1,075 million in cash and additional interests of 8% and 13% in the Valhall and Hod fields, respectively, for $507 million in cash. Capital expenditures in 2009 include acquisitions of $188 million for unproved leaseholds and $74 million for a 50% interest in blocks PM301 and PM302 in Malaysia, which are adjacent to Block A 18 of the JDA. Capital expenditures in 2008 include $600 million for leasehold acquisitions in the United States and $210 million for the acquisition of the remaining 22.5% interest in the Corporations Gabonese subsidiary. In 2008, the Corporation also selectively expanded its energy marketing business by acquiring fuel oil, natural gas, and electricity customer accounts, and a terminal and related assets, for an aggregate of approximately $100 million. Financing Activities: During 2010, net proceeds from borrowings were $1,098 million. In August 2010, the Corporation issued $1,250 million of 30 year fixed rate notes with a coupon of 5.6% scheduled to mature in 2041. The proceeds were used to purchase additional acreage in the Bakken and additional interests in the Valhall and Hod fields. In January 2010, the Corporation completed the repurchase of the remaining $116 million of notes that were scheduled to mature in 2011. During 2009, net proceeds from borrowings were $447 million, compared with net repayments of debt of $32 million in 2008. Total common stock dividends paid were $131 million in 2010 and 2009 and $130 million in 2008. The Corporation received net proceeds from the exercise of stock options, including related income tax benefits of $54 million, $18 million and $340 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Future Capital Requirements and Resources The Corporation anticipates investing a total of approximately $5.6 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures during 2011, substantially all of which is targeted for EP operations. In the Corporations MR operations, refining margins continue to be weak, which have adversely affected HOVENSAs liquidity position. The Corporation intends to provide its share of financial support for HOVENSA. The Corporation expects to fund its 2011 operations, including capital expenditures, dividends, pension contributions, required debt repayments and financial support for HOVENSA, with existing cash on hand, cash flow from operations, proceeds from the sale of United Kingdom natural gas assets and its available credit facilities. Crude oil prices, natural gas prices and refining margins are volatile and difficult to predict. In addition, unplanned increases in the Corporations capital expenditure program could occur. If conditions were to change, such as a significant decrease in commodity prices or an unexpected increase in capital expenditures, the Corporation would take steps to protect its financial flexibility and may pursue other sources of liquidity, including the issuance of debt securities, the issuance of equity securities, and or asset sales. 33 Table of Contents The table below summarizes the capacity, usage, and available capacity of the Corporations borrowing and letter of credit facilities at December 31, 2010: Expiration Letters of Available Date Capacity Borrowings Credit Issued Total Used Capacity (Millions of dollars) Revolving credit facility May 2012(a) $ 3,000 $ $ $ $ 3,000 Asset backed credit facility July 2011(b) 530 400 400 130 Committed lines Various(c) 2,925 1,161 1,161 1,764 Uncommitted lines Various(c) 521 521 521 Total $ 6,976 $ $ 2,082 $ 2,082 $ 4,894 (a) $75 million expires in May 2011. (b) Total capacity of $1.0 billion subject to the amount of eligible receivables posted as collateral. (c) Committed and uncommitted lines have expiration dates through 2013. The Corporation has a $3 billion syndicated revolving credit facility (the facility), which can be used for borrowings and letters of credit, substantially all of which is committed through May 2012. At December 31, 2010, the Corporation has available capacity on the facility of $3 billion. The Corporation has a 364 day asset backed credit facility securitized by certain accounts receivable from its Marketing and Refining operations. Under the terms of this financing arrangement, the Corporation has the ability to borrow or issue letters of credit of up to $1 billion subject to the availability of sufficient levels of eligible receivables. At December 31, 2010, outstanding letters of credit under this facility were collateralized by a total of $1,194 million of accounts receivable, which are held by a wholly owned subsidiary. These receivables are only available to pay the general obligations of the Corporation after satisfaction of the outstanding obligations under the asset backed facility. The Corporation also has a shelf registration under which it may issue additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or preferred stock. The Corporations long term debt agreements contain a financial covenant that restricts the amount of total borrowings and secured debt. At December 31, 2010, the Corporation is permitted to borrow up to an additional $22.4 billion for the construction or acquisition of assets. The Corporation has the ability to borrow up to an additional $4.4 billion of secured debt at December 31, 2010. The Corporations $2,082 million in letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2010 were primarily issued to satisfy margin requirements. See also Note 16, Risk Management and Trading Activities. Credit Ratings There are three major credit rating agencies that rate the Corporations debt. All three agencies have currently assigned an investment grade rating with a stable outlook to the Corporations debt. The interest rates and facility fees charged on some of the Corporations credit facilities, as well as margin requirements from risk management and trading counterparties, are subject to adjustment if the Corporations credit rating changes. 34 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Contingencies Following is a table showing aggregated information about certain contractual obligations at December 31, 2010: Payments Due by Period 2012 and 2014 and Total 2011 2013 2015 Thereafter (Millions of dollars) Total debt* $ 5,583 $ 46 $ 72 $ 345 $ 5,120 Operating leases 3,077 410 840 558 1,269 Purchase obligations Supply commitments** 32,376 12,233 10,264 9,862 17 Capital expenditures and other investments 2,382 1,798 494 89 1 Operating expenses 1,677 830 483 214 150 Other long term liabilities 2,308 204 326 310 1,468 * At December 31, 2010, the Corporations debt bears interest at a weighted average rate of 6.8%. ** The Corporation intends to continue purchasing refined product supply from HOVENSA. Estimated future purchases amount to approximately $5 billion annually using year end 2010 prices, which have been included in the table through 2015. In the preceding table, the Corporations supply commitments include its estimated purchases of 50% of HOVENSAs production of refined products, after anticipated sales by HOVENSA to unaffiliated parties. The value of future supply commitments will fluctuate based on prevailing market prices, actual refinery output and the amount of product sold by HOVENSA to unaffiliated third parties. Under the product sales agreement between the Corporation and HOVENSA, HOVENSA is entitled to reserve refined products for sale to unaffiliated third parties each month up to a maximum amount set by the executive committee of HOVENSA annually. The Corporation is obligated to purchase 50% of the remaining refined products produced by HOVENSA, including amounts reserved for third party sales by HOVENSA that remain unsold. The prices at which the Corporation purchases refined products are determined by reference to published market prices prevailing at the time of purchase. The amount of the purchase commitment from HOVENSA is based on the forecasted refinery output that is expected to be sold to the Corporation calculated using year end prices. Also included above are term purchase agreements at market prices for additional gasoline necessary to supply the Corporations retail marketing system and feedstocks for the Port Reading refining facility. In addition, the Corporation has commitments to purchase refined products, natural gas and electricity to supply contracted customers in its energy marketing business. These commitments were computed based predominately on year end market prices. The table also reflects future capital expenditures, including the portion of the Corporations planned $5.6 billion capital investment program for 2011 that is contractually committed at December 31, 2010. Obligations for operating expenses include commitments for transportation, seismic purchases, oil and gas production expenses and other normal business expenses. Other long term liabilities reflect contractually committed obligations on the balance sheet at December 31, 2010, including asset retirement obligations, pension plan liabilities and anticipated obligations for uncertain income tax positions. The Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries lease gasoline stations, drilling rigs, tankers, office space and other assets for varying periods under leases accounted for as operating leases. As of December 31, 2010, the Corporation has a contingent purchase obligation, expiring in April 2012, to acquire the remaining interest in WilcoHess, a retail gasoline station joint venture, for approximately $190 million. The Corporation guarantees the payment of up to 50% of HOVENSAs crude oil purchases from certain suppliers other than PDVSA. The amount of the Corporations guarantee fluctuates based on the volume of crude oil purchased and related prices and at December 31, 2010 it amounted to $150 million. In addition, the Corporation 35 Table of Contents has agreed to provide funding up to a maximum of $15 million to the extent HOVENSA does not have funds to meet its senior debt obligations. The Corporation is contingently liable under letters of credit and under guarantees of the debt of other entities directly related to its business at December 31, 2010 as shown below (in millions): Letters of credit $ 81 Guarantees 165 $ 246 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Corporation has leveraged leases not included in its balance sheet, primarily related to retail gasoline stations that the Corporation operates. The net present value of these leases is $394 million at December 31, 2010 compared with $412 million at December 31, 2009. The Corporations December 31, 2010 debt to capitalization ratio would increase from 24.9% to 26.2% if these leases were included as debt. See also Note 4, Refining Joint Venture, and Note 17, Guarantees and Contingencies, in the notes to the financial statements. Foreign Operations The Corporation conducts exploration and production activities outside the United States, principally in Algeria, Australia, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Brunei, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, France, Ghana, Indonesia, Libya, Malaysia, Norway, Peru, Russia, Thailand, and the United Kingdom. Therefore, the Corporation is subject to the risks associated with foreign operations, including political risk, tax law changes, and currency risk. See also Item 1A. Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations. Accounting Policies Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities on the Corporations balance sheet and revenues and expenses on the income statement. The accounting methods used can affect net income, equity and various financial statement ratios. However, the Corporations accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity. Accounting for Exploration and Development Costs: Exploration and production activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses, brokers fees and other related costs, are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are capitalized. In production operations, costs of injected CO2 for tertiary recovery are expensed as incurred. The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found. Exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and (2) sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project. If either of those criteria is not met, or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the capitalized well costs are charged to expense. Indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include: commitment of project personnel, active negotiations for sales contracts with customers, negotiations with governments, operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors. 36 Table of Contents Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves: The SEC revised its oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements effective for year end 2009 reporting. In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) revised its accounting standard on oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosures. The determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities. The estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations, the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment, as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill. For reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. In addition, government and project operator approvals must be obtained and, depending on the amount of the project cost, senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project. The Corporation maintains its own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties. The Corporations technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells, performance reviews, new technical data and other studies. To provide consistency throughout the Corporation, standard reserve estimation guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and approval practices are used. The internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management review. The Corporation also engages an independent third party consulting firm to audit approximately 80% of the Corporations total proved reserves. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Goodwill: As explained below there are significant differences in the way long lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing. The Corporation reviews long lived assets, including oil and gas fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered. Long lived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying amounts of the long lived assets are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted future net cash flow estimates, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows. In the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future net cash flows is based on managements best estimate of future prices, which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices, applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a risk adjusted rate. The projected production volumes represent reserves, including probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures. The production volumes, prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information. Oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve month average prices. The Corporations impairment tests of long lived EP producing assets are based on its best estimates of future production volumes (including recovery factors), selling prices, operating and capital costs, the timing of future production and other factors, which are updated each time an impairment test is performed. The Corporation could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease, crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly. The Corporations goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level, which is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. The impairment test is conducted annually in the fourth quarter or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable. The reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed. The Corporations goodwill is assigned to the EP operating segment and it expects that the benefits of goodwill will be recovered through the operation of that segment. The Corporations fair value estimate of the EP segment is the sum of: (1) the discounted anticipated cash flows of producing assets and known developments, (2) the estimated risk adjusted present value of exploration assets, and (3) an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential 37 Table of Contents synergies including cost savings, access to new business opportunities, enterprise control, improved processes and increased market share. The Corporation also considers the relative market valuation of similar Exploration and Production companies. The determination of the fair value of the EP segment depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves, future prices, timing of future net cash flows and market premiums. Significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of the EP segment that could result in an impairment of goodwill. As there are significant differences in the way long lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing, there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned to the EP segment. Impairment of Equity Investees: The Corporation reviews equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than temporary decline in value may have occurred. The fair value measurement used in the impairment assessment is based on quoted market prices, where available, or other valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows. Differences between the carrying value of the Corporations equity investments and its equity in the net assets of the affiliate that result from impairment charges are amortized over the remaining useful life of the affiliates fixed assets. Income Taxes: Judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements. These judgments include the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when management believes that it is more likely than not, that based on the technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. The Corporation has net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in several jurisdictions, including the United States, and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits. Additionally, the Corporation has deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities. Regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized. If it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized. In evaluating realizability of deferred tax assets, the Corporation refers to the reversal periods for available carryforward periods for net operating losses and credit carryforwards, temporary differences, the availability of tax planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets and estimates of future taxable income and other factors. Estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the Corporations internal business forecasts. Additionally, the Corporation has income taxes which have been deferred on intercompany transactions eliminated in consolidation related to transfers of property, plant and equipment remaining within the consolidated group. The amortization of these income taxes deferred on intercompany transactions will occur ratably with the recovery through depletion and depreciation of the carrying value of these assets. The Corporation does not provide for deferred U.S. income taxes for that portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Fair Value Measurements: The Corporations derivative instruments and supplemental pension plan investments are recorded at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period as appropriate. The Corporation uses various valuation approaches in determining fair value, including the market and income approaches. The Corporations fair value measurements also include non performance risk and time value of money considerations. Counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances, and the Corporations credit is considered for accrued liabilities. The Corporation also records certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by generally accepted accounting principles. These fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations, the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of long lived assets, equity method investments or goodwill. The Corporation determines fair value in accordance with the FASB fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure the fair value of financial asset and liabilities based on the source of the input, which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal 38 Table of Contents trading market (Level 1) to estimates determined using related market data (Level 3). Multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value, however, the level of fair value is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy. Details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values are as follows: Fair value measurements based on Level 1 inputs: Measurements that are most observable are based on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained from the principal markets in which they are traded. Closing prices are both readily available and representative of fair value. Market transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to assure liquidity. The fair value of certain of the Corporations exchange traded futures and options are considered Level 1. Fair value measurements based on Level 2 inputs: Measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered Level 2. Measurements based on Level 2 inputs include over the counter derivative instruments that are priced on an exchange traded curve but have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange traded contracts. The Corporation utilizes fair value measurements based on Level 2 inputs for certain forwards, swaps and options. The liability related to the Corporations crude oil hedges is classified as Level 2. Fair value measurements based on Level 3 inputs: Measurements that are least observable are estimated from related market data determined from sources with little or no market activity for comparable contracts or are positions with longer durations. For example, in its energy marketing business, the Corporation sells natural gas and electricity to customers and offsets the price exposure by purchasing forward contracts. The fair value of these sales and purchases may be based on specific prices at less liquid delivered locations, which are classified as Level 3. Fair values determined using discounted cash flows and other unobservable data are also classified as Level 3. Derivatives: The Corporation utilizes derivative instruments for both risk management and trading activities. In risk management activities, the Corporation uses futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and electricity, as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. In trading activities, the Corporation, principally through a consolidated partnership, trades energy commodities and derivatives, including futures, forwards, options and swaps, based on expectations of future market conditions. All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the Corporations balance sheet. The Corporations policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative. The changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges) or hedges of firm commitments (fair value hedges). The effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings. The change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives that are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges are tested for effectiveness prospectively before they are executed and both prospectively and retrospectively on an on going basis to determine whether they continue to qualify for hedge accounting. The prospective and retrospective effectiveness calculations are performed using either historical simulation or other statistical models, which utilize historical observable market data consisting of futures curves and spot prices. Retirement Plans: The Corporation has funded non contributory defined benefit pension plans and an unfunded supplemental pension plan. The Corporation recognizes on the balance sheet the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans. 39 Table of Contents The determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations; expected long term rates of return on plan assets; and rate of future increases in compensation levels. These assumptions represent estimates made by the Corporation, some of which can be affected by external factors. For example, the discount rate used to estimate the Corporations projected benefit obligation is based on a portfolio of high quality, fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations, while the expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category, weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category. Changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on the amounts reported in the Corporations financial statements. Asset Retirement Obligations: The Corporation has material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain exploration and production locations. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the Corporation recognizes a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations. In addition, the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligations is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated. The Corporation capitalizes such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred. In order to measure these obligations, the Corporation estimates the fair value of the obligations by discounting the future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations. In determining these estimates, the Corporation is required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement, timing of settlement, interpretation of legal requirements, inflationary factors and discount rate. In addition, there are other external factors which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including: changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements, fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates, and advances in technology. As a result, the Corporations estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above. Changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values. Changes in Accounting Policies Effective January 1, 2010, the Corporation adopted the amended accounting standards that eliminated the consolidation exception for a qualifying special purpose entity and changed the analysis necessary to determine whether consolidation of a variable interest entity is required. The adoption of these standards resulted in an increase of approximately $10 million to Property, plant and equipment and a corresponding increase to Long term debt. The debt was subsequently repaid during the first quarter of 2010. Effective December 31, 2009, the FASB adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) Extractive Activities Oil and Gas (ASC 932) Oil and Gas Reserve Estimation and Disclosures, which amended the requirements for oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosures. The main provisions of the ASU, which align accounting standards with the previously issued Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirements, expand the definition of oil and gas producing activities to include the extraction of resources which are saleable as synthetic oil or gas, to change the price assumption used for reserve estimation and future cash flows to a twelve month average from the year end price and to amend the geographic disclosure requirements for reporting reserves and other supplementary oil and gas data. See the Supplementary Oil and Gas Data for these disclosures. Environment, Health and Safety The Corporation has a values based, socially responsible strategy focused on improving environment, health and safety performance and making a positive impact on communities where it does business. The strategy is reflected in the Corporations environment, health, safety and social responsibility (EHS SR) policies and by environment and safety management systems that help protect the Corporations workforce, customers and local communities. The Corporations management systems are designed to uphold or exceed international standards and are intended to promote internal consistency, adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in EHS SR performance. Improved performance may, in the short term, increase the Corporations operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to assets, reputation and license to operate. In addition to enhanced EHS SR performance, improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be realized as collateral benefits from investments in EHS SR. The Corporation has programs in place to evaluate 40 Table of Contents regulatory compliance, audit facilities, train employees, prevent and manage risks and emergencies and to generally meet corporate EHS SR goals. The Corporation and HOVENSA produce and the Corporation distributes fuel oils in the United States. Many states and localities are adopting requirements that mandate a lower sulfur content of fuel oils and restrict the types of fuel oil sold within their jurisdictions. These proposals could require capital expenditures by the Corporation and HOVENSA to meet the required sulfur content standards or other changes in the marketing of fuel oils. Over the last several years, many refiners have entered into consent agreements to resolve the United States Environmental Protection Agencys (EPA) assertions that refining facilities were modified or expanded without complying with New Source Review regulations that require permits and new emission controls in certain circumstances and other regulations that impose emissions control requirements. These consent agreements, which arise out of an EPA enforcement initiative focusing on petroleum refiners and utilities, have typically imposed substantial civil fines and penalties and required (i) significant capital expenditures to install emissions control equipment over a three to eight year time period and (ii) changes to operations which resulted in increased operating costs. The capital expenditures, penalties and supplemental environmental projects for individual refineries covered by the settlements can vary significantly, depending on the size and configuration of the refinery, the circumstances of the alleged modifications and whether the refinery has previously installed more advanced pollution controls. In January 2011, HOVENSA signed a Consent Decree with EPA to resolve its claims. Under the terms of the Consent Decree, HOVENSA will pay a penalty of approximately $5 million and spend approximately $700 million over the next 10 years to install equipment and implement additional operating procedures at the HOVENSA refinery to reduce emissions. In addition, the Consent Decree requires HOVENSA to spend approximately $5 million to fund an environmental project to be determined at a later date by the Virgin Islands and $500,000 to assist the Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority with monitoring. The Consent Decree has been lodged with the United States District Court for the Virgin Islands and approval is pending. In addition, substantial progress has been made towards resolving this matter for the Port Reading refining facility, which is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Corporations financial position or results of operations. The Corporation has undertaken a program to assess, monitor and reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane. The Corporation recognizes that climate change is a global environmental concern. The Corporation is committed to the responsible management of greenhouse gas emissions from our existing assets and future developments and is implementing a strategy to control our carbon emissions. The Corporation will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation. Sites where corrective action may be necessary include gasoline stations, terminals, onshore exploration and production facilities, refineries (including solid waste management units under permits issued pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act) and, although not currently significant, Superfund sites where the Corporation has been named a potentially responsible party. The Corporation accrues for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable. At year end 2010, the Corporations reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately $55 million. The Corporation expects that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites. The Corporations remediation spending was $13 million in 2010 and $11 million in both 2009 and 2008. Capital expenditures for facilities, primarily to comply with federal, state and local environmental standards, other than for the low sulfur requirements, were approximately $85 million in 2010, $50 million in 2009 and $15 million in 2008. Forward Looking Information Certain sections of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, including Business and Properties, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, include references to the Corporations future results of operations and financial position, liquidity and capital resources, capital expenditures, oil and gas production, tax rates, debt repayment, hedging, derivative, market risk and environmental disclosures, off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations and contingencies, which include forward looking information. Forward looking disclosures are based on the Corporations current understanding and assessment of these activities and reasonable assumptions about the 41 Table of Contents future. Actual results may differ from these disclosures because of changes in market conditions, government actions and other factors. For more information regarding the factors that may cause the Corporations results to differ from these statements, see Item 1A Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk In the normal course of its business, the Corporation is exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the price of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and electricity, as well as to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. In the disclosures that follow, these risk management activities are referred to as energy marketing and corporate risk management. The Corporation also has trading operations, principally through a 50% voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades energy commodities and energy derivatives. These activities are also exposed to commodity risks primarily related to the prices of crude oil, natural gas and refined products. The following describes how these risks are controlled and managed. Controls: The Corporation maintains a control environment under the direction of its chief risk officer and through its corporate risk policy, which the Corporations senior management has approved. Controls include volumetric, term and value at risk limits. The chief risk officer must approve the use of new instruments or commodities. Risk limits are monitored and reported on daily to business units and to senior management. The Corporations risk management department also performs independent verifications of sources of fair values and validations of valuation models. These controls apply to all of the Corporations risk management and trading activities, including the consolidated trading partnership. The Corporations treasury department is responsible for administering foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs. The Corporation uses value at risk to monitor and control commodity risk within its trading and risk management activities. The value at risk model uses historical simulation and the results represent the potential loss in fair value over one day at a 95% confidence level. The model captures both first and second order sensitivities for options. Results may vary from time to time as strategies change in trading activities or hedging levels change in risk management activities. Instruments: The Corporation primarily uses forward commodity contracts, foreign exchange forward contracts, futures, swaps, options and energy commodity based securities in its risk management and trading activities. These contracts are generally widely traded instruments with standardized terms. The following describes these instruments and how the Corporation uses them: Forward Commodity Contracts: The Corporation enters into contracts for the forward purchase and sale of commodities. At settlement date, the notional value of the contract is exchanged for physical delivery of the commodity. Forward contracts that are deemed normal purchase and sale contracts are excluded from the quantitative market risk disclosures. Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts: The Corporation enters into forward contracts primarily for the British Pound and the Thai Baht, which commit the Corporation to buy or sell a fixed amount of these currencies at a predetermined exchange rate on a future date. Exchange Traded Contracts: The Corporation uses exchange traded contracts, including futures, on a number of different underlying energy commodities. These contracts are settled daily with the relevant exchange and may be subject to exchange position limits. Swaps: The Corporation uses financially settled swap contracts with third parties as part of its risk management and trading activities. Cash flows from swap contracts are determined based on underlying commodity prices or interest rates and are typically settled over the life of the contract. Options: Options on various underlying energy commodities include exchange traded and third party contracts and have various exercise periods. As a seller of options, the Corporation receives a premium at the outset and bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the commodity underlying the option. As a purchaser of options, the Corporation pays a premium at the outset and has the right to participate in the favorable price movements in the underlying commodities. 42 Table of Contents Energy Securities: Energy securities include energy related equity or debt securities issued by a company or government or related derivatives on these securities. Risk Management Activities Energy marketing activities: In its energy marketing activities, the Corporation sells refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity principally to commercial and industrial businesses at fixed and floating prices for varying periods of time. Commodity contracts such as futures, forwards, swaps and options together with physical assets, such as storage, are used to obtain supply and reduce margin volatility or lower costs related to sales contracts with customers. Corporate risk management: Corporate risk management activities include transactions designed to reduce risk in the selling prices of crude oil, refined products or natural gas produced by the Corporation or to reduce exposure to foreign currency or interest rate movements. Generally, futures, swaps or option strategies may be used to reduce risk in the selling price of a portion of the Corporations crude oil or natural gas production. Forward contracts may also be used to purchase certain currencies in which the Corporation does business with the intent of reducing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Interest rate swaps may also be used, generally to convert fixed rate interest payments to floating. The Corporation uses foreign exchange contracts to reduce its exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates by entering into formal contracts for various currencies including the British Pound and the Thai Baht. At December 31, 2010, the Corporation had a payable for foreign exchange contracts maturing in 2011 with a fair value of $7 million. The change in fair value of the foreign exchange contracts from a 10% strengthening of the US Dollar exchange rate is estimated to be an approximately $88 million loss at December 31, 2010. The Corporations fixed rate debt of $5,569 million has a fair value of $6,353 million at December 31, 2010. A 15% decrease in the rate of interest would increase the fair value of debt by approximately $147 million at December 31, 2010.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview The Corporation is a global integrated energy company that operates in two segments, Exploration and Production (EP) and Marketing and Refining (MR). The EP segment explores for, develops, produces, purchases, transports and sells crude oil and natural gas. The MR segment manufactures refined petroleum products and purchases, markets and trades refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity. Net income in 2010 was $2,125 million compared with $740 million in 2009 and $2,360 million in 2008. Diluted earnings per share were $6.47 in 2010 compared with $2.27 in 2009 and $7.24 in 2008. A table of items affecting comparability between periods is shown on page 25. Exploration and Production The Corporations strategy for the EP segment is to profitably grow reserves and production in a sustainable and financially disciplined manner. The Corporations total proved reserves were 1,537 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) at December 31, 2010 compared with 1,437 million boe at December 31, 2009 and 1,432 million boe at December 31, 2008. EP earnings were $2,736 million in 2010, $1,042 million in 2009 and $2,423 million in 2008. Average realized crude oil selling prices were $66.20 per barrel in 2010, $51.62 in 2009, and $82.04 in 2008, including the impact of hedging. Production averaged 418,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in 2010, an increase of 10,000 boepd or 2.5% from 2009. Production averaged 408,000 boepd in 2009, an increase of 27,000 boepd or 7% from 381,000 boepd in 2008. The Corporation estimates that total worldwide production will average between 415,000 and 425,000 boepd in 2011. The following is an update of significant EP activities during 2010: In December, the Corporation acquired approximately 167,000 net acres in the Bakken oil shale play (Bakken) in North Dakota for $1,075 million in cash from TRZ Energy, LLC. The Corporation also completed the acquisition of American Oil Gas Inc. (American Oil Gas) through the issuance of approximately 8.6 million shares of the Corporations stock, which further increased its acreage position in the Bakken by approximately 85,000 net acres. After these acquisitions, the Corporation holds more than 900,000 net acres in the Bakken. The properties acquired are located near the Corporations existing acreage. In September, the Corporation completed the exchange of its interests in Gabon and the Clair Field in the United Kingdom for additional interests in the Valhall and Hod fields of 28% and 25%, respectively. This non monetary exchange, which was recorded at fair value, resulted in a pre tax gain of $1,150 million ($1,072 million after income taxes). The Corporation also completed the acquisition of an additional 8% interest in the Valhall Field and 13% interest in the Hod Field for $507 million in cash. As a result of these transactions, the Corporations interests in the Valhall and Hod fields increased to 64% and 63%, respectively. In the fourth quarter, the Corporation completed the acquisition of an additional 20% interest in the Tubular Bells oil and gas field in the Gulf of Mexico for approximately $40 million. The Corporation now has a 40% working interest and is operator of the field. In January, the Corporation completed the sale of its interest in the Jambi Merang natural gas development project in Indonesia (Hess 25%) for cash proceeds of $183 million. The transaction resulted in a gain of $58 million. In March, the Corporation agreed to the sale of its interests in a package of natural gas production and transportation assets in the United Kingdom North Sea. The package includes the Corporations interests in the Easington Catchment Area (Hess 30%), the Bacton Area (Hess 23%), the Everest Field (Hess 19%), the Lomond Field (Hess 17%) and the Central Area Transmission System (CATS) pipeline (Hess 18%). In February 2011, the Corporation completed the sale of the producing assets for approximately $350 million, 22 Table of Contents after closing adjustments. The sale of the Corporations interest in the CATS pipeline is expected to close in the second quarter of 2011. In September, the Corporation recorded an impairment charge and dry hole expense totaling $554 million before income taxes ($347 million after income taxes) to reduce the carrying value of unproved property and suspended well costs relating to its 55% interest in the West Mediterranean Block 1 Concession (West Med Block), located offshore Egypt. In the Carnarvon basin offshore Western Australia, the Corporation drilled 4 exploration wells in 2010 on WA 390 P Block (Hess 100%). The Corporation has drilled all 16 commitment wells on the block, 13 of which were natural gas discoveries. In the fourth quarter of 2010, the Corporation commenced an appraisal program that includes further drilling and flow testing certain wells. On the Pony project in Green Canyon Block 468 (Hess 100%) in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the Corporation has signed a non binding agreement in principle with the owners on the adjacent Green Canyon Block 512 that outlines a proposal to jointly develop the Pony and Knotty Head fields. The Corporation also spud and subsequently suspended an appraisal well on the Pony prospect in 2010. The Corporation is planning to resume drilling of the Pony appraisal well in 2011 contingent upon receipt of necessary drilling permits. In November, the third exploration well was spud on Block BM S 22 (Hess 40%) offshore Brazil which encountered noncommercial quantities of hydrocarbons. As a result, dry hole expenses totaling $111 million ($72 million after tax) were recorded relating to this well and the previously suspended Azulo well, which was drilled in 2009. Gulf of Mexico Update: In April 2010, an accident occurred on the Transocean Deepwater Horizon drilling rig at the BP p.l.c. (BP) operated Macondo prospect in the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in loss of life, the sinking of the rig and a significant crude oil spill. The Corporation was not a participant in the well. As a result of the accident, a temporary drilling moratorium was imposed in the Gulf of Mexico. In October 2010, the drilling moratorium was lifted by the United States Department of the Interiors Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE) provided operators complied with all rules and requirements, including a series of new drilling and safety rules issued by BOEMRE. The Corporation is currently evaluating the impact of these new requirements on its activities in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as seeking approvals for plans and permits submitted in connection with planned activities. However, the new regulatory environment is expected to result in a longer permitting process and higher costs. The moratorium impacted development drilling at the Shenzi Field, in which the Corporation has a 28% interest. A production well that was being drilled was suspended and the drilling of a second production well that was planned for 2010 was postponed. The Corporation estimates that these delays reduced 2010 production by approximately 2,000 boepd and will likely reduce 2011 production by approximately 4,000 boepd. In 2010, the Corporations only operated drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico, the Stena Forth, left the Pony project on Green Canyon 469 as part of a preexisting agreement for a one well farm out of the rig to another operator. In January 2011, the BOEMRE announced that supplementary environmental reviews will not be required of 13 companies to resume work on the 16 wells that were in progress when the moratorium took effect, including the aforementioned suspended Shenzi and Pony wells. However, these projects must comply with the new safety rules and regulations before work can resume. As a result, the Corporation does not anticipate that it will be able to re commence these operations before the second half of 2011. Additionally, the Corporation has filed Suspension of Operations (SOO) applications with the BOEMRE for several exploration block licenses in the Gulf of Mexico that are due to expire in 2011 and may file additional applications as deemed necessary. These SOO applications seek approval for extension of the lease expiration terms due to circumstances outside the control of the Corporation that have delayed activities required to hold the licenses. 23 Table of Contents Marketing and Refining The Corporations strategy for the MR segment is to deliver consistent operating performance and generate free cash flow. MR earnings (losses) were $(231) million in 2010, $127 million in 2009 and $277 million in 2008. Refining operations generated losses of $445 million in 2010 and $87 million in 2009 and income of $73 million in 2008. Refining results for 2010 include an after tax impairment charge of $289 million ($300 million pre tax) to reduce the carrying value of the Corporations investment in HOVENSA L.L.C. to the estimated fair value. The refining results in 2010 and 2009 also reflect weak refining margins and lower volumes. Marketing earnings were $215 million in 2010, $168 million in 2009 and $240 million in 2008. Liquidity and Capital and Exploratory Expenditures Net cash provided by operating activities was $4,530 million in 2010, $3,046 million in 2009 and $4,688 million in 2008, principally reflecting fluctuations in earnings. At December 31, 2010, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1,608 million compared with $1,362 million at December 31, 2009. Total debt was $5,583 million at December 31, 2010 compared with $4,467 million at December 31, 2009. In August 2010, the Corporation issued $1,250 million of 30 year fixed rate notes with a coupon of 5.6% that are scheduled to mature in 2041. The proceeds were used for the acquisition of additional acreage in the Bakken and additional interests in the Valhall and Hod fields. In January 2010, the Corporation completed the repurchase of the remaining $116 million of notes that were scheduled to mature in 2011. The Corporations debt to capitalization ratio at December 31, 2010 was 24.9% compared with 24.8% at the end of 2009. Capital and exploratory expenditures were as follows for the years ended December 31: 2010 2009 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and Production United States $ 2,935 $ 1,200 International 2,822 1,927 Total Exploration and Production 5,757 3,127 Marketing, Refining and Corporate 98 118 Total capital and exploratory expenditures $ 5,855 $ 3,245 Exploration expenses charged to income included above: United States $ 154 $ 144 International 209 183 Total exploration expenses charged to income included above $ 363 $ 327 The Corporation anticipates investing $5.6 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures in 2011, substantially all of which relates to EP operations. Consolidated Results of Operations The after tax results by major operating activity are summarized below: 2010 2009 2008 (Millions of dollars, except per share data) Exploration and Production $ 2,736 $ 1,042 $ 2,423 Marketing and Refining (231 ) 127 277 Corporate (159 ) (205 ) (173 ) Interest expense (221 ) (224 ) (167 ) Net income attributable to Hess Corporation $ 2,125 $ 740 $ 2,360 Net income per share diluted $ 6.47 $ 2.27 $ 7.24 24 Table of Contents The following table summarizes, on an after tax basis, items of income (expense) that are included in net income and affect comparability between periods. The items in the table below are explained on pages 28 through 31. 2010 2009 2008 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and Production $ 732 $ 45 $ (26 ) Marketing and Refining (289 ) 12 Corporate (7 ) (60 ) $ 436 $ (3 ) $ (26 ) In the discussion that follows, the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after tax basis. Management reviews segment earnings on an after tax basis and uses after tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings. Management believes that after tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre tax amount. After tax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre tax amounts. Comparison of Results Exploration and Production Following is a summarized income statement of the Corporations EP operations: 2010 2009 2008 (Millions of dollars) Sales and other operating revenues* $ 8,744 $ 6,835 $ 9,806 Other, net 1,233 207 (167 ) Total revenues and non operating income 9,977 7,042 9,639 Costs and expenses Production expenses, including related taxes 1,924 1,805 1,872 Exploration expenses, including dry holes and lease impairment 865 829 725 General, administrative and other expenses 281 255 302 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 2,222 2,113 1,922 Asset impairments 532 54 30 Total costs and expenses 5,824 5,056 4,851 Results of operations before income taxes 4,153 1,986 4,788 Provision for income taxes 1,417 944 2,365 Results of operations attributable to Hess Corporation $ 2,736 $ 1,042 $ 2,423 * Amounts differ from EP operating revenues in Note 18, Segment Information, primarily due to the exclusion of sales of hydrocarbons purchased from third parties. After considering the EP items in the table on page 28, the remaining changes in EP earnings are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices, production and sales volumes, operating costs, exploration expenses, foreign exchange, and income taxes, as discussed below. Selling prices: Higher average selling prices increased EP revenues by approximately $1,775 million in 2010 compared with 2009. Lower average selling prices reduced EP revenues by approximately $4,000 million in 2009 compared with 2008. 25 Table of Contents The Corporations average selling prices were as follows: 2010 2009 2008 Crude oil per barrel (including hedging) United States $ 75.02 $ 60.67 $ 96.82 Europe 58.11 47.02 78.75 Africa 65.02 48.91 78.72 Asia 79.23 63.01 97.07 Worldwide 66.20 51.62 82.04 Crude oil per barrel (excluding hedging) United States $ 75.02 $ 60.67 $ 96.82 Europe 58.11 47.02 78.75 Africa 78.31 60.79 93.57 Asia 79.23 63.01 97.07 Worldwide 71.40 56.74 89.23 Natural gas liquids per barrel United States $ 47.92 $ 36.57 $ 64.98 Europe 59.23 43.23 74.63 Asia 63.50 46.48 Worldwide 50.49 38.47 67.61 Natural gas per mcf (including hedging) United States $ 3.70 $ 3.36 $ 8.61 Europe 6.23 5.15 9.44 Asia and other 5.93 5.06 5.24 Worldwide 5.63 4.85 7.17 Natural gas per mcf (excluding hedging) United States $ 3.70 $ 3.36 $ 8.61 Europe 6.23 5.15 9.79 Asia and other 5.93 5.06 5.24 Worldwide 5.63 4.85 7.30 In October 2008, the Corporation closed its Brent crude oil hedges, covering 24,000 barrels per day from 2009 though 2012, by entering into offsetting contracts with the same counterparty. The deferred after tax loss as of the date the hedge positions were closed will be recorded in earnings as the contracts mature. The estimated annual after tax loss from the closed positions will be approximately $330 million in 2011 and 2012. Crude oil hedges reduced EP earnings by $338 million ($533 million before income taxes) in 2010 and $337 million ($533 million before income taxes) in 2009. Crude oil and natural gas hedges reduced EP earnings by $423 million ($685 million before income taxes) in 2008. Production and sales volumes: The Corporations crude oil and natural gas production was 418,000 boepd in 2010 compared with 408,000 boepd in 2009 and 381,000 boepd in 2008. Approximately 73% in 2010, 72% in 2009 and 70% in 2008 of the Corporations production was from crude oil and natural gas liquids. The Corporation currently estimates that its 2011 production will average between 415,000 and 425,000 boepd, after a reduction of approximately 4,000 boepd due to drilling delays at the Shenzi Field in the Gulf of Mexico as well as the effect of the sale in February 2011 of natural gas producing assets in the United Kingdom North Sea. 26 Table of Contents The Corporations net daily worldwide production was as follows: 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Crude oil (barrels per day) United States 75 60 32 Europe 88 83 83 Africa 113 120 124 Asia 13 16 13 Total 289 279 252 Natural gas liquids (barrels per day) United States 14 11 10 Europe 3 3 4 Asia 1 Total 18 14 14 Natural gas (mcf per day) United States 108 93 78 Europe 134 151 255 Asia and other 427 446 356 Total 669 690 689 Barrels of oil equivalent* (barrels per day) 418 408 381 * Reflects natural gas production converted on the basis of relative energy content (six mcf equals one barrel). Barrel of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence as the equivalent price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis has been substantially lower than the corresponding price for crude oil over the recent past. See the average selling prices in the table above. United States: Crude oil and natural gas production in the United States was higher in 2010 compared with 2009, primarily due to production from the Shenzi, Llano, Conger and Bakken fields. Crude oil and natural gas production was higher in 2009 compared with 2008, primarily due to new production from the Shenzi Field and production resuming after the 2008 hurricanes. Hurricane impacts reduced full year 2008 production by an estimated 7,000 boepd. Europe: Crude oil production was higher in 2010 compared with 2009, due to higher production in Russia and an increase in Norway following the acquisition of additional interests in the Valhall and Hod fields, partially offset by lower production in the United Kingdom North Sea following the exchange of Clair for additional Norway interests. Crude oil production was comparable in 2009 and 2008, as higher production in Russia offset lower production in the United Kingdom North Sea. Natural gas production was lower in 2010 compared with 2009, primarily due to downtime at certain United Kingdom gas fields. Natural gas production was lower in 2009 compared with 2008, primarily due to decline and subsequent cessation of production at the Atlantic and Cromarty fields. Africa: Crude oil production decreased in 2010 compared with 2009 following the exchange of Gabon for additional interests in the Valhall and Hod fields in Norway in the third quarter and lower entitlement to Algerian production. Crude oil production decreased in 2009 compared with 2008, primarily due to lower production from the Ceiba Field. Asia and other: Natural gas production in 2010 was lower than in 2009, primarily due to downtime at the Pangkah Field and a temporary shut in at the Bumi Field in the Joint Development Area of Malaysia/Thailand (JDA). Natural gas production in 2009 was higher than in 2008, primarily due to a full year of Phase 2 sales from JDA. The decrease in crude oil production in 2010 from 2009 principally reflects changes to the Corporations entitlement to production in Azerbaijan. 27 Table of Contents Sales volumes: Higher sales volumes and other operating revenues increased revenue by approximately $135 million in 2010 compared with 2009 and $1,030 million in 2009 compared with 2008. Operating costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization: Cash operating costs, consisting of production expenses and general and administrative expenses, increased by $145 million in 2010 compared with 2009 and decreased by $114 million in 2009 compared with 2008. The increase in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily due to higher production taxes as a result of higher selling prices. The decrease in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to lower production taxes (due to lower realized selling prices), the cessation of production at several United Kingdom North Sea fields, the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by the impact of higher production volumes. Depreciation, depletion and amortization charges increased by $109 million in 2010 and $191 million in 2009, compared with the corresponding amounts in prior years. The increases in both 2010 and 2009 were primarily due to higher production volumes and per barrel costs, reflecting higher finding and development costs. Excluding items affecting comparability between periods, cash operating costs per barrel of oil equivalent were $14.45 in 2010, $13.70 in 2009 and $15.49 in 2008. Cash operating costs in 2011 are estimated to be in the range of $15.00 to $16.00 per barrel of oil equivalent. Depreciation, depletion and amortization costs per barrel of oil equivalent were $14.56 in 2010, $14.19 in 2009 and $13.79 in 2008. Depreciation, depletion and amortization costs for 2011 are estimated to be in the range of $14.50 to $15.50 per barrel of oil equivalent. Effective December 31, 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued updated standards for oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure. The new rules allow, among other changes, the use of permitted technology in determining oil and gas reserve estimates. Since it was not practical to calculate reserve estimates under both the old and the new reserve estimation standards, it was not possible to precisely measure the effect of adopting the new SEC requirements on total proved reserves at December 31, 2009. However, the Corporation estimates that applying the new rules increased income during 2010 by approximately $80 million, after income taxes, due to lower depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. Exploration expenses: Exploration expenses increased in 2010 from 2009, primarily due to higher lease amortization. Exploration expenses increased in 2009 compared to 2008, mainly due to higher dry hole costs and lease amortization. Income taxes: Excluding the impact of items affecting comparability, the effective income tax rates for EP operations were 44% in 2010, 48% in 2009 and 49% in 2008. The effective income tax rate for EP operations in 2011 is estimated to be in the range of 45% to 49%. Foreign Exchange: The after tax foreign currency losses were $9 million in 2010, $10 million in 2009 and $80 million in 2008. The foreign currency loss in 2008 reflects the net effect of significant exchange rate movements in the fourth quarter of 2008 on the remeasurement of assets, liabilities and foreign currency forward contracts by certain foreign businesses. Reported EP earnings include the following items affecting comparability of income (expense) before and after income taxes: Before Income Taxes After Income Taxes 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 (Millions of dollars) Gains on asset sales $ 1,208 $ $ $ 1,130 $ $ Royalty dispute resolution 143 89 Asset impairments (532 ) (54 ) (30 ) (334 ) (26 ) (17 ) Dry hole expense (101 ) (64 ) Reductions in carrying values of assets (23 ) (18 ) Hurricane related costs (15 ) (9 ) $ 575 $ 66 $ (45 ) $ 732 $ 45 $ (26 ) 28 Table of Contents 2010: The Corporation completed the exchange of its interests in Gabon and the Clair Field in the United Kingdom for additional interests of 28% and 25%, respectively, in the Valhall and Hod fields in Norway. This non monetary transaction, which was recorded at fair value, resulted in a pre tax gain of $1,150 million ($1,072 million after income taxes). The Corporation also completed the sale of its interest in the Jambi Merang natural gas development project in Indonesia for a gain of $58 million. The Corporation recorded a charge of $532 million ($334 million after income taxes) to fully impair the carrying value of its 55% interest in the West Med Block, located offshore Egypt. This interest was acquired in 2006 and included four natural gas discoveries and additional exploration prospects. The Corporation and its partners subsequently explored and further evaluated the area, made a fifth discovery, conducted development planning, and held negotiations with the Egyptian authorities to amend the existing gas sales agreement. In September 2010, the Corporation and its partners notified the Egyptian authorities of their decision to cease exploration activities and to relinquish a significant portion of the block. As a result, the Corporation fully impaired the carrying value of its interests in the West Med Block. The Corporation recorded $101 million ($64 million after income taxes) of dry hole expenses related to previously suspended well costs on the West Med Block offshore Egypt and Block BM S 22 offshore Brazil, both of which were drilled prior to 2010. 2009: The U.S. Supreme Court decided it would not review the decision of the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals against the U.S. Minerals Management Service (predecessor to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement) relating to royalty relief under the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995. As a result, the Corporation recognized after tax income of $89 million to reverse all previously recorded royalties covering the periods from 2003 to 2009. The pre tax amount of $143 million was reported in Other, net in the Statement of Consolidated Income. The Corporation recorded total asset impairment charges of $54 million ($26 million after income taxes) to reduce the carrying value of two short lived fields in the United Kingdom North Sea. Pre tax charges of approximately $25 million ($18 million after income taxes) were recorded to impair the carrying values of production equipment and to write down materials inventories in Equatorial Guinea and the United States. The pre tax amount of most of the inventory write downs was reported in Production expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income. 2008: Pre tax charges of $30 million ($17 million after income taxes) were recorded to impair the carrying values of mature fields in the United States and the United Kingdom North Sea. Pre tax charges of $15 million ($9 million after income taxes) were recorded to expense costs associated with Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in the Gulf of Mexico. The pre tax amount of the charges totaling $15 million were reported in Production expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income. The Corporations future EP earnings may be impacted by external factors, such as volatility in the selling prices of crude oil and natural gas, reserve and production changes, exploration expenses, industry cost inflation, changes in foreign exchange rates and income tax rates, the effects of weather, political risk, environmental risk and catastrophic risk. In addition, as a result of the oil spill in 2010 at the BP operated Macondo prospect in the Gulf of Mexico, there have been and there may be further changes in laws and regulations that could impact the Corporations future drilling operations and increase its potential liability in the event of an oil spill. For a more comprehensive description of the risks that may affect the Corporations EP business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations. Marketing and Refining Earnings (losses) from MR activities amounted to $(231) million in 2010, $127 million in 2009 and $277 million in 2008. Excluding the items affecting comparability reflected in the table on page 25 and discussed below, the earnings were $58 million, $115 million and $277 million, respectively. 29 Table of Contents Refining: Refining earnings (losses), which consist of the Corporations share of HOVENSAs results, Port Reading earnings and results of other miscellaneous operating activities, were $(445) million in 2010 (including the $289 million after tax impairment charge discussed below), $(87) million in 2009 (including a benefit of $12 million due to an income tax adjustment) and $73 million in 2008. In December 2010, the Corporation recorded an impairment charge of $300 million before income taxes ($289 million after income taxes) to reduce the carrying value of its equity investment in HOVENSA, which was recorded in Income (loss) from equity investment in HOVENSA L.L.C. The investment had been adversely affected by consecutive annual operating losses resulting from continued weak refining margins and refinery utilization, and a fourth quarter 2010 debt rating downgrade. As a result of a strategic assessment in 2010, HOVENSA decided to lower crude oil refining capacity from 500,000 to 350,000 barrels per day. The Corporation performed an impairment analysis and concluded that its investment had experienced an other than temporary decline in value. For discussion of the impairment charge, see Note 4, Refining Joint Venture in the notes to the financial statements on page 59. As a result of cumulative net operating losses in the last two years, the Corporation is not recognizing a full income tax benefit on the impairment charge. The Corporations share of HOVENSAs results was a loss of $138 million in 2010 ($222 million before income taxes) excluding the impairment charge, a loss of $142 million ($229 million before income taxes) in 2009, and income of $27 million ($44 million before income taxes) in 2008. These results reflect lower refining margins and lower sales volumes. The 2010 and 2009 utilization rates for HOVENSA reflect weaker refining margins and planned and unplanned maintenance. The 2008 utilization rates also reflect a refinery wide shut down for Hurricane Omar. During 2010, the fluid catalytic cracking unit at HOVENSA was shut down for a scheduled turnaround. The Corporations share of HOVENSAs turnaround expenses was approximately $20 million after income taxes. Other after tax refining results, principally from Port Reading operations, were a loss of $18 million in 2010 and income of $43 million in both 2009 and 2008. During 2010, the Port Reading refining facility was shutdown for 41 days for a scheduled turnaround. The after tax expenses for the Port Reading turnaround were approximately $30 million. The turnaround expenses are included in Other operating expenses, in the Statement of Consolidated Income. The following table summarizes refinery utilization rates: Refinery Refinery Utilization Capacity 2010 2009 2008 (Thousands of barrels per day) HOVENSA Crude 500 78.0 % 80.3 % 88.2 % Fluid catalytic cracker 150 66.5 % 70.2 % 72.7 % Coker 58 78.3 % 81.6 % 92.4 % Port Reading 70 78.1 % 90.2 % 90.7 % In January 2011, HOVENSA announced plans to shut down certain older and smaller processing units on the west side of its refinery, which will reduce the refinerys crude oil distillation capacity from 500,000 to 350,000 barrels per day, with no impact on the capacity of its coker or FCC unit. This reconfiguration, which is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2011, is being undertaken to improve efficiency, reliability and competitiveness. Marketing: Marketing operations, which consist principally of retail gasoline and energy marketing activities, generated income of $215 million in 2010, $168 million in 2009 and $240 million in 2008. The increase in earnings in 2010 compared with 2009 reflects improved margins from the weak economic environment in 2009. 30 Table of Contents The table below summarizes marketing sales volumes: 2010 2009 2008 Refined product sales (thousands of barrels per day) 471 473 472 Natural gas (thousands of mcf per day) 2,016 2,010 1,955 Electricity (megawatts round the clock) 4,140 4,306 3,152 The Corporation has a 50% voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades energy commodities and energy derivatives. The Corporation also takes trading positions for its own account. The Corporations after tax results from trading activities, including its share of the results of the trading partnership, amounted to a loss of $1 million in 2010, earnings of $46 million in 2009 and a loss of $36 million in 2008. Marketing expenses increased in 2010 compared with 2009 and decreased in 2009 as compared with 2008, principally reflecting changes in retail credit card fees. The Corporations future MR earnings may be impacted by supply and demand factors, volatility in margins, credit risks, the effects of weather, competitive industry conditions, political risk, environmental risk and catastrophic risk. For a more comprehensive description of the risks that may affect the Corporations MR business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations. Corporate The following table summarizes corporate expenses: 2010 2009 2008 (Millions of dollars) Corporate expenses (excluding items affecting comparability) $ 256 $ 227 $ 260 Income taxes (benefits) (104 ) (82 ) (87 ) Net corporate expenses 152 145 173 Items affecting comparability between periods, after tax 7 60 Total corporate expenses, after tax $ 159 $ 205 $ 173 Excluding items affecting comparability between periods, the increase in corporate expenses in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily reflects higher employee and insurance costs, and bank facility fees. The decrease in corporate expenses in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily reflects gains on supplemental pension related investments and lower employee and professional costs. After tax corporate expenses in 2011 are estimated to be in the range of $165 to $175 million. In 2009, the Corporation recorded pre tax charges of $54 million ($34 million after income taxes) related to the repurchase of $546 million in fixed rate notes that were scheduled to mature in 2011 and $42 million ($26 million after income taxes) relating to retirement benefits and employee severance costs. In 2010, the Corporation recorded a pre tax charge of $11 million ($7 million after income taxes) related to the repurchase of the remaining $116 million of notes that were scheduled to mature in 2011. The pre tax charges in connection with the debt repurchases were recorded in Other, net, and the pre tax amounts of the retirement benefits and severance costs were recorded in General and administrative expenses within the Statement of Consolidated Income. 31 Table of Contents Interest Interest expense was as follows: 2010 2009 2008 (Millions of dollars) Total interest incurred $ 366 $ 366 $ 274 Less capitalized interest 5 6 7 Interest expense before income taxes 361 360 267 Less income taxes 140 136 100 After tax interest expense $ 221 $ 224 $ 167 Interest expense was comparable in 2010 and 2009. The increase in interest expense in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily reflects higher debt and fees for letters of credit. After tax interest expense in 2011 is expected to be in the range of $240 to $250 million. Sales and Other Operating Revenues Sales and other operating revenues totaled $33,862 million in 2010, $29,614 million in 2009 and $41,134 million in 2008. In 2010, sales and other operating revenues increased by 14% compared with 2009. In 2009, sales and other operating revenues decreased by 28% compared with 2008. The fluctuations in each year primarily reflect changes in crude oil and refined product selling prices. The change in cost of goods sold in each year principally reflects the change in sales volumes and purchase prices of refined products, natural gas and electricity. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table sets forth certain relevant measures of the Corporations liquidity and capital resources as of December 31: 2010 2009 (Millions of dollars) Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,608 $ 1,362 Short term debt and current maturities of long term debt $ 46 $ 148 Total debt $ 5,583 $ 4,467 Total equity $ 16,809 $ 13,528 Debt to capitalization ratio* 24.9 % 24.8 % * Total debt as a percentage of the sum of total debt plus equity. Cash Flows The following table sets forth a summary of the Corporations cash flows: 2010 2009 2008 (Millions of dollars) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 4,530 $ 3,046 $ 4,688 Investing activities (5,259 ) (2,924 ) (4,444 ) Financing activities 975 332 57 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 246 $ 454 $ 301 32 Table of Contents Operating Activities: Net cash provided by operating activities, including changes in operating assets and liabilities, was $4,530 million in 2010 compared with $3,046 million in 2009, reflecting higher earnings. Operating cash flow decreased to $3,046 million in 2009 from $4,688 million in 2008 reflecting lower earnings. Investing Activities: The following table summarizes the Corporations capital expenditures: 2010 2009 2008 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and Production Exploration $ 552 $ 611 $ 744 Production and development 2,592 1,927 2,523 Acquisitions (including leaseholds) 2,250 262 984 5,394 2,800 4,251 Marketing, Refining and Corporate 98 118 187 Total $ 5,492 $ 2,918 $ 4,438 Capital expenditures in 2010 include acquisitions of 167,000 net acres in the Bakken oil shale play in North Dakota from TRZ Energy, LLC for $1,075 million in cash and additional interests of 8% and 13% in the Valhall and Hod fields, respectively, for $507 million in cash. Capital expenditures in 2009 include acquisitions of $188 million for unproved leaseholds and $74 million for a 50% interest in blocks PM301 and PM302 in Malaysia, which are adjacent to Block A 18 of the JDA. Capital expenditures in 2008 include $600 million for leasehold acquisitions in the United States and $210 million for the acquisition of the remaining 22.5% interest in the Corporations Gabonese subsidiary. In 2008, the Corporation also selectively expanded its energy marketing business by acquiring fuel oil, natural gas, and electricity customer accounts, and a terminal and related assets, for an aggregate of approximately $100 million. Financing Activities: During 2010, net proceeds from borrowings were $1,098 million. In August 2010, the Corporation issued $1,250 million of 30 year fixed rate notes with a coupon of 5.6% scheduled to mature in 2041. The proceeds were used to purchase additional acreage in the Bakken and additional interests in the Valhall and Hod fields. In January 2010, the Corporation completed the repurchase of the remaining $116 million of notes that were scheduled to mature in 2011. During 2009, net proceeds from borrowings were $447 million, compared with net repayments of debt of $32 million in 2008. Total common stock dividends paid were $131 million in 2010 and 2009 and $130 million in 2008. The Corporation received net proceeds from the exercise of stock options, including related income tax benefits of $54 million, $18 million and $340 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Future Capital Requirements and Resources The Corporation anticipates investing a total of approximately $5.6 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures during 2011, substantially all of which is targeted for EP operations. In the Corporations MR operations, refining margins continue to be weak, which have adversely affected HOVENSAs liquidity position. The Corporation intends to provide its share of financial support for HOVENSA. The Corporation expects to fund its 2011 operations, including capital expenditures, dividends, pension contributions, required debt repayments and financial support for HOVENSA, with existing cash on hand, cash flow from operations, proceeds from the sale of United Kingdom natural gas assets and its available credit facilities. Crude oil prices, natural gas prices and refining margins are volatile and difficult to predict. In addition, unplanned increases in the Corporations capital expenditure program could occur. If conditions were to change, such as a significant decrease in commodity prices or an unexpected increase in capital expenditures, the Corporation would take steps to protect its financial flexibility and may pursue other sources of liquidity, including the issuance of debt securities, the issuance of equity securities, and or asset sales. 33 Table of Contents The table below summarizes the capacity, usage, and available capacity of the Corporations borrowing and letter of credit facilities at December 31, 2010: Expiration Letters of Available Date Capacity Borrowings Credit Issued Total Used Capacity (Millions of dollars) Revolving credit facility May 2012(a) $ 3,000 $ $ $ $ 3,000 Asset backed credit facility July 2011(b) 530 400 400 130 Committed lines Various(c) 2,925 1,161 1,161 1,764 Uncommitted lines Various(c) 521 521 521 Total $ 6,976 $ $ 2,082 $ 2,082 $ 4,894 (a) $75 million expires in May 2011. (b) Total capacity of $1.0 billion subject to the amount of eligible receivables posted as collateral. (c) Committed and uncommitted lines have expiration dates through 2013. The Corporation has a $3 billion syndicated revolving credit facility (the facility), which can be used for borrowings and letters of credit, substantially all of which is committed through May 2012. At December 31, 2010, the Corporation has available capacity on the facility of $3 billion. The Corporation has a 364 day asset backed credit facility securitized by certain accounts receivable from its Marketing and Refining operations. Under the terms of this financing arrangement, the Corporation has the ability to borrow or issue letters of credit of up to $1 billion subject to the availability of sufficient levels of eligible receivables. At December 31, 2010, outstanding letters of credit under this facility were collateralized by a total of $1,194 million of accounts receivable, which are held by a wholly owned subsidiary. These receivables are only available to pay the general obligations of the Corporation after satisfaction of the outstanding obligations under the asset backed facility. The Corporation also has a shelf registration under which it may issue additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or preferred stock. The Corporations long term debt agreements contain a financial covenant that restricts the amount of total borrowings and secured debt. At December 31, 2010, the Corporation is permitted to borrow up to an additional $22.4 billion for the construction or acquisition of assets. The Corporation has the ability to borrow up to an additional $4.4 billion of secured debt at December 31, 2010. The Corporations $2,082 million in letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2010 were primarily issued to satisfy margin requirements. See also Note 16, Risk Management and Trading Activities. Credit Ratings There are three major credit rating agencies that rate the Corporations debt. All three agencies have currently assigned an investment grade rating with a stable outlook to the Corporations debt. The interest rates and facility fees charged on some of the Corporations credit facilities, as well as margin requirements from risk management and trading counterparties, are subject to adjustment if the Corporations credit rating changes. 34 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Contingencies Following is a table showing aggregated information about certain contractual obligations at December 31, 2010: Payments Due by Period 2012 and 2014 and Total 2011 2013 2015 Thereafter (Millions of dollars) Total debt* $ 5,583 $ 46 $ 72 $ 345 $ 5,120 Operating leases 3,077 410 840 558 1,269 Purchase obligations Supply commitments** 32,376 12,233 10,264 9,862 17 Capital expenditures and other investments 2,382 1,798 494 89 1 Operating expenses 1,677 830 483 214 150 Other long term liabilities 2,308 204 326 310 1,468 * At December 31, 2010, the Corporations debt bears interest at a weighted average rate of 6.8%. ** The Corporation intends to continue purchasing refined product supply from HOVENSA. Estimated future purchases amount to approximately $5 billion annually using year end 2010 prices, which have been included in the table through 2015. In the preceding table, the Corporations supply commitments include its estimated purchases of 50% of HOVENSAs production of refined products, after anticipated sales by HOVENSA to unaffiliated parties. The value of future supply commitments will fluctuate based on prevailing market prices, actual refinery output and the amount of product sold by HOVENSA to unaffiliated third parties. Under the product sales agreement between the Corporation and HOVENSA, HOVENSA is entitled to reserve refined products for sale to unaffiliated third parties each month up to a maximum amount set by the executive committee of HOVENSA annually. The Corporation is obligated to purchase 50% of the remaining refined products produced by HOVENSA, including amounts reserved for third party sales by HOVENSA that remain unsold. The prices at which the Corporation purchases refined products are determined by reference to published market prices prevailing at the time of purchase. The amount of the purchase commitment from HOVENSA is based on the forecasted refinery output that is expected to be sold to the Corporation calculated using year end prices. Also included above are term purchase agreements at market prices for additional gasoline necessary to supply the Corporations retail marketing system and feedstocks for the Port Reading refining facility. In addition, the Corporation has commitments to purchase refined products, natural gas and electricity to supply contracted customers in its energy marketing business. These commitments were computed based predominately on year end market prices. The table also reflects future capital expenditures, including the portion of the Corporations planned $5.6 billion capital investment program for 2011 that is contractually committed at December 31, 2010. Obligations for operating expenses include commitments for transportation, seismic purchases, oil and gas production expenses and other normal business expenses. Other long term liabilities reflect contractually committed obligations on the balance sheet at December 31, 2010, including asset retirement obligations, pension plan liabilities and anticipated obligations for uncertain income tax positions. The Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries lease gasoline stations, drilling rigs, tankers, office space and other assets for varying periods under leases accounted for as operating leases. As of December 31, 2010, the Corporation has a contingent purchase obligation, expiring in April 2012, to acquire the remaining interest in WilcoHess, a retail gasoline station joint venture, for approximately $190 million. The Corporation guarantees the payment of up to 50% of HOVENSAs crude oil purchases from certain suppliers other than PDVSA. The amount of the Corporations guarantee fluctuates based on the volume of crude oil purchased and related prices and at December 31, 2010 it amounted to $150 million. In addition, the Corporation 35 Table of Contents has agreed to provide funding up to a maximum of $15 million to the extent HOVENSA does not have funds to meet its senior debt obligations. The Corporation is contingently liable under letters of credit and under guarantees of the debt of other entities directly related to its business at December 31, 2010 as shown below (in millions): Letters of credit $ 81 Guarantees 165 $ 246 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Corporation has leveraged leases not included in its balance sheet, primarily related to retail gasoline stations that the Corporation operates. The net present value of these leases is $394 million at December 31, 2010 compared with $412 million at December 31, 2009. The Corporations December 31, 2010 debt to capitalization ratio would increase from 24.9% to 26.2% if these leases were included as debt. See also Note 4, Refining Joint Venture, and Note 17, Guarantees and Contingencies, in the notes to the financial statements. Foreign Operations The Corporation conducts exploration and production activities outside the United States, principally in Algeria, Australia, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Brunei, China, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, France, Ghana, Indonesia, Libya, Malaysia, Norway, Peru, Russia, Thailand, and the United Kingdom. Therefore, the Corporation is subject to the risks associated with foreign operations, including political risk, tax law changes, and currency risk. See also Item 1A. Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations. Accounting Policies Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities on the Corporations balance sheet and revenues and expenses on the income statement. The accounting methods used can affect net income, equity and various financial statement ratios. However, the Corporations accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity. Accounting for Exploration and Development Costs: Exploration and production activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses, brokers fees and other related costs, are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are capitalized. In production operations, costs of injected CO2 for tertiary recovery are expensed as incurred. The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found. Exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and (2) sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project. If either of those criteria is not met, or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the capitalized well costs are charged to expense. Indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include: commitment of project personnel, active negotiations for sales contracts with customers, negotiations with governments, operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors. 36 Table of Contents Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves: The SEC revised its oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements effective for year end 2009 reporting. In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) revised its accounting standard on oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosures. The determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities. The estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations, the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment, as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill. For reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. In addition, government and project operator approvals must be obtained and, depending on the amount of the project cost, senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project. The Corporation maintains its own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties. The Corporations technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells, performance reviews, new technical data and other studies. To provide consistency throughout the Corporation, standard reserve estimation guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and approval practices are used. The internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management review. The Corporation also engages an independent third party consulting firm to audit approximately 80% of the Corporations total proved reserves. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Goodwill: As explained below there are significant differences in the way long lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing. The Corporation reviews long lived assets, including oil and gas fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered. Long lived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying amounts of the long lived assets are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted future net cash flow estimates, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows. In the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future net cash flows is based on managements best estimate of future prices, which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices, applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a risk adjusted rate. The projected production volumes represent reserves, including probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures. The production volumes, prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information. Oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve month average prices. The Corporations impairment tests of long lived EP producing assets are based on its best estimates of future production volumes (including recovery factors), selling prices, operating and capital costs, the timing of future production and other factors, which are updated each time an impairment test is performed. The Corporation could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease, crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly. The Corporations goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level, which is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. The impairment test is conducted annually in the fourth quarter or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable. The reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed. The Corporations goodwill is assigned to the EP operating segment and it expects that the benefits of goodwill will be recovered through the operation of that segment. The Corporations fair value estimate of the EP segment is the sum of: (1) the discounted anticipated cash flows of producing assets and known developments, (2) the estimated risk adjusted present value of exploration assets, and (3) an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential 37 Table of Contents synergies including cost savings, access to new business opportunities, enterprise control, improved processes and increased market share. The Corporation also considers the relative market valuation of similar Exploration and Production companies. The determination of the fair value of the EP segment depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves, future prices, timing of future net cash flows and market premiums. Significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of the EP segment that could result in an impairment of goodwill. As there are significant differences in the way long lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing, there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned to the EP segment. Impairment of Equity Investees: The Corporation reviews equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than temporary decline in value may have occurred. The fair value measurement used in the impairment assessment is based on quoted market prices, where available, or other valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows. Differences between the carrying value of the Corporations equity investments and its equity in the net assets of the affiliate that result from impairment charges are amortized over the remaining useful life of the affiliates fixed assets. Income Taxes: Judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements. These judgments include the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when management believes that it is more likely than not, that based on the technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. The Corporation has net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in several jurisdictions, including the United States, and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits. Additionally, the Corporation has deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities. Regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized. If it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized. In evaluating realizability of deferred tax assets, the Corporation refers to the reversal periods for available carryforward periods for net operating losses and credit carryforwards, temporary differences, the availability of tax planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets and estimates of future taxable income and other factors. Estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the Corporations internal business forecasts. Additionally, the Corporation has income taxes which have been deferred on intercompany transactions eliminated in consolidation related to transfers of property, plant and equipment remaining within the consolidated group. The amortization of these income taxes deferred on intercompany transactions will occur ratably with the recovery through depletion and depreciation of the carrying value of these assets. The Corporation does not provide for deferred U.S. income taxes for that portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Fair Value Measurements: The Corporations derivative instruments and supplemental pension plan investments are recorded at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period as appropriate. The Corporation uses various valuation approaches in determining fair value, including the market and income approaches. The Corporations fair value measurements also include non performance risk and time value of money considerations. Counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances, and the Corporations credit is considered for accrued liabilities. The Corporation also records certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by generally accepted accounting principles. These fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations, the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of long lived assets, equity method investments or goodwill. The Corporation determines fair value in accordance with the FASB fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure the fair value of financial asset and liabilities based on the source of the input, which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal 38 Table of Contents trading market (Level 1) to estimates determined using related market data (Level 3). Multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value, however, the level of fair value is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy. Details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values are as follows: Fair value measurements based on Level 1 inputs: Measurements that are most observable are based on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained from the principal markets in which they are traded. Closing prices are both readily available and representative of fair value. Market transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to assure liquidity. The fair value of certain of the Corporations exchange traded futures and options are considered Level 1. Fair value measurements based on Level 2 inputs: Measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered Level 2. Measurements based on Level 2 inputs include over the counter derivative instruments that are priced on an exchange traded curve but have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange traded contracts. The Corporation utilizes fair value measurements based on Level 2 inputs for certain forwards, swaps and options. The liability related to the Corporations crude oil hedges is classified as Level 2. Fair value measurements based on Level 3 inputs: Measurements that are least observable are estimated from related market data determined from sources with little or no market activity for comparable contracts or are positions with longer durations. For example, in its energy marketing business, the Corporation sells natural gas and electricity to customers and offsets the price exposure by purchasing forward contracts. The fair value of these sales and purchases may be based on specific prices at less liquid delivered locations, which are classified as Level 3. Fair values determined using discounted cash flows and other unobservable data are also classified as Level 3. Derivatives: The Corporation utilizes derivative instruments for both risk management and trading activities. In risk management activities, the Corporation uses futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and electricity, as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. In trading activities, the Corporation, principally through a consolidated partnership, trades energy commodities and derivatives, including futures, forwards, options and swaps, based on expectations of future market conditions. All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the Corporations balance sheet. The Corporations policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative. The changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges) or hedges of firm commitments (fair value hedges). The effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings. The change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives that are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges are tested for effectiveness prospectively before they are executed and both prospectively and retrospectively on an on going basis to determine whether they continue to qualify for hedge accounting. The prospective and retrospective effectiveness calculations are performed using either historical simulation or other statistical models, which utilize historical observable market data consisting of futures curves and spot prices. Retirement Plans: The Corporation has funded non contributory defined benefit pension plans and an unfunded supplemental pension plan. The Corporation recognizes on the balance sheet the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans. 39 Table of Contents The determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations; expected long term rates of return on plan assets; and rate of future increases in compensation levels. These assumptions represent estimates made by the Corporation, some of which can be affected by external factors. For example, the discount rate used to estimate the Corporations projected benefit obligation is based on a portfolio of high quality, fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations, while the expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category, weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category. Changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on the amounts reported in the Corporations financial statements. Asset Retirement Obligations: The Corporation has material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain exploration and production locations. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the Corporation recognizes a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations. In addition, the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligations is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated. The Corporation capitalizes such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred. In order to measure these obligations, the Corporation estimates the fair value of the obligations by discounting the future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations. In determining these estimates, the Corporation is required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement, timing of settlement, interpretation of legal requirements, inflationary factors and discount rate. In addition, there are other external factors which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including: changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements, fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates, and advances in technology. As a result, the Corporations estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above. Changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values. Changes in Accounting Policies Effective January 1, 2010, the Corporation adopted the amended accounting standards that eliminated the consolidation exception for a qualifying special purpose entity and changed the analysis necessary to determine whether consolidation of a variable interest entity is required. The adoption of these standards resulted in an increase of approximately $10 million to Property, plant and equipment and a corresponding increase to Long term debt. The debt was subsequently repaid during the first quarter of 2010. Effective December 31, 2009, the FASB adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) Extractive Activities Oil and Gas (ASC 932) Oil and Gas Reserve Estimation and Disclosures, which amended the requirements for oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosures. The main provisions of the ASU, which align accounting standards with the previously issued Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirements, expand the definition of oil and gas producing activities to include the extraction of resources which are saleable as synthetic oil or gas, to change the price assumption used for reserve estimation and future cash flows to a twelve month average from the year end price and to amend the geographic disclosure requirements for reporting reserves and other supplementary oil and gas data. See the Supplementary Oil and Gas Data for these disclosures. Environment, Health and Safety The Corporation has a values based, socially responsible strategy focused on improving environment, health and safety performance and making a positive impact on communities where it does business. The strategy is reflected in the Corporations environment, health, safety and social responsibility (EHS SR) policies and by environment and safety management systems that help protect the Corporations workforce, customers and local communities. The Corporations management systems are designed to uphold or exceed international standards and are intended to promote internal consistency, adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in EHS SR performance. Improved performance may, in the short term, increase the Corporations operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to assets, reputation and license to operate. In addition to enhanced EHS SR performance, improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be realized as collateral benefits from investments in EHS SR. The Corporation has programs in place to evaluate 40 Table of Contents regulatory compliance, audit facilities, train employees, prevent and manage risks and emergencies and to generally meet corporate EHS SR goals. The Corporation and HOVENSA produce and the Corporation distributes fuel oils in the United States. Many states and localities are adopting requirements that mandate a lower sulfur content of fuel oils and restrict the types of fuel oil sold within their jurisdictions. These proposals could require capital expenditures by the Corporation and HOVENSA to meet the required sulfur content standards or other changes in the marketing of fuel oils. Over the last several years, many refiners have entered into consent agreements to resolve the United States Environmental Protection Agencys (EPA) assertions that refining facilities were modified or expanded without complying with New Source Review regulations that require permits and new emission controls in certain circumstances and other regulations that impose emissions control requirements. These consent agreements, which arise out of an EPA enforcement initiative focusing on petroleum refiners and utilities, have typically imposed substantial civil fines and penalties and required (i) significant capital expenditures to install emissions control equipment over a three to eight year time period and (ii) changes to operations which resulted in increased operating costs. The capital expenditures, penalties and supplemental environmental projects for individual refineries covered by the settlements can vary significantly, depending on the size and configuration of the refinery, the circumstances of the alleged modifications and whether the refinery has previously installed more advanced pollution controls. In January 2011, HOVENSA signed a Consent Decree with EPA to resolve its claims. Under the terms of the Consent Decree, HOVENSA will pay a penalty of approximately $5 million and spend approximately $700 million over the next 10 years to install equipment and implement additional operating procedures at the HOVENSA refinery to reduce emissions. In addition, the Consent Decree requires HOVENSA to spend approximately $5 million to fund an environmental project to be determined at a later date by the Virgin Islands and $500,000 to assist the Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority with monitoring. The Consent Decree has been lodged with the United States District Court for the Virgin Islands and approval is pending. In addition, substantial progress has been made towards resolving this matter for the Port Reading refining facility, which is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Corporations financial position or results of operations. The Corporation has undertaken a program to assess, monitor and reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane. The Corporation recognizes that climate change is a global environmental concern. The Corporation is committed to the responsible management of greenhouse gas emissions from our existing assets and future developments and is implementing a strategy to control our carbon emissions. The Corporation will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation. Sites where corrective action may be necessary include gasoline stations, terminals, onshore exploration and production facilities, refineries (including solid waste management units under permits issued pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act) and, although not currently significant, Superfund sites where the Corporation has been named a potentially responsible party. The Corporation accrues for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable. At year end 2010, the Corporations reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately $55 million. The Corporation expects that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites. The Corporations remediation spending was $13 million in 2010 and $11 million in both 2009 and 2008. Capital expenditures for facilities, primarily to comply with federal, state and local environmental standards, other than for the low sulfur requirements, were approximately $85 million in 2010, $50 million in 2009 and $15 million in 2008. Forward Looking Information Certain sections of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, including Business and Properties, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, include references to the Corporations future results of operations and financial position, liquidity and capital resources, capital expenditures, oil and gas production, tax rates, debt repayment, hedging, derivative, market risk and environmental disclosures, off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations and contingencies, which include forward looking information. Forward looking disclosures are based on the Corporations current understanding and assessment of these activities and reasonable assumptions about the 41 Table of Contents future. Actual results may differ from these disclosures because of changes in market conditions, government actions and other factors. For more information regarding the factors that may cause the Corporations results to differ from these statements, see Item 1A Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk In the normal course of its business, the Corporation is exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the price of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and electricity, as well as to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. In the disclosures that follow, these risk management activities are referred to as energy marketing and corporate risk management. The Corporation also has trading operations, principally through a 50% voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades energy commodities and energy derivatives. These activities are also exposed to commodity risks primarily related to the prices of crude oil, natural gas and refined products. The following describes how these risks are controlled and managed. Controls: The Corporation maintains a control environment under the direction of its chief risk officer and through its corporate risk policy, which the Corporations senior management has approved. Controls include volumetric, term and value at risk limits. The chief risk officer must approve the use of new instruments or commodities. Risk limits are monitored and reported on daily to business units and to senior management. The Corporations risk management department also performs independent verifications of sources of fair values and validations of valuation models. These controls apply to all of the Corporations risk management and trading activities, including the consolidated trading partnership. The Corporations treasury department is responsible for administering foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs. The Corporation uses value at risk to monitor and control commodity risk within its trading and risk management activities. The value at risk model uses historical simulation and the results represent the potential loss in fair value over one day at a 95% confidence level. The model captures both first and second order sensitivities for options. Results may vary from time to time as strategies change in trading activities or hedging levels change in risk management activities. Instruments: The Corporation primarily uses forward commodity contracts, foreign exchange forward contracts, futures, swaps, options and energy commodity based securities in its risk management and trading activities. These contracts are generally widely traded instruments with standardized terms. The following describes these instruments and how the Corporation uses them: Forward Commodity Contracts: The Corporation enters into contracts for the forward purchase and sale of commodities. At settlement date, the notional value of the contract is exchanged for physical delivery of the commodity. Forward contracts that are deemed normal purchase and sale contracts are excluded from the quantitative market risk disclosures. Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts: The Corporation enters into forward contracts primarily for the British Pound and the Thai Baht, which commit the Corporation to buy or sell a fixed amount of these currencies at a predetermined exchange rate on a future date. Exchange Traded Contracts: The Corporation uses exchange traded contracts, including futures, on a number of different underlying energy commodities. These contracts are settled daily with the relevant exchange and may be subject to exchange position limits. Swaps: The Corporation uses financially settled swap contracts with third parties as part of its risk management and trading activities. Cash flows from swap contracts are determined based on underlying commodity prices or interest rates and are typically settled over the life of the contract. Options: Options on various underlying energy commodities include exchange traded and third party contracts and have various exercise periods. As a seller of options, the Corporation receives a premium at the outset and bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the commodity underlying the option. As a purchaser of options, the Corporation pays a premium at the outset and has the right to participate in the favorable price movements in the underlying commodities. 42 Table of Contents Energy Securities: Energy securities include energy related equity or debt securities issued by a company or government or related derivatives on these securities. Risk Management Activities Energy marketing activities: In its energy marketing activities, the Corporation sells refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity principally to commercial and industrial businesses at fixed and floating prices for varying periods of time. Commodity contracts such as futures, forwards, swaps and options together with physical assets, such as storage, are used to obtain supply and reduce margin volatility or lower costs related to sales contracts with customers. Corporate risk management: Corporate risk management activities include transactions designed to reduce risk in the selling prices of crude oil, refined products or natural gas produced by the Corporation or to reduce exposure to foreign currency or interest rate movements. Generally, futures, swaps or option strategies may be used to reduce risk in the selling price of a portion of the Corporations crude oil or natural gas production. Forward contracts may also be used to purchase certain currencies in which the Corporation does business with the intent of reducing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Interest rate swaps may also be used, generally to convert fixed rate interest payments to floating. The Corporation uses foreign exchange contracts to reduce its exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates by entering into formal contracts for various currencies including the British Pound and the Thai Baht. At December 31, 2010, the Corporation had a payable for foreign exchange contracts maturing in 2011 with a fair value of $7 million. The change in fair value of the foreign exchange contracts from a 10% strengthening of the US Dollar exchange rate is estimated to be an approximately $88 million loss at December 31, 2010. The Corporations fixed rate debt of $5,569 million has a fair value of $6,353 million at December 31, 2010. A 15% decrease in the rate of interest would increase the fair value of debt by approximately $147 million at December 31, 2010. Following is the value at risk for the Corporations energy marketing and risk management commodity derivatives activities, excluding foreign exchange and interest derivatives described above: 2010 2009 (Millions of dollars) At December 31 $ 5 $ 8 Average 5 10 High 6 13 Low 4 8 Trading Activities Trading activities are conducted principally through a trading partnership in which the Corporation has a 50% voting interest. This consolidated entity intends to generate earnings through various strategies primarily using energy commodities, securities and derivatives. The Corporation also takes trading positions for its own account. Following is the value at risk for the Corporations trading activities: 2010 2009 (Millions of dollars) At December 31 $ 14 $ 9 Average 14 12 High 15 15 Low 12 9 43 Table of Contents Derivative trading transactions are marked to market and unrealized gains or losses are recognized currently in earnings. Gains or losses from sales of physical products are recorded at the time of sale. Total realized gains on trading activities amounted to $375 million in 2010 and $642 million in 2009.
