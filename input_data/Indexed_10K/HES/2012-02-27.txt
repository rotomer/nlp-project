Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations Our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant risk factors, including those described below. The risk factors described below could negatively affect our operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, and as a result, holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments. It is possible that additional risks relating to our securities may be described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in the future. Our business and operating results are highly dependent on the market prices of crude oil, natural gas, refined petroleum products and electricity, which can be very volatile. Our estimated proved reserves, revenue, operating cash flows, operating margins, future earnings and trading operations are highly dependent on the prices of crude oil, natural gas, refined petroleum products and electricity, which are volatile and influenced by numerous factors beyond our control. Changes in commodity prices can also have a material impact on collateral and margin requirements under our derivative contracts. The major foreign oil producing countries, including members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), exert considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products. Their ability or inability to agree on a common policy on rates of production and other matters has a significant impact on the oil markets. The commodities trading markets as well as other supply and demand factors may also influence the selling prices of crude oil, natural gas, refined petroleum products and electricity. To the extent that we engage in hedging activities to mitigate commodity price volatility, we may not realize the benefit of price increases above the hedged price. In order to manage the potential volatility of cash flows and credit requirements, the Corporation utilizes significant bank credit facilities. An inability to renew or replace such credit facilities or access other sources of funding as they mature would negatively impact our liquidity. If we fail to successfully increase our reserves, our future crude oil and natural gas production will be adversely impacted. We own or have access to a finite amount of oil and gas reserves which will be depleted over time. Replacement of oil and gas production and reserves, including proved undeveloped reserves, is subject to successful exploration drilling, development activities, and enhanced recovery programs. Therefore, future oil and gas production is dependent on technical success in finding and developing additional hydrocarbon reserves. Exploration activity involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and geophysical data, which does not always successfully predict the presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Drilling risks include unexpected adverse conditions, irregularities in pressure or formations, equipment failure, blowouts and weather interruptions. Future developments may be affected by unforeseen reservoir conditions which negatively affect recovery factors or flow rates. The costs of drilling and development activities have increased in recent years which could negatively affect expected economic returns. Reserve replacement can also be achieved through acquisition. Although due diligence is used in evaluating acquired oil and gas properties, similar risks may be encountered in the production of oil and gas on properties acquired from others. There are inherent uncertainties in estimating quantities of proved reserves and discounted future net cash flow, and actual quantities may be lower than estimated. Numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues from those reserves. Actual future production, oil and gas prices, revenues, taxes, capital expenditures, operating expenses, and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities of our proved reserves and the related future net revenues. In addition, reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward changes based on production performance, purchases or sales of properties, results of future development, prevailing oil and gas prices, production sharing contracts, which may decrease reserves as crude oil and natural gas prices increase, and other factors. We are subject to changing laws and regulations and other governmental actions that can significantly and adversely affect our business. Federal, state, local, territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims, disallowance of tax credits and deductions, expropriation or nationalization of property, mandatory government participation, cancellation or amendment of contract rights, and changes in import and export regulations, limitations on access to exploration and development opportunities, as well as other political developments may affect our operations. The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform Act, enacted in 2010, delegated rulemaking responsibilities to carry out the Act to various U.S. government agencies. Our business could potentially be adversely impacted by one or more of the final 14 Table of Contents rules under this Act, when issued, including potential additional costs to engage in certain derivative transactions. We also market motor fuels through lessee dealers and wholesalers in certain states where legislation prohibits producers or refiners of crude oil from directly engaging in retail marketing of motor fuels. Similar legislation has been periodically proposed in various other states. As a result of the accident in April 2010 at the BP p.l.c. (BP) operated Macondo prospect in the Gulf of Mexico (in which the Corporation was not a participant) and the ensuing significant oil spill, a temporary drilling moratorium was imposed in the Gulf of Mexico. While this moratorium has since been lifted, significant new regulations have been imposed and further legislation and regulations may be proposed, including an increase in the potential liability in the event of an oil spill. The new regulatory environment has resulted in a longer permitting process and higher costs. Political instability in areas where we operate can adversely affect our business. Some of the international areas in which we operate, and the partners with whom we operate, are politically less stable than other areas and partners. Political unrest in North Africa and the Middle East has affected and may continue to affect our operations in these areas as well as oil and gas markets generally. The threat of terrorism around the world also poses additional risks to the operations of the oil and gas industry. Our oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks and environmental laws and regulations that can result in significant costs and liabilities. Our oil and gas operations, like those of the industry, are subject to environmental risks such as oil spills, produced water spills, gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage. For example, the accident at the BP operated Macondo prospect in April 2010 resulted in a significant release of crude oil which caused extensive environmental and economic damage. Our operations are also subject to numerous United States federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. Non compliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative, civil or criminal penalties, remedial clean ups and natural resource damages or other liabilities. In addition, increasingly stringent environmental regulations, particularly relating to the production of motor and other fuels, have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general. Concerns have been raised in certain jurisdictions where we have operations concerning the safety and environmental impact of the drilling and development of unconventional oil and gas resources, particularly using the process of hydraulic fracturing. While we believe that these operations can be conducted safely and with minimal impact on the environment, regulatory bodies are responding to these concerns and may impose moratoriums and new regulations on such drilling operations that would likely have the effect of prohibiting or delaying such operations and increasing their cost. For example, a moratorium prohibiting hydraulic fracturing is currently impacting the Corporations operations in France. Concerns about climate change may result in significant operational changes and expenditures and reduced demand for our products. We recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern. Continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national, regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions. These agreements and measures may require significant equipment modifications, operational changes, taxes, or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of greenhouse gases from our operations, which may result in substantial capital expenditures and compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs. In addition, we manufacture petroleum fuels, which through normal customer use result in the emission of greenhouse gases. Regulatory initiatives to reduce the use of these fuels may reduce our sales of, and revenues from, these products. Finally, to the extent that climate change may result in more extreme weather related events, we could experience increased costs related to prevention, maintenance and remediation of affected operations in addition to costs and lost revenues related to delays and shutdowns. Our industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have. The petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital intensive. We encounter competition from numerous companies in each of our activities, including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas, and in purchasing and marketing of refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity. Many competitors, including national oil companies, are larger and have substantially greater resources. We are also in competition with producers and marketers of other forms of energy. Increased competition for worldwide oil and gas assets has significantly increased the cost of acquisitions. In addition, 15 Table of Contents competition for drilling services, technical expertise and equipment has, in the recent past, affected the availability of technical personnel and drilling rigs, resulting in increased capital and operating costs. Catastrophic events, whether naturally occurring or man made, may materially affect our operations and financial conditions. Our oil and gas operations are subject to unforeseen occurrences which have affected us from time to time and which may damage or destroy assets, interrupt operations and have other significant adverse effects. Examples of catastrophic risks include hurricanes, fires, explosions and blowouts, such as the accident at the Macondo prospect operated by BP in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. Although we maintain insurance coverage against property and casualty losses, there can be no assurance that such insurance will adequately protect the Corporation against liability from all potential consequences and damages. Moreover, some forms of insurance may be unavailable in the future or be available only on terms that are deemed economically unacceptable. Item 3. Legal Proceedings The Corporation, along with many other companies engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline, has been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) in gasoline. A series of similar lawsuits, many involving water utilities or governmental entities, were filed in jurisdictions across the United States against producers of MTBE and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing MTBE, including the Corporation. The principal allegation in all cases was that gasoline containing MTBE is a defective product and that these parties are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of MTBE. In 2008, the majority of the cases against the Corporation were settled. In 2010 and 2011, additional cases were settled including an action brought in state court by the State of New Hampshire. Two separate cases brought by the State of New Jersey and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico remain unresolved. In 2007, a pre tax charge of $40 million was recorded to cover all of the known MTBE cases against the Corporation. The Corporation received a directive from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) to remediate contamination in the sediments of the lower Passaic River and the NJDEP is also seeking natural resource damages. The directive, insofar as it affects the Corporation, relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in Newark, New Jersey now owned by the Corporation. The Corporation and over 70 companies entered into an Administrative Order on Consent with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to study the same contamination. The NJDEP has also sued several other companies linked to a facility considered by the State to be the largest contributor to river contamination. In January 2009, these companies added third party defendants, including the Corporation, to that case. In June 2007, the EPA issued a draft study which evaluated six alternatives for early action, with costs ranging from $900 million to $2.3 billion for all parties. Based on adverse comments from the Corporation and others, the EPA is reevaluating its alternatives. In addition, the federal trustees for natural resources have begun a separate assessment of damages to natural resources in the Passaic River. Given the ongoing studies, remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at this time. Based on currently known facts and circumstances, the Corporation does not believe that this matter will result in a material liability because its terminal could not have contributed contamination along most of the rivers length and did not store or use contaminants which are of the greatest concern in the river sediments, and because there are numerous other parties who will likely share in the cost of remediation and damages. On July 25, 2011, the Virgin Islands Department of Planning and Natural Resources commenced an enforcement action against HOVENSA by issuance of documents titled Notice Of Violation, Order For Corrective Action, Notice Of Assessment of Civil Penalty, Notice Of Opportunity For Hearing (the NOVs). The NOVs assert violations of Virgin Islands Air Pollution Control laws and regulations arising out of odor incidents on St. Croix in May 2011 and proposes total penalties of $210,000. HOVENSA is engaging in settlement discussions with the Government of the Virgin Islands, but believes that it has good defenses against the asserted violations. On December 16, 2010, the Virgin Islands Department of Planning and Natural Resources commenced four separate enforcement actions against HOVENSA by issuance of documents titled Notice Of Violation, Order For Corrective Action, Notice Of Assessment of Civil Penalty, Notice Of Opportunity For Hearing. The NOVs assert violations of Virgin Islands Air Pollution Control laws and regulations arising out of air release incidents 16 Table of Contents at the HOVENSA refinery in 2009 and 2010 and propose total penalties of $1,355,000. HOVENSA anticipates settling this matter in the first quarter of 2012. In July 2004, Hess Oil Virgin Islands Corp. (HOVIC), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Corporation, and HOVENSA, each received a letter from the Commissioner of the Virgin Islands Department of Planning and Natural Resources and Natural Resources Trustees, advising of the Trustees intention to bring suit against HOVIC and HOVENSA under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). The letter alleges that HOVIC and HOVENSA are potentially responsible for damages to natural resources arising from releases of hazardous substances from the HOVENSA refinery, which had been operated by HOVIC until October 1998. An action was filed on May 5, 2005 in the District Court of the Virgin Islands against HOVENSA, HOVIC and other companies that operated industrial facilities on the south shore of St. Croix asserting that the defendants are liable under CERCLA and territorial statutory and common law for damages to natural resources. HOVIC and HOVENSA are continuing to vigorously defend this matter and do not believe that this matter will result in a material liability as they believe that they have strong defenses against this complaint. The Corporation periodically receives notices from the EPA that it is a potential responsible party under the Superfund legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites. Under this legislation, all potentially responsible parties are jointly and severally liable. For certain sites, the EPAs claims or assertions of liability against the Corporation relating to these sites have not been fully developed. With respect to the remaining sites, the EPAs claims have been settled, or a proposed settlement is under consideration, in all cases for amounts that are not material. The ultimate impact of these proceedings, and of any related proceedings by private parties, on the business or accounts of the Corporation cannot be predicted at this time due to the large number of other potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of clean up cost estimates, but is not expected to be material. The Corporation is from time to time involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings, including proceedings relating to other environmental matters. The Corporation cannot predict with certainty if, how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief, if any, may be, particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages. Numerous issues may need to be resolved, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters before a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated for any proceeding. Subject to the foregoing, in managements opinion, based upon currently known facts and circumstances, the outcome of such proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of the Corporation. 17 Table of Contents PART II Item 5.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview The Corporation is a global integrated energy company that operates in two segments, Exploration and Production (E&P) and Marketing and Refining (M&R). The E&P segment explores for, develops, produces, purchases, transports and sells crude oil and natural gas. The M&R segment manufactures refined petroleum products and purchases, markets and trades refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity. Net income in 2011 was $1,703 million compared with $2,125 million in 2010 and $740 million in 2009. Diluted earnings per share were $5.01 in 2011 compared with $6.47 in 2010 and $2.27 in 2009. A table of items affecting comparability between periods is shown on page 23. Exploration and Production The Corporations strategy for the E&P segment is to profitably grow reserves and production in a sustainable and financially disciplined manner. The Corporations total proved reserves were 1,573 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) at December 31, 2011 compared with 1,537 million boe at December 31, 2010 and 1,437 million boe at December 31, 2009. E&P earnings were $2,675 million in 2011, $2,736 million in 2010 and $1,042 million in 2009. Average realized crude oil selling prices were $89.99 per barrel in 2011, $66.20 in 2010 and $51.62 in 2009, including the impact of hedging. Average realized natural gas selling prices were $5.96 per mcf in 2011, $5.63 in 2010 and $4.85 in 2009. Production averaged 370,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in 2011, a decrease of 48,000 boepd or 11% from 2010. Production averaged 408,000 boepd in 2009. The Corporation estimates that total worldwide production will average between 370,000 and 390,000 boepd in 2012, excluding the impact of asset sales and any Libyan production. The following is an update of significant E&P activities during 2011: In North Dakota, net production from the Bakken oil shale play averaged approximately 30,000 boepd during 2011 and 38,000 boepd for the fourth quarter 2011. The Corporation forecasts Bakken production will average 60,000 boepd for the full year of 2012 and is targeted to reach 120,000 boepd in 2015. The Corporation and its partner sanctioned the development of the Tubular Bells Field (Hess 57%) in the Mississippi Canyon Block 725 Area in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. In 2012, field development will be advanced with the construction of a floating production system and development drilling is scheduled to start in the second quarter. First production is anticipated in 2014. In the third quarter of the year, the Corporation announced the acquisition of approximately 185,000 net acres in the Utica Shale play in eastern Ohio. The Corporation entered into agreements to acquire approximately 85,000 net acres for approximately $750 million, principally through the acquisition of Marquette Exploration, LLC. In October 2011, the Corporation completed the acquisition of a 50% undivided interest in CONSOL Energy Inc.s (CONSOL) nearly 200,000 acres in the Utica Shale play for $59 million in cash at closing and the agreement to fund 50% of CONSOLs share of the drilling costs up to $534 million within a 5 year period. Appraisal of the Utica acreage commenced in the fourth quarter and will continue during 2012 with the acquisition of seismic and the planned drilling of 29 wells. The Corporation filed a Notice of Discovery with the Ministry for Energy of Ghana for the Paradise 1 exploration well in the Deepwater Tano Cape Three Points block. The well encountered an estimated 490 net feet of oil and gas condensate pay over three separate intervals. The Corporation is operator and has a 90% working interest in the license. The Corporation anticipates commencing additional exploration drilling in the first quarter of 2012, subject to government approvals and rig availability. In 2011, the Corporation drilled the Andalan 1 well on the Semai V block, offshore Indonesia (Hess 100%). The well encountered reservoir sands and hydrocarbons but not in commercial quantities. This well, along with a follow up well, was expensed in the fourth quarter. In September 2011, the operator of Block CA 1 in Brunei (Hess 14%) spud the Julong Center well. This well also failed to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons and was expensed. 21 Table of Contents In February 2011, the Corporation completed the sale of its interests in certain natural gas producing assets located in the United Kingdom North Sea for cash proceeds of $359 million, after post closing adjustments, resulting in a pre tax gain of $343 million ($310 million after income taxes). In August 2011, the Corporation completed the sale of its interests in the Snorre Field (Hess 1%), offshore Norway and the Cook Field (Hess 28%) in the United Kingdom North Sea for cash proceeds of $131 million, after post closing adjustments. These disposals resulted in non taxable gains totaling $103 million. Status of Libyan Operations In response to civil unrest in Libya, a number of measures were taken by the international community in the first quarter of 2011, including the imposition of economic sanctions. Production at the Waha Field was suspended in the first quarter of 2011. As a consequence of the civil unrest and the sanctions, the Corporation delivered force majeure notices to the Libyan government relating to the agreements covering its exploration and production interests in order to protect its rights while it was temporarily prevented from fulfilling its obligations and benefiting from the rights granted by those agreements. Production at the Waha Field restarted during the fourth quarter of 2011 at levels that were significantly lower than those prior to the civil unrest. The Corporations Libyan production averaged 23,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) for the full year of 2010 and 4,000 boepd for 2011. The force majeure covering the Corporations production interests was withdrawn at the end of the fourth quarter of 2011, as the economic sanctions were lifted. The force majeure covering the Corporations offshore exploration interests remained in place at year end but is expected to be withdrawn in 2012. The Corporation had proved reserves of 166 million barrels of oil equivalent in Libya at December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2011, the net book value of the Corporations exploration and production assets in Libya was approximately $500 million. Marketing and Refining The Corporations strategy for the M&R segment is to deliver strong operating performance and generate free cash flow. In January 2012, HOVENSA announced a decision to shut down its refinery in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands and operate the complex as an oil storage terminal. Results from M&R activities amounted to losses of $584 million in 2011, losses of $231 million in 2010 and earnings of $127 million in 2009. Refining operations generated losses of $728 million in 2011, $445 million in 2010 and $87 million in 2009. Refining results include after tax charges of $525 million in 2011 and $289 million in 2010 related to the Corporations investment in HOVENSA. Marketing earnings were $185 million in 2011, $215 million in 2010 and $168 million in 2009. Liquidity and Capital and Exploratory Expenditures Net cash provided by operating activities was $4,984 million in 2011, $4,530 million in 2010 and $3,046 million in 2009. At December 31, 2011, cash and cash equivalents totaled $351 million compared with $1,608 million at December 31, 2010, principally due to increased capital expenditures. Total debt was $6,057 million at December 31, 2011 and $5,583 million at December 31, 2010. The Corporations debt to capitalization ratio at December 31, 2011 was 24.6% compared with 24.9% at the end of 2010. Capital and exploratory expenditures were as follows for the years ended December 31: 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and Production United States $ 4,305 $ 2,935 $ 1,200 International 3,039 2,822 1,927 Total Exploration and Production 7,344 5,757 3,127 Marketing, Refining and Corporate 118 98 118 Total capital and exploratory expenditures $ 7,462 $ 5,855 $ 3,245 Exploration expenses charged to income included above: United States $ 197 $ 154 $ 144 International 259 209 183 Total exploration expenses charged to income included above $ 456 $ 363 $ 327 22 Table of Contents The Corporation anticipates investing $6.8 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures in 2012, substantially all of which is targeted for E&P operations. Consolidated Results of Operations The after tax income (loss) by major operating activity is summarized below for the years ended December 31: 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of dollars,except per share data) Exploration and Production $ 2,675 $ 2,736 $ 1,042 Marketing and Refining (584 ) (231 ) 127 Corporate (154 ) (159 ) (205 ) Interest expense (234 ) (221 ) (224 ) Net income attributable to Hess Corporation $ 1,703 $ 2,125 $ 740 Net income per share diluted $ 5.01 $ 6.47 $ 2.27 The following table summarizes, on an after tax basis, items of income (expense) that are included in net income and affect comparability between periods. The items in the table below are explained on pages 27 through 30. 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and Production $ 244 $ 732 $ 45 Marketing and Refining (525 ) (289 ) 12 Corporate (7 ) (60 ) $ (281 ) $ 436 $ (3 ) In the following discussion and elsewhere in this report, the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after tax basis. Management reviews segment earnings on an after tax basis and uses after tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings. Management believes that after tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre tax amount. After tax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre tax amounts. 23 Table of Contents Comparison of Results Exploration and Production Following is a summarized income statement of the Corporations E&P operations for the years ended December 31: 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of dollars) Sales and other operating revenues* $ 10,047 $ 8,744 $ 6,835 Other, net 464 1,233 207 Total revenues and non operating income 10,511 9,977 7,042 Costs and expenses Production expenses, including related taxes 2,352 1,924 1,805 Exploration expenses, including dry holes and lease impairment 1,195 865 829 General, administrative and other expenses 313 281 255 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 2,305 2,222 2,113 Asset impairments 358 532 54 Total costs and expenses 6,523 5,824 5,056 Results of operations before income taxes 3,988 4,153 1,986 Provision for income taxes 1,313 1,417 944 Results of operations attributable to Hess Corporation $ 2,675 $ 2,736 $ 1,042 * Amounts differ from E&P operating revenues in Note 19, Segment Information in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements primarily due to the exclusion of sales of hydrocarbons purchased from third parties. After considering the E&P items affecting comparability of earnings between periods in the table on page 27, the remaining changes in E&P earnings are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices, production and sales volumes, operating costs, exploration expenses, income taxes and foreign exchange, as discussed below. Selling Prices: Higher average selling prices increased E&P revenues by approximately $2,400 million in 2011 compared with 2010. Higher average selling prices increased E&P revenues by approximately $1,775 million in 2010 compared with 2009. The Corporations average selling prices were as follows for the years ended December 31: 2011 2010 2009 Crude oil per barrel (including hedging) United States $ 98.56 $ 75.02 $ 60.67 Europe 80.18 58.11 47.02 Africa 88.46 65.02 48.91 Asia 111.71 79.23 63.01 Worldwide 89.99 66.20 51.62 Crude oil per barrel (excluding hedging) United States $ 98.56 $ 75.02 $ 60.67 Europe 80.18 58.11 47.02 Africa 110.28 78.31 60.79 Asia 111.71 79.23 63.01 Worldwide 95.60 71.40 56.74 Natural gas liquids per barrel United States $ 58.59 $ 47.92 $ 36.57 Europe 75.49 59.23 43.23 Asia 72.29 63.50 46.48 Worldwide 62.72 50.49 38.47 24 Table of Contents 2011 2010 2009 Natural gas per mcf United States $ 3.39 $ 3.70 $ 3.36 Europe 8.79 6.23 5.15 Asia and other 6.02 5.93 5.06 Worldwide 5.96 5.63 4.85 In October 2008, the Corporation closed Brent crude oil hedges covering 24,000 barrels per day from 2009 through 2012 by entering into offsetting contracts with the same counterparty. The deferred after tax losses as of the date the hedge positions were closed are recorded in earnings as the contracts mature. Crude oil hedges reduced E&P earnings by $327 million ($517 million before income taxes) in 2011, $338 million ($533 million before income taxes) in 2010 and $337 million ($533 million before income taxes) in 2009. The remaining realized after tax losses from the closed hedge positions will be approximately $325 million in 2012. The Corporation also entered into Brent crude oil hedges using fixed price swap contracts to hedge 120,000 boepd of crude oil sales volumes for the full year of 2012 at an average price of $107.70 per barrel. Production and Sales Volumes: The Corporations crude oil and natural gas production was 370,000 boepd in 2011 compared with 418,000 boepd in 2010 and 408,000 boepd in 2009. The principal reasons for the reduction are described below. Approximately 72% in 2011, 73% in 2010 and 72% in 2009 of the Corporations production was from crude oil and natural gas liquids. The Corporation currently estimates that its 2012 production will average between 370,000 and 390,000 boepd, excluding the impact of asset sales and any Libyan production. The Corporations net daily worldwide production was as follows for the years ended December 31: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Crude oil barrels per day United States 81 75 60 Europe 89 88 83 Africa 66 113 120 Asia 13 13 16 Total 249 289 279 Natural gas liquids barrels per day United States 13 14 11 Europe 3 3 3 Asia 1 1 Total 17 18 14 Natural gas mcf per day United States 100 108 93 Europe 81 134 151 Asia and other 442 427 446 Total 623 669 690 Barrels of oil equivalent per day* 370 418 408 * Reflects natural gas production converted on the basis of relative energy content (six mcf equals one barrel). Barrel of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence as the equivalent price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis has been substantially lower than the corresponding price for crude oil over the recent past. See the average selling prices in the table above. 25 Table of Contents United States: Crude oil production in the United States was higher in 2011 compared with 2010, primarily due to new wells in the Bakken oil shale play, partly offset by lower production due to a shut in well at the Llano Field. Natural gas production was lower in 2011 compared with 2010, primarily due to this shut in well at the Llano Field. Crude oil and natural gas production was higher in 2010 compared with 2009, primarily due to new production from the Shenzi, Llano, Conger and Bakken fields. Europe: Crude oil production was comparable in 2011 and 2010, as higher production from Russia was largely offset by lower production from the Corporations United Kingdom North Sea assets. Crude oil production was higher in 2010 compared with 2009, due to higher production in Russia and in Norway following the acquisition of additional interests in the Valhall and Hod fields in 2010. Natural gas production was lower in 2011 compared with 2010, primarily due to the sale in February 2011 of certain natural gas producing assets in the United Kingdom North Sea. Natural gas production was lower in 2010 compared with 2009, primarily due to downtime at certain United Kingdom gas fields. Africa: Crude oil production decreased in 2011 compared with 2010 due to the suspension of production in Libya following civil unrest, the exchange in September 2010 of the Corporations interests in Gabon for increased interests in Norway, lower production entitlement in Equatorial Guinea and Algeria as a result of higher selling prices, and natural decline in Equatorial Guinea. Crude oil production decreased in 2010 compared with 2009 following the exchange of Gabon for additional interests in the Valhall and Hod fields in Norway and lower entitlement to Algerian production. Asia and other: Natural gas production in 2011 was higher than 2010, primarily due to higher total nominations at the Joint Development Area of Malaysia and Thailand (JDA) and the adjacent Block PM301 in Malaysia and first production from the Gajah Baru Complex at the Natuna A Field in Indonesia, which commenced production in the fourth quarter of 2011. Natural gas production in 2010 was lower than in 2009, primarily due to downtime at the Pangkah Field in Indonesia and a temporary shut in at the Bumi Field in the JDA. Sales Volumes: Lower sales volumes and other operating revenues decreased revenue by approximately $1,100 million in 2011 compared with 2010 and higher sales volumes and other operating revenues increased revenue by $135 million in 2010 compared with 2009. Operating Costs and Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization: Cash operating costs, consisting of production expenses and general and administrative expenses, increased by $460 million in 2011 compared with 2010 and increased by $145 million in 2010 compared with 2009. The increase in 2011 was primarily due to higher production taxes as a result of higher selling prices, together with higher operating and maintenance expenses, mainly in Norway and in the Bakken oil shale play. The increase in costs in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to higher production taxes as a result of higher selling prices. Depreciation, depletion and amortization charges increased by $83 million in 2011 and $109 million in 2010, compared with the corresponding amounts in prior years. The increases in both 2011 and 2010 were primarily due to higher per barrel costs, reflecting higher finding and development costs. In addition, the higher total per barrel costs in 2011 resulted from a greater proportion of production volumes from the Bakken. Excluding items affecting comparability between periods, cash operating costs per barrel of oil equivalent were $19.71 in 2011, $14.45 in 2010 and $13.70 in 2009. Depreciation, depletion and amortization costs per barrel of oil equivalent were $17.06 in 2011, $14.56 in 2010 and $14.19 in 2009. For 2012, cash operating costs are estimated to be in the range of $20.00 to $21.00 per barrel and depreciation, depletion and amortization costs are estimated to be in the range of $20.50 to $21.50 per barrel, resulting in total unit costs in the range of $40.50 to $42.50 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding Libyan operations. Exploration Expenses: Exploration expenses increased in 2011 compared to 2010, mainly due to higher dry hole expenses. Dry hole expenses included amounts relating to two exploration wells on the Semai V Block, offshore Indonesia and a well in the North Red Sea Block 1, offshore Egypt. Exploration expenses also increased in 2010 from 2009, primarily due to higher lease amortization. Income Taxes: Excluding the impact of items affecting comparability, the effective income tax rates for E&P operations were 38% in 2011, 44% in 2010 and 48% in 2009. The decrease in the effective income tax rate in 2011 compared with 2010 was predominantly due to the suspension of Libyan operations. The effective income tax rate for E&P operations in 2012 is estimated to be in the range of 36% to 40%, excluding Libyan operations. 26 Table of Contents Foreign Exchange: The after tax foreign currency losses were $16 million in 2011, $9 million in 2010 and $10 million in 2009. Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings: Reported E&P earnings include the following items affecting comparability of income (expense) before and after income taxes for the years ended December 31: Before Income Taxes After Income Taxes 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of dollars) Gains on asset sales $ 446 $ 1,208 $ $ 413 $ 1,130 $ Royalty dispute resolution 143 89 Asset impairments (358 ) (532 ) (54 ) (140 ) (334 ) (26 ) Dry hole expense (101 ) (64 ) Reductions in carrying values of assets (23 ) (18 ) Income tax adjustment (29 ) $ 88 $ 575 $ 66 $ 244 $ 732 $ 45 2011: In February 2011, the Corporation completed the sale of its interests in the Easington Catchment Area (Hess 30%), the Bacton Area (Hess 23%), the Everest Field (Hess 19%) and the Lomond Field (Hess 17%) in the United Kingdom North Sea for cash proceeds of $359 million, after post closing adjustments. These disposals resulted in pre tax gains totaling $343 million ($310 million after income taxes). These assets had a productive capacity of approximately 15,000 boepd. The total combined net book value of the disposed assets prior to the sale was $16 million, including allocated goodwill of $14 million. In August 2011, the Corporation completed the sale of its interests in the Snorre Field (Hess 1%), offshore Norway and the Cook Field (Hess 28%) in the United Kingdom North Sea for cash proceeds of $131 million, after post closing adjustments. These disposals resulted in non taxable gains totaling $103 million. The total combined net book value of the disposed assets prior to the sale was $28 million, including allocated goodwill of $11 million. In the third quarter of 2011, the Corporation recorded impairment charges of $358 million ($140 million after income taxes) related to increases in the Corporations estimated abandonment liabilities primarily for non producing properties which resulted in the book value of the properties exceeding their fair value. See Note 9, Asset Retirement Obligations in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In July 2011, the United Kingdom increased the supplementary tax rate on petroleum operations to 32% from 20% with an effective date of March 24, 2011. As a result, the Corporation recorded a charge of $29 million to increase the deferred tax liability in the United Kingdom. 2010: The Corporation completed the exchange of its interests in Gabon and the Clair Field in the United Kingdom for additional interests of 28% and 25%, respectively, in the Valhall and Hod fields in Norway. This non monetary transaction, which was recorded at fair value, resulted in a pre tax gain of $1,150 million ($1,072 million after income taxes). The Corporation also completed the sale of its interest in the Jambi Merang natural gas development project in Indonesia for a gain of $58 million. The Corporation recorded a charge of $532 million ($334 million after income taxes) to fully impair the carrying value of its 55% interest in the West Mediterranean Block 1 concession (West Med Block), located offshore Egypt. This interest was acquired in 2006 and included four natural gas discoveries and additional exploration prospects. The Corporation and its partners subsequently explored and further evaluated the area, made a fifth discovery, conducted development planning, and held negotiations with the Egyptian authorities to amend the existing gas sales agreement. In September 2010, the Corporation and its partners notified the Egyptian authorities of their decision to cease exploration activities and to relinquish a significant portion of the block. As a result, the Corporation fully impaired the carrying value of its interest in the West Med Block. The West Med Block was relinquished in 2011. The Corporation also recorded $101 million ($64 million after income taxes) of dry hole expenses related to previously suspended well costs on the West Med Block offshore Egypt and Block BM S 22 offshore Brazil, both of which were drilled prior to 2010. 27 Table of Contents 2009: The U.S. Supreme Court decided it would not review the decision of the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals against the U.S. Minerals Management Service (predecessor to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement) relating to royalty relief under the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995. As a result, the Corporation recognized after tax income of $89 million to reverse all previously recorded royalties covering the periods from 2003 to 2009. The pre tax amount of $143 million was reported in Other, net in the Statement of Consolidated Income. The Corporation recorded total asset impairment charges of $54 million ($26 million after income taxes) to reduce the carrying value of two short lived fields in the United Kingdom North Sea. Pre tax charges of approximately $23 million ($18 million after income taxes) were recorded to impair the carrying values of production equipment and to write down materials inventories in Equatorial Guinea and the United States. The pre tax amount of most of the inventory write downs was reported in Production expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income. The Corporations future E&P earnings may be impacted by external factors, such as volatility in the selling prices of crude oil and natural gas, reserve and production changes, exploration expenses, industry cost inflation, changes in foreign exchange rates and income tax rates, the effects of weather, political risk, environmental risk and catastrophic risk. In addition, as a result of the oil spill in 2010 at the BP p.l.c. operated Macondo prospect in the Gulf of Mexico, there have been and there may be further changes in laws and regulations that could impact the Corporations future drilling operations and increase its potential liability in the event of an oil spill. For a more comprehensive description of the risks that may affect the Corporations E&P business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations. Marketing and Refining Results from M&R activities were losses of $584 million in 2011, losses of $231 million in 2010 and earnings of $127 million in 2009. Excluding the items affecting comparability reflected in the table on page 23 and discussed below, results were losses of $59 million in 2011 and earnings of $58 million in 2010 and $115 million in 2009. Refining: Refining results consist of the Corporations share of HOVENSAs losses, together with the results of Port Reading and other miscellaneous operating activities. Refining losses were $728 million in 2011 (including $525 million of after tax losses related to the impairment recorded by HOVENSA and other charges due to the decision to shut down the refinery in St. Croix), $445 million in 2010 (including a $289 million after tax charge to reduce the carrying value of the Corporations equity investment in HOVENSA) and $87 million in 2009 (including a benefit of $12 million due to an income tax adjustment). In 2011, HOVENSA experienced continued substantial operating losses due to global economic conditions and competitive disadvantages versus other refiners, despite efforts to improve operating performance by reducing refining capacity to 350,000 from 500,000 barrels per day in the first half of the year. Operating losses were also projected to continue. In January 2012, HOVENSA announced a decision to shut down its refinery and operate the complex as an oil storage terminal. As a result of these developments, HOVENSA prepared an impairment analysis as of December 31, 2011, which concluded that undiscounted future cash flows would not recover the carrying value of its long lived assets, and recorded an impairment charge and other charges related to the decision to shut down the refinery. For 2011, the Corporation recorded a total of $1,073 million of losses from its equity investment in HOVENSA. These pre tax losses included $875 million ($525 million after income taxes) due to the impairment recorded by HOVENSA and other charges associated with its decision to shut down the refinery. The Corporations share of the impairment related losses recorded by HOVENSA represents an amount equivalent to the Corporations financial support to HOVENSA at December 31, 2011, its planned future funding commitments for costs related to the refinery shutdown, and a charge of $135 million for the write off of related assets held by the subsidiary which owns the Corporations investment in HOVENSA. At December 31, 2011, the Corporation has a liability of $487 million for its planned funding commitments, which is expected to be incurred in 2012. A deferred income tax benefit of $350 million, consisting primarily of U.S. income taxes, has been recorded on the Corporations share of HOVENSAs impairment and refinery shutdown related charges. 28 Table of Contents In December 2010, the Corporation recorded an impairment charge of $300 million before income taxes ($289 million after income taxes) to reduce the carrying value of its equity investment in HOVENSA, which was recorded in Income (loss) from equity investment in HOVENSA L.L.C., on the Statement of Consolidated Income. The investment had been adversely affected by consecutive annual operating losses resulting from continued weak refining margins and refinery utilization, and a fourth quarter 2010 debt rating downgrade. As a result of a strategic assessment in 2010, HOVENSA decided to lower its crude oil refining capacity to 350,000 from 500,000 barrels per day in 2011. The Corporation performed an impairment analysis and concluded that its investment had experienced an other than temporary decline in value. For discussion of the impairment charge, see Note 5, HOVENSA L.L.C. Joint Venture in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Excluding items affecting comparability discussed above, the Corporations share of HOVENSAs results was a loss of $198 million in 2011, $137 million in 2010 ($222 million before income taxes) and $141 million ($230 million before income taxes) in 2009. U.S. Virgin Island income taxes have not been recorded on the Corporations share of HOVENSAs 2011 results due to cumulative operating losses. These results reflect lower refining margins, higher fuel costs and lower sales volumes. During 2010, the fluid catalytic cracking unit at HOVENSA was shut down for a scheduled turnaround. The Corporations share of HOVENSAs turnaround expenses was approximately $20 million after income taxes. Other after tax refining results, principally from Port Reading operations, were a loss of $5 million in 2011, a loss of $19 million in 2010 and income of $42 million in 2009. During 2010, the Port Reading refining facility was shut down for 41 days for a scheduled turnaround. The after tax expenses for the Port Reading turnaround were approximately $30 million. The turnaround expenses are included in Other operating expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income. The following table summarizes refinery utilization rates for the years ended December 31: RefineryCapacity Refinery Utilization (Thousands ofbarrels per day) 2011 2010 2009 HOVENSA Crude 350* 81.1 % 78.0 % 80.3 % Fluid catalytic cracker 150 71.7 % 66.5 % 70.2 % Coker 58 77.4 % 78.3 % 81.6 % Port Reading 70 90.0 % 78.1 % 90.2 % * HOVENSAs crude oil refining capacity was reduced to 350,000 from 500,000 barrels per day in the first half of 2011. Marketing: Marketing operations, which consist principally of retail gasoline and energy marketing activities, generated income of $185 million in 2011, $215 million in 2010 and $168 million in 2009. The decrease in earnings in 2011 compared with 2010 was due to lower sales volumes and lower margins. The increase in earnings in 2010 compared with 2009 reflected improved margins from the weak economic environment in 2009. The table below summarizes marketing sales volumes for the years ended December 31: 2011 2010 2009 Refined petroleum product sales (thousands of barrels per day) 430 471 473 Natural gas (thousands of mcf per day) 2,167 2,016 2,010 Electricity (megawatts round the clock) 4,374 4,140 4,306 The Corporation has a 50% voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades energy commodities and energy derivatives. The Corporation also takes trading positions for its own account. The Corporations after tax results from trading activities, including its share of the results of the trading partnership, amounted to a loss of $41 million in 2011, a loss of $1 million in 2010 and earnings of $46 million in 2009. Marketing expenses increased in 2011 compared with 2010 reflecting higher retail credit card fees, maintenance, environmental and employee related expenses. Marketing expenses increased in 2010 compared with 2009, principally reflecting changes in retail credit card fees. 29 Table of Contents The Corporations future M&R earnings may be impacted by supply and demand factors, volatility in margins, credit risks, the effects of weather, competitive industry conditions, political risk, environmental risk and catastrophic risk. For a more comprehensive description of the risks that may affect the Corporations M&R business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations. Corporate The following table summarizes corporate expenses for the years ended December 31: 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of dollars) Corporate expenses (excluding items affecting comparability) $ 260 $ 256 $ 227 Income taxes (benefits) (106 ) (104 ) (82 ) Net corporate expenses 154 152 145 Items affecting comparability between periods, after tax 7 60 Total corporate expenses, after tax $ 154 $ 159 $ 205 Excluding items affecting comparability between periods, net corporate expenses were comparable in 2011 and 2010. The increase in net corporate expenses in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily reflects higher employee and insurance costs and bank facility fees. After tax corporate expenses in 2012 are estimated to be in the range of $160 million to $170 million. In 2010, the Corporation recorded a pre tax charge of $11 million ($7 million after income taxes) related to the repurchase of the remaining $116 million of fixed rate public notes that were scheduled to mature in 2011. In 2009, the Corporation recorded pre tax charges of $54 million ($34 million after income taxes) related to the repurchase of $546 million in fixed rate public notes that were scheduled to mature in 2011 and $42 million ($26 million after income taxes) relating to retirement benefits and employee severance costs. The pre tax charges in connection with the debt repurchases were recorded in Other, net, and the pre tax amounts of the retirement benefits and severance costs were recorded in General and administrative expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income. Interest Interest expense was as follows for the years ended December 31: 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of dollars) Total interest incurred $ 396 $ 366 $ 366 Capitalized interest (13 ) (5 ) (6 ) Interest expense before income taxes 383 361 360 Income taxes (benefits) (149 ) (140 ) (136 ) After tax interest expense $ 234 $ 221 $ 224 The increase in interest expense in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily reflects higher average borrowings following the issuance of $1.25 billion of 30 year fixed rate public notes in August 2010. Capitalized interest increased in 2011 due to the sanctioning of the Tubular Bells project. Interest expense was comparable in 2010 and 2009. After tax interest expense in 2012 is expected to be in the range of $245 million to $255 million. Consolidated Sales and Cost of Products Sold Sales and other operating revenues totaled $38,466 million in 2011, $33,862 million in 2010 and $29,614 million in 2009. The increase in Sales and other operating revenues of 14% year on year from 2009 to 2011 is primarily due to higher crude oil and refined petroleum product selling prices, partially offset by lower crude oil and refined petroleum product sales volumes. 30 Table of Contents The increase in Cost of products sold each year principally reflects higher prices for purchased refined petroleum products. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table sets forth certain relevant measures of the Corporations liquidity and capital resources at December 31: 2011 2010 (Millions of dollars) Cash and cash equivalents $ 351 $ 1,608 Short term debt and current maturities of long term debt $ 52 $ 46 Total debt $ 6,057 $ 5,583 Total equity $ 18,592 $ 16,809 Debt to capitalization ratio* 24.6 % 24.9 % * Total debt as a percentage of the sum of total debt plus equity. Cash Flows The following table sets forth a summary of the Corporations cash flows for the years ended December 31: 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of dollars) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 4,984 $ 4,530 $ 3,046 Investing activities (6,566 ) (5,259 ) (2,924 ) Financing activities 325 975 332 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (1,257 ) $ 246 $ 454 Operating Activities: Net cash provided by operating activities amounted to $4,984 million in 2011 compared with $4,530 million in 2010, reflecting higher operating earnings partially offset by a period over period increase in the use of cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $412 million. Operating cash flow increased to $4,530 million in 2010 from $3,046 million in 2009 principally reflecting higher earnings. Investing Activities: The following table summarizes the Corporations capital expenditures for the years ended December 31: 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and Production Exploration $ 869 $ 552 $ 611 Production and development 4,673 2,592 1,927 Acquisitions (including leaseholds) 1,346 2,250 262 6,888 5,394 2,800 Marketing, Refining and Corporate 118 98 118 Total $ 7,006 $ 5,492 $ 2,918 Capital expenditures in 2011 included acquisitions of approximately $800 million for 185,000 net acres in the Utica Shale play in eastern Ohio, $214 million for interests in two blocks in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq and $116 million for an additional 4% interest in the South Arne Field in Denmark. Capital expenditures in 2010 included acquisitions of 167,000 net acres in the Bakken oil shale play in North Dakota from TRZ Energy, LLC for $1,075 million in cash and additional interests of 8% and 13% in the Valhall and Hod fields, respectively, for $507 million in cash. Capital expenditures in 2009 included acquisitions of $188 million for unproved leaseholds and $74 million for a 50% interest in blocks PM301 and PM302 in Malaysia, which are adjacent to Block A 18 of the JDA. In addition, proceeds from asset sales were $490 million in 2011 and $183 million in 2010. 31 Table of Contents Financing Activities: During 2011, net proceeds from borrowings on available credit facilities were $422 million. During 2010, net proceeds from borrowings were $1,098 million, including the August 2010 issuance of $1,250 million of 30 year fixed rate public notes with a coupon of 5.6% scheduled to mature in 2041. The proceeds were used to purchase additional acreage in the Bakken and additional interests in the Valhall and Hod fields. In January 2010, the Corporation completed the repurchase of the remaining $116 million of fixed rate public notes that were scheduled to mature in 2011. Total common stock dividends paid were $136 million in 2011 and $131 million in 2010 and 2009. The Corporation received net proceeds from the exercise of stock options, including related income tax benefits of $88 million, $54 million and $18 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Future Capital Requirements and Resources The Corporation anticipates investing a total of approximately $6.8 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures during 2012, substantially all of which is targeted for E&P operations. The Corporation expects to fund its 2012 operations, including capital expenditures, its share of HOVENSA financial support totaling $487 million, dividends, pension contributions and required debt repayments, with existing cash on hand, cash flows from operations including the effect of hedging, proceeds from asset sales and its available credit facilities. Crude oil and natural gas prices are volatile and difficult to predict. In addition, unplanned increases in the Corporations capital expenditure program could occur. If conditions were to change, such as a significant decrease in commodity prices or an unexpected increase in capital expenditures, the Corporation would take steps to protect its financial flexibility and may pursue other sources of liquidity, including the issuance of debt securities, the issuance of equity securities, and or asset sales. The table below summarizes the capacity, usage, and available capacity of the Corporations borrowing and letter of credit facilities at December 31, 2011: ExpirationDate Capacity Borrowings Letters ofCredit Issued Total Used AvailableCapacity (Millions of dollars) Revolving credit facility April 2016 $ 4,000 $ $ 173 $ 173 $ 3,827 Asset backed credit facility July 2012 (a) 525 350 350 175 Committed lines Various (b) 2,675 1,063 1,063 1,612 Uncommitted lines Various (b) 562 100 462 562 Total $ 7,762 $ 450 $ 1,698 $ 2,148 $ 5,614 (a) Total capacity of $1 billion subject to the amount of eligible receivables posted as collateral. (b) Committed and uncommitted lines have expiration dates through 2014. In April 2011, the Corporation entered into a new $4 billion syndicated revolving credit facility that matures in April 2016. This facility, which replaced a $3 billion facility that was scheduled to mature in May 2012, can be used for borrowings and letters of credit. Borrowings on the facility bear interest at 1.25% above the London Interbank Offered Rate. A facility fee of 0.25% per annum is also payable on the amount of the facility. The interest rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment if the Corporations credit rating changes. The covenants that establish restrictions on the amount of total borrowings and secured debt are consistent with the previous facility. The Corporation has a 364 day asset backed credit facility securitized by certain accounts receivable from its Marketing and Refining operations. Under the terms of this financing arrangement, the Corporation has the ability to borrow or issue letters of credit of up to $1 billion subject to the availability of sufficient levels of eligible receivables. At December 31, 2011, outstanding borrowings under this facility of $350 million were collateralized by a total of $947 million of accounts receivable, which are held by a wholly owned subsidiary. These receivables are only available to pay the general obligations of the Corporation after satisfaction of the outstanding obligations under the asset backed facility. The Corporation also has a shelf registration statement filed with the SEC under which it may issue additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or preferred stock. Promptly after filing this report, as a result 32 Table of Contents of the Corporations existing shelf registration expiring on February 26, 2012, the Corporation anticipates filing a new shelf registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, under which it may issue, among other things, additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or preferred stock. The Corporations long term debt agreements contain a financial covenant that restricts the amount of total borrowings and secured debt. At December 31, 2011, the Corporation is permitted to borrow up to an additional $24.9 billion for the construction or acquisition of assets. The Corporation has the ability to borrow up to an additional $4.5 billion of secured debt at December 31, 2011. The Corporations $1.7 billion in letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2011 were primarily issued to satisfy margin requirements. See also Note 17, Risk Management and Trading Activities in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Credit Ratings There are three major credit rating agencies that rate the Corporations debt. All three agencies have currently assigned an investment grade rating with a stable outlook to the Corporations debt. The interest rates and facility fees charged on some of the Corporations credit facilities, as well as margin requirements from risk management and trading counterparties, are subject to adjustment if the Corporations credit rating changes. Contractual Obligations and Contingencies Following is a table showing aggregated information about certain contractual obligations at December 31, 2011: Payments Due by Period Total 2012 2013 and2014 2015 and2016 Thereafter (Millions of dollars) Total debt* $ 6,057 $ 52 $ 386 $ 459 $ 5,160 Operating leases 3,210 531 1,195 320 1,164 Purchase obligations Supply commitments 8,131 7,187 782 149 13 Capital expenditures and other investments 3,045 1,640 873 257 275 Operating expenses 3,039 1,637 829 204 369 Other long term liabilities 3,327 290 556 463 2,018 * At December 31, 2011, the Corporations debt bears interest at a weighted average rate of 6.8%. Supply commitments include term purchase agreements at market prices for a portion of the gasoline necessary to supply the Corporations retail marketing system and feedstocks for the Port Reading refining facility. In addition, the Corporation has commitments to purchase refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity to supply contracted customers in its energy marketing business. These commitments were computed based predominately on year end market prices. The table also reflects future capital expenditures, including the portion of the Corporations planned $6.8 billion capital investment program for 2012 that was contractually committed at December 31, 2011. Obligations for operating expenses include commitments for transportation, seismic purchases, oil and gas production expenses and other normal business expenses. Other long term liabilities reflect contractually committed obligations in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2011, including asset retirement obligations, pension plan liabilities and estimates for uncertain income tax positions. During 2011, the Corporation entered into a lease agreement for a floating production system and related support activities for the Tubular Bells Field. Payments under this five year contract, which total approximately $420 million and are expected to commence by mid 2014, are included in Capital expenditures and other investments in the contractual obligations table above. The Corporation also has a tolling agreement with Bayonne Energy Center, LLC (BEC) (Hess 50%), a joint venture formed to generate electricity for sale into the 33 Table of Contents New York City market. Under the tolling arrangement, the Corporation will pay its share of a predetermined monthly amount to BEC following the start up of plant operations, which is expected in mid 2012. Estimated payments through 2027, which total approximately $415 million, are included in Operating expenses in the contractual obligations table. The Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries lease gasoline stations, drilling rigs, tankers, office space and other assets for varying periods under leases accounted for as operating leases. The Corporation has a contingent purchase obligation to acquire the remaining interest in WilcoHess, a retail gasoline station joint venture. This contingent obligation, which expires in April 2014, was approximately $205 million at December 31, 2011. The Corporation is contingently liable under letters of credit and under guarantees of the debt of other entities directly related to its business at December 31, 2011 as shown below (in millions of dollars): Letters of credit $ 67 Guarantees 15 $ 82 Off balance Sheet Arrangements The Corporation has leveraged leases not included in its Consolidated Balance Sheet, primarily related to retail gasoline stations that the Corporation operates. The net present value of these leases is $388 million at December 31, 2011 compared with $394 million at December 31, 2010. If these leases were included as debt, the Corporations December 31, 2011 debt to capitalization ratio would increase to 25.7% from 24.6%. See also Note 18, Guarantees and Contingencies in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Foreign Operations The Corporation conducts exploration and production activities outside the United States, principally in Algeria, Australia, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Brunei, China, Denmark, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, France, Ghana, Indonesia, the Kurdistan region of Iraq, Libya, Malaysia, Norway, Peru, Russia, Thailand and the United Kingdom. Therefore, the Corporation is subject to the risks associated with foreign operations, including political risk, tax law changes and currency risk. See also Item 1A. Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations. Accounting Policies Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities in the Corporations Consolidated Balance Sheet and revenues and expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income. The accounting methods used can affect net income, equity and various financial statement ratios. However, the Corporations accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity. Accounting for Exploration and Development Costs: Exploration and production activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses, brokers fees and other related costs, are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are capitalized. In production operations, costs of injected CO2 for tertiary recovery are expensed as incurred. The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found. Exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and 34 Table of Contents (2) sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project. If either of those criteria is not met, or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the capitalized well costs are charged to expense. Indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include: commitment of project personnel, active negotiations for sales contracts with customers, negotiations with governments, operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors. Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves: The SEC revised its oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements effective for year end 2009 reporting. In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) revised its accounting standard on oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosures. The determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities. The estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations, the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment, as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill. For reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. In addition, government and project operator approvals must be obtained and, depending on the amount of the project cost, senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project. The Corporation maintains its own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties. The Corporations technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells, performance reviews, new technical data and other studies. To provide consistency throughout the Corporation, standard reserve estimation guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and approval practices are used. The internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management review. The Corporation also engages an independent third party consulting firm to audit approximately 80% of the Corporations total proved reserves. Impairment of Long lived Assets and Goodwill: As explained below, there are significant differences in the way long lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing. The Corporation reviews long lived assets, including oil and gas fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered. Long lived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying amounts of the long lived assets are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted future net cash flow estimates, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows. In the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future net cash flows is based on managements best estimate of future prices, which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices, applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a risk adjusted rate. The projected production volumes represent reserves, including probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures. The production volumes, prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information. Oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve month average prices. The Corporations impairment tests of long lived E&P producing assets are based on its best estimates of future production volumes (including recovery factors), selling prices, operating and capital costs, the timing of future production and other factors, which are updated each time an impairment test is performed. The Corporation could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease, crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly. The Corporations goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable. The goodwill test is conducted at a reporting unit level, which is defined in accounting standards as an operating segment or one level 35 Table of Contents below an operating segment. The reporting unit or units to be used in an evaluation and measurement of goodwill for impairment testing are determined from a number of factors, including the manner in which the business is managed. The Corporation has concluded that the E&P segment is the reporting unit for the purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, since the E&P segment is managed globally by one segment manager who allocates financial and technical resources globally and reviews operating results at the segment level. Accordingly, the Corporation expects that the benefits of goodwill will be recovered through the operations of that segment. If any of the E&P segment components, such as our financial reporting regions (United States, Europe, Africa and Asia) were considered to be reporting units, an analysis would be performed to determine if these components were economically similar as defined in the accounting standard for goodwill (ASC 350 20 35). If components are economically similar, that guidance requires that those components be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit. While the Corporation believes that the E&P segment is the reporting unit because of the manner in which the business is managed, it also evaluated the required aggregation criteria specified in the accounting standard for segment reporting (ASC 280 10 50 11) and determined that its components are economically similar for the following reasons: The Corporation operates its exploration and production segment as a single, global business. Each component produces oil and gas. The exploration and production processes are similar in each component. The methods used by each component to market and distribute oil and gas are similar. Customers of each component are similar. The components share technical resources and support services. If the Corporation reorganized its exploration and production business such that there was more than one reporting unit, goodwill may be assigned to two or more reporting units. The Corporations fair value estimate of the E&P segment is the sum of: (1) the discounted anticipated cash flows of producing assets and known developments, (2) the estimated risk adjusted present value of exploration assets, and (3) an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential synergies including cost savings, access to new business opportunities, enterprise control, improved processes and increased market share. The Corporation also considers the relative market valuation of similar E&P companies. The determination of the fair value of the E&P segment depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves, future prices, timing of future net cash flows and market premiums. Significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of the E&P segment that could result in an impairment of goodwill. As there are significant differences in the way long lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing, there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned to the E&P segment. Impairment of Equity Investees: The Corporation reviews equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than temporary decline in value may have occurred. The fair value measurement used in the impairment assessment is based on quoted market prices, where available, or other valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows. Differences between the carrying value of the Corporations equity investments and its equity in the net assets of the affiliate that result from impairment charges are amortized over the remaining useful life of the affiliates fixed assets. Income Taxes: Judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements. These judgments include the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when management believes that it is more likely than not, that based on the technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. The Corporation has net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in several jurisdictions, including the United States, and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits. Additionally, the Corporation has deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain 36 Table of Contents assets and liabilities. Regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized. If it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized. In evaluating realizability of deferred tax assets, the Corporation refers to the reversal periods for available carryforward periods for net operating losses and credit carryforwards, temporary differences, the availability of tax planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets and estimates of future taxable income and other factors. Estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the Corporations internal business forecasts. Additionally, the Corporation has income taxes which have been deferred on intercompany transactions eliminated in consolidation related to transfers of property, plant and equipment remaining within the consolidated group. The amortization of these income taxes deferred on intercompany transactions will occur ratably with the recovery through depletion and depreciation of the carrying value of these assets. The Corporation does not provide for deferred U.S. income taxes for that portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Fair Value Measurements: The Corporations derivative instruments and supplemental pension plan investments are recorded at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period as appropriate. The Corporation uses various valuation approaches in determining fair value, including the market and income approaches. The Corporations fair value measurements also include non performance risk and time value of money considerations. Counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances, and the Corporations credit is considered for accrued liabilities. The Corporation also records certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by generally accepted accounting principles. These fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations, the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of long lived assets, equity method investments or goodwill. The Corporation determines fair value in accordance with the FASB fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the input, which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market (Level 1) to estimates determined using related market data (Level 3). Multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value, however, the level of fair value is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy. Details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values are as follows: Fair value measurements based on Level 1 inputs: Measurements that are most observable are based on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained from the principal markets in which they are traded. Closing prices are both readily available and representative of fair value. Market transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to assure liquidity. The fair value of certain of the Corporations exchange traded futures and options are considered Level 1. Fair value measurements based on Level 2 inputs: Measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered Level 2. Measurements based on Level 2 inputs include over the counter derivative instruments that are priced on an exchange traded curve but have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange traded contracts. The Corporation utilizes fair value measurements based on Level 2 inputs for certain forwards, swaps and options. The liability related to the Corporations crude oil hedges is classified as Level 2. Fair value measurements based on Level 3 inputs: Measurements that are least observable are estimated from related market data determined from sources with little or no market activity for comparable contracts or are positions with longer durations. For example, in its energy marketing business, the Corporation sells natural gas and electricity to customers and offsets the price exposure by purchasing forward contracts. The fair value of these sales and purchases may be based on specific prices at less liquid delivered locations, which are classified as Level 3. Fair values determined using discounted cash flows and other unobservable data are also classified as Level 3. Derivatives: The Corporation utilizes derivative instruments for both risk management and trading activities. In risk management activities, the Corporation uses futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil, natural gas, refined petroleum 37 Table of Contents products and electricity, as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. In trading activities, the Corporation, principally through a consolidated partnership, trades energy related commodities and derivatives, including futures, forwards, options and swaps, based on expectations of future market conditions. All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the Corporations Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Corporations policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative. The changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges) or hedges of firm commitments (fair value hedges). The effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings. The change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives that are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges are tested for effectiveness prospectively before they are executed and both prospectively and retrospectively on an on going basis to determine whether they continue to qualify for hedge accounting. The prospective and retrospective effectiveness calculations are performed using either historical simulation or other statistical models, which utilize historical observable market data consisting of futures curves and spot prices. Retirement Plans: The Corporation has funded non contributory defined benefit pension plans and an unfunded supplemental pension plan. The Corporation recognizes in the Consolidated Balance Sheet the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans. The determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations; expected long term rates of return on plan assets; and rate of future increases in compensation levels. These assumptions represent estimates made by the Corporation, some of which can be affected by external factors. For example, the discount rate used to estimate the Corporations projected benefit obligation is based on a portfolio of high quality, fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations, while the expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category, weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category. Changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on the amounts reported in the Corporations financial statements. Asset Retirement Obligations: The Corporation has material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain exploration and production locations. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the Corporation recognizes a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations. In addition, the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligations is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated. The Corporation capitalizes such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred. In order to measure these obligations, the Corporation estimates the fair value of the obligations by discounting the future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations. In determining these estimates, the Corporation is required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement, timing of settlement, interpretation of legal requirements, inflationary factors and discount rate. In addition, there are other external factors which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements, fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates and advances in technology. As a result, the Corporations estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above. Changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values. 38 Table of Contents Environment, Health and Safety The Corporation has a values based, socially responsible strategy focused on improving environment, health and safety performance and making a positive impact on communities where it does business. The strategy is reflected in the Corporations environment, health, safety and social responsibility (EHS & SR) policies and by environment and safety management systems that help protect the Corporations workforce, customers and local communities. The Corporations management systems are designed to uphold or exceed international standards and are intended to promote internal consistency, adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in EHS & SR performance. Improved performance may, in the short term, increase the Corporations operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to assets, reputation and license to operate. In addition to enhanced EHS & SR performance, improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be realized as collateral benefits from investments in EHS & SR. The Corporation has programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance, audit facilities, train employees, prevent and manage risks and emergencies and to generally meet corporate EHS & SR goals. Over the last several years, many refineries have entered into consent agreements to resolve the United States Environmental Protection Agencys (EPA) assertions that refining facilities were modified or expanded without complying with the New Source Review regulations that require permits and new emission controls in certain circumstances and other regulations that impose emissions control requirements. In January 2011, HOVENSA signed a consent decree with the EPA to resolve its claims. Under the terms of the Consent Decree, HOVENSA agreed to pay a penalty of approximately $5 million and spend approximately $700 million over the next 10 years to install equipment and implement additional operating procedures at the HOVENSA refinery to reduce emissions. In addition, the Consent Decree requires HOVENSA to spend approximately $5 million to fund an environmental project to be determined at a later date by the Virgin Islands and $500,000 to assist the Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority with monitoring. However, as a result of HOVENSAs decision to shut down its refinery, which was announced in January 2012, HOVENSA believes that it will not be required to make material capital expenditures pursuant to this consent decree. The Corporation believes that it will also enter into a consent decree with the EPA in the near future to resolve these matters as they relate to its Port Reading refinery facility, which is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of the Corporation. The Corporation produces and distributes fuel oils in the United States. Many states and localities are adopting requirements that mandate a lower sulfur content of fuel oils and restrict the types of fuel oil sold within their jurisdictions. These proposals could require capital expenditures by the Corporation for its Port Reading refining facility to meet the required sulfur content standards or other changes in the marketing of fuel oils and affect the profitability of that facility. The Corporation has undertaken a program to assess, monitor and reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane. The Corporation recognizes that climate change is a global environmental concern. The Corporation is committed to the responsible management of greenhouse gas emissions from our existing assets and future developments and is implementing a strategy to control our carbon emissions. The Corporation will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation. Sites where corrective action may be necessary include gasoline stations, terminals, onshore exploration and production facilities, refineries (including solid waste management units under permits issued pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act) and, although not currently significant, Superfund sites where the Corporation has been named a potentially responsible party. The Corporation accrues for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable. At year end 2011, the Corporations reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately $60 million. The Corporation expects that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites. The Corporations remediation spending was $19 million in 2011, $13 million in 2010 and $11 million in 2009. Capital expenditures for facilities, primarily to comply with federal, state and local environmental standards, other than for the low sulfur requirements, were approximately $95 million in 2011, $85 million in 2010 and $50 million in 2009. 39 Table of Contents Forward looking Information Certain sections of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, including Business and Properties, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, include references to the Corporations future results of operations and financial position, liquidity and capital resources, capital expenditures, oil and gas production, tax rates, debt repayment, hedging, derivative, market risk and environmental disclosures, off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations and contingencies, which include forward looking information. These sections typically include statements with words such as anticipate, estimate, expect, forecast, guidance, could, may, should, would or similar words, indicating that future outcomes are uncertain. Forward looking disclosures are based on the Corporations current understanding and assessment of these activities and reasonable assumptions about the future. Actual results may differ from these disclosures because of changes in market conditions, government actions and other factors. For more information regarding the factors that may cause the Corporations results to differ from these statements, see Item 1A. Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk In the normal course of its business, the Corporation is exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the price of crude oil, natural gas, refined petroleum products and electricity, as well as to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. In the disclosures that follow, risk management activities are referred to as energy marketing and corporate risk management activities. The Corporation also has trading operations, principally through a 50% voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades energy related commodities, securities and derivatives. These activities are also exposed to commodity risks primarily related to the prices of crude oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products. The following describes how these risks are controlled and managed. Controls: The Corporation maintains a control environment under the direction of its chief risk officer and through its corporate risk policy, which the Corporations senior management has approved. Controls include volumetric, term and value at risk limits. The chief risk officer must approve the use of new instruments or commodities. Risk limits are monitored and are reported on a daily basis to business units and to senior management. The Corporations risk management department also performs independent verifications of sources of fair values and validations of valuation models. These controls apply to all of the Corporations risk management and trading activities, including the consolidated trading partnership. The Corporations treasury department is responsible for administering and monitoring foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs. The Corporation uses value at risk to monitor and control commodity risk within its risk management and trading activities. The value at risk model uses historical simulation and the results represent the potential loss in fair value over one day at a 95% confidence level. The model captures both first and second order sensitivities for options. Results may vary from time to time as strategies change in trading activities or hedging levels change in risk management activities. Instruments: The Corporation primarily uses forward commodity contracts, foreign exchange forward contracts, futures, swaps, options and energy commodity based securities in its risk management and trading activities. These contracts are generally widely traded instruments with standardized terms. The following describes these instruments and how the Corporation uses them: Forward Commodity Contracts: The Corporation enters into contracts for the forward purchase and sale of commodities. At settlement date, the notional value of the contract is exchanged for physical delivery of the commodity. Forward contracts that are deemed normal purchase and sale contracts are excluded from the quantitative market risk disclosures. Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts: The Corporation enters into forward contracts primarily for the British Pound and the Thai Baht, which commit the Corporation to buy or sell a fixed amount of these currencies at a predetermined exchange rate on a future date. Exchange Traded Contracts: The Corporation uses exchange traded contracts, including futures, on a number of different underlying energy commodities. These contracts are settled daily with the relevant exchange and may be subject to exchange position limits. 40 Table of Contents Swaps: The Corporation uses financially settled swap contracts with third parties as part of its risk management and trading activities. Cash flows from swap contracts are determined based on underlying commodity prices or interest rates and are typically settled over the life of the contract. Options: Options on various underlying energy commodities include exchange traded and third party contracts and have various exercise periods. As a seller of options, the Corporation receives a premium at the outset and bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the commodity underlying the option. As a purchaser of options, the Corporation pays a premium at the outset and has the right to participate in the favorable price movements in the underlying commodities. Energy Securities: Energy securities include energy related equity or debt securities issued by a company or government or related derivatives on these securities. Risk Management Activities Energy marketing activities: In its energy marketing activities, the Corporation sells refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity principally to commercial and industrial businesses at fixed and floating prices for varying periods of time. Commodity contracts such as futures, forwards, swaps and options together with physical assets, such as storage, are used to obtain supply and reduce margin volatility or lower costs related to sales contracts with customers. Corporate risk management: Corporate risk management activities include transactions designed to reduce risk in the selling prices of crude oil, refined petroleum products or natural gas produced by the Corporation or to reduce exposure to foreign currency or interest rate movements. Generally, futures, swaps or option strategies may be used to reduce risk in the selling price of a portion of the Corporations crude oil or natural gas production. Forward contracts may also be used to purchase certain currencies in which the Corporation does business with the intent of reducing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Interest rate swaps may also be used, generally to convert fixed rate interest payments to floating. The Corporation has outstanding foreign exchange contracts used to reduce its exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates for various currencies, including the British Pound and the Thai Baht. At December 31, 2011, the Corporation had a payable for foreign exchange contracts maturing in 2012 with a fair value of $14 million. The change in fair value of the foreign exchange contracts from a 10% strengthening of the U.S. Dollar exchange rate is estimated to be a loss of approximately $89 million at December 31, 2011. The Corporations outstanding long term debt of $6,040 million has a fair value of $7,317 million at December 31, 2011. A 15% decrease in the rate of interest would increase the fair value of debt by approximately $247 million at December 31, 2011.

Trading Activities Trading activities are conducted principally through a trading partnership in which the Corporation has a 50% voting interest. This consolidated entity intends to generate earnings through various strategies primarily using energy commodities, securities and derivatives. The Corporation also takes trading positions for its own account. 41 Table of Contents Following is the value at risk for the Corporations trading activities: 2011 2010 (Millions of dollars) At December 31 $ 4 $ 14 Average 11 14 High 16 15 Low 4 12 The information that follows represents 100% of the trading partnership and the Corporations proprietary trading accounts.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview The Corporation is a global integrated energy company that operates in two segments, Exploration and Production (E&P) and Marketing and Refining (M&R). The E&P segment explores for, develops, produces, purchases, transports and sells crude oil and natural gas. The M&R segment manufactures refined petroleum products and purchases, markets and trades refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity. Net income in 2011 was $1,703 million compared with $2,125 million in 2010 and $740 million in 2009. Diluted earnings per share were $5.01 in 2011 compared with $6.47 in 2010 and $2.27 in 2009. A table of items affecting comparability between periods is shown on page 23. Exploration and Production The Corporations strategy for the E&P segment is to profitably grow reserves and production in a sustainable and financially disciplined manner. The Corporations total proved reserves were 1,573 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) at December 31, 2011 compared with 1,537 million boe at December 31, 2010 and 1,437 million boe at December 31, 2009. E&P earnings were $2,675 million in 2011, $2,736 million in 2010 and $1,042 million in 2009. Average realized crude oil selling prices were $89.99 per barrel in 2011, $66.20 in 2010 and $51.62 in 2009, including the impact of hedging. Average realized natural gas selling prices were $5.96 per mcf in 2011, $5.63 in 2010 and $4.85 in 2009. Production averaged 370,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in 2011, a decrease of 48,000 boepd or 11% from 2010. Production averaged 408,000 boepd in 2009. The Corporation estimates that total worldwide production will average between 370,000 and 390,000 boepd in 2012, excluding the impact of asset sales and any Libyan production. The following is an update of significant E&P activities during 2011: In North Dakota, net production from the Bakken oil shale play averaged approximately 30,000 boepd during 2011 and 38,000 boepd for the fourth quarter 2011. The Corporation forecasts Bakken production will average 60,000 boepd for the full year of 2012 and is targeted to reach 120,000 boepd in 2015. The Corporation and its partner sanctioned the development of the Tubular Bells Field (Hess 57%) in the Mississippi Canyon Block 725 Area in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. In 2012, field development will be advanced with the construction of a floating production system and development drilling is scheduled to start in the second quarter. First production is anticipated in 2014. In the third quarter of the year, the Corporation announced the acquisition of approximately 185,000 net acres in the Utica Shale play in eastern Ohio. The Corporation entered into agreements to acquire approximately 85,000 net acres for approximately $750 million, principally through the acquisition of Marquette Exploration, LLC. In October 2011, the Corporation completed the acquisition of a 50% undivided interest in CONSOL Energy Inc.s (CONSOL) nearly 200,000 acres in the Utica Shale play for $59 million in cash at closing and the agreement to fund 50% of CONSOLs share of the drilling costs up to $534 million within a 5 year period. Appraisal of the Utica acreage commenced in the fourth quarter and will continue during 2012 with the acquisition of seismic and the planned drilling of 29 wells. The Corporation filed a Notice of Discovery with the Ministry for Energy of Ghana for the Paradise 1 exploration well in the Deepwater Tano Cape Three Points block. The well encountered an estimated 490 net feet of oil and gas condensate pay over three separate intervals. The Corporation is operator and has a 90% working interest in the license. The Corporation anticipates commencing additional exploration drilling in the first quarter of 2012, subject to government approvals and rig availability. In 2011, the Corporation drilled the Andalan 1 well on the Semai V block, offshore Indonesia (Hess 100%). The well encountered reservoir sands and hydrocarbons but not in commercial quantities. This well, along with a follow up well, was expensed in the fourth quarter. In September 2011, the operator of Block CA 1 in Brunei (Hess 14%) spud the Julong Center well. This well also failed to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons and was expensed. 21 Table of Contents In February 2011, the Corporation completed the sale of its interests in certain natural gas producing assets located in the United Kingdom North Sea for cash proceeds of $359 million, after post closing adjustments, resulting in a pre tax gain of $343 million ($310 million after income taxes). In August 2011, the Corporation completed the sale of its interests in the Snorre Field (Hess 1%), offshore Norway and the Cook Field (Hess 28%) in the United Kingdom North Sea for cash proceeds of $131 million, after post closing adjustments. These disposals resulted in non taxable gains totaling $103 million. Status of Libyan Operations In response to civil unrest in Libya, a number of measures were taken by the international community in the first quarter of 2011, including the imposition of economic sanctions. Production at the Waha Field was suspended in the first quarter of 2011. As a consequence of the civil unrest and the sanctions, the Corporation delivered force majeure notices to the Libyan government relating to the agreements covering its exploration and production interests in order to protect its rights while it was temporarily prevented from fulfilling its obligations and benefiting from the rights granted by those agreements. Production at the Waha Field restarted during the fourth quarter of 2011 at levels that were significantly lower than those prior to the civil unrest. The Corporations Libyan production averaged 23,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) for the full year of 2010 and 4,000 boepd for 2011. The force majeure covering the Corporations production interests was withdrawn at the end of the fourth quarter of 2011, as the economic sanctions were lifted. The force majeure covering the Corporations offshore exploration interests remained in place at year end but is expected to be withdrawn in 2012. The Corporation had proved reserves of 166 million barrels of oil equivalent in Libya at December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2011, the net book value of the Corporations exploration and production assets in Libya was approximately $500 million. Marketing and Refining The Corporations strategy for the M&R segment is to deliver strong operating performance and generate free cash flow. In January 2012, HOVENSA announced a decision to shut down its refinery in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands and operate the complex as an oil storage terminal. Results from M&R activities amounted to losses of $584 million in 2011, losses of $231 million in 2010 and earnings of $127 million in 2009. Refining operations generated losses of $728 million in 2011, $445 million in 2010 and $87 million in 2009. Refining results include after tax charges of $525 million in 2011 and $289 million in 2010 related to the Corporations investment in HOVENSA. Marketing earnings were $185 million in 2011, $215 million in 2010 and $168 million in 2009. Liquidity and Capital and Exploratory Expenditures Net cash provided by operating activities was $4,984 million in 2011, $4,530 million in 2010 and $3,046 million in 2009. At December 31, 2011, cash and cash equivalents totaled $351 million compared with $1,608 million at December 31, 2010, principally due to increased capital expenditures. Total debt was $6,057 million at December 31, 2011 and $5,583 million at December 31, 2010. The Corporations debt to capitalization ratio at December 31, 2011 was 24.6% compared with 24.9% at the end of 2010. Capital and exploratory expenditures were as follows for the years ended December 31: 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and Production United States $ 4,305 $ 2,935 $ 1,200 International 3,039 2,822 1,927 Total Exploration and Production 7,344 5,757 3,127 Marketing, Refining and Corporate 118 98 118 Total capital and exploratory expenditures $ 7,462 $ 5,855 $ 3,245 Exploration expenses charged to income included above: United States $ 197 $ 154 $ 144 International 259 209 183 Total exploration expenses charged to income included above $ 456 $ 363 $ 327 22 Table of Contents The Corporation anticipates investing $6.8 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures in 2012, substantially all of which is targeted for E&P operations. Consolidated Results of Operations The after tax income (loss) by major operating activity is summarized below for the years ended December 31: 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of dollars,except per share data) Exploration and Production $ 2,675 $ 2,736 $ 1,042 Marketing and Refining (584 ) (231 ) 127 Corporate (154 ) (159 ) (205 ) Interest expense (234 ) (221 ) (224 ) Net income attributable to Hess Corporation $ 1,703 $ 2,125 $ 740 Net income per share diluted $ 5.01 $ 6.47 $ 2.27 The following table summarizes, on an after tax basis, items of income (expense) that are included in net income and affect comparability between periods. The items in the table below are explained on pages 27 through 30. 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and Production $ 244 $ 732 $ 45 Marketing and Refining (525 ) (289 ) 12 Corporate (7 ) (60 ) $ (281 ) $ 436 $ (3 ) In the following discussion and elsewhere in this report, the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after tax basis. Management reviews segment earnings on an after tax basis and uses after tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings. Management believes that after tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre tax amount. After tax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre tax amounts. 23 Table of Contents Comparison of Results Exploration and Production Following is a summarized income statement of the Corporations E&P operations for the years ended December 31: 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of dollars) Sales and other operating revenues* $ 10,047 $ 8,744 $ 6,835 Other, net 464 1,233 207 Total revenues and non operating income 10,511 9,977 7,042 Costs and expenses Production expenses, including related taxes 2,352 1,924 1,805 Exploration expenses, including dry holes and lease impairment 1,195 865 829 General, administrative and other expenses 313 281 255 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 2,305 2,222 2,113 Asset impairments 358 532 54 Total costs and expenses 6,523 5,824 5,056 Results of operations before income taxes 3,988 4,153 1,986 Provision for income taxes 1,313 1,417 944 Results of operations attributable to Hess Corporation $ 2,675 $ 2,736 $ 1,042 * Amounts differ from E&P operating revenues in Note 19, Segment Information in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements primarily due to the exclusion of sales of hydrocarbons purchased from third parties. After considering the E&P items affecting comparability of earnings between periods in the table on page 27, the remaining changes in E&P earnings are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices, production and sales volumes, operating costs, exploration expenses, income taxes and foreign exchange, as discussed below. Selling Prices: Higher average selling prices increased E&P revenues by approximately $2,400 million in 2011 compared with 2010. Higher average selling prices increased E&P revenues by approximately $1,775 million in 2010 compared with 2009. The Corporations average selling prices were as follows for the years ended December 31: 2011 2010 2009 Crude oil per barrel (including hedging) United States $ 98.56 $ 75.02 $ 60.67 Europe 80.18 58.11 47.02 Africa 88.46 65.02 48.91 Asia 111.71 79.23 63.01 Worldwide 89.99 66.20 51.62 Crude oil per barrel (excluding hedging) United States $ 98.56 $ 75.02 $ 60.67 Europe 80.18 58.11 47.02 Africa 110.28 78.31 60.79 Asia 111.71 79.23 63.01 Worldwide 95.60 71.40 56.74 Natural gas liquids per barrel United States $ 58.59 $ 47.92 $ 36.57 Europe 75.49 59.23 43.23 Asia 72.29 63.50 46.48 Worldwide 62.72 50.49 38.47 24 Table of Contents 2011 2010 2009 Natural gas per mcf United States $ 3.39 $ 3.70 $ 3.36 Europe 8.79 6.23 5.15 Asia and other 6.02 5.93 5.06 Worldwide 5.96 5.63 4.85 In October 2008, the Corporation closed Brent crude oil hedges covering 24,000 barrels per day from 2009 through 2012 by entering into offsetting contracts with the same counterparty. The deferred after tax losses as of the date the hedge positions were closed are recorded in earnings as the contracts mature. Crude oil hedges reduced E&P earnings by $327 million ($517 million before income taxes) in 2011, $338 million ($533 million before income taxes) in 2010 and $337 million ($533 million before income taxes) in 2009. The remaining realized after tax losses from the closed hedge positions will be approximately $325 million in 2012. The Corporation also entered into Brent crude oil hedges using fixed price swap contracts to hedge 120,000 boepd of crude oil sales volumes for the full year of 2012 at an average price of $107.70 per barrel. Production and Sales Volumes: The Corporations crude oil and natural gas production was 370,000 boepd in 2011 compared with 418,000 boepd in 2010 and 408,000 boepd in 2009. The principal reasons for the reduction are described below. Approximately 72% in 2011, 73% in 2010 and 72% in 2009 of the Corporations production was from crude oil and natural gas liquids. The Corporation currently estimates that its 2012 production will average between 370,000 and 390,000 boepd, excluding the impact of asset sales and any Libyan production. The Corporations net daily worldwide production was as follows for the years ended December 31: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Crude oil barrels per day United States 81 75 60 Europe 89 88 83 Africa 66 113 120 Asia 13 13 16 Total 249 289 279 Natural gas liquids barrels per day United States 13 14 11 Europe 3 3 3 Asia 1 1 Total 17 18 14 Natural gas mcf per day United States 100 108 93 Europe 81 134 151 Asia and other 442 427 446 Total 623 669 690 Barrels of oil equivalent per day* 370 418 408 * Reflects natural gas production converted on the basis of relative energy content (six mcf equals one barrel). Barrel of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence as the equivalent price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis has been substantially lower than the corresponding price for crude oil over the recent past. See the average selling prices in the table above. 25 Table of Contents United States: Crude oil production in the United States was higher in 2011 compared with 2010, primarily due to new wells in the Bakken oil shale play, partly offset by lower production due to a shut in well at the Llano Field. Natural gas production was lower in 2011 compared with 2010, primarily due to this shut in well at the Llano Field. Crude oil and natural gas production was higher in 2010 compared with 2009, primarily due to new production from the Shenzi, Llano, Conger and Bakken fields. Europe: Crude oil production was comparable in 2011 and 2010, as higher production from Russia was largely offset by lower production from the Corporations United Kingdom North Sea assets. Crude oil production was higher in 2010 compared with 2009, due to higher production in Russia and in Norway following the acquisition of additional interests in the Valhall and Hod fields in 2010. Natural gas production was lower in 2011 compared with 2010, primarily due to the sale in February 2011 of certain natural gas producing assets in the United Kingdom North Sea. Natural gas production was lower in 2010 compared with 2009, primarily due to downtime at certain United Kingdom gas fields. Africa: Crude oil production decreased in 2011 compared with 2010 due to the suspension of production in Libya following civil unrest, the exchange in September 2010 of the Corporations interests in Gabon for increased interests in Norway, lower production entitlement in Equatorial Guinea and Algeria as a result of higher selling prices, and natural decline in Equatorial Guinea. Crude oil production decreased in 2010 compared with 2009 following the exchange of Gabon for additional interests in the Valhall and Hod fields in Norway and lower entitlement to Algerian production. Asia and other: Natural gas production in 2011 was higher than 2010, primarily due to higher total nominations at the Joint Development Area of Malaysia and Thailand (JDA) and the adjacent Block PM301 in Malaysia and first production from the Gajah Baru Complex at the Natuna A Field in Indonesia, which commenced production in the fourth quarter of 2011. Natural gas production in 2010 was lower than in 2009, primarily due to downtime at the Pangkah Field in Indonesia and a temporary shut in at the Bumi Field in the JDA. Sales Volumes: Lower sales volumes and other operating revenues decreased revenue by approximately $1,100 million in 2011 compared with 2010 and higher sales volumes and other operating revenues increased revenue by $135 million in 2010 compared with 2009. Operating Costs and Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization: Cash operating costs, consisting of production expenses and general and administrative expenses, increased by $460 million in 2011 compared with 2010 and increased by $145 million in 2010 compared with 2009. The increase in 2011 was primarily due to higher production taxes as a result of higher selling prices, together with higher operating and maintenance expenses, mainly in Norway and in the Bakken oil shale play. The increase in costs in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to higher production taxes as a result of higher selling prices. Depreciation, depletion and amortization charges increased by $83 million in 2011 and $109 million in 2010, compared with the corresponding amounts in prior years. The increases in both 2011 and 2010 were primarily due to higher per barrel costs, reflecting higher finding and development costs. In addition, the higher total per barrel costs in 2011 resulted from a greater proportion of production volumes from the Bakken. Excluding items affecting comparability between periods, cash operating costs per barrel of oil equivalent were $19.71 in 2011, $14.45 in 2010 and $13.70 in 2009. Depreciation, depletion and amortization costs per barrel of oil equivalent were $17.06 in 2011, $14.56 in 2010 and $14.19 in 2009. For 2012, cash operating costs are estimated to be in the range of $20.00 to $21.00 per barrel and depreciation, depletion and amortization costs are estimated to be in the range of $20.50 to $21.50 per barrel, resulting in total unit costs in the range of $40.50 to $42.50 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding Libyan operations. Exploration Expenses: Exploration expenses increased in 2011 compared to 2010, mainly due to higher dry hole expenses. Dry hole expenses included amounts relating to two exploration wells on the Semai V Block, offshore Indonesia and a well in the North Red Sea Block 1, offshore Egypt. Exploration expenses also increased in 2010 from 2009, primarily due to higher lease amortization. Income Taxes: Excluding the impact of items affecting comparability, the effective income tax rates for E&P operations were 38% in 2011, 44% in 2010 and 48% in 2009. The decrease in the effective income tax rate in 2011 compared with 2010 was predominantly due to the suspension of Libyan operations. The effective income tax rate for E&P operations in 2012 is estimated to be in the range of 36% to 40%, excluding Libyan operations. 26 Table of Contents Foreign Exchange: The after tax foreign currency losses were $16 million in 2011, $9 million in 2010 and $10 million in 2009. Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings: Reported E&P earnings include the following items affecting comparability of income (expense) before and after income taxes for the years ended December 31: Before Income Taxes After Income Taxes 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of dollars) Gains on asset sales $ 446 $ 1,208 $ $ 413 $ 1,130 $ Royalty dispute resolution 143 89 Asset impairments (358 ) (532 ) (54 ) (140 ) (334 ) (26 ) Dry hole expense (101 ) (64 ) Reductions in carrying values of assets (23 ) (18 ) Income tax adjustment (29 ) $ 88 $ 575 $ 66 $ 244 $ 732 $ 45 2011: In February 2011, the Corporation completed the sale of its interests in the Easington Catchment Area (Hess 30%), the Bacton Area (Hess 23%), the Everest Field (Hess 19%) and the Lomond Field (Hess 17%) in the United Kingdom North Sea for cash proceeds of $359 million, after post closing adjustments. These disposals resulted in pre tax gains totaling $343 million ($310 million after income taxes). These assets had a productive capacity of approximately 15,000 boepd. The total combined net book value of the disposed assets prior to the sale was $16 million, including allocated goodwill of $14 million. In August 2011, the Corporation completed the sale of its interests in the Snorre Field (Hess 1%), offshore Norway and the Cook Field (Hess 28%) in the United Kingdom North Sea for cash proceeds of $131 million, after post closing adjustments. These disposals resulted in non taxable gains totaling $103 million. The total combined net book value of the disposed assets prior to the sale was $28 million, including allocated goodwill of $11 million. In the third quarter of 2011, the Corporation recorded impairment charges of $358 million ($140 million after income taxes) related to increases in the Corporations estimated abandonment liabilities primarily for non producing properties which resulted in the book value of the properties exceeding their fair value. See Note 9, Asset Retirement Obligations in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In July 2011, the United Kingdom increased the supplementary tax rate on petroleum operations to 32% from 20% with an effective date of March 24, 2011. As a result, the Corporation recorded a charge of $29 million to increase the deferred tax liability in the United Kingdom. 2010: The Corporation completed the exchange of its interests in Gabon and the Clair Field in the United Kingdom for additional interests of 28% and 25%, respectively, in the Valhall and Hod fields in Norway. This non monetary transaction, which was recorded at fair value, resulted in a pre tax gain of $1,150 million ($1,072 million after income taxes). The Corporation also completed the sale of its interest in the Jambi Merang natural gas development project in Indonesia for a gain of $58 million. The Corporation recorded a charge of $532 million ($334 million after income taxes) to fully impair the carrying value of its 55% interest in the West Mediterranean Block 1 concession (West Med Block), located offshore Egypt. This interest was acquired in 2006 and included four natural gas discoveries and additional exploration prospects. The Corporation and its partners subsequently explored and further evaluated the area, made a fifth discovery, conducted development planning, and held negotiations with the Egyptian authorities to amend the existing gas sales agreement. In September 2010, the Corporation and its partners notified the Egyptian authorities of their decision to cease exploration activities and to relinquish a significant portion of the block. As a result, the Corporation fully impaired the carrying value of its interest in the West Med Block. The West Med Block was relinquished in 2011. The Corporation also recorded $101 million ($64 million after income taxes) of dry hole expenses related to previously suspended well costs on the West Med Block offshore Egypt and Block BM S 22 offshore Brazil, both of which were drilled prior to 2010. 27 Table of Contents 2009: The U.S. Supreme Court decided it would not review the decision of the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals against the U.S. Minerals Management Service (predecessor to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement) relating to royalty relief under the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995. As a result, the Corporation recognized after tax income of $89 million to reverse all previously recorded royalties covering the periods from 2003 to 2009. The pre tax amount of $143 million was reported in Other, net in the Statement of Consolidated Income. The Corporation recorded total asset impairment charges of $54 million ($26 million after income taxes) to reduce the carrying value of two short lived fields in the United Kingdom North Sea. Pre tax charges of approximately $23 million ($18 million after income taxes) were recorded to impair the carrying values of production equipment and to write down materials inventories in Equatorial Guinea and the United States. The pre tax amount of most of the inventory write downs was reported in Production expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income. The Corporations future E&P earnings may be impacted by external factors, such as volatility in the selling prices of crude oil and natural gas, reserve and production changes, exploration expenses, industry cost inflation, changes in foreign exchange rates and income tax rates, the effects of weather, political risk, environmental risk and catastrophic risk. In addition, as a result of the oil spill in 2010 at the BP p.l.c. operated Macondo prospect in the Gulf of Mexico, there have been and there may be further changes in laws and regulations that could impact the Corporations future drilling operations and increase its potential liability in the event of an oil spill. For a more comprehensive description of the risks that may affect the Corporations E&P business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations. Marketing and Refining Results from M&R activities were losses of $584 million in 2011, losses of $231 million in 2010 and earnings of $127 million in 2009. Excluding the items affecting comparability reflected in the table on page 23 and discussed below, results were losses of $59 million in 2011 and earnings of $58 million in 2010 and $115 million in 2009. Refining: Refining results consist of the Corporations share of HOVENSAs losses, together with the results of Port Reading and other miscellaneous operating activities. Refining losses were $728 million in 2011 (including $525 million of after tax losses related to the impairment recorded by HOVENSA and other charges due to the decision to shut down the refinery in St. Croix), $445 million in 2010 (including a $289 million after tax charge to reduce the carrying value of the Corporations equity investment in HOVENSA) and $87 million in 2009 (including a benefit of $12 million due to an income tax adjustment). In 2011, HOVENSA experienced continued substantial operating losses due to global economic conditions and competitive disadvantages versus other refiners, despite efforts to improve operating performance by reducing refining capacity to 350,000 from 500,000 barrels per day in the first half of the year. Operating losses were also projected to continue. In January 2012, HOVENSA announced a decision to shut down its refinery and operate the complex as an oil storage terminal. As a result of these developments, HOVENSA prepared an impairment analysis as of December 31, 2011, which concluded that undiscounted future cash flows would not recover the carrying value of its long lived assets, and recorded an impairment charge and other charges related to the decision to shut down the refinery. For 2011, the Corporation recorded a total of $1,073 million of losses from its equity investment in HOVENSA. These pre tax losses included $875 million ($525 million after income taxes) due to the impairment recorded by HOVENSA and other charges associated with its decision to shut down the refinery. The Corporations share of the impairment related losses recorded by HOVENSA represents an amount equivalent to the Corporations financial support to HOVENSA at December 31, 2011, its planned future funding commitments for costs related to the refinery shutdown, and a charge of $135 million for the write off of related assets held by the subsidiary which owns the Corporations investment in HOVENSA. At December 31, 2011, the Corporation has a liability of $487 million for its planned funding commitments, which is expected to be incurred in 2012. A deferred income tax benefit of $350 million, consisting primarily of U.S. income taxes, has been recorded on the Corporations share of HOVENSAs impairment and refinery shutdown related charges. 28 Table of Contents In December 2010, the Corporation recorded an impairment charge of $300 million before income taxes ($289 million after income taxes) to reduce the carrying value of its equity investment in HOVENSA, which was recorded in Income (loss) from equity investment in HOVENSA L.L.C., on the Statement of Consolidated Income. The investment had been adversely affected by consecutive annual operating losses resulting from continued weak refining margins and refinery utilization, and a fourth quarter 2010 debt rating downgrade. As a result of a strategic assessment in 2010, HOVENSA decided to lower its crude oil refining capacity to 350,000 from 500,000 barrels per day in 2011. The Corporation performed an impairment analysis and concluded that its investment had experienced an other than temporary decline in value. For discussion of the impairment charge, see Note 5, HOVENSA L.L.C. Joint Venture in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Excluding items affecting comparability discussed above, the Corporations share of HOVENSAs results was a loss of $198 million in 2011, $137 million in 2010 ($222 million before income taxes) and $141 million ($230 million before income taxes) in 2009. U.S. Virgin Island income taxes have not been recorded on the Corporations share of HOVENSAs 2011 results due to cumulative operating losses. These results reflect lower refining margins, higher fuel costs and lower sales volumes. During 2010, the fluid catalytic cracking unit at HOVENSA was shut down for a scheduled turnaround. The Corporations share of HOVENSAs turnaround expenses was approximately $20 million after income taxes. Other after tax refining results, principally from Port Reading operations, were a loss of $5 million in 2011, a loss of $19 million in 2010 and income of $42 million in 2009. During 2010, the Port Reading refining facility was shut down for 41 days for a scheduled turnaround. The after tax expenses for the Port Reading turnaround were approximately $30 million. The turnaround expenses are included in Other operating expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income. The following table summarizes refinery utilization rates for the years ended December 31: RefineryCapacity Refinery Utilization (Thousands ofbarrels per day) 2011 2010 2009 HOVENSA Crude 350* 81.1 % 78.0 % 80.3 % Fluid catalytic cracker 150 71.7 % 66.5 % 70.2 % Coker 58 77.4 % 78.3 % 81.6 % Port Reading 70 90.0 % 78.1 % 90.2 % * HOVENSAs crude oil refining capacity was reduced to 350,000 from 500,000 barrels per day in the first half of 2011. Marketing: Marketing operations, which consist principally of retail gasoline and energy marketing activities, generated income of $185 million in 2011, $215 million in 2010 and $168 million in 2009. The decrease in earnings in 2011 compared with 2010 was due to lower sales volumes and lower margins. The increase in earnings in 2010 compared with 2009 reflected improved margins from the weak economic environment in 2009. The table below summarizes marketing sales volumes for the years ended December 31: 2011 2010 2009 Refined petroleum product sales (thousands of barrels per day) 430 471 473 Natural gas (thousands of mcf per day) 2,167 2,016 2,010 Electricity (megawatts round the clock) 4,374 4,140 4,306 The Corporation has a 50% voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades energy commodities and energy derivatives. The Corporation also takes trading positions for its own account. The Corporations after tax results from trading activities, including its share of the results of the trading partnership, amounted to a loss of $41 million in 2011, a loss of $1 million in 2010 and earnings of $46 million in 2009. Marketing expenses increased in 2011 compared with 2010 reflecting higher retail credit card fees, maintenance, environmental and employee related expenses. Marketing expenses increased in 2010 compared with 2009, principally reflecting changes in retail credit card fees. 29 Table of Contents The Corporations future M&R earnings may be impacted by supply and demand factors, volatility in margins, credit risks, the effects of weather, competitive industry conditions, political risk, environmental risk and catastrophic risk. For a more comprehensive description of the risks that may affect the Corporations M&R business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations. Corporate The following table summarizes corporate expenses for the years ended December 31: 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of dollars) Corporate expenses (excluding items affecting comparability) $ 260 $ 256 $ 227 Income taxes (benefits) (106 ) (104 ) (82 ) Net corporate expenses 154 152 145 Items affecting comparability between periods, after tax 7 60 Total corporate expenses, after tax $ 154 $ 159 $ 205 Excluding items affecting comparability between periods, net corporate expenses were comparable in 2011 and 2010. The increase in net corporate expenses in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily reflects higher employee and insurance costs and bank facility fees. After tax corporate expenses in 2012 are estimated to be in the range of $160 million to $170 million. In 2010, the Corporation recorded a pre tax charge of $11 million ($7 million after income taxes) related to the repurchase of the remaining $116 million of fixed rate public notes that were scheduled to mature in 2011. In 2009, the Corporation recorded pre tax charges of $54 million ($34 million after income taxes) related to the repurchase of $546 million in fixed rate public notes that were scheduled to mature in 2011 and $42 million ($26 million after income taxes) relating to retirement benefits and employee severance costs. The pre tax charges in connection with the debt repurchases were recorded in Other, net, and the pre tax amounts of the retirement benefits and severance costs were recorded in General and administrative expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income. Interest Interest expense was as follows for the years ended December 31: 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of dollars) Total interest incurred $ 396 $ 366 $ 366 Capitalized interest (13 ) (5 ) (6 ) Interest expense before income taxes 383 361 360 Income taxes (benefits) (149 ) (140 ) (136 ) After tax interest expense $ 234 $ 221 $ 224 The increase in interest expense in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily reflects higher average borrowings following the issuance of $1.25 billion of 30 year fixed rate public notes in August 2010. Capitalized interest increased in 2011 due to the sanctioning of the Tubular Bells project. Interest expense was comparable in 2010 and 2009. After tax interest expense in 2012 is expected to be in the range of $245 million to $255 million. Consolidated Sales and Cost of Products Sold Sales and other operating revenues totaled $38,466 million in 2011, $33,862 million in 2010 and $29,614 million in 2009. The increase in Sales and other operating revenues of 14% year on year from 2009 to 2011 is primarily due to higher crude oil and refined petroleum product selling prices, partially offset by lower crude oil and refined petroleum product sales volumes. 30 Table of Contents The increase in Cost of products sold each year principally reflects higher prices for purchased refined petroleum products. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table sets forth certain relevant measures of the Corporations liquidity and capital resources at December 31: 2011 2010 (Millions of dollars) Cash and cash equivalents $ 351 $ 1,608 Short term debt and current maturities of long term debt $ 52 $ 46 Total debt $ 6,057 $ 5,583 Total equity $ 18,592 $ 16,809 Debt to capitalization ratio* 24.6 % 24.9 % * Total debt as a percentage of the sum of total debt plus equity. Cash Flows The following table sets forth a summary of the Corporations cash flows for the years ended December 31: 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of dollars) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 4,984 $ 4,530 $ 3,046 Investing activities (6,566 ) (5,259 ) (2,924 ) Financing activities 325 975 332 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (1,257 ) $ 246 $ 454 Operating Activities: Net cash provided by operating activities amounted to $4,984 million in 2011 compared with $4,530 million in 2010, reflecting higher operating earnings partially offset by a period over period increase in the use of cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $412 million. Operating cash flow increased to $4,530 million in 2010 from $3,046 million in 2009 principally reflecting higher earnings. Investing Activities: The following table summarizes the Corporations capital expenditures for the years ended December 31: 2011 2010 2009 (Millions of dollars) Exploration and Production Exploration $ 869 $ 552 $ 611 Production and development 4,673 2,592 1,927 Acquisitions (including leaseholds) 1,346 2,250 262 6,888 5,394 2,800 Marketing, Refining and Corporate 118 98 118 Total $ 7,006 $ 5,492 $ 2,918 Capital expenditures in 2011 included acquisitions of approximately $800 million for 185,000 net acres in the Utica Shale play in eastern Ohio, $214 million for interests in two blocks in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq and $116 million for an additional 4% interest in the South Arne Field in Denmark. Capital expenditures in 2010 included acquisitions of 167,000 net acres in the Bakken oil shale play in North Dakota from TRZ Energy, LLC for $1,075 million in cash and additional interests of 8% and 13% in the Valhall and Hod fields, respectively, for $507 million in cash. Capital expenditures in 2009 included acquisitions of $188 million for unproved leaseholds and $74 million for a 50% interest in blocks PM301 and PM302 in Malaysia, which are adjacent to Block A 18 of the JDA. In addition, proceeds from asset sales were $490 million in 2011 and $183 million in 2010. 31 Table of Contents Financing Activities: During 2011, net proceeds from borrowings on available credit facilities were $422 million. During 2010, net proceeds from borrowings were $1,098 million, including the August 2010 issuance of $1,250 million of 30 year fixed rate public notes with a coupon of 5.6% scheduled to mature in 2041. The proceeds were used to purchase additional acreage in the Bakken and additional interests in the Valhall and Hod fields. In January 2010, the Corporation completed the repurchase of the remaining $116 million of fixed rate public notes that were scheduled to mature in 2011. Total common stock dividends paid were $136 million in 2011 and $131 million in 2010 and 2009. The Corporation received net proceeds from the exercise of stock options, including related income tax benefits of $88 million, $54 million and $18 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Future Capital Requirements and Resources The Corporation anticipates investing a total of approximately $6.8 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures during 2012, substantially all of which is targeted for E&P operations. The Corporation expects to fund its 2012 operations, including capital expenditures, its share of HOVENSA financial support totaling $487 million, dividends, pension contributions and required debt repayments, with existing cash on hand, cash flows from operations including the effect of hedging, proceeds from asset sales and its available credit facilities. Crude oil and natural gas prices are volatile and difficult to predict. In addition, unplanned increases in the Corporations capital expenditure program could occur. If conditions were to change, such as a significant decrease in commodity prices or an unexpected increase in capital expenditures, the Corporation would take steps to protect its financial flexibility and may pursue other sources of liquidity, including the issuance of debt securities, the issuance of equity securities, and or asset sales. The table below summarizes the capacity, usage, and available capacity of the Corporations borrowing and letter of credit facilities at December 31, 2011: ExpirationDate Capacity Borrowings Letters ofCredit Issued Total Used AvailableCapacity (Millions of dollars) Revolving credit facility April 2016 $ 4,000 $ $ 173 $ 173 $ 3,827 Asset backed credit facility July 2012 (a) 525 350 350 175 Committed lines Various (b) 2,675 1,063 1,063 1,612 Uncommitted lines Various (b) 562 100 462 562 Total $ 7,762 $ 450 $ 1,698 $ 2,148 $ 5,614 (a) Total capacity of $1 billion subject to the amount of eligible receivables posted as collateral. (b) Committed and uncommitted lines have expiration dates through 2014. In April 2011, the Corporation entered into a new $4 billion syndicated revolving credit facility that matures in April 2016. This facility, which replaced a $3 billion facility that was scheduled to mature in May 2012, can be used for borrowings and letters of credit. Borrowings on the facility bear interest at 1.25% above the London Interbank Offered Rate. A facility fee of 0.25% per annum is also payable on the amount of the facility. The interest rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment if the Corporations credit rating changes. The covenants that establish restrictions on the amount of total borrowings and secured debt are consistent with the previous facility. The Corporation has a 364 day asset backed credit facility securitized by certain accounts receivable from its Marketing and Refining operations. Under the terms of this financing arrangement, the Corporation has the ability to borrow or issue letters of credit of up to $1 billion subject to the availability of sufficient levels of eligible receivables. At December 31, 2011, outstanding borrowings under this facility of $350 million were collateralized by a total of $947 million of accounts receivable, which are held by a wholly owned subsidiary. These receivables are only available to pay the general obligations of the Corporation after satisfaction of the outstanding obligations under the asset backed facility. The Corporation also has a shelf registration statement filed with the SEC under which it may issue additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or preferred stock. Promptly after filing this report, as a result 32 Table of Contents of the Corporations existing shelf registration expiring on February 26, 2012, the Corporation anticipates filing a new shelf registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, under which it may issue, among other things, additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or preferred stock. The Corporations long term debt agreements contain a financial covenant that restricts the amount of total borrowings and secured debt. At December 31, 2011, the Corporation is permitted to borrow up to an additional $24.9 billion for the construction or acquisition of assets. The Corporation has the ability to borrow up to an additional $4.5 billion of secured debt at December 31, 2011. The Corporations $1.7 billion in letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2011 were primarily issued to satisfy margin requirements. See also Note 17, Risk Management and Trading Activities in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Credit Ratings There are three major credit rating agencies that rate the Corporations debt. All three agencies have currently assigned an investment grade rating with a stable outlook to the Corporations debt. The interest rates and facility fees charged on some of the Corporations credit facilities, as well as margin requirements from risk management and trading counterparties, are subject to adjustment if the Corporations credit rating changes. Contractual Obligations and Contingencies Following is a table showing aggregated information about certain contractual obligations at December 31, 2011: Payments Due by Period Total 2012 2013 and2014 2015 and2016 Thereafter (Millions of dollars) Total debt* $ 6,057 $ 52 $ 386 $ 459 $ 5,160 Operating leases 3,210 531 1,195 320 1,164 Purchase obligations Supply commitments 8,131 7,187 782 149 13 Capital expenditures and other investments 3,045 1,640 873 257 275 Operating expenses 3,039 1,637 829 204 369 Other long term liabilities 3,327 290 556 463 2,018 * At December 31, 2011, the Corporations debt bears interest at a weighted average rate of 6.8%. Supply commitments include term purchase agreements at market prices for a portion of the gasoline necessary to supply the Corporations retail marketing system and feedstocks for the Port Reading refining facility. In addition, the Corporation has commitments to purchase refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity to supply contracted customers in its energy marketing business. These commitments were computed based predominately on year end market prices. The table also reflects future capital expenditures, including the portion of the Corporations planned $6.8 billion capital investment program for 2012 that was contractually committed at December 31, 2011. Obligations for operating expenses include commitments for transportation, seismic purchases, oil and gas production expenses and other normal business expenses. Other long term liabilities reflect contractually committed obligations in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2011, including asset retirement obligations, pension plan liabilities and estimates for uncertain income tax positions. During 2011, the Corporation entered into a lease agreement for a floating production system and related support activities for the Tubular Bells Field. Payments under this five year contract, which total approximately $420 million and are expected to commence by mid 2014, are included in Capital expenditures and other investments in the contractual obligations table above. The Corporation also has a tolling agreement with Bayonne Energy Center, LLC (BEC) (Hess 50%), a joint venture formed to generate electricity for sale into the 33 Table of Contents New York City market. Under the tolling arrangement, the Corporation will pay its share of a predetermined monthly amount to BEC following the start up of plant operations, which is expected in mid 2012. Estimated payments through 2027, which total approximately $415 million, are included in Operating expenses in the contractual obligations table. The Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries lease gasoline stations, drilling rigs, tankers, office space and other assets for varying periods under leases accounted for as operating leases. The Corporation has a contingent purchase obligation to acquire the remaining interest in WilcoHess, a retail gasoline station joint venture. This contingent obligation, which expires in April 2014, was approximately $205 million at December 31, 2011. The Corporation is contingently liable under letters of credit and under guarantees of the debt of other entities directly related to its business at December 31, 2011 as shown below (in millions of dollars): Letters of credit $ 67 Guarantees 15 $ 82 Off balance Sheet Arrangements The Corporation has leveraged leases not included in its Consolidated Balance Sheet, primarily related to retail gasoline stations that the Corporation operates. The net present value of these leases is $388 million at December 31, 2011 compared with $394 million at December 31, 2010. If these leases were included as debt, the Corporations December 31, 2011 debt to capitalization ratio would increase to 25.7% from 24.6%. See also Note 18, Guarantees and Contingencies in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Foreign Operations The Corporation conducts exploration and production activities outside the United States, principally in Algeria, Australia, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Brunei, China, Denmark, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, France, Ghana, Indonesia, the Kurdistan region of Iraq, Libya, Malaysia, Norway, Peru, Russia, Thailand and the United Kingdom. Therefore, the Corporation is subject to the risks associated with foreign operations, including political risk, tax law changes and currency risk. See also Item 1A. Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations. Accounting Policies Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities in the Corporations Consolidated Balance Sheet and revenues and expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income. The accounting methods used can affect net income, equity and various financial statement ratios. However, the Corporations accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity. Accounting for Exploration and Development Costs: Exploration and production activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses, brokers fees and other related costs, are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are capitalized. In production operations, costs of injected CO2 for tertiary recovery are expensed as incurred. The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found. Exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and 34 Table of Contents (2) sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project. If either of those criteria is not met, or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the capitalized well costs are charged to expense. Indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include: commitment of project personnel, active negotiations for sales contracts with customers, negotiations with governments, operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors. Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves: The SEC revised its oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements effective for year end 2009 reporting. In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) revised its accounting standard on oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosures. The determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities. The estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations, the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment, as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill. For reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. In addition, government and project operator approvals must be obtained and, depending on the amount of the project cost, senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project. The Corporation maintains its own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties. The Corporations technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells, performance reviews, new technical data and other studies. To provide consistency throughout the Corporation, standard reserve estimation guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and approval practices are used. The internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management review. The Corporation also engages an independent third party consulting firm to audit approximately 80% of the Corporations total proved reserves. Impairment of Long lived Assets and Goodwill: As explained below, there are significant differences in the way long lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing. The Corporation reviews long lived assets, including oil and gas fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered. Long lived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying amounts of the long lived assets are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted future net cash flow estimates, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows. In the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future net cash flows is based on managements best estimate of future prices, which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices, applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a risk adjusted rate. The projected production volumes represent reserves, including probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures. The production volumes, prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information. Oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve month average prices. The Corporations impairment tests of long lived E&P producing assets are based on its best estimates of future production volumes (including recovery factors), selling prices, operating and capital costs, the timing of future production and other factors, which are updated each time an impairment test is performed. The Corporation could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease, crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly. The Corporations goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable. The goodwill test is conducted at a reporting unit level, which is defined in accounting standards as an operating segment or one level 35 Table of Contents below an operating segment. The reporting unit or units to be used in an evaluation and measurement of goodwill for impairment testing are determined from a number of factors, including the manner in which the business is managed. The Corporation has concluded that the E&P segment is the reporting unit for the purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, since the E&P segment is managed globally by one segment manager who allocates financial and technical resources globally and reviews operating results at the segment level. Accordingly, the Corporation expects that the benefits of goodwill will be recovered through the operations of that segment. If any of the E&P segment components, such as our financial reporting regions (United States, Europe, Africa and Asia) were considered to be reporting units, an analysis would be performed to determine if these components were economically similar as defined in the accounting standard for goodwill (ASC 350 20 35). If components are economically similar, that guidance requires that those components be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit. While the Corporation believes that the E&P segment is the reporting unit because of the manner in which the business is managed, it also evaluated the required aggregation criteria specified in the accounting standard for segment reporting (ASC 280 10 50 11) and determined that its components are economically similar for the following reasons: The Corporation operates its exploration and production segment as a single, global business. Each component produces oil and gas. The exploration and production processes are similar in each component. The methods used by each component to market and distribute oil and gas are similar. Customers of each component are similar. The components share technical resources and support services. If the Corporation reorganized its exploration and production business such that there was more than one reporting unit, goodwill may be assigned to two or more reporting units. The Corporations fair value estimate of the E&P segment is the sum of: (1) the discounted anticipated cash flows of producing assets and known developments, (2) the estimated risk adjusted present value of exploration assets, and (3) an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential synergies including cost savings, access to new business opportunities, enterprise control, improved processes and increased market share. The Corporation also considers the relative market valuation of similar E&P companies. The determination of the fair value of the E&P segment depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves, future prices, timing of future net cash flows and market premiums. Significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of the E&P segment that could result in an impairment of goodwill. As there are significant differences in the way long lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing, there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned to the E&P segment. Impairment of Equity Investees: The Corporation reviews equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than temporary decline in value may have occurred. The fair value measurement used in the impairment assessment is based on quoted market prices, where available, or other valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows. Differences between the carrying value of the Corporations equity investments and its equity in the net assets of the affiliate that result from impairment charges are amortized over the remaining useful life of the affiliates fixed assets. Income Taxes: Judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements. These judgments include the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when management believes that it is more likely than not, that based on the technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. The Corporation has net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in several jurisdictions, including the United States, and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits. Additionally, the Corporation has deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain 36 Table of Contents assets and liabilities. Regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized. If it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized. In evaluating realizability of deferred tax assets, the Corporation refers to the reversal periods for available carryforward periods for net operating losses and credit carryforwards, temporary differences, the availability of tax planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets and estimates of future taxable income and other factors. Estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the Corporations internal business forecasts. Additionally, the Corporation has income taxes which have been deferred on intercompany transactions eliminated in consolidation related to transfers of property, plant and equipment remaining within the consolidated group. The amortization of these income taxes deferred on intercompany transactions will occur ratably with the recovery through depletion and depreciation of the carrying value of these assets. The Corporation does not provide for deferred U.S. income taxes for that portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Fair Value Measurements: The Corporations derivative instruments and supplemental pension plan investments are recorded at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period as appropriate. The Corporation uses various valuation approaches in determining fair value, including the market and income approaches. The Corporations fair value measurements also include non performance risk and time value of money considerations. Counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances, and the Corporations credit is considered for accrued liabilities. The Corporation also records certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by generally accepted accounting principles. These fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations, the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of long lived assets, equity method investments or goodwill. The Corporation determines fair value in accordance with the FASB fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the input, which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market (Level 1) to estimates determined using related market data (Level 3). Multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value, however, the level of fair value is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy. Details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values are as follows: Fair value measurements based on Level 1 inputs: Measurements that are most observable are based on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained from the principal markets in which they are traded. Closing prices are both readily available and representative of fair value. Market transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to assure liquidity. The fair value of certain of the Corporations exchange traded futures and options are considered Level 1. Fair value measurements based on Level 2 inputs: Measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered Level 2. Measurements based on Level 2 inputs include over the counter derivative instruments that are priced on an exchange traded curve but have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange traded contracts. The Corporation utilizes fair value measurements based on Level 2 inputs for certain forwards, swaps and options. The liability related to the Corporations crude oil hedges is classified as Level 2. Fair value measurements based on Level 3 inputs: Measurements that are least observable are estimated from related market data determined from sources with little or no market activity for comparable contracts or are positions with longer durations. For example, in its energy marketing business, the Corporation sells natural gas and electricity to customers and offsets the price exposure by purchasing forward contracts. The fair value of these sales and purchases may be based on specific prices at less liquid delivered locations, which are classified as Level 3. Fair values determined using discounted cash flows and other unobservable data are also classified as Level 3. Derivatives: The Corporation utilizes derivative instruments for both risk management and trading activities. In risk management activities, the Corporation uses futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil, natural gas, refined petroleum 37 Table of Contents products and electricity, as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. In trading activities, the Corporation, principally through a consolidated partnership, trades energy related commodities and derivatives, including futures, forwards, options and swaps, based on expectations of future market conditions. All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the Corporations Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Corporations policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative. The changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges) or hedges of firm commitments (fair value hedges). The effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings. The change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives that are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges are tested for effectiveness prospectively before they are executed and both prospectively and retrospectively on an on going basis to determine whether they continue to qualify for hedge accounting. The prospective and retrospective effectiveness calculations are performed using either historical simulation or other statistical models, which utilize historical observable market data consisting of futures curves and spot prices. Retirement Plans: The Corporation has funded non contributory defined benefit pension plans and an unfunded supplemental pension plan. The Corporation recognizes in the Consolidated Balance Sheet the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans. The determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations; expected long term rates of return on plan assets; and rate of future increases in compensation levels. These assumptions represent estimates made by the Corporation, some of which can be affected by external factors. For example, the discount rate used to estimate the Corporations projected benefit obligation is based on a portfolio of high quality, fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations, while the expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category, weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category. Changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on the amounts reported in the Corporations financial statements. Asset Retirement Obligations: The Corporation has material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain exploration and production locations. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the Corporation recognizes a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations. In addition, the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligations is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated. The Corporation capitalizes such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred. In order to measure these obligations, the Corporation estimates the fair value of the obligations by discounting the future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations. In determining these estimates, the Corporation is required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement, timing of settlement, interpretation of legal requirements, inflationary factors and discount rate. In addition, there are other external factors which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements, fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates and advances in technology. As a result, the Corporations estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above. Changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values. 38 Table of Contents Environment, Health and Safety The Corporation has a values based, socially responsible strategy focused on improving environment, health and safety performance and making a positive impact on communities where it does business. The strategy is reflected in the Corporations environment, health, safety and social responsibility (EHS & SR) policies and by environment and safety management systems that help protect the Corporations workforce, customers and local communities. The Corporations management systems are designed to uphold or exceed international standards and are intended to promote internal consistency, adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in EHS & SR performance. Improved performance may, in the short term, increase the Corporations operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to assets, reputation and license to operate. In addition to enhanced EHS & SR performance, improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be realized as collateral benefits from investments in EHS & SR. The Corporation has programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance, audit facilities, train employees, prevent and manage risks and emergencies and to generally meet corporate EHS & SR goals. Over the last several years, many refineries have entered into consent agreements to resolve the United States Environmental Protection Agencys (EPA) assertions that refining facilities were modified or expanded without complying with the New Source Review regulations that require permits and new emission controls in certain circumstances and other regulations that impose emissions control requirements. In January 2011, HOVENSA signed a consent decree with the EPA to resolve its claims. Under the terms of the Consent Decree, HOVENSA agreed to pay a penalty of approximately $5 million and spend approximately $700 million over the next 10 years to install equipment and implement additional operating procedures at the HOVENSA refinery to reduce emissions. In addition, the Consent Decree requires HOVENSA to spend approximately $5 million to fund an environmental project to be determined at a later date by the Virgin Islands and $500,000 to assist the Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority with monitoring. However, as a result of HOVENSAs decision to shut down its refinery, which was announced in January 2012, HOVENSA believes that it will not be required to make material capital expenditures pursuant to this consent decree. The Corporation believes that it will also enter into a consent decree with the EPA in the near future to resolve these matters as they relate to its Port Reading refinery facility, which is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of the Corporation. The Corporation produces and distributes fuel oils in the United States. Many states and localities are adopting requirements that mandate a lower sulfur content of fuel oils and restrict the types of fuel oil sold within their jurisdictions. These proposals could require capital expenditures by the Corporation for its Port Reading refining facility to meet the required sulfur content standards or other changes in the marketing of fuel oils and affect the profitability of that facility. The Corporation has undertaken a program to assess, monitor and reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane. The Corporation recognizes that climate change is a global environmental concern. The Corporation is committed to the responsible management of greenhouse gas emissions from our existing assets and future developments and is implementing a strategy to control our carbon emissions. The Corporation will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation. Sites where corrective action may be necessary include gasoline stations, terminals, onshore exploration and production facilities, refineries (including solid waste management units under permits issued pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act) and, although not currently significant, Superfund sites where the Corporation has been named a potentially responsible party. The Corporation accrues for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable. At year end 2011, the Corporations reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately $60 million. The Corporation expects that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites. The Corporations remediation spending was $19 million in 2011, $13 million in 2010 and $11 million in 2009. Capital expenditures for facilities, primarily to comply with federal, state and local environmental standards, other than for the low sulfur requirements, were approximately $95 million in 2011, $85 million in 2010 and $50 million in 2009. 39 Table of Contents Forward looking Information Certain sections of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, including Business and Properties, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, include references to the Corporations future results of operations and financial position, liquidity and capital resources, capital expenditures, oil and gas production, tax rates, debt repayment, hedging, derivative, market risk and environmental disclosures, off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations and contingencies, which include forward looking information. These sections typically include statements with words such as anticipate, estimate, expect, forecast, guidance, could, may, should, would or similar words, indicating that future outcomes are uncertain. Forward looking disclosures are based on the Corporations current understanding and assessment of these activities and reasonable assumptions about the future. Actual results may differ from these disclosures because of changes in market conditions, government actions and other factors. For more information regarding the factors that may cause the Corporations results to differ from these statements, see Item 1A. Risk Factors Related to Our Business and Operations. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk In the normal course of its business, the Corporation is exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the price of crude oil, natural gas, refined petroleum products and electricity, as well as to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values. In the disclosures that follow, risk management activities are referred to as energy marketing and corporate risk management activities. The Corporation also has trading operations, principally through a 50% voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades energy related commodities, securities and derivatives. These activities are also exposed to commodity risks primarily related to the prices of crude oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products. The following describes how these risks are controlled and managed. Controls: The Corporation maintains a control environment under the direction of its chief risk officer and through its corporate risk policy, which the Corporations senior management has approved. Controls include volumetric, term and value at risk limits. The chief risk officer must approve the use of new instruments or commodities. Risk limits are monitored and are reported on a daily basis to business units and to senior management. The Corporations risk management department also performs independent verifications of sources of fair values and validations of valuation models. These controls apply to all of the Corporations risk management and trading activities, including the consolidated trading partnership. The Corporations treasury department is responsible for administering and monitoring foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs. The Corporation uses value at risk to monitor and control commodity risk within its risk management and trading activities. The value at risk model uses historical simulation and the results represent the potential loss in fair value over one day at a 95% confidence level. The model captures both first and second order sensitivities for options. Results may vary from time to time as strategies change in trading activities or hedging levels change in risk management activities. Instruments: The Corporation primarily uses forward commodity contracts, foreign exchange forward contracts, futures, swaps, options and energy commodity based securities in its risk management and trading activities. These contracts are generally widely traded instruments with standardized terms. The following describes these instruments and how the Corporation uses them: Forward Commodity Contracts: The Corporation enters into contracts for the forward purchase and sale of commodities. At settlement date, the notional value of the contract is exchanged for physical delivery of the commodity. Forward contracts that are deemed normal purchase and sale contracts are excluded from the quantitative market risk disclosures. Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts: The Corporation enters into forward contracts primarily for the British Pound and the Thai Baht, which commit the Corporation to buy or sell a fixed amount of these currencies at a predetermined exchange rate on a future date. Exchange Traded Contracts: The Corporation uses exchange traded contracts, including futures, on a number of different underlying energy commodities. These contracts are settled daily with the relevant exchange and may be subject to exchange position limits. 40 Table of Contents Swaps: The Corporation uses financially settled swap contracts with third parties as part of its risk management and trading activities. Cash flows from swap contracts are determined based on underlying commodity prices or interest rates and are typically settled over the life of the contract. Options: Options on various underlying energy commodities include exchange traded and third party contracts and have various exercise periods. As a seller of options, the Corporation receives a premium at the outset and bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the commodity underlying the option. As a purchaser of options, the Corporation pays a premium at the outset and has the right to participate in the favorable price movements in the underlying commodities. Energy Securities: Energy securities include energy related equity or debt securities issued by a company or government or related derivatives on these securities. Risk Management Activities Energy marketing activities: In its energy marketing activities, the Corporation sells refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity principally to commercial and industrial businesses at fixed and floating prices for varying periods of time. Commodity contracts such as futures, forwards, swaps and options together with physical assets, such as storage, are used to obtain supply and reduce margin volatility or lower costs related to sales contracts with customers. Corporate risk management: Corporate risk management activities include transactions designed to reduce risk in the selling prices of crude oil, refined petroleum products or natural gas produced by the Corporation or to reduce exposure to foreign currency or interest rate movements. Generally, futures, swaps or option strategies may be used to reduce risk in the selling price of a portion of the Corporations crude oil or natural gas production. Forward contracts may also be used to purchase certain currencies in which the Corporation does business with the intent of reducing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Interest rate swaps may also be used, generally to convert fixed rate interest payments to floating. The Corporation has outstanding foreign exchange contracts used to reduce its exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates for various currencies, including the British Pound and the Thai Baht. At December 31, 2011, the Corporation had a payable for foreign exchange contracts maturing in 2012 with a fair value of $14 million. The change in fair value of the foreign exchange contracts from a 10% strengthening of the U.S. Dollar exchange rate is estimated to be a loss of approximately $89 million at December 31, 2011. The Corporations outstanding long term debt of $6,040 million has a fair value of $7,317 million at December 31, 2011. A 15% decrease in the rate of interest would increase the fair value of debt by approximately $247 million at December 31, 2011. Following is the value at risk for the Corporations energy marketing and risk management commodity derivatives activities, excluding foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives described above: 2011 2010 (Millions of dollars) At December 31 $ 94 $ 5 Average 30 5 High 94 6 Low 8 4 The increase in the value at risk for the Corporations energy marketing and risk management commodity derivatives activities in 2011 primarily reflects additional Brent crude oil cash flow hedge positions as described in Note 17, Risk Management and Trading Activities in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Trading Activities Trading activities are conducted principally through a trading partnership in which the Corporation has a 50% voting interest. This consolidated entity intends to generate earnings through various strategies primarily using energy commodities, securities and derivatives. The Corporation also takes trading positions for its own account. 41 Table of Contents Following is the value at risk for the Corporations trading activities: 2011 2010 (Millions of dollars) At December 31 $ 4 $ 14 Average 11 14 High 16 15 Low 4 12 The information that follows represents 100% of the trading partnership and the Corporations proprietary trading accounts. Derivative trading transactions are marked to market and unrealized gains or losses are recognized currently in earnings. Gains or losses from sales of physical products are recorded at the time of sale. Net realized gains on trading activities amounted to $44 million in 2011 and $375 million in 2010.
