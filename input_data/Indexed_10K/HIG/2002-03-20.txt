ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA, UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED) Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") addresses the financial condition of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, "The Hartford" or the "Company") as of December 31, 2001, compared with December 31, 2000, and its results of operations for the three years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes beginning on page F 1. Certain of the statements contained herein or in Part I of the Companys Form 10 K (other than statements of historical fact) are forward looking statements. These forward looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and include estimates and assumptions related to economic, competitive and legislative developments. These forward looking statements are subject to change and uncertainty which are, in many instances, beyond the Companys control and have been made based upon managements expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effect upon the Company. There can be no assurance that future developments will be in accordance with managements expectations or that the effect of future developments on The Hartford will be those anticipated by management. Actual results could differ materially from those expected by the Company, depending on the outcome of various factors. These factors include: the uncertain nature of damage theories and loss amounts and the development of additional facts related to the September 11 terrorist attack ("September 11"); the response of reinsurance companies under reinsurance contracts, the impact of increasing reinsurance rates, and the adequacy of reinsurance to protect the Company against losses; the possibility of more unfavorable loss experience than anticipated; the possibility of general economic and business conditions that are less favorable than anticipated; the incidence and severity of catastrophes, both natural and man made; the effect of changes in interest rates, the stock markets or other financial markets; stronger than anticipated competitive activity; unfavorable legislative, regulatory or judicial developments; the difficulty in predicting the Companys potential exposure for environmental and asbestos claims and related litigation; the Companys ability to distribute its products through distribution channels, both current and future; the uncertain effects of emerging claim and coverage issues; the effect of assessments and other surcharges for guaranty funds and second injury funds and other mandatory pooling arrangements; a downgrade in the Companys claims paying, financial strength or credit ratings; the ability of the Companys subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Company; and other factors described in such forward looking statements. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year financial information to conform to the current year presentation.

[2] Represents the write off of unamortized issuance costs on the Companys 8.35% Cumulative Quarterly Income Preferred Securities which were redeemed on December 31, 2001. [3] Represents the cumulative impact of the Companys adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133, as amended, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" and Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue 99 20, "Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased and Retained Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets". [4] 2001 includes $440 of losses related to September 11 and a $130 tax benefit at HLI. The Hartford defines "operating income" (defined in previous years as "core earnings") as after tax operational results excluding, as applicable, net realized capital gains and losses, extraordinary items, the cumulative effect of accounting changes and certain other items. Operating income is an internal performance measure used by the Company in the management of its operations. Management believes that this performance measure delineates the results of operations of the Companys ongoing businesses in a manner that allows for a better understanding of the underlying trends in the Companys current business. However, operating income should only be analyzed in conjunction with, and not in lieu of, net income and may not be comparable to other performance measures used by the Companys competitors. OPERATING RESULTS 2001 COMPARED TO 2000 Revenues increased $444, or 3%. Included in revenues in 2001 was a $91 reduction in North American Property & Casualty premiums, resulting from additional reinsurance cessions related to September 11. Also included in revenues were net realized capital losses of $236 in 2001 and net realized capital gains of $145 in 2000. These capital gains and losses related primarily to the sales of international subsidiaries and other than temporary impairments on securities. Excluding the effects of both September 11 and the net realized capital gains and losses, revenues increased $916, or 6%. The increase was related to continued new business growth in Group Benefits, increased fee income in Individual Life, primarily as a result of the April 2001 acquisition of the United States individual life insurance, annuity and mutual fund businesses of Fortis, Inc. (operating as "Fortis" or "Fortis Financial Group") and earned premium growth in most of the Property & Casualty underwriting segments. (For further discussion of the Fortis acquisition, see Note 18 (a) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Also contributing to the increase was higher net investment income, primarily due to income earned on fixed maturities. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenues in the Other Operations segment, reflecting the sales of Property & Casualtys international subsidiaries. Operating income decreased $238, or 25%. Included in the Companys operating income for the year ended December 31, 2001, were $440 of losses, after tax and net of reinsurance, related to September 11 and a $130 tax benefit at Hartford Life, Inc. ("HLI"), primarily the result of the favorable treatment of 17 certain tax matters related to separate account investment activity during the 1996 2000 tax years. Excluding the effects of September 11 and HLI tax benefit, operating income increased $72, or 7%. The increase reflected favorable operating performance in the Companys Business Insurance, Individual Life, Investment Products and Group Benefits segments, partially offset by higher loss costs in the Companys Affinity Personal Lines and Personal Insurance segments as well as adverse loss development in the Reinsurance segment. 2000 COMPARED TO 1999 Revenues increased $1.2 billion, or 9%, primarily as a result of strong growth in fee income in the Investment Products and Individual Life segments, along with premium growth in the Group Benefits segment and in all North American Property & Casualty underwriting segments. Operating income increased $125, or 15%, due to double digit earnings growth across all segments in Life partially offset by a decline in Property & Casualty, primarily due to adverse loss development in Reinsurance, increased automobile losses in the Personal Insurance segment, expenses related to the Business Insurance field office and claim reorganizations and deteriorating underwriting results from discontinued operations (public entity ("PENCO"), Canada, Farm and Industrial Risk Insurance pool ("IRI"). SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES For information on the Companys significant accounting policies, see the Deferred Acquisition Costs, Reserves and Investments sections and Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. NET REALIZED CAPITAL GAINS AND LOSSES See "Investment Results" in the Investments section. INCOME TAXES The effective tax expense (benefit) rate for 2001, 2000 and 1999 was (55)%, 28% and 23%, respectively. Excluding the impacts of September 11 and the HLI federal tax benefits of $130 and $24 in 2001 and 2000, respectively, the effective tax rate for 2001 was 17% compared with 29% and 23%, respectively, for 2000 and 1999. Excluding the impact of September 11 and the HLI federal tax benefits, the decrease in the effective tax rate for 2001 was primarily due to an increase in the proportionate share of tax exempt net investment income to total pre tax income for 2001 compared to 2000 and taxes related to the gain on the sale of Zwolsche Algemeene N.V. ("Zwolsche") in 2000. The increase in the effective tax rate for 2000, excluding the $24 tax benefit at HLI, was primarily due to taxes related to the gain on the sale of Zwolsche. (For a further discussion on the sale of Zwolsche, see the Other Operations section and Note 18(b) of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) Tax exempt interest earned on invested assets was the principal cause of effective rates lower than the 35% United States statutory rate in all years. Income taxes paid (received) in 2001, 2000 and 1999 were $(52), $95 and $41, respectively. (See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.) MINORITY INTEREST IN CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARY Prior to the June 27, 2000 acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of HLI that The Hartford did not already own ("The HLI Repurchase"), the minority interest in the consolidated subsidiarys operating results represented approximately 19%. (For additional information, see the Capital Resources and Liquidity section under "Acquisitions" and Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) PER COMMON SHARE The following table represents per common share data and return on equity for the past three years: 2001 2000 1999 Basic earnings per share $2.13 $4.42 $3.83 Diluted earnings per share $2.10 $4.34 $3.79 Weighted average common shares outstanding 237.7 220.6 224.9 Weighted average common shares outstanding and dilutive potential common shares 241.4 224.4 227.5 Return on equity excluding September 11 and Life tax benefit [1] 10.5% 15.4% 15.3% Return on equity [1] 6.6% 15.4% 15.3% [1] Calculated by dividing net income by average equity excluding unrealized gain (loss), after tax. SEGMENT RESULTS The Hartford is organized into two major operations: Life and Property & Casualty. Within these operations, The Hartford conducts business principally in ten operating segments. Additionally, all activities related to The HLI Repurchase and the minority interest in HLI for pre acquisition periods are included in Corporate. Life is organized into four reportable operating segments: Investment Products, Individual Life, Group Benefits and Corporate Owned Life Insurance ("COLI"). Life also includes in an Other category its international operations, which are primarily located in Latin America and Japan, as well as corporate items not directly allocable to any of its reportable operating segments, principally interest expense. Property & Casualty was reorganized into six reportable operating segments and, effective January 1, 2001, is reported as the North American underwriting segments of Business Insurance, Affinity Personal Lines, Personal Insurance, Specialty Commercial and Reinsurance; and the Other Operations segment, formerly "International and Other Operations". The measure of profit or loss used by The Hartfords management in evaluating performance is operating income, except for its North American underwriting segments, which are evaluated by The Hartfords management primarily based upon underwriting results. While not considered segments, the Company also reports and evaluates operating income results for Life, Property & Casualty, and North American, which includes the combined underwriting results of the North American underwriting segments along with income and expense items not directly allocable to these segments, such as 18 net investment income. Property & Casualty includes operating income for North American and the Other Operations segment. Certain transactions between segments occur during the year that primarily relate to tax settlements, insurance coverage, expense reimbursements, services provided and capital contributions. Certain reinsurance stop loss agreements exist between the segments which specify that one segment will reimburse another for losses incurred in excess of a predetermined limit. Also, one segment may purchase group annuity contracts from another to fund pension costs and claim annuities to settle casualty claims. In addition, certain intersegment transactions occur in Life. These transactions include interest income on allocated surplus and the allocation of net realized capital gains and losses through net invested income utilizing the duration of the segments investment portfolios. The following is a summary of North American underwriting results by underwriting segment within Property & Casualty. Underwriting results represent premiums earned less incurred claims, claim adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses.

Reserves, Environmental and Asbestos Claims, and Investments are discussed in separate sections. 19 LIFE Life provides investment and retirement products such as variable and fixed annuities; mutual funds, and retirement plan services; individual and corporate owned life insurance; and group benefit products, such as group life and group disability insurance. Life derives its revenues principally from: (a) fee income, including asset management fees on separate account and mutual fund assets and mortality and expense fees, as well as cost of insurance charges; (b) fully insured premiums; (c) certain other fees; and (d) net investment income on general account assets. Asset management fees and mortality and expense fees are primarily generated from separate account assets, which are deposited with the Company through the sale of variable annuity and variable life products, and mutual funds. Cost of insurance charges are assessed on the net amount at risk for investment oriented life insurance products. Premium revenues are derived primarily from the sale of group life and group disability insurance products. Lifes expenses essentially consist of interest credited to policyholders on general account liabilities, insurance benefits provided, dividends to policyholders, costs of selling and servicing the various products offered by the Company, and other general business expenses. Lifes profitability depends largely on the amount of assets under management, the level of fully insured premiums, the adequacy of product pricing and underwriting discipline, claims management and operating efficiencies, and its ability to earn target spreads between earned investment rates on general account assets and credited rates to customers. The level of assets under management is generally impacted by equity market performance, persistency of the in force block of business, sales and other deposits, as well as any acquired blocks of business.

[2] For the year ended December 31, 2001, represents the cumulative impact of the Companys adoption of SFAS No. 133 and EITF Issue 99 20. [3] For the year ended December 31, 2001, includes $130 tax benefit related to separate account investment activity and $20 of after tax losses related to September 11. For the year ended December 31, 2000, includes $32 tax benefit related to favorable tax items. As discussed above, Life consists of the following reportable operating segments: Investment Products, Individual Life, Group Benefits and COLI. In addition, Life includes in an Other category its international operations, which are primarily located in Latin America and Japan, and corporate items not directly allocable to any of its reportable operating segments. On April 2, 2001, The Hartford acquired the United States individual life insurance, annuity and mutual fund businesses of Fortis. (For further discussion, see "Acquisitions" in the Capital Resources and Liquidity section and Note 18(a) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) This transaction was accounted for as a purchase and, as such, the revenues and expenses generated by this business from April 2, 2001 forward are included in Lifes consolidated results of operations. On June 27, 2000, The Hartford acquired all of the outstanding shares of HLI that it did not already own. (For additional information, see the Capital Resources and Liquidity section 20 under "Acquisitions" and Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) 2001 COMPARED TO 2000 Revenues increased $559, or 9%, primarily related to the growth across each of Lifes primary operating segments, particularly the Individual Life and Group Benefits segments, where revenues increased $250, or 39%, and $300, or 14%, respectively. The revenue growth in the Individual Life segment was primarily due to higher earned fee income and net investment income resulting from the business acquired from Fortis. The Group Benefits segment experienced higher earned premiums due to strong sales and persistency. The Investment Products segment also contributed to the revenue increase as a result of higher fee income in the retail mutual fund business and higher net investment income in the institutional business. Revenues related to the Companys Individual Annuity business were down $46 or 3%, primarily due to lower fee income as a result of the lower equity markets in 2001. Additionally, COLI revenues were below prior year due to a decrease in variable COLI sales and the declining block of leveraged COLI business. Benefits claims and expenses increased $582, or 11%, primarily associated with the growth in Life revenues discussed above. Operating income increased $168, or 27%, led by the Individual Life and Group Benefits segments where operating income increased $42, or 53% and $16, or 18%, respectively. In addition, the 2001 results include a $130 federal income tax benefit primarily related to separate account investment activity and a $20 charge associated with the impact of September 11. Additionally, 2000 results include a benefit of $32 also related to favorable tax items. Excluding these tax items and the impact of September 11, operating income increased $90, or 15%, for the year ended December 31, 2001, as each of the Companys operating segments experienced growth from a year ago. 2000 COMPARED TO 1999 Revenues increased $454, or 8%, primarily related to the growth across each of Lifes primary operating segments, particularly the Investment Products and Group Benefits segments, where revenues increased $339, or 17%, and $183, or 9%, respectively. The revenue growth in the Investment Products segment was primarily due to higher fee income in the individual annuity and retail mutual fund operations as related average assets under management in 2000 were higher than 1999. The Group Benefits segment experienced higher earned premiums due to strong sales and persistency. The Individual Life segment also contributed to the revenue increase as a result of strong sales and favorable persistency. Partially offsetting the growth in revenues was the decrease in COLI revenues primarily related to the declining block of leveraged COLI business. Benefits, claims and expenses increased $352, or 7%, primarily related to the growth in Lifes principal operating segments described above. Operating income increased $165, or 35%, led by the Investment Products segment, where operating income increased $94, or 28%. Additionally, operating income related to each of the remaining three operating segments increased 10% or more. As discussed above, Life also recorded benefits of $32 in 2000 related to favorable tax items. Excluding these tax items, operating income increased $133, or 28%. INVESTMENT PRODUCTS OPERATING SUMMARY 2001 2000 1999 Fee income and other $ 1,620 $ 1,639 $ 1,333 Net investment income 886 741 708 TOTAL REVENUES 2,506 2,380 2,041 Benefits, claims and claim adjustment expenses 819 700 668 Insurance operating costs and other expenses 608 551 440 Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 461 516 430 TOTAL BENEFITS, CLAIMS AND EXPENSES 1,888 1,767 1,538 INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 618 613 503 Income tax expense 155 189 173 OPERATING INCOME $ 463 $ 424 $ 330 Individual variable annuity account values $ 74,581 $ 78,174 $ 80,588 Other individual annuity account values 9,572 9,059 8,383 Other investment products account values 19,322 17,376 16,352 TOTAL ACCOUNT VALUES 103,475 104,609 105,323 Mutual fund assets under management 16,809 11,432 6,374 TOTAL INVESTMENT PRODUCTS ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT $ 120,284 $ 116,041 $ 111,697 The Investment Products segment focuses on the savings and retirement needs of the growing number of individuals who are preparing for retirement or have already retired through the sale of individual variable and fixed annuities, mutual funds, retirement plan services and other investment products. The Company is both a leading writer of individual variable annuities and a top seller of individual variable annuities through banks in the United States. In addition, in 2001 The Hartford Mutual Funds, Inc. reached $12 billion in assets faster than any other retail oriented mutual fund family in history, according to Strategic Insight. 2001 COMPARED TO 2000 Revenues in the Investment Products segment increased $126, or 5%, driven primarily by other investment products. Fee income from other investment products increased $59, or 21%, principally due to growth in Lifes mutual fund assets under management. Mutual fund assets increased $5.4 billion, or 47%, to $16.8 billion as of 21 December 31, 2001, due to strong sales and the inclusion of the mutual fund assets acquired from Fortis. Net investment income from other investment products increased $113, or 20%, due mostly to growth in the institutional business, where account values were $9.1 billion at December 31, 2001, an increase of $1.4 billion, or 18%, from a year ago. The increase in revenues from other investment products was partially offset by individual annuity revenues, which decreased $46, or 3%. Fee income and net investment income from the individual annuity business acquired from Fortis helped to partially offset lower revenues in the individual annuity operation which was primarily associated with decreased account values resulting from the lower equity markets as compared to the prior year. Individual annuity account values at December 31, 2001 were $84.2 billion, a decrease of $3.1 billion, or 4%, from December 31, 2000. Benefits, claims and expenses increased $121, or 7%, driven by higher interest credited and insurance operating expenses related to other investment products consistent with the revenue growth described above. Interest credited related to other investment products increased $83, or 18%, while insurance operating expenses increased $44, or 17%. Also, individual annuity benefits and claims expenses increased $35, or 14%, principally due to the business acquired from Fortis and higher death benefits resulting from the lower equity markets in 2001. Individual annuitys insurance operating costs increased $13, or 4%, due to the business acquired from Fortis. Excluding Fortis, individual annuitys operating expenses decreased $39, or 4%, from prior year, driven by managements continued focus on maintaining operating expense levels. Partially offsetting the increase in benefits, claims, and insurance operating costs was a decrease in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs resulting from the lower gross profits associated with the individual annuity business. In addition, income tax expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2001 was $118, a $45, or 28%, decrease due to lower pretax operating income and the ongoing tax impact related to separate account investment activity. Operating income increased $39, or 9%. These increases were driven by the growth in revenues in other investment products described above, the favorable impact of Fortis and the lower effective tax rate related to the individual annuity business. 2000 COMPARED TO 1999 Revenues increased $339, or 17%, primarily due to higher fee income in the individual annuity and retail mutual fund operations. Fee income generated by individual annuities increased $227, or 20%, while related average account values grew $8.2 billion, or 10%, to $88.1 billion. The growth in average account values was due, in part, to strong sales of $10.7 billion in 2000, and the significant equity market performance in 1999, partially offset by surrenders. Although average individual annuity account values in 2000 were higher than 1999, account values at December 31, 2000 declined $1.7 billion, or 2%, as compared to December 31, 1999, as strong sales were not sufficient to offset surrenders and the impact of the retreating equity markets. In addition, fee income from other investment products increased $99, or 54%, primarily driven by the Companys retail mutual fund operation, where related assets under management increased $4.0 billion, or 63%. This substantial increase in the retail mutual fund operation was due to sales of $5.2 billion in 2000, which was partially offset by redemptions. Due to the continued growth in this segment, particularly the individual annuity and retail mutual fund operations, total benefits, claims and expenses increased $229, or 15%. This increase was driven by amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and operating expenses, which grew $86, or 20%, and $43, or 15%, respectively, primarily related to growth in the individual annuity operation. Additionally, non deferred commissions increased $83, or 59%, principally related to growth in the retail mutual fund operation. Operating income increased $94, or 28%, primarily due to the growth in revenues discussed above. Additionally, the Investment Products segment continued to maintain its profit margins related to its primary businesses, thus contributing to the segments earnings growth. In particular, its individual annuity operations operating expenses as a percentage of average individual annuity account values remained consistent with the prior year at 21 basis points. OUTLOOK The market for retirement products continues to expand as individuals increasingly save and plan for retirement. Demographic trends suggest that as the "baby boom" generation matures, a significant portion of the United States population will allocate a greater percentage of their disposable incomes to saving for their retirement years due to uncertainty surrounding the Social Security system and increases in average life expectancy. As this market grows, particularly for variable annuities and mutual funds, new companies are continually entering the market, aggressively seeking distribution channels and pursuing market share. This trend is not expected to subside, particularly in light of the Gramm Leach Bliley Act of 1999 ("the Financial Services Modernization Act"), which permits affiliations among banks, insurance companies and securities firms. Management believes that it has developed and implemented strategies to maintain and enhance its position as a market leader in the financial services industry. For example, The Hartford is introducing a tax advantaged college savings product (529 plan) in early 2002 called SMART 529. SMART 529 is a state sponsored education savings program established by the State of West Virginia which offers an easy way for both the residents of West Virginia and out of state participants to invest for a college education. SMART 529 will allow investors to choose from a wide variety of investment portfolios to match their risk preference to help accumulate savings for college. The SMART 529 product complements Hartford Lifes existing offering of investment products (mutual funds, variable annuities, 401 (k), 457 and 403 (b) plans). It also leverages The Companys capabilities in distribution, service and fund performance. The Hartford believes this is a significant market opportunity and the benefits of investing in 529 plans will be well received by many Americans saving for college. 22 INDIVIDUAL LIFE OPERATING SUMMARY 2001 2000 1999 Fee income and other $ 647 $ 459 $ 412 Net investment income 243 181 172 TOTAL REVENUES 890 640 584 Benefits, claims and claim adjustment expenses 385 274 258 Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 168 145 129 Insurance operating costs and other expenses 159 103 88 TOTAL BENEFITS, CLAIMS AND EXPENSES 712 522 475 INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 178 118 109 Income tax expense 57 39 38 OPERATING INCOME $ 121 $ 79 $ 71 Variable life account values $ 3,993 $ 2,947 $ 2,595 Total account values $ 7,868 $ 5,849 $ 5,419 Variable life insurance in force $ 61,617 $ 33,460 $ 23,854 Total life insurance in force $ 120,269 $ 75,113 $ 66,690 The Individual Life segment sells a variety of life insurance products, including variable life, universal life, interest sensitive whole life and term life insurance primarily to the high end estate and business planning markets. Additionally, the Fortis transaction, through the addition of a retail broker dealer, which has been renamed Woodbury Financial Services, has allowed the Individual Life segment to increase its reach in the emerging affluent market. 2001 COMPARED TO 2000 Revenues in the Individual Life segment increased $250, or 39%, primarily due to the business acquired from Fortis. Fee income, including cost of insurance charges, increased $180, or 40%, driven principally by growth in the variable life business where account values increased $1.0 billion, or 35%, and life insurance in force increased $28.2 billion, or 84%, from a year ago. In addition, net investment income on general account business (universal life, interest sensitive whole life and term life) increased $66, or 34%, consistent with the growth in related account values. Benefits, claims and expenses increased $190, or 36%, due principally to the growth in revenues described above. Although death benefits were higher in 2001 than the prior year as a result of the increase in life insurance in force, year to date mortality experience (expressed as death claims as a percentage of net amount at risk) for 2001 was within pricing assumptions. Operating income increased $42, or 53%, primarily due to the revenue growth described above. Individual Life incurred an after tax loss of $3 related to September 11. Excluding this loss, operating income increased $45, or 57%, primarily due to the growth factors described above. 2000 COMPARED TO 1999 Revenues increased $56, or 10%, resulting primarily from fee income associated with the growing block of variable life insurance. Fee income increased $59, or 15%, as variable life account values increased $352, or 14%, and variable life insurance in force increased $9.6 billion, or 40%. Benefits, claims and expenses increased $47, or 10%, primarily due to a $16, or 6%, increase in benefits, claims and claim adjustment expenses and a $16, or 12%, increase in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs mostly associated with the growth in this segments variable business. Additionally, insurance operating costs and other expenses increased $15, or 17%, directly associated with the growth in this segment as previously described. Operating income increased $8, or 11%, primarily due to higher fee income as mortality experience (death claims as a percentage of net amount at risk) was consistent with prior year. OUTLOOK Management believes that the Companys strong market position will provide opportunities for growth in this segment as individuals increasingly focus on estate planning. The Hartfords acquisition of the United States individual life insurance business of Fortis has increased its scale while broadening its distribution capabilities as described above. 23 GROUP BENEFITS OPERATING SUMMARY 2001 2000 1999 Earned premiums and other $ 2,259 $ 1,981 $ 1,829 Net investment income 248 226 195 TOTAL REVENUES 2,507 2,207 2,024 Benefits, claims and claim adjustment expenses 1,874 1,643 1,507 Insurance operating costs and other expenses 498 450 415 TOTAL BENEFITS, CLAIMS AND EXPENSES 2,372 2,093 1,922 INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 135 114 102 Income tax expense 29 24 23 OPERATING INCOME $ 106 $ 90 $ 79 The Hartford is a leading provider of group benefits, and through this segment sells group life and group disability insurance as well as other products, including stop loss and supplementary medical coverages to employers and employer sponsored plans, accidental death and dismemberment, travel accident and other special risk coverages to employers and associations. The Company also offers disability underwriting, administration, claims processing services and reinsurance to other insurers and self funded employer plans. 2001 COMPARED TO 2000 Revenues in the Group Benefits segment increased $300, or 14%, driven primarily by growth in premiums, which increased $278, or 14%, due to solid persistency and increased premium rates related to the in force block of business, and strong sales to new customers. Fully insured ongoing sales for the year ended December 31, 2001 were $531, $85, or 19%, higher than the prior year. Additionally, net investment income increased $22, or 10%, due to the overall growth in the in force business. Total benefits, claims and expenses increased $279, or 13%, driven primarily by higher benefits and claims which increased $231, or 14%. These increases are consistent with the growth in the business described above as the loss ratios (defined as benefits and claims and claim adjustment expenses as a percentage of premiums and other considerations) have remained relatively consistent with the comparable prior year periods. In addition, expenses other than benefits and claims increased $48, or 11%, for the year ended December 31, 2001, also consistent with the overall growth in the segment. Operating income increased $16, or 18%, driven by overall revenue growth and consistent loss and expense ratios as compared to the prior year. Group Benefits incurred an after tax loss of $2 related to September 11; excluding this loss, operating income increased $18, or 20%. 2000 COMPARED TO 1999 Revenues increased $183, or 9%, driven primarily by growth in fully insured premiums, excluding buyouts, which increased $182, or 10%, principally due to favorable persistency of the in force block of business, as well as new sales. Also contributing to the revenue growth was an increase in net investment income of $31, or 16%. Total benefits, claims and expenses increased $171, or 9%, primarily due to higher benefits, claims and claim adjustment expenses which, excluding buyouts, increased $168, or 12%, directly related to revenue growth in this segment. The segments combined ratio (ratio of total benefits, claims and expenses as a percentage of earned premiums and other) was consistent with the prior year. Operating income increased $11, or 14%, primarily driven by the increased revenues described above. OUTLOOK As employers continue to offer benefit plans in order to attract and retain valued employees, management expects that the need for group life and group disability insurance will continue to expand and believes the Company is well positioned to take advantage of this growth potential. The Group Benefits segment offered Medicare supplement insurance to members of several retired military officer associations. Federal legislation effective in the fourth quarter of 2001, now provides retired military officers age 65 and older with full medical insurance paid for by the government, eliminating the need for Medicare supplement insurance. This legislation will reduce Group Benefits premium revenues by approximately $131 in 2002. 24 CORPORATE OWNED LIFE INSURANCE (COLI) OPERATING SUMMARY 2001 2000 1999 Fee income and other $ 367 $ 401 $ 400 Net investment income 352 366 431 TOTAL REVENUES 719 767 831 Benefits, claims and claim adjustment expenses 514 545 621 Insurance operating costs and expenses 84 102 59 Dividends to policyholders 66 67 104 TOTAL BENEFITS, CLAIMS AND EXPENSES 664 714 784 INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 55 53 47 Income tax expense 18 19 17 OPERATING INCOME $ 37 $ 34 $ 30 Variable COLI account values $ 18,019 $ 15,937 $ 12,386 Leveraged COLI account values 4,315 4,978 5,729 TOTAL ACCOUNT VALUES $ 22,334 $ 20,915 $ 18,115 The Hartford is a leader in the COLI market, which includes life insurance policies purchased by a company on the lives of its employees, with the company or a trust sponsored by the company named as beneficiary under the policy. Until the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPA Act of 1996"), the Company sold two principal types of COLI business, leveraged and variable products. Leveraged COLI is a fixed premium life insurance policy owned by a company or a trust sponsored by a company. The HIPA Act of 1996 phased out the deductibility of interest on policy loans under leveraged COLI through the end of 1998, virtually eliminating all future sales of this product. Variable COLI continues to be a product used by employers to fund non qualified benefits or other postemployment benefit liabilities. 2001 COMPARED TO 2000 COLI revenues decreased $48, or 6%, mostly due to lower fee income and net investment income. Fee income and other decreased $34, or 8%, due to a decline in variable COLI sales and deposits which were approximately $1.5 billion in 2001 as compared to $2.9 billion in 2000. In addition, net investment income decreased $14, or 4%, due primarily to lower interest rates and the decline in leveraged COLI account values. Benefits, claims and expenses decreased $50, or 7%, directly related to the decrease in revenue discussed above. Operating income increased $3, or 9%, primarily due to the overall growth in variable COLI business and earnings associated with the leveraged COLI business recaptured in 1998. COLI incurred an after tax charge of $2 related to September 11; excluding this charge, operating income increased $5, or 15%. 2000 COMPARED TO 1999 Revenues in the COLI segment decreased $64, or 8%, primarily due to a decline in net investment income of $65, or 15%. This decline was principally due to the leveraged COLI block of business, as related account values decreased $751, or 13%, as a result of the continued downsizing caused by the HIPA Act of 1996. Total benefits, claims and expenses decreased $70, or 9%, primarily due to the factor described above. Operating income increased $4, or 13%, principally due to the variable COLI business where related account values increased $3.6 billion, or 29%, as well as earnings associated with a block of leveraged COLI business recaptured in 1998. OUTLOOK The focus of this segment is variable COLI, which continues to be a product generally used by employers to fund non qualified benefits or other postemployment benefit liabilities. The leveraged COLI product has been an important contributor to The Hartfords profitability in recent years and will continue to contribute to the profitability of The Hartford in the future, although the level of profit is expected to decline over the long run. COLI is subject to a changing legislative and regulatory environment that could have a material adverse effect on its business. 25 PROPERTY & CASUALTY OPERATING SUMMARY 2001 2000 1999 Earned premiums $ 7,267 $ 7,055 $ 6,578 Net investment income 1,053 1,072 1,065 Other revenue [1] 363 343 310 Net realized capital gains (losses) (103) 234 39 TOTAL REVENUES 8,580 8,704 7,992 Benefits, claims and claim adjustment expenses 6,146 5,253 4,848 Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 1,572 1,542 1,443 Insurance operating costs and expenses 647 677 647 Goodwill amortization 3 5 4 Other expenses [2] 547 543 501 TOTAL BENEFITS, CLAIMS AND EXPENSES 8,915 8,020 7,443 INCOME (LOSS) BEFORE INCOME TAXES, EXTRAORDINARY ITEM AND CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE (335) 684 549 Income tax expense (benefit) (236) 190 68 INCOME (LOSS) BEFORE EXTRAORDINARY ITEM AND CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE (99) 494 481 Extraordinary loss from early retirement of debt, net of tax [3] (8) Cumulative effect of accounting change, net of tax [4] (8) NET INCOME (LOSS) [5] (115) 494 481 Less: Restructuring charges, net of tax (10) Extraordinary loss from early retirement of debt, net of tax [3] (8) Cumulative effect of accounting change, net of tax [4] (8) Net realized capital gains (losses), after tax (75) 65 25 OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) [5] $ (14) $ 429 $ 456 [1] Primarily servicing revenue.

[4] Represents the cumulative impact of the Companys adoption of EITF Issue 99 20. [5] 2001 includes $420 of after tax losses related to September 11. As discussed above, Property & Casualty was reorganized into six reportable operating segments and, effective January 1, 2001, is reported as the North American underwriting segments of Business Insurance, Affinity Personal Lines, Personal Insurance, Specialty Commercial and Reinsurance; and the Other Operations segment. Also reported within Property & Casualty is North American, which includes the combined underwriting results of the North American underwriting segments along with income and expense items not directly allocable to these segments, such as net investment income, net realized capital gains and losses, other expenses including interest and income taxes. The following is a summary of Property & Casualty operating income, after tax. Operating income excludes net realized capital gains and losses, restructuring charges, extraordinary items and the cumulative effect of accounting changes. (after tax) 2001 2000 1999 North American Underwriting results excluding September 11 $ (207) $ (146) $ (120) September 11 (420) UNDERWRITING RESULTS (627) (146) (120) Net investment income 722 695 684 Other expenses [1] (115) (137) (130) NORTH AMERICAN OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) (20) 412 434 Other Operations operating income 6 17 22 OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) $ (14) $ 429 $ 456 [1] Includes interest, net servicing income and goodwill amortization. Underwriting results are discussed in each of the Business Insurance, Affinity Personal Lines, Personal Insurance, Specialty Commercial and Reinsurance segment sections. Net investment income and net realized capital gains and losses are 26 discussed in the Investments section. (For a further discussion of September 11, see Capital Resources and Liquidity section and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) 2001 COMPARED TO 2000 Operating income decreased $443 as compared with 2000. Excluding the $420 impact of September 11, operating income decreased $23, or 5%. Earned premium growth in Business Insurance due to price increases, strong new business growth and improved premium renewal retention, as well as an increase in North American investment income, was offset by increased losses in the personal automobile lines of business and in Reinsurance. A decrease in underwriting results of $16, after tax, related to Enron Corporation and lower income resulting from the sales of international subsidiaries also contributed to the decrease. 2000 COMPARED TO 1999 Operating income decreased $27, or 6%, primarily due to adverse loss development in Reinsurance, expenses related to the Business Insurance field office and claim reorganizations, deteriorating underwriting results from discontinued operations (PENCO, Canada, Farm and IRI) and increased automobile losses in the Personal Insurance segment. Partially offsetting this decrease was a reduction in property catastrophe losses and improvement in Business Insurance mid market results. BUSINESS INSURANCE OPERATING SUMMARY 2001 2000 1999 Written premiums [1] $ 2,886 $ 2,405 $ 2,227 Earned premiums [1] $ 2,645 $ 2,298 $ 2,202 Benefits, claims and claim adjustment expenses 1,704 1,506 1,525 Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 681 605 566 Insurance operating costs and expenses 257 237 234 UNDERWRITING RESULTS EXCLUDING SEPTEMBER 11 3 (50) (123) September 11 (245) UNDERWRITING RESULTS $ (242) $ (50) $ (123) Combined ratio excluding September 11 97.8 100.6 105.6 Combined ratio impact of September 11 9.3 Combined ratio 107.1 100.6 105.6 [1] 2001 excludes $15 of reinsurance cessions related to September 11. Business Insurance provides workers compensation, property, automobile and liability coverages to small ("Select Customer") and mid sized ("Key Accounts") commercial businesses primarily throughout the United States. This segment also provides commercial risk management products and services to small and mid sized members of affinity groups in addition to marine coverage. 2001 COMPARED TO 2000 Written premiums increased $481, or 20%, driven by strong growth in Select Customer and Key Accounts. Select Customer increased $209, or 19%, as a result of pricing increases, strong premium renewal retention and the success of product, marketing, technology and service growth initiatives. The increase in Key Accounts of $195, or 19%, was attributable primarily to significant pricing increases and improved premium renewal retention as well as strong new business growth. Excluding the impact of September 11, underwriting results improved $53, with a corresponding 2.8 point decrease in the combined ratio. The improvement for the year was primarily due to strong pricing and decreased frequency loss costs as well as an improved expense ratio. The favorable expense ratio was the result of current year benefits of the 2000 field office reorganization and reorganization costs in 2000 not recurring in 2001. 2000 COMPARED TO 1999 Written premiums increased $178, or 8%, primarily as a result of strong growth in Select Customer, up $171, or 19%. Enhanced product offerings, targeted geographic strategies and new business growth coupled with mid single digit price increases were the primary drivers of the Select Customer growth. This increase was slightly offset by a 2% decrease in Key Accounts. The decline in mid market premiums reflected the effective execution of the Companys underwriting initiatives, although significant price increases partially mitigated this decrease. Underwriting results improved $73, or 5.0 combined ratio points, primarily the result of reduced loss ratios due to the effective execution of pricing actions and lower catastrophe losses. A decrease in the expense ratio, despite field and claim reorganization costs, also contributed to the lower combined ratio. OUTLOOK Firming market conditions in the standard commercial sector are expected to continue in 2002, although price competition within many markets of the commercial industry will remain a challenge. Additionally, September 11 has created an ambiguous environment and economic uncertainty as federal backing in the event of future terrorist attacks remains uncertain. Uncertainties in the reinsurance market also may impact the segments ability to obtain adequate reinsurance coverage for certain exposures at a reasonable price. Management expects significant growth in small commercial businesses will continue to be achieved, in part, due to continued strategic actions being implemented. This includes providing a complete product solution for the small commercial coverage needs of the 27 segments customers, expanding non traditional distribution alternatives, executing geographic market share strategies and developing technology solutions that deliver superior business tools to The Hartfords agents, alliances and policyholders. Continued pricing and underwriting actions in the middle market business should continue to have a positive impact on overall profitability in 2002. AFFINITY PERSONAL LINES OPERATING SUMMARY 2001 2000 1999 Written premiums $ 1,839 $ 1,659 $ 1,527 Earned premiums $ 1,741 $ 1,583 $ 1,468 Benefits, claims and claim adjustment expenses 1,400 1,220 1,125 Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 180 164 155 Insurance operating costs and expenses 197 182 169 UNDERWRITING RESULTS EXCLUDING SEPTEMBER 11 (36) 17 19 September 11 (3) UNDERWRITING RESULTS $ (39) $ 17 $ 19 Combined ratio excluding September 11 102.8 100.0 100.2 Combined ratio impact of September 11 0.1 Combined ratio 102.9 100.0 100.2 Other revenue [1] $ 150 $ 166 $ 162 [1] Primarily servicing revenue. Affinity Personal Lines provides automobile, homeowners and home based business coverages to individuals across the United States. Affinity Personal Lines is organized to provide customized products and services to the following markets: the membership of AARP through a direct marketing operation; customers of Sears, Roebuck & Co. ("Sears") and Ford Motor Company and Ford Motor Credit Company (collectively, "Ford") as well as customers of financial institutions through an affinity center. Affinity Personal Lines also operates a member contact center for health insurance products offered through AARPs Health Care Options. The Hartfords exclusive licensing arrangement with AARP, which was renewed during the fourth quarter of 2001, continues through January 1, 2010 for automobile, homeowners and home based business. The Health Care Options agreement continues through 2007. 2001 COMPARED TO 2000 Written premiums increased $180, or 11%, driven by growth in both the AARP program and Affinity business unit. AARP increased primarily as a result of strong new business growth and continued steady premium renewal retention. The improvement in the Affinity business unit continues to reflect increased new business from the Ford and Sears accounts. Excluding the impact of September 11, underwriting results decreased $53, with a corresponding 2.8 point increase in the combined ratio. Higher automobile losses continue to adversely impact underwriting results and the combined ratio. In addition, the loss adjustment expense ratio increased, primarily as a result of higher losses and increased litigation costs. Although underwriting expenses increased, primarily due to increased written premiums, the expense ratio improved slightly as compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of prudent expense management. 2000 COMPARED TO 1999 Written premiums increased $132, or 9%, due primarily to policy count growth and improved renewal retention in the AARP program as well as growth in the Affinity business unit resulting from increased business from the Ford and Sears accounts. Underwriting results decreased $2, with a slight improvement in the combined ratio. The decrease in underwriting results was primarily due to increased automobile losses, partially offset by strong improvement in the AARP homeowners line. The combined ratio improvement was primarily attributable to a decrease in the expense ratio, reflecting productivity gains from prior initiatives. OUTLOOK The personal lines industry is struggling to regain its momentum towards profitability as rising loss costs resulting from inflation in both medical and automobile repair costs have adversely impacted results. In addition, September 11 will likely have negative short term implications to the industry as a result of lower investment yields and higher reinsurance rates. More severe catastrophes could also impact future results. Management does believe, however, that with increased rate activity, the personal lines industry will be positioned for recovery. During the fourth quarter of 2001, The Hartfords exclusive licensing arrangement with AARP to offer personal insurance products to the over 34 million AARP members was renewed through January 1, 2010. This agreement provides the segment with an important competitive advantage. Favorable "baby boom" demographics as well as initiatives implemented to further strengthen the AARP relationship are expected to increase membership during this period. 28 PERSONAL INSURANCE OPERATING SUMMARY 2001 2000 1999 Written premiums $ 1,021 $ 988 $ 943 Earned premiums $ 1,006 $ 964 $ 875 Benefits, claims and claim adjustment expenses 764 701 607 Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 205 213 193 Insurance operating costs and expenses 79 65 60 UNDERWRITING RESULTS EXCLUDING SEPTEMBER 11 $ (42) $ (15) $ 15 September 11 (6) UNDERWRITING RESULTS $ (48) $ (15) $ 15 Combined ratio excluding September 11 102.9 100.3 98.4 Combined ratio impact of September 11 0.5 Combined ratio 103.4 100.3 98.4 Personal Insurance provides automobile, homeowners and home based business coverages to individuals across the United States. Personal Insurance is organized to provide products and services to individuals who prefer local agent involvement through a network of independent agents in the standard personal lines market and through Omni Insurance Group ("Omni"), in the non standard automobile market. 2001 COMPARED TO 2000 Written premiums increased $33, or 3%, primarily due to premium growth in the standard automobile and homeowners lines as a result of pricing increases and strong premium renewal retention. Premium declines in non standard auto reflect decreased policy counts, the result of significant price increases to address loss cost issues. Excluding the impact of September 11, underwriting results decreased $27, with a corresponding 2.6 point increase in the combined ratio. Increased automobile losses in both standard and non standard adversely impacted the underwriting results and combined ratios. In addition, higher losses and increased litigation costs resulted in an increase in the loss adjustment expense ratio. Partially offsetting the combined ratio increase was improvement in the expense ratio, primarily due to lower commissions and prudent expense management. 2000 COMPARED TO 1999 Written premiums increased $45, or 5%, due primarily to policy count growth and improved renewal retention in the standard automobile and homeowners lines. Non standard automobile written premiums through Omni decreased for the year as a result of an expected consumer reaction to rate increases in certain states. Underwriting results decreased $30, with a corresponding 1.9 point increase in the combined ratio. The decrease in underwriting results and related increase in the combined ratio were primarily due to increased standard and non standard automobile losses. Partially offsetting this decrease was an improvement in the homeowners line of business. A 1.4 point decrease in the expense ratio for the year reflected the continued trend of productivity gains from prior initiatives. OUTLOOK The personal lines industry is struggling to regain its momentum towards profitability as rising loss costs resulting from inflation in both medical and automobile repair costs have adversely impacted results. In addition, September 11 will likely have negative short term implications to the industry in the form of lower investment yields and higher reinsurance rates. More severe catastrophes could also impact future results. Management does believe, however, that with increased rate activity, the personal lines industry will be positioned for recovery. Strategic actions being taken by the Personal Insurance segment include unprofitable agency closures in the standard lines and a continued shift in state mix away from poor loss performing states in non standard automobile. Additionally, further investments in technology, continued efforts to reduce expenses and improve the product line, ease of doing business and customer service capability will position Personal Insurance to take advantage of future market conditions. 29 SPECIALTY COMMERCIAL OPERATING SUMMARY 2001 2000 1999 Written premiums [1] $ 996 $ 1,080 $ 954 Earned premiums [1] $ 1,029 $ 1,034 $ 928 Benefits, claims and claim adjustment expenses 766 779 630 Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 267 268 257 Insurance operating costs and expenses 91 90 89 UNDERWRITING RESULTS EXCLUDING SEPTEMBER 11 $ (95) $ (103) $ (48) September 11 (167) UNDERWRITING RESULTS $ (262) $ (103) $ (48) Combined ratio excluding September 11 108.3 107.1 105.1 Combined ratio impact of September 11 16.5 Combined ratio 124.8 107.1 105.1 Other revenue [2] $ 213 $ 168 $ 141 [1] 2001 excludes $7 of reinsurance cessions related to September 11. [2] Primarily servicing revenue. Specialty Commercial provides insurance through retailers and wholesalers to large commercial clients and insureds requiring a variety of specialized coverages. The segments results also include the professional liability and bond lines as well as First State Management Group, a leading underwriter of excess and surplus lines business produced primarily through wholesale brokers. Agricultural and livestock products are also included in the property line of business in Specialty Commercial. 2001 COMPARED TO 2000 Written premiums decreased $84, or 8%, primarily due to a decrease in written premiums from sold or exited business lines which include farm, public entity and Canada. Partially offsetting the decrease was an increase in written premiums due to The Hartfords purchase, in the third quarter of 2000, of the in force, new and renewal financial products business as well as the majority of the excess and surplus lines business of Reliance Group Holdings, Inc. ("Reliance"), which resulted in $60 of additional written premiums as compared with 2000. Excluding the impact of September 11, underwriting results improved $8, with a 1.2 point increase in the combined ratio. The improved underwriting results were primarily a result of favorable results in the property lines of business and lower losses and underwriting expenses from the sold or exited business lines. Partially offsetting the improvement was deteriorating underwriting results in risk management and a decrease in underwriting results related to Enron Corporation. The increase in the combined ratio was primarily due to an increase in the commission ratio as well as additional taxes, licenses and fees in the risk management and professional liability lines of business. The increase in the commission ratio was primarily a result of lower ceding commissions. 2000 COMPARED TO 1999 Written premiums increased $126, or 13%, primarily due to the purchase of Reliances in force, new and renewal financial products business as well as the majority of the excess and surplus lines in 2000, which resulted in $108 of additional written premiums for the year. Higher written premiums in the casualty line of business also contributed to the increase. Underwriting results decreased $55, impacting the combined ratio by 2.0 points, primarily the result of increased losses and loss adjustment expenses in the property and bond lines of business as well as in PENCO and Canada. The combined ratio was adversely impacted by the higher loss ratios. The increase in the combined ratio was partially offset by a decrease in the expense ratio. OUTLOOK Firming market conditions in the specialty commercial sector are expected to continue in 2002. However, September 11 has created an ambiguous environment and economic uncertainty as federal backing in the event of future terrorist attacks remains uncertain. Uncertainties in the reinsurance market also may impact the segments ability to obtain adequate reinsurance coverage for certain exposures at a reasonable price. Strong property pricing should be even stronger in 2002 as a result of September 11. New capital is flowing into the industry as a result of a hardening market, thereby increasing capacity. Management believes, however, that strategic actions being taken which include providing innovative new products as well as expanding product lines; expanding non traditional distribution alternatives; and further leveraging underwriting discipline and capabilities will position the segment to capitalize on a continued improving marketplace. 30 REINSURANCE OPERATING SUMMARY 2001 2000 1999 Written premiums [1] $ 918 $ 826 $ 703 Earned premiums [1] $ 920 $ 809 $ 680 Benefits, claims and claim adjustment expenses 815 624 507 Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 239 243 211 Insurance operating costs and expenses 15 15 10 UNDERWRITING RESULTS EXCLUDING SEPTEMBER 11 $ (149) $ (73) $ (48) September 11 (226) UNDERWRITING RESULTS $ (375) $ (73) $ (48) Combined ratio excluding September 11 116.1 108.9 107.2 Combined ratio impact of September 11 27.8 Combined ratio 143.9 108.9 107.2 [1] 2001 excludes $69 of reinsurance cessions related to September 11. The Hartford assumed reinsurance worldwide through its thirteen Hartford Reinsurance Company ("HartRe") offices and wrote treaty reinsurance through professional reinsurance brokers covering various property, casualty, specialty and marine classes of business until the fourth quarter of 2001. In October 2001, HartRe announced a centralization of all underwriting and claims operations in Hartford, Connecticut and an exit from all international lines except catastrophe, Alternative Risk Transfer ("ART") and marine. The exited international lines contributed $101 of written premiums in 2001. 2001 COMPARED TO 2000 Written premiums increased $92, or 11%, primarily due to growth in ART written premiums, driven primarily by a significant first quarter ART transaction. The achievement of double digit pricing increases in traditional reinsurance was offset by underwriting discipline to maintain profitability targets. Excluding the impact of September 11, underwriting results decreased $76, with a corresponding 7.2 point increase in the combined ratio. The decrease in underwriting results and corresponding increase in the combined ratio were primarily attributable to continued adverse loss development on prior underwriting years. 2000 COMPARED TO 1999 Reinsurance written premiums increased $123, or 17%, primarily due to successful pricing increases in a firming pricing environment, as well as growth in new casualty programs business, and continued execution of new business development strategies in the ART line. Underwriting results decreased $25, with a corresponding 1.7 point increase in the combined ratio. This decrease was primarily due to adverse prior underwriting years loss development, partially offset by lower property catastrophe losses. OUTLOOK As a result of September 11, the reinsurance market has been transformed to an environment of some uncertainty. Net new capital, price increases and modifications in contract terms and conditions have contributed to the uncertainty. The property and casualty worldwide reinsurance market remains extremely competitive, although the pricing environment continued to improve in 2001. It is anticipated by management that rates and terms will continue to improve in 2002. HartRes organizational realignment has created a centralized organization aimed at enhancing core functions consistent with the segments return objectives. HartRe will be established as a specialized worldwide property catastrophe underwriting practice, blending technical underwriting expertise and state of the art catastrophe modeling and risk portfolio analysis. 31 OTHER OPERATIONS OPERATING SUMMARY 2001 2000 1999 Earned premiums $ 17 $ 367 $ 425 Net investment income 146 210 212 Other revenue 9 7 Net realized capital gains 5 16 17 TOTAL REVENUES 168 602 661 Benefits, claims and claim adjustment expenses 142 423 454 Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 49 61 Insurance operating costs and expenses 7 88 85 Other expenses 5 7 9 TOTAL BENEFITS, CLAIMS AND EXPENSES 154 567 609 INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 14 35 52 Income tax expense 4 7 19 NET INCOME 10 28 33 Less: Net realized capital gains, after tax 4 11 11 OPERATING INCOME $ 6 $ 17 $ 22 The Other Operations segment, formerly International and Other Operations, consists of certain property and casualty insurance operations of The Hartford which have discontinued writing new business. These operations primarily include First State Insurance Company, located in Boston, Massachusetts; Heritage Reinsurance Company, Ltd., headquartered in Bermuda; and Excess Insurance Company, Ltd, located in the United Kingdom. The main focus of these operations is the proper disposition of claims, resolving disputes and collecting reinsurance proceeds related largely to business underwritten and reinsured prior to 1985. Also included in Other Operations are the Companys international property and casualty businesses. During the fourth quarter 2001, the Company finalized a new management structure within its Other Operations segment that consolidates the management and claims handling responsibility of the Companys environmental and asbestos exposures. In addition, the Company consolidated its environmental and asbestos reserves into one legal entity within Other Operations. The transaction was accomplished through the use of an intercompany reinsurance agreement, and resulted in $602 of reserves, primarily related to environmental and asbestos exposures from 1986 and prior, being ceded from the Specialty Commercial segment to Other Operations. There was no impact to the Companys consolidated financial condition or results of operations as a result of this transaction. The Other Operations segment results include activity for the Companys international property and casualty businesses up until their dates of sale as discussed below. Products offered by these companies included property and casualty products in both personal and commercial lines as well as life insurance products and services designed to meet the needs of local customers. The sale of all of The Hartfords property and casualty international businesses continued the Companys strategic shift in its international operations to emphasize growth opportunities in asset accumulation business. In September 2001, The Hartford entered into an agreement to sell its Singapore based Hartford Insurance Company (Singapore), Ltd. The Company recorded a net realized capital loss of $9 after tax related to the sale, which was recorded in the 2001 investment results of North American. The sale was completed in January 2002. On February 8, 2001, The Hartford completed the sale of its Spain based subsidiary, Hartford Seguros. The Hartford received $29, before costs of sale and recorded a $16 after tax net realized capital loss which was reported in the 2001 investment results of North American. On December 22, 2000, The Hartford completed the sale of Zwolsche located in the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg. The Hartford received $547, before costs of sale and recorded a $69 after tax net realized capital gain which was reported in the 2000 investment results of North American. 2001 COMPARED TO 2000 Revenues were down $434, or 72%, and operating income was down $11, or 65%, primarily due to the sale of Zwolsche. 2000 COMPARED TO 1999 Revenues were down $59, or 9%, primarily due to lower earned premiums at Zwolsche. Operating income was down $5, or 23%, primarily due to a higher calendar year loss ratio in automobile business in Hartford Seguros and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. OUTLOOK Except for the uncertainties related to dispute resolution, reinsurance collection and those discussed in the Environmental and Asbestos Claims section, management does not anticipate the future financial performance of Other Operations to have a material effect on the future operating results of the Company. 32 DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS Management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. One of the significant estimates made includes those used in determining deferred policy acquisition costs. Although some variability is inherent in these estimates, management believes the amounts provided are adequate. LIFE Policy acquisition costs, which include commissions and certain other expenses that vary with and are primarily associated with acquiring business, are deferred and amortized over the estimated lives of the contracts, usually 20 years. Deferred policy acquisition costs related to investment contracts and universal life type contracts are deferred and amortized using the retrospective deposit method. Under the retrospective deposit method, acquisition costs are amortized in proportion to the present value of expected gross profits from investment, mortality and expense margins and surrender charges. Actual gross profits can vary from managements estimates, resulting in increases or decreases in the rate of amortization. Management periodically reviews these estimates and evaluates the recoverability of the deferred acquisition cost asset. When appropriate, management revises its assumptions on the estimated gross profits of these contracts and the cumulative amortization for the books of business are re estimated and adjusted by a cumulative charge or credit to income. The average rate of assumed future investment yield used in estimating expected gross profits related to variable annuity and variable life business was 9% at December 31, 2001 and for all other products including fixed annuities and other universal life type contracts the average assumed investment yield ranged from 5.0% 8.5%. Deferred policy acquisition costs related to traditional policies are amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies in proportion to the ratio of the present value of annual expected premium income to the present value of total expected premium income. Adjustments are made each year to recognize actual experience as compared to assumed experience for the current period. To date, our experience has generally been consistent or favorable to the assumptions used in determining DAC amortization. However, if we were to experience a material adverse deviation in certain critical assumptions, including surrender rates, mortality experience, or investment performance, there could be a negative effect on the Companys reported earnings and stockholders equity. PROPERTY & CASUALTY The Property & Casualty operations also incur costs related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance policies. These costs include agent and broker commissions, premium taxes and certain other underwriting expenses. These costs are deferred and amortized over policy terms. Estimates of the present value of future revenues, including net investment income and tax benefits, are compared to estimates of the present value of future costs, including amortization of policy acquisition costs, to determine if the deferred acquisition costs are recoverable, and if not, they are charged to expense. RESERVES LIFE In accordance with applicable insurance regulations under which Life operates, life insurance subsidiaries of The Hartford establish and carry as liabilities actuarially determined reserves which are calculated to meet The Hartfords future obligations. Reserves for life insurance and disability contracts are based on actuarially recognized methods using prescribed morbidity and mortality tables in general use in the United States, which are modified to reflect The Hartfords actual experience when appropriate. These reserves are computed at amounts that, with additions from estimated premiums to be received and with interest on such reserves compounded annually at certain assumed rates, are expected to be sufficient to meet The Hartfords policy obligations at their maturities or in the event of an insureds death. Reserves also include unearned premiums, premium deposits, claims incurred but not reported ("IBNR") and claims reported but not yet paid. Reserves for assumed reinsurance are computed in a manner that is comparable to direct insurance reserves. The liability for policy benefits for universal life type contracts and interest sensitive whole life policies is equal to the balance that accrues to the benefit of policyholders, including credited interest, amounts that have been assessed to compensate the Company for services to be performed over future periods, and any amounts previously assessed against policyholders that are refundable on termination of the contract. Certain contracts include provisions whereby a guaranteed death benefit is provided in the event that the contractholders account value at death is below the guaranteed value. Although the Company reinsures the majority of the death benefit guarantees associated with its in force block of business, declines in the equity market may increase the Companys net exposure to death benefits under these contracts. The Company records the death benefit costs, net of reinsurance, as they are incurred. For investment contracts, policyholder liabilities are equal to the accumulated policy account values, which consist of an accumulation of deposit payments plus credited interest, less withdrawals and amounts assessed through the end of the period. For the Companys group disability policies, the level of reserves is based on a variety of factors including particular diagnoses, termination rates and benefit levels. The persistency of The Hartfords annuity and other interest sensitive life insurance reserves is enhanced by policy restrictions on the withdrawal of funds. Withdrawals in excess of allowable penalty free amounts are assessed a surrender charge during a penalty period, which is usually at least seven years. Such surrender charge is initially a percentage of either the accumulation value or considerations received, which varies 33 by product, and generally decreases gradually during the penalty period. Surrender charges are set at levels to protect The Hartford from loss on early terminations and to reduce the likelihood of policyholders terminating their policies during periods of increasing interest rates, thereby lengthening the effective duration of policy liabilities and improving the Companys ability to maintain profitability on such policies. PROPERTY & CASUALTY The Hartford establishes property and casualty reserves to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims made by policyholders or against policyholders. These reserves include estimates for both claims that have been reported and those that have been incurred but not reported, and include estimates of all expenses associated with processing and settling these claims. Estimating the ultimate cost of future claims and claim adjustment expenses is an uncertain and complex process. This estimation process is based largely on the assumption that past developments are an appropriate predictor of future events, and involves a variety of actuarial techniques that analyze experience, trends and other relevant factors. The uncertainties involved with the reserving process have become increasingly unpredictable due to a number of complex factors including social and economic trends and changes in the concepts of legal liability and damage awards. Accordingly, final claim settlements may vary from the present estimates, particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future. As a result of September 11, the Company established estimated gross reserves of $1.1 billion and estimated net reserves of $556 related to property and casualty operations. This loss estimate includes coverages related to property, business interruption, workers compensation and other liability exposures, including those underwritten by the Companys assumed reinsurance operation. The Company based the loss estimate upon a review of insured exposures using a variety of assumptions and actuarial techniques, including estimated amounts for unknown and unreported policyholder losses and costs incurred in settling claims. Included in net reserves was an estimate of amounts recoverable under the Companys ceded reinsurance programs. As a result of the uncertainties involved in the estimation process, final claims settlement may vary from present estimates. The Hartford continually reviews the adequacy of its estimated claims and claim adjustment expense reserves on an overall basis. As additional experience and other relevant data become available, reserve levels are adjusted accordingly. Adjustments to previously established reserves, if any, will be reflected in the operating results of the period in which the adjustment is made. For the year ended December 31, 2001, there were no changes to these reserving assumptions that had a significant impact on the reserves or results of operations. In the judgment of management, all information currently available has been properly considered in the reserves established for claims and claim adjustment expenses. For a discussion of environmental and asbestos claims and the uncertainties related to these reserves, refer to the next section. ENVIRONMENTAL AND ASBESTOS CLAIMS The Hartford continues to receive claims that assert damages from environmental exposures and for injuries from asbestos and asbestos related products, both of which affect the Property & Casualty operation. Environmental claims relate primarily to pollution and related clean up costs. With regard to these claims, uncertainty exists which impacts the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves for unpaid losses and related settlement expenses. The Hartford finds that conventional reserving techniques cannot estimate the ultimate cost of these claims because of inadequate development patterns and inconsistent emerging legal doctrine. The majority of environmental claims and many types of asbestos claims differ from any other type of contractual claims because there is almost no agreement or consistent precedent to determine what, if any, coverage exists or which, if any, policy years and insurers or reinsurers may be liable. Further uncertainty arises with environmental claims since claims are often made under policies, the existence of which may be in dispute, the terms of which may have changed over many years, which may or may not provide for legal defense costs, and which may or may not contain environmental exclusion clauses that may be absolute or allow for fortuitous events. Courts in different jurisdictions have reached disparate conclusions on similar issues and in certain situations have broadened the interpretation of policy coverage and liability issues. In light of the extensive claim settlement process for environmental and asbestos claims, which involves comprehensive fact gathering, subject matter expertise and intensive litigation, The Hartford established an environmental claims facility in 1992 to defend itself aggressively against unwarranted claims and to minimize costs. Within the property and casualty insurance industry in the mid 1990s, progress was made in developing sophisticated, alternative methodologies utilizing company experience and supplemental databases to assess environmental and asbestos liabilities. Consistent with The Hartfords practice of using the best techniques to estimate the Companys environmental and asbestos exposures, a study was initiated in April 1996 based on known cases. The Hartford, utilizing internal staff supplemented by outside legal and actuarial consultants, completed the study in October 1996. The study included a review of identified environmental and asbestos exposures of North American Property & Casualty, along with the United States exposures of The Hartfords Other Operations segment. The methodology utilized a ground up analysis of policy, site and exposure level data for a representative sample of The Hartfords claims. The results of the evaluation were extrapolated against the balance of the claim population to estimate the Companys overall exposure for reported claims. In addition to estimating liabilities on reported environmental and asbestos claims, The Hartford estimated reserves for claims incurred but not reported. The IBNR reserve was estimated using information on reporting patterns of known insureds, characteristics of insureds such as limits exposed, attachment points and number of coverage years involved, third party costs and closed claims. Included in The Hartfords analysis of environmental and asbestos exposures was a review of applicable reinsurance 34 coverage. Reinsurance coverage applicable to the sample was used to estimate the reinsurance coverage that applied to the balance of the reported environmental and asbestos claims and to the IBNR estimates. An international actuarial firm reviewed The Hartfords approach and concluded that the way the Company studied its exposures, the thoroughness of its analysis and the way The Hartford came to its estimates were reasonable and comprehensive. The Company believes that its methodology continues to be reasonable and comprehensive. Reserve activity for both reported and unreported environmental and asbestos claims, including reserves for legal defense costs, for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, was as follows (net of reinsurance): ENVIRONMENTAL AND ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES 2001 2000 1999 Environ. Asbestos Total Environ. Asbestos Total Environ. Asbestos Total Beginning liability $ 911 $ 572 $ 1,483 $ 995 $ 625 $ 1,620 $ 1,144 $ 668 $ 1,812 Claims and claim adjustment expenses incurred [1] 15 28 43 8 8 16 7 4 11 Claims and claim adjustment expenses paid (172) (84) (256) (92) (61) (153) (156) (47) (203) Other [2] (100) 100 ENDING LIABILITY [3] $ 654 $ 616 $ 1,270 $ 911 $ 572 $ 1,483 $ 995 $ 625 $ 1,620 [1] For 2001, environmental and asbestos include $2 and $19, respectively, of incurred expenses related to the assumption of previously ceded reserves from commutations of reinsurance contracts. [2] 2001 includes a $100 reclassification from environmental to asbestos. [3] The ending liabilities are net of reinsurance on reported and unreported claims of $1,282, $1,506 and $1,524 for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. As of December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, reserves for environmental and asbestos, gross of reinsurance, were $919 and $1,633, $1,483 and $1,506, and $1,609 and $1,535, respectively. Actual claim settlements since 1996 have indicated that a smaller proportion of the total environmental and asbestos reserves should have originally been allocated to environmental, with a greater portion allocated to asbestos. As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company reclassified $100 of environmental reserves to asbestos. With the consolidation of The Hartfords environmental and asbestos liabilities into the Other Operations segment, as previously discussed in the Other Operations section, essentially all of the Companys environmental and asbestos reserves are held within Other Operations. The Hartford believes that the environmental and asbestos reserves, reported at December 31, 2001, are a reasonable estimate of the ultimate remaining liability for these claims based upon known facts, current assumptions and The Hartfords methodologies. Future social, economic, legal or legislative developments may alter the original intent of policies and the scope of coverage. The Hartford will continue to evaluate new methodologies and developments, such as the increasing level of asbestos claims being tendered under the comprehensive general liability operations (non product) section of policies, as they arise in order to supplement the Companys ongoing analysis and review of its environmental and asbestos exposures. These future reviews may result in a change in reserves, impacting The Hartfords results of operations in the period in which the reserve estimates are changed. While the impact of these changes could have a material effect on future results of operations, The Hartford does not expect such changes would have a material effect on its liquidity or financial condition. INVESTMENTS Return on invested assets is an important element of The Hartfords financial results. Significant fluctuations in the fixed income or equity markets could weaken the Companys financial condition or its results of operations. Net investment income and net realized capital gains and losses accounted for approximately 17% and 19% of the Companys consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Fluctuations in interest rates affect the Companys return on, and the fair value of, fixed maturity investments, which comprised approximately 86% and 85% of the fair value of its invested assets as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Other events beyond the Companys control could also adversely impact the fair value of these investments. Specifically, a downgrade of an issuers credit rating or default of payment by an issuer could reduce the Companys investment return. The Company also invests in unaffiliated limited partnership arrangements in order to further diversify its investment portfolio. These limited partnerships represent approximately 3% of the fair value of its invested assets as of December 31, 2001 and 2000. Limited partnerships are typically less liquid than direct investments in fixed income or equity investments. Market volatility and other factors beyond the Companys control can adversely affect the value of these investments. Because the Company is a limited partner, its ability to control the timing or the realization of the related investment income is restricted. A significant decrease in the fair value of any investment that is deemed other than temporary could result in the Companys recognition of a loss in its financial results prior to the actual sale of the investment. The Hartfords investment portfolios are divided between Life and Property & Casualty. The investment portfolios are 35 managed based on the underlying characteristics and nature of each operations respective liabilities and within established risk parameters. (For a further discussion on The Hartfords approach to managing risks, see the Capital Markets Risk Management section.) The investment portfolios of Life and Property & Casualty are managed by Hartford Investment Management Company ("HIMCO"), a wholly owned subsidiary of The Hartford. HIMCO is responsible for monitoring and managing the asset/liability profile, establishing investment objectives and guidelines, and determining, within specified risk tolerances and investment guidelines, the appropriate asset allocation, duration, convexity and other characteristics of the portfolios. Security selection and monitoring are performed by asset class specialists working within dedicated portfolio management teams. LIFE The primary investment objective of Lifes general account is to maximize after tax returns consistent with acceptable risk parameters, including the management of the interest rate sensitivity of invested assets and the generation of sufficient liquidity relative to that of corporate and policyholder obligations, as discussed in the Capital Markets Risk Management section under "Market Risk Life Interest Rate Risk". The following table identifies the invested assets by type held in the general account as of December 31, 2001 and 2000. COMPOSITION OF INVESTED ASSETS 2001 2000 AMOUNT PERCENT AMOUNT PERCENT Fixed maturities, at fair value $ 23,301 82.1% $ 18,248 79.6% Equity securities, at fair value 428 1.5% 171 0.7% Policy loans, at outstanding balance 3,317 11.7% 3,610 15.7% Limited partnerships, at fair value 811 2.9% 668 2.9% Other investments 520 1.8% 242 1.1% TOTAL INVESTMENTS $ 28,377 100.0% $ 22,939 100.0% During 2001, fixed maturity investments increased $5.1 billion as a result of the Fortis acquisition, increased operating cash flow and an increase in fair value due to a lower interest rate environment. The decrease in policy loans was primarily due to the decrease in leveraged COLI business, partially offset by policy loans acquired as a result of the Fortis acquisition. Policy loans are secured by the cash value of the associated life policy and do not mature in a conventional sense, but expire in conjunction with the related policy liabilities. The following table identifies, by type, the fixed maturity securities held in the general account as of December 31, 2001 and 2000.

As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, approximately 21% and 22%, respectively, of Lifes fixed maturities were invested in private placement securities (including 12% and 13% of Rule 144A offerings as of December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, respectively). Private placement securities are generally less liquid than public securities. However, private placements generally have covenants designed to compensate for liquidity risk. Most of the private placement securities in the operations portfolio are rated by nationally recognized rating agencies. (For further discussion of the Companys investment credit policies, see the Capital Markets Risk Management section under "Credit Risk".) INVESTMENT RESULTS The following table summarizes Lifes investment results. 36 (before tax) 2001 2000 1999 Net investment income excluding policy loan income $ 1,472 $ 1,284 $ 1,171 Policy loan income 307 308 391 Net investment income total $ 1,779 $ 1,592 $ 1,562 Yield on average invested assets [1] 7.0% 7.0% 6.7% Net realized capital losses $ (133) $ (88) $ (5) [1] Represents net investment income (excluding net realized capital losses) divided by average invested assets at cost (fixed maturities at amortized cost). 2001 COMPARED TO 2000 Net investment income, excluding policy loan income, increased $188, or 15%. The increase was primarily due to income earned on the previously discussed increase in fixed maturity investments, partially offset by lower yields on fixed maturities in the third and fourth quarters of 2001. Yields on overall average invested assets were flat. Included in 2001 net realized capital losses were write downs for other than temporary impairments on fixed maturities of $105, including a $37 loss related to securities issued by Enron Corporation. Also included in net realized capital losses is a $35 loss recognized on the sale of the Companys interest in an Argentine insurance joint venture, in addition to losses associated with the credit deterioration of certain investments in which the Company has an indirect economic interest. These losses were partially offset by gains from the sale of fixed maturities. 2000 COMPARED TO 1999 Net investment income, excluding policy loan income, increased $113, or 10%. The increase was primarily due to higher yields earned on the investment of cash flow from operations and reinvestment of proceeds from sales and maturities of fixed maturity securities in a higher interest rate environment. Policy loan income decreased $83, or 21%, due to the decrease in leveraged COLI business. Net realized capital losses increased $83 primarily as a result of portfolio rebalancing in a higher interest rate environment. PROPERTY & CASUALTY The investment objective for the majority of Property & Casualty is to maximize economic value while generating after tax income and sufficient liquidity to meet corporate and policyholder obligations. For Property & Casualtys Other Operations segment, the investment objective is to ensure the full and timely payment of all liabilities. Property & Casualtys investment strategies are developed based on a variety of factors including business needs, regulatory requirements and tax considerations. The following table identifies the invested assets by type held as of December 31, 2001 and 2000. COMPOSITION OF INVESTED ASSETS 2001 2000 AMOUNT PERCENT AMOUNT PERCENT Fixed maturities, at fair value $ 16,742 91.5% $ 16,239 91.6% Equity securities, at fair value 921 5.0% 885 5.0% Limited partnerships, at fair value 561 3.0% 470 2.7% Other investments 85 0.5% 131 0.7% TOTAL INVESTMENTS $ 18,309 100.0% $ 17,725 100.0% During 2001, fixed maturity investments increased slightly, as a result of an increase in operating and financing cash flow and an increase in fair value due to a lower interest rate environment, partially offset by a decline in fixed maturities due to sales of international subsidiaries. The following table identifies, by type, the fixed maturity securities held as of December 31, 2001 and 2000.

INVESTMENT RESULTS The following table below summarizes Property & Casualtys investment results. 2001 2000 1999 Net investment income, before tax $ 1,053 $ 1,072 $ 1,065 Net investment income, after tax [1] $ 819 $ 836 $ 828 Yield on average invested assets, before tax [2] 6.1% 6.2% 6.1% Yield on average invested assets, after tax [1] [2] 4.7% 4.9% 4.6% Net realized capital gains (losses), before tax $ (103) $ 234 $ 39 [1] Due to the significant holdings in tax exempt investments, after tax net investment income and yield are included. [2] Represents net investment income (losses) (excluding net realized capital gains) divided by average invested assets at cost (fixed maturities at amortized cost). 2001 COMPARED TO 2000 Both before and after tax net investment income decreased 2% compared to the prior year. The decreases were primarily due to a reduction in investment income resulting from the sales of Zwolsche and Hartford Seguros, partially offset by higher income on taxable fixed maturities in the North American Property & Casualty operations. Yields on average invested assets declined slightly due to the lower interest rate environment. Net realized capital losses were $103 compared to net realized capital gains of $234 for the prior year. The 2001 net realized capital losses included write downs for other than temporary impairments of $61 on fixed maturities, including a $16 loss related to securities issued by Enron Corporation, and $30 on equities and other invested assets. An additional $7 of losses were sustained on sales of Enron Corporation common stock. Also included in 2001 net realized capital losses were losses generated from the sales of international subsidiaries of $54, in addition to losses associated with the credit deterioration of certain investments in which the Company has an indirect economic interest. These losses were partially offset by gains from the sale of fixed maturities. 2000 COMPARED TO 1999 Both before and after tax net investment income and yields were relatively flat compared to the prior year. Net realized capital gains increased by $195 for 2000 primarily as a result of the $242 before tax gain recognized on the sale of Zwolsche, partially offset by net realized capital losses in the investment portfolio. CORPORATE In connection with The HLI Repurchase, the carrying value of the purchased fixed maturity security investments was adjusted to fair market value as of the date of the repurchase. This adjustment was reported in Corporate. The amortization of the adjustment to the fixed maturity security investments carrying values is reported in Corporates net investment income. The total amount of before tax amortization for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 was $18 and $10, respectively. Also reported in Corporate as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 are $3 and $5, respectively, of fixed maturity security investments. SEPARATE ACCOUNT PRODUCTS Separate account products are those for which a separate investment and liability account is maintained on behalf of the policyholder. The Companys separate accounts reflect two categories of risk assumption: non guaranteed separate accounts totaling $104.6 billion and $104.3 billion as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, wherein the policyholder assumes substantially all the risk and reward; and guaranteed separate accounts totaling $10.1 billion and $9.8 billion as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, wherein The Hartford contractually guarantees either a minimum return or the account value to the policyholder. Guaranteed separate account products primarily consist of modified guaranteed individual annuities and modified guaranteed life insurance and generally include market value adjustment features and surrender charges to mitigate the risk of disintermediation. The primary investment objective of guaranteed separate accounts is to maximize after tax returns consistent with acceptable risk parameters, including the management of the interest rate sensitivity of invested assets relative to that of policyholder obligations, as discussed in the Capital Markets Risk Management section under "Market Risk Life Interest Rate Risk." Investment objectives for non guaranteed separate accounts vary by fund account type, as outlined in the applicable fund prospectus or separate account plan of operations. Non guaranteed separate account products include variable annuities, variable life insurance contracts and variable COLI. CAPITAL MARKETS RISK MANAGEMENT The Hartford has a disciplined approach to managing risks associated with its capital markets and asset/liability management activities. Investment portfolio management is organized to focus investment management expertise on specific classes of investments, while asset/liability management is the responsibility of separate and distinct risk management units supporting Life and Property & Casualty operations. Derivative instruments are utilized in compliance with established Company policy and regulatory requirements and are monitored internally and reviewed by senior management. The Company is exposed to two primary sources of investment and asset/liability management risk: credit risk, relating to the uncertainty associated with the ability of an obligor or 38 counterparty to make timely payments of principal and or interest, and market risk, relating to the market price and or cash flow variability associated with changes in interest rates, securities prices, market indices, yield curves or currency exchange rates. The Company does not hold any financial instruments purchased for trading purposes. CREDIT RISK The Hartford has established investment credit policies that focus on the credit quality of obligors and counterparties, limit credit concentrations, encourage diversification and require frequent creditworthiness reviews. Investment activity, including setting of policy and defining acceptable risk levels, is subject to regular review and approval by senior management and by the Companys Finance Committee. The Company invests primarily in securities which are rated investment grade and has established exposure limits, diversification standards and review procedures for all credit risks including borrower, issuer and counterparty. Creditworthiness of specific obligors is determined by an internal credit evaluation supplemented by consideration of external determinants of creditworthiness, typically ratings assigned by nationally recognized ratings agencies. Obligor, asset sector and industry concentrations are subject to established limits and monitored on a regular interval. The Companys derivative counterparty exposure policy establishes market based credit limits, favors long term financial stability and creditworthiness and typically requires credit enhancement/credit risk reducing agreements. Credit risk is measured as the amount owed to the Company based on current market conditions and potential payment obligations between the Company and its counterparties. Credit exposures are generally quantified weekly and netted, and collateral is pledged to and held by, or on behalf of, the Company to the extent the current value of derivatives exceeds exposure policy thresholds. The Hartford is not exposed to any credit concentration risk of a single issuer greater than 10% of the Companys stockholders equity. The following tables identify fixed maturity securities for Life, including guaranteed separate accounts, and Property & Casualty by credit quality. The ratings referenced in the tables are based on the ratings of a nationally recognized rating organization or, if not rated, assigned based on the Companys internal analysis of such securities. LIFE As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, over 96% and 97%, respectively, of the fixed maturity portfolio was invested in securities rated investment grade (BBB and above). During 2001, the percentage of BBB rated fixed maturity investments increased due to the Fortis acquisition and the continued active management of the general account portfolios.

Life is responsible for maximizing after tax returns within acceptable risk parameters, including the management of the interest rate sensitivity of invested assets and the generation of sufficient liquidity to that of corporate and policyholder obligations. 39 Lifes fixed maturity portfolios have material market exposure to interest rate risk. Property & Casualty attempts to maximize economic value while generating appropriate after tax income and sufficient liquidity to meet corporate and policyholder obligations. Property & Casualty has material exposure to interest rate and equity market risk. The Company continually monitors these exposures and makes portfolio adjustments to manage these risks within established limits. Downward movement in market interest rates during 2001 resulted in a significant increase in the unrealized appreciation of the fixed maturity security portfolio from 2000. However, The Hartfords asset allocation and its exposure to market risk as of December 31, 2001 have not changed materially from its position at December 31, 2000. The Company analyzes interest rate risk using various models, including multi scenario cash flow projection models that forecast cash flows of the liabilities and their supporting investments, including derivative instruments. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS The Hartford utilizes a variety of derivative instruments, including swaps, caps, floors, forwards and exchange traded futures and options, in compliance with Company policy and regulatory requirements in order to achieve one of three Company approved objectives: to hedge risk arising from interest rate, price or currency exchange rate volatility; to manage liquidity; or to control transaction costs. The Company does not make a market or trade derivatives for the express purpose of earning trading profits. Interest rate swaps involve the periodic exchange of payments with other parties, at specified intervals, calculated using the agreed upon rates and notional principal amounts. Generally, no cash or principal payments are exchanged at the inception of the contract. Typically, at the time a swap is entered into, the cash flow streams exchanged by the counterparties are equal in value. Foreign currency swaps exchange an initial principal amount in two currencies, agreeing to re exchange the currencies at a future date, at an agreed exchange rate. There is also periodic exchange of payments at specified intervals calculated using the agreed upon rates and exchanged principal amounts. Interest rate cap and floor contracts entitle the purchaser to receive from the issuer at specified dates, the amount, if any, by which a specified market rate exceeds the cap strike rate or falls below the floor strike rate, applied to a notional principal amount. A premium payment is made by the purchaser of the contract at its inception, and no principal payments are exchanged. Forward contracts are customized commitments to either purchase or sell designated financial instruments, at a future date, for a specified price and may be settled in cash or through delivery of the underlying instrument. Financial futures are standardized commitments to either purchase or sell designated financial instruments, at a future date, for a specified price and may be settled in cash or through delivery of the underlying instrument. Futures contracts trade on organized exchanges. Margin requirements for futures are met by pledging securities, and changes in the futures contract values are settled daily in cash. Option contracts grant the purchaser, for a premium payment, the right to either purchase from or sell to the issuer a financial instrument at a specified price, within a specified period or on a stated date. The Company uses derivative instruments in its management of market risk consistent with four risk management strategies: hedging anticipated transactions, hedging liability instruments, hedging invested assets and hedging portfolios of assets and or liabilities. (For additional information on these strategies along with tables reflecting outstanding derivative instruments, see the Life and Property & Casualty discussions below.) Derivative activities are monitored by an internal compliance unit, reviewed frequently by senior management and reported to the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors. The notional amounts of derivative contracts represent the basis upon which pay or receive amounts are calculated and are not reflective of credit risk. Notional amounts pertaining to derivative instruments for both general and guaranteed separate accounts at December 31, 2001 and 2000 totaled $11.2 billion and $8.8 billion, respectively. The following discussions focus on the key market risk exposures within Life and Property & Casualty. LIFE Interest Rate Risk Lifes general account and guaranteed separate account exposure to interest rate risk relates to the market price and or cash flow variability associated with changes in market interest rates. Changes in interest rates can potentially impact Lifes profitability. In certain scenarios where interest rates are volatile, Life could be exposed to disintermediation risk and reduction in net interest rate spread or profit margins. Lifes general account and guaranteed separate account investment portfolios primarily consist of investment grade, fixed maturity securities, including corporate bonds, asset backed securities, commercial mortgage backed securities, tax exempt municipal securities and collateralized mortgage obligations. The fair value of these and Lifes other invested assets fluctuates depending on the interest rate environment and other general economic conditions. During periods of declining interest rates, paydowns on mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations increase as the underlying mortgages are prepaid. During such periods, the Company generally will not be able to reinvest the proceeds of any such prepayments at comparable yields. Conversely, during periods of rising interest rates, the rate of prepayments generally declines, exposing the Company to the possibility of asset/liability cash flow and yield mismatch. (For further discussion of the Companys risk management techniques to manage this market risk, see the "Asset and Liability Management Strategies Used to Manage Market Risk" discussed below.) As described above, Life holds a significant fixed maturity portfolio that includes both fixed and variable rate securities. The following table reflects the principal amounts of Lifes general and guaranteed separate accounts fixed and variable rate fixed maturity portfolios, along with the respective weighted average coupons by estimated maturity year at December 31, 2001. Comparative totals are included as of December 31, 2000. 40 Expected maturities differ from contractual maturities due to call or prepayment provisions. The weighted average coupon ("WAC") on variable rate securities is based on spot rates as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and is primarily based on London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"). Callable bonds and notes are distributed to either call dates or maturity, depending on which date produces the most conservative yield. Asset backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage backed securities are distributed based on estimates of the rate of future prepayments of principal over the remaining life of the securities. These estimates are developed using prepayment speeds provided in broker consensus data. Such estimates are derived from prepayment speeds previously experienced at the interest rate levels projected for the underlying collateral. Actual prepayment experience may vary from these estimates. Financial instruments with certain leverage features have been included in each of the fixed maturity categories. These instruments have not been separately displayed because they were immaterial to the Life investment portfolio. 2001 2000 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 THEREAFTER TOTAL TOTAL CALLABLE BONDS Fixed Rate Par value $ 17 $ 34 $ 9 $ 52 $ 17 $ 2,795 $ 2,924 $ 1,458 WAC 6.5% 5.2% 6.7% 8.2% 8.3% 3.8% 4.0% 5.5% Fair value $ 2,445 $ 1,439 Variable Rate Par value $ 12 $ 24 $ 3 $ 37 $ 9 $ 980 $ 1,065 $ 1,158 WAC 4.0% 3.2% 3.8% 4.1% 5.7% 3.4% 3.4% 7.1% Fair value $ 972 $ 1,075 BONDS OTHER Fixed Rate Par value $ 2,531 $ 1,521 $ 1,304 $ 1,680 $ 1,934 $ 9,275 $ 18,245 $ 14,699 WAC 5.8% 6.7% 6.1% 7.4% 6.1% 6.1% 6.2% 6.1% Fair value $ 17,424 $ 13,409 Variable Rate Par value $ 211 $ 224 $ 70 $ 248 $ 73 $ 221 $ 1,047 $ 1,235 WAC 4.6% 3.9% 5.2% 4.2% 7.7% 5.8% 4.9% 7.4% Fair value $ 947 $ 1,108 ASSET BACKED SECURITIES Fixed Rate Par value $ 462 $ 365 $ 484 $ 264 $ 168 $ 509 $ 2,252 $ 2,343 WAC 6.9% 6.6% 6.3% 6.9% 6.5% 7.7% 6.9% 6.9% Fair value $ 2,234 $ 2,342 Variable Rate Par value $ 276 $ 305 $ 380 $ 343 $ 212 $ 880 $ 2,396 $ 2,124 WAC 2.4% 2.8% 2.8% 2.7% 2.7% 2.9% 2.8% 7.3% Fair value $ 2,333 $ 2,099 COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS Fixed Rate Par value $ 104 $ 116 $ 110 $ 102 $ 95 $ 441 $ 968 $ 1,098 WAC 6.7% 6.1% 6.1% 6.1% 6.1% 6.5% 6.3% 6.4% Fair value $ 960 $ 1,087 Variable Rate Par value $ 4 $ 3 $ 3 $ 2 $ 1 $ 2 $ 15 $ 112 WAC 7.9% 6.7% 6.6% 6.7% 6.7% 6.4% 6.9% 5.3% Fair value $ 16 $ 101 COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE BACKED SECURITIES Fixed Rate Par value $ 85 $ 69 $ 106 $ 77 $ 198 $ 2,483 $ 3,018 $ 2,606 WAC 7.0% 6.8% 7.1% 6.9% 7.3% 7.1% 7.1% 7.3% Fair value $ 3,123 $ 2,674 Variable Rate Par value $ 274 $ 289 $ 242 $ 137 $ 118 $ 441 $ 1,501 $ 1,730 WAC 4.2% 4.1% 4.0% 5.7% 7.1% 7.9% 5.8% 7.9% Fair value $ 1,498 $ 1,738 41 2001 2000 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 THEREAFTER TOTAL TOTAL MORTGAGE BACKED SECURITIES Fixed Rate Par value $ 159 $ 175 $ 158 $ 128 $ 104 $ 444 $ 1,168 $ 792 WAC 7.0% 6.9% 6.8% 6.8% 6.8% 6.7% 6.8% 7.2% Fair value $ 1,189 $ 800 Variable Rate Par value $ $ $ $ $ $ 2 $ 2 $ 3 WAC 5.4% 5.4% 7.0% Fair value $ 2 $ 3 The table below provides information as of December 31, 2001 on debt obligations and trust preferred securities and reflects principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by maturity year.

Asset and Liability Management Strategies Used to Manage Market Risk Life employs several risk management tools to quantify and manage market risk arising from their investments and interest sensitive liabilities. For certain portfolios, management monitors the changes in present value between assets and liabilities resulting from various interest rate scenarios using integrated asset/liability measurement systems and a proprietary system that simulates the impacts of parallel and non parallel yield curve shifts. Based on this current and prospective information, management implements risk reducing techniques to improve the match between assets and liabilities. Derivatives play an important role in facilitating the management of interest rate risk, creating opportunities to efficiently fund obligations, hedge against risks that affect the value of certain liabilities and adjust broad investment risk characteristics as a result of any significant changes in market risks. As an end user of derivatives, Life uses a variety of derivatives, including swaps, caps, floors, forwards and exchange traded financial futures and options, in order to hedge exposure primarily to interest rate risk on anticipated investment purchases or existing assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2001, notional amounts pertaining to derivatives totaled $9.9 billion ($8.2 billion related to insurance investments and $1.7 billion related to life insurance liabilities). Notional amounts pertaining to derivatives totaled $8.5 billion at December 31, 2000 ($6.5 billion related to insurance investments and $2.0 billion related to life insurance liabilities). The economic objectives and strategies for which the Company utilizes derivatives are categorized as follows: Anticipatory Hedging For certain liabilities, the Company commits to the price of the product prior to receipt of the associated premium or deposit. Anticipatory hedges are executed to offset the impact of changes in asset prices arising from interest rate changes pending the receipt of premium or deposit and the subsequent purchase of an asset. These hedges involve taking a long position (purchase) in interest rate futures or entering into an interest rate swap with duration characteristics equivalent to the associated liabilities or anticipated investments. The notional amounts of anticipatory hedges as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 were $320 and $144, respectively. Liability Hedging Several products obligate the Company to credit a return to the contract holder which is indexed to a market rate. To hedge risks associated with these products, the Company enters into various derivative contracts. Interest rate swaps are used to convert the contract rate into a rate that trades in a more liquid and efficient market. This hedging strategy enables the Company to customize contract terms and conditions to customer objectives and satisfies the operations asset/liability matching policy. In addition, interest rate swaps are used to convert certain variable contract rates to different variable rates, thereby allowing them to be appropriately 42 matched against variable rate assets. Finally, interest rate caps and option contracts are used to hedge against the risk of contract holder disintermediation in a rising interest rate environment. The notional amounts of derivatives used for liability hedging as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 were $1.7 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. Asset Hedging To meet the various policyholder obligations and to provide cost effective, prudent investment risk diversification, the Company may combine two or more financial instruments to achieve the investment characteristics of a fixed maturity security or that match an associated liability. The use of derivative instruments in this regard effectively transfers unwanted investment risks or attributes to others. The selection of the appropriate derivative instruments depends on the investment risk, the liquidity and efficiency of the market, and the asset and liability characteristics. The notional amounts of asset hedges as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 were $6.8 billion and $5.4 billion, respectively. Portfolio Hedging The Company periodically compares the duration and convexity of its portfolios of assets to its corresponding liabilities and enters into portfolio hedges to reduce any difference to desired levels. Portfolio hedges reduce the duration and convexity mismatch between assets and liabilities and offset the potential impact to cash flows caused by changes in interest rates. The notional amounts of portfolio hedges as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 were $1.1 and $1.0 billion, respectively. The following tables provide information as of December 31, 2001 with comparative totals for December 31, 2000 on derivative instruments used in accordance with the aforementioned hedging strategies. For interest rate swaps, caps and floors, the tables present notional amounts with weighted average pay and receive rates for swaps and weighted average strike rates for caps and floors by maturity year. For interest rate futures, the table presents contract amount and weighted average settlement price by expected maturity year. For option contracts, the table presents contract amount by expected maturity year. 2001 2000 INTEREST RATE SWAPS 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 THEREAFTER TOTAL TOTAL Pay Fixed/Receive Variable Notional value $ 90 $ 198 $ 35 $ 140 $ 50 $ 794 $ 1,307 $ 1,031 Weighted average pay rate 5.9% 5.1% 6.1% 7.5% 6.7% 7.0% 6.5% 6.6% Weighted average receive rate 2.1% 2.3% 2.2% 2.2% 2.4% 2.2% 2.2% 6.8% Fair value $ (65) $ (43) Pay Variable/Receive Fixed Notional value $ 204 $ 518 $ 1,299 $ 935 $ 797 $ 1,327 $ 5,080 $ 4,886 Weighted average pay rate 2.1% 2.0% 2.2% 2.1% 2.0% 2.1% 2.1% 7.0% Weighted average receive rate 5.9% 5.4% 5.6% 6.0% 5.7% 6.3% 5.8% 6.6% Fair value $ 194 $ 78 Pay Variable/Receive Different Variable Notional value $ 5 $ 2 $ 150 $ 11 $ $ 251 $ 419 $ 278 Weighted average pay rate 5.4% 2.2% 3.3% 4.0% 3.1% 3.2% 6.6% Weighted average receive rate 3.0% 1.9% 3.0% 1.2% 5.5% 4.4% 4.9% Fair value $ (48) $ (1) 2001 2000 INTEREST RATE CAPS LIBOR BASED 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 THEREAFTER TOTAL TOTAL Purchased Notional value $ 10 $ 54 $ $ 77 $ $ 30 $ 171 $ 171 Weighted average strike rate (8.0 9.9%) 8.9% 8.5% 8.4% 8.3% 8.5% 8.5% Fair value $ 1 $ 1 Notional value $ 19 $ $ $ $ $ $ 19 $ 19 Weighted average strike rate (10.0 11.9%) 10.1% 10.1% 10.1% Fair value $ $ 2001 2000 INTEREST RATE CAPS CMT BASED [1] 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 THEREAFTER TOTAL TOTAL Purchased Notional value $ $ 250 $ $ 250 $ $ $ 500 $ 500 Weighted average strike rate (8.0 9.9%) 8.7% 8.7% 8.7% 8.7% Fair value $ 3 $ [1] CMT represents the Constant Maturity Treasury Rate. 43 2001 2000 INTEREST RATE FLOORS LIBOR BASED 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 THEREAFTER TOTAL TOTAL Purchased Notional value $ $ $ 27 $ $ $ $ 27 $ 27 Weighted average strike rate (6.0 7.9%) 7.9% 7.9% 7.9% Fair value $ 3 $ 2 Issued Notional value $ 28 $ 54 $ 34 $ 77 $ $ $ 193 $ 193 Weighted average strike rate (4.0 5.9%) 5.3% 5.4% 5.3% 5.3% 5.3% 5.3% Fair value $ (8) $ (2) Notional value $ $ $ 27 $ $ $ $ 27 $ 27 Weighted average strike rate (6.0 7.9%) 7.8% 7.8% 7.8% Fair value $ (3) $ (2) 2001 2000 INTEREST RATE FLOORS CMT BASED [1] 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 THEREAFTER TOTAL TOTAL Purchased Notional value $ $ 150 $ $ $ $ $ 150 $ 150 Weighted average strike rate (4.0 5.9%) 5.5% 5.5% 5.5% Fair value $ 5 $ 3 [1] CMT represents the Constant Maturity Treasury Rate. 2001 2000 INTEREST RATE FUTURES 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 THEREAFTER TOTAL TOTAL Long Contract amount/notional $ 266 $ $ $ $ $ $ 266 $ 198 Weighted average settlement price $ 105 $ $ $ $ $ $ 105 $ 105 Short Contract amount/notional $ 25 $ $ $ $ $ $ 25 $ 59 Weighted average settlement price $ 105 $ $ $ $ $ $ 105 $ 105 2001 2000 OPTION CONTRACTS 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 THEREAFTER TOTAL TOTAL Long Contract amount/notional $ $ 119 $ 107 $ 45 $ 324 $ 128 $ 723 $ 589 Fair value 28 $ 6 Short Contract amount/notional $ 39 $ 178 $ 427 $ 137 $ 245 $ 30 $1,056 $ 362 Fair value $ (61) $ (40) Currency Exchange Risk As of December 31, 2001, Life had immaterial currency exposures resulting from its international operations. Life Product Liability Characteristics Lifes product liabilities, other than non guaranteed separate accounts, include accumulation vehicles such as fixed and variable annuities, other investment and universal life type contracts, and other insurance products such as long term disability and term life insurance. Asset Accumulation Vehicles While interest rate risk associated with these insurance products has been reduced through the use of market value adjustment features and surrender charges, the primary risk associated with these products is that the spread between investment return and credited rate may not be sufficient to earn targeted returns. Fixed Rate Products in this category require the payment of a fixed rate for a certain period of time. The cash flows are not interest sensitive because the products are written with a market value adjustment feature and the liabilities have protection against the early withdrawal of funds through surrender charges. Product examples include fixed rate annuities with a market value adjustment and fixed rate guaranteed investment contracts. Contract duration is dependent on the policyholders choice of guarantee period. Indexed Products in this category are similar to the fixed rate asset accumulation vehicles but require the life operations to pay a rate that is determined by an external index. The amount and or timing of cash flows will therefore vary based on the level of the particular index. The primary risks inherent in these products are similar to the fixed rate asset accumulation vehicles, with the additional risk that changes in the index may adversely affect profitability. Product examples include indexed guaranteed investment contracts with an estimated duration of up to two years. 44 Interest Credited Products in this category credit interest to policyholders, subject to market conditions and minimum guarantees. Policyholders may surrender at book value but are subject to surrender charges for an initial period. Product examples include universal life contracts and the general account portion of Lifes variable annuity products. Liability duration is short to intermediate term. Other Insurance Products Long term Pay Out Liabilities Products in this category are long term in nature and may contain significant actuarial (including mortality and morbidity) pricing and cash flow risks. The cash flows associated with these policy liabilities are not interest rate sensitive but do vary based on the timing and amount of benefit payments. The primary risks associated with these products are that the benefits will exceed expected actuarial pricing and or that the actual timing of the cash flows differ from those anticipated, resulting in an investment return lower than that assumed in pricing. Product examples include structured settlement contracts, on benefit annuities (i.e., the annuitant is currently receiving benefits thereon) and long term disability contracts. Contract duration is generally five to ten years. Short term Pay Out Liabilities These liabilities are short term in nature with a duration of less than one year. The primary risks associated with these products are determined by the non investment contingencies such as mortality or morbidity and the variability in the timing of the expected cash flows. Liquidity is of greater concern than for the long term pay out liabilities. Products include individual and group term life insurance contracts and short term disability contracts. Management of the duration of investments with respective policyholder obligations is an explicit objective of Lifes management strategy. The estimated cash flows of insurance policy liabilities based upon internal actuarial assumptions as of December 31, 2001 are reflected in the table below by expected maturity year. Comparative totals are included for December 31, 2000.

Sensitivity to Changes in Interest Rates For liabilities whose cash flows are not substantially affected by changes in interest rates ("fixed liabilities") and where investment experience is substantially absorbed by Life, the sensitivity of the net economic value (discounted present value of asset cash flows less the discounted present value of liability cash flows) of those portfolios to 100 basis point shifts in interest rates are shown in the following table. Change in Net Economic Value 2001 2000 Basis point shift 100 + 100 100 + 100 Amount $ 6 $ (31) $ (15) $ (27) Percent of liability value 0.03% (0.16)% (0.09)% (0.16)% These fixed liabilities represented about 61% and 60% of Lifes general and guaranteed separate account liabilities at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The remaining liabilities generally allow Life significant flexibility to adjust credited rates to reflect actual investment experience and thereby pass through a substantial portion of actual investment experience to the policyholder. The fixed liability portfolios are managed and monitored relative to defined objectives and are analyzed regularly by management for internal risk management purposes using scenario simulation techniques, and are evaluated on an annual basis, in compliance with regulatory requirements. PROPERTY & CASUALTY Interest Rate Risk The primary exposure to interest rate risk in Property & Casualty relates to its fixed maturity investments. Changes in market interest rates directly impact the market value of the fixed maturity securities. In addition, but to a lesser extent, interest rate risk exists on debt and trust preferred securities issued. Derivative instruments are used to manage interest rate risk and had a total notional amount as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 of $1.3 billion and $318, respectively. The principal amounts of the fixed and variable rate fixed maturity portfolios, along with the respective weighted average coupons by estimated maturity year at December 31, 2001, are reflected in the following table. Comparative totals are included as of December 31, 2000. Expected maturities differ from contractual maturities due to call or prepayment provisions. The WAC on variable rate securities is based on spot rates as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and is based primarily on LIBOR. Callable bonds and notes are primarily municipal bonds, and are distributed to either call dates or maturity depending on which date produces the most conservative yield. Asset backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage backed securities are distributed based on estimates of the rate of future prepayments of principal over the remaining life of the 45 securities. These estimates are developed using prepayment speeds contained in broker consensus data. Such estimates are derived from prepayment speeds previously experienced at interest rate levels projected for the underlying collateral. Actual prepayment experience may vary from these estimates. Financial instruments with certain leverage features have been included in each of the fixed maturity categories. These instruments have not been separately displayed, as they were immaterial to Property & Casualtys investment portfolio. 2001 2000 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 THEREAFTER TOTAL TOTAL CALLABLE BONDS Fixed Rate Par value $ 14 $ 12 $ 53 $ 148 $ 273 $ 7,124 $ 7,624 $ 7,311 WAC 5.9% 5.8% 5.7% 5.6% 5.5% 5.3% 5.3% 5.4% Variable Rate Par value $ 1 $ 1 $ 1 $ 15 $ 5 $ 243 $ 266 $ 282 WAC 4.0% 4.0% 4.0% 6.6% 6.1% 5.3% 5.4% 6.5% Fair value $ 214 $ 227 BONDS OTHER Fixed Rate Par value $ 1,050 $ 311 $ 465 $ 566 $ 743 $ 3,278 $ 6,413 $ 6,175 WAC 5.9% 6.5% 6.8% 7.0% 6.2% 6.4% 6.4% 6.2% Fair value $ 6,297 $ 5,967 Variable Rate Par value $ 38 $ 2 $ 51 $ 1 $ 1 $ 175 $ 268 $ 128 WAC 4.9% 5.4% 3.2% 5.0% 5.2% 5.2% 4.8% 4.8% Fair value $ 231 $ 88 ASSET BACKED SECURITIES Fixed Rate Par value $ 51 $ 59 $ 75 $ 95 $ 64 $ 226 $ 570 $ 626 WAC 8.0% 7.2% 6.5% 6.6% 7.0% 7.7% 7.2% 7.4% Fair value $ 549 $ 620 Variable Rate Par value $ 10 $ 5 $ 39 $ 9 $ 19 $ 109 $ 191 $ 155 WAC 5.0% 3.7% 2.9% 3.3% 3.1% 4.1% 3.8% 7.9% Fair value $ 168 $ 141 COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS Fixed Rate Par value $ 15 $ 14 $ 18 $ 12 $ 7 $ 21 $ 87 $ 222 WAC 6.9% 6.9% 7.1% 7.0% 6.9% 6.2% 6.8% 6.6% Fair value $ 88 $ 219 Variable Rate Par value $ 1 $ 1 $ 1 $ 1 $ 1 $ 3 $ 8 $ 18 WAC 15.5% 15.4% 15.3% 15.1% 15.0% 14.4% 15.1% 5.6% Fair value $ 9 $ 17 COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE BACKED SECURITIES Fixed Rate Par value $ 19 $ 14 $ 19 $ 10 $ 19 $ 626 $ 707 $ 689 WAC 7.0% 6.7% 7.1% 7.1% 7.4% 7.1% 7.1% 7.2% Fair value $ 728 $ 697 Variable Rate Par value $ 84 $ 76 $ 34 $ 47 $ 21 $ 148 $ 410 $ 441 WAC 4.2% 4.2% 6.0% 6.3% 7.9% 8.3% 6.2% 8.1% Fair value $ 417 $ 444 MORTGAGE BACKED SECURITIES Fixed Rate Par value $ 47 $ 51 $ 49 $ 39 $ 33 $ 160 $ 379 $ 313 WAC 6.8% 6.7% 6.6% 6.6% 6.6% 6.6% 6.6% 7.2% Fair value $ 381 $ 315 46 The following table provides information as of December 31, 2001 on interest rate swaps used to manage interest rate risk on fixed maturities and trust preferred securities and presents notional amounts with weighted average pay and receive rates by maturity year.

Equities Price Risk Property & Casualty holds a diversified portfolio of investments in equity securities representing firms in various countries, industries and market segments ranging from small market capitalization stocks to Standard & Poors 500 stocks. The risk associated with these securities relates to potential decreases in value resulting from changes in equity prices.

Currency exchange risk also exists with respect to investments in foreign equity securities. Forward foreign contracts with a notional amount of $7 and $8 were used to manage this risk at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. CORPORATE Interest Rate Risk The primary exposure to interest rate risk in Corporate relates to the debt issued in connection with The HLI Repurchase. Corporate also has $3 in fixed maturity security investments that represent an immaterial interest rate exposure. The table below provides information as of December 31, 2001 on Corporates debt obligations and reflects principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by maturity year. 2001 2000 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 THEREAFTER TOTAL TOTAL LONG TERM DEBT Fixed Rate Amount $ $ $ $ 250 $ $ 275 $ 525 $ 525 Weighted average interest rate 7.8% 7.9% 7.8% 7.8% Fair value $ 563 $ 554 CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Capital resources and liquidity represent the overall financial strength of The Hartford and its ability to generate strong cash flows from each of the business segments and borrow funds at competitive rates to meet operating and growth needs. The capital structure of The Hartford as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 consisted of debt and equity, and as of December 31, 1999 also consisted of minority interest, summarized as follows: AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001 2000 1999 Short term debt $ 599 $ 235 $ 31 Long term debt 1,965 1,862 1,548 Company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts holding solely junior subordinated debentures (trust preferred securities) 1,412 1,243 1,250 TOTAL DEBT $ 3,976 $ 3,340 $ 2,829 MINORITY INTEREST IN CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARY [1] $ $ $ 491 Equity excluding unrealized gain (loss) on securities and other, net of tax [2] $ 8,344 $ 6,967 $ 5,664 Unrealized gain (loss) on securities and other, net of tax [2] 669 497 (198) TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY $ 9,013 $ 7,464 $ 5,466 TOTAL CAPITALIZATION [3] $12,320 $10,307 $ 8,984 Debt to equity [3] [4] 48% 48% 50% Debt to capitalization [3] [4] 32% 32% 31% [1] Excludes unrealized gain (loss) on securities, net of tax, of $(62) as of December 31, 1999.

These capital commitments can be called by the partnerships during 48 the commitment period (on average, 3 6 years) to fund working capital needs or the purchase of new investments. If the commitment period expires and the commitment has not been fully funded, The Hartford is not required to fund the remaining unfunded commitment but may elect to do so. ACQUISITIONS Fortis On April 2, 2001, The Hartford acquired Fortis Financial Group for $1.12 billion in cash. The Company effected the acquisition through several reinsurance agreements with subsidiaries of Fortis, Inc. and the purchase of 100% of the stock of Fortis Advisers, Inc. and Fortis Investors, Inc., wholly owned subsidiaries of Fortis, Inc. The acquisition was recorded as a purchase transaction. Purchase consideration for the transaction was as follows: Issuance of: Common stock issuance (10 million shares @ $64.00 per share), net of transaction costs $ 615 Long term notes: $400 7.375% notes due March 1, 2031 400 Trust preferred securities: $200 7.625% Trust Preferred Securities (Series B) due February 15, 2050 200 Consideration raised $ 1,215 For a further discussion of the Fortis Acquisition, see Note 18(a) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

CAPITALIZATION The Hartfords total capitalization, excluding unrealized gain (loss) on securities and other, net of tax, increased by $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2001 compared to December 31, 2000. This change was primarily the result of earnings and financing activities related to Fortis and September 11, partially offset by dividends declared. The Hartfords total capitalization, excluding unrealized gain (loss) on securities and other, net of tax, increased by $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2000 compared to December 31, 1999. This change was primarily the result of earnings and financing activities related to The HLI Repurchase, partially offset by dividends declared and the effect of treasury stock acquired in the first quarter of 2000. SHELF REGISTRATION On May 15, 2001, HLI filed with the SEC a shelf registration statement for the potential offering and sale of up to $1.0 billion in debt and preferred securities. The registration statement was declared effective on May 29, 2001. As of December 31, 2001, HLI had $1.0 billion remaining on its shelf. On November 9, 2000, The Hartford filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement and a prospectus, as amended on January 31, 2001, for the potential offering and sale of up to $2.6 billion in debt and equity securities. As of December 31, 2001, The Hartford had $1.1 billion remaining on its shelf. For a further discussion of the shelf registration statements, see Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. DEBT The Hartford has a commercial paper program which allows the Company to borrow up to a maximum amount of $2.0 billion in short term commercial paper notes. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had $299 of outstanding borrowings under the program. Effective June 20, 2001, The Hartford entered into an amended and restated five year revolving $1.0 billion credit facility with fourteen banks. This facility is available for general corporate purposes and to provide additional support to the Companys commercial paper program. As of December 31, 2001, there were no outstanding borrowings under the facility. HLI has a commercial paper program which allows it to borrow up to a maximum amount of $250 in short term commercial paper notes. As of December 31, 2001, HLI had no outstanding borrowings under the program. As of December 31, 2001, HLI maintained a $250 five year revolving credit facility comprised of four participatory banks. As of December 31, 2001, there were no outstanding borrowings under the facility. On December 1, 2001, The Hartfords 8.3% medium term notes became due. The Company borrowed $200 under its commercial paper program to retire the debt. On March 1, 2001, HLI issued and sold $400 of senior debt securities to partially finance the Fortis acquisition. On June 16, 2000, The Hartford issued and sold $525 of unsecured redeemable long term debt. On June 23, 2000, The Hartford issued $400 of commercial paper. Proceeds from the debt issuances were used to partially fund The HLI Repurchase. The Company used proceeds from the sale of Zwolsche to pay off the $400 of commercial paper on December 29, 2000. 49 For additional information regarding debt, see Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. COMPANY OBLIGATED MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE PREFERRED SECURITIES OF SUBSIDIARY TRUSTS HOLDING SOLELY JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES (TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES) On December 31, 2001, The Hartford redeemed its 20,000,000 Series B, 8.35% Cumulative Quarterly Income Preferred Securities due October 30, 2026 for $500. The Company used proceeds from its October 26, 2001 issuance of 7.45% Trust Originated Preferred Securities, Series C to redeem the securities. On October 26, 2001, Hartford Capital III, a Delaware statutory business trust formed by The Hartford, issued 20,000,000, 7.45% Trust Originated Preferred Securities, Series C and received proceeds before underwriting expenses of $500. On March 6, 2001, HLI issued and sold $200 of trust preferred securities to partially finance the Fortis acquisition. For a further discussion of Company Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities of Subsidiary Trusts Holding Solely Junior Subordinated Debentures, see Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY Issuance of common stock As a result of September 11, on October 22, 2001, The Hartford issued 7.0 million shares of common stock pursuant to an underwritten offering for net proceeds of $400. Issuance of common stock Fortis Financial Group acquisition On February 16, 2001, The Hartford issued 10 million shares of common stock pursuant to an underwritten offering for net proceeds of $615 to partially fund the Fortis Financial Group acquisition. Issuance of common stock from treasury On June 8, 2000, The Hartford issued 7.25 million shares of common stock in a block trade to Goldman, Sachs & Co. for $398. The shares were issued out of treasury. The Hartford used the net proceeds from the issuance of the shares to partially fund The HLI Repurchase. Dividends The Hartford declared $242 and paid $235 in dividends to shareholders in 2001, declared $214 and paid $210 in 2000 and declared $209 and paid $207 in 1999. On October 18, 2001, The Hartfords Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.26 per share payable on January 2, 2002 to shareholders of record as of December 3, 2001. The dividend represented a 4% increase from the prior quarter. Treasury Stock In October 1999, The Hartfords Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of the Companys outstanding common stock. This repurchase authorization was effective in November 1999 and covers a three year period. On the first two trading days following September 11, The Hartford repurchased 0.1 million shares of its common stock in the open market at a total cost of $7. These were the Companys only repurchases in 2001. Since the inception of the 1999 repurchase program, The Hartford has repurchased 6.1 million shares at a total cost of $250. Certain of these repurchased shares have been reissued pursuant to certain stock based benefit plans. Unrealized Gain (Loss) and Other Unrealized gain (loss) on securities and other, net of tax, increased by $172 as of December 31, 2001 compared to December 31, 2000. The change resulted primarily from the impact of decreased interest rates on the fixed maturity portfolio and the net gain on cash flow hedging instruments. For additional information on stockholders equity, see Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. RATINGS The following table summarizes The Hartfords significant United States member companies financial ratings from the major independent rating organizations as of February 28, 2002. A.M. STANDARD BEST FITCH & POORS MOODYS Insurance Ratings: Hartford Fire A+ AA AA Aa3 Hartford Life Insurance Company A+ AA+ AA Aa3 Hartford Life & Accident A+ AA+ AA Aa3 Hartford Life & Annuity A+ AA+ AA Aa3 OTHER RATINGS: The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.: Senior debt a+ A+ A A2 Commercial paper AMB 1 F 1 A 1 P 1 Hartford Capital I quarterly income preferred securities [1] a A BBB+ A3 Hartford Capital III trust originated preferred securities [1] a A BBB+ A3 Hartford Life, Inc.: Senior debt a+ A+ A A2 Commercial paper F 1 A 1 P 1 Hartford Life, Inc.: Capital I and II trust preferred securities [1] a A BBB+ A3 [1] In 2001, Moodys Investor Service recalibrated its rating scale for preferred stock and subordinated bonds to increase comparability of credit risk assessments across sectors of fixed income markets globally. The recalibration represents a change in Moodys overall rating system for preferred stocks and subordinated bonds but not a change in its risk assessment of an issuers fundamental credit quality. The Companys preferred securities ratings were changed from A2 to A3 as a result of the recalibration. Ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of an insurance company such as The Hartford. There can be no assurance that the Companys ratings will continue for any given period of time or that they will not be changed. As a result of September 11 and subsequent reviews by major independent rating agencies, all insurance financial strength and debt ratings of The Hartford were reaffirmed. However, negative outlooks were placed upon the debt ratings of the Company by Moodys and the property and casualty financial strength rating by Standard & Poors. All other ratings were reaffirmed with stable outlooks. 50 LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS The liquidity requirements of The Hartford have been and will continue to be met by funds from operations as well as the issuance of commercial paper, debt securities and borrowings from its credit facility. The principal sources of operating funds are premiums and investment income as well as maturities and sales of invested assets. The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. is a holding company which receives operating cash flow in the form of dividends from its subsidiaries, enabling it to service debt, pay dividends on its common stock and pay certain business expenses. Dividends to The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. from its subsidiaries are restricted. The payment of dividends by Connecticut domiciled insurers is limited under the insurance holding company laws of Connecticut. Under these laws, the insurance subsidiaries may only make their dividend payments out of restricted surplus. These laws require notice to and approval by the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend, which, together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of (i) 10% of the insurers policyholder surplus as of December 31 of the preceding year or (ii) net income (or net gain from operations, if such company is a life insurance company) for the twelve month period ending on the thirty first day of December last preceding, in each case determined under statutory insurance accounting policies. In addition, if any dividend of a Connecticut domiciled insurer exceeds the insurers earned surplus, it requires the prior approval of the Connecticut Insurance Commissioner. The insurance holding company laws of the other jurisdictions in which The Hartfords insurance subsidiaries are incorporated (or deemed commercially domiciled) generally contain similar (although in certain instances somewhat more restrictive) limitations on the payment of dividends. As of December 31, 2001, the maximum amount of statutory dividends which may be paid to The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. from its insurance subsidiaries in 2002, without prior regulatory approval, is $577. The primary uses of funds are to pay claims, policy benefits, operating expenses and commissions, and to purchase new investments. In addition, The Hartford has a policy of carrying a significant short term investment position and accordingly does not anticipate selling intermediate and long term fixed maturity investments to meet any liquidity needs. (For a discussion of the Companys investment objectives and strategies, see the Investments and Capital Markets Risk Management sections.) FUTURE TERRORISM EXPOSURES The September 11 terrorist attack had a significant impact on The Hartford and the insurance industry as a whole. Since that time, The Hartford has taken steps to limit future exposure to terrorist acts. These steps include attaching terrorist exclusions to our policies wherever possible and identifying and managing concentrated exposures by location and dividing the exposures into terrorism risk classes. The Hartford and the industry continue to support the development of Federal legislation to provide a federal insurance program, which would help share in potential losses from terrorism. However, in the absence of a federally backed capital resource or availability of adequate reinsurance coverage and despite the steps already taken to limit exposure, The Hartford may not have the capacity to cover future large scale terrorist acts such as nuclear, chemical or biological attacks. In addition, losses related to future terrorist attacks could negatively impact the Companys financial strength and debt ratings. As a result, any losses related to future terrorist attacks could have a material impact to the liquidity, financial condition and results of operation of The Hartford. CASH FLOW 2001 2000 1999 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,303 $ 2,435 $ 954 Net cash provided by (used for) investing activities $ (5,536) $ (2,164) $ 2,216 Net cash provided by (used for) financing activities $ 3,365 $ (208) $ (3,104) Cash end of year $ 353 $ 227 $ 182 2001 COMPARED TO 2000 The increase in cash from financing activities was the result of current year proceeds on investment type contracts versus the prior year disbursements for investment type contracts and financing activities related to Fortis and September 11. Cash provided by financing and operating activities accounted for the majority of the change in cash for investing activities. Cash flows from operating activities were comparable with prior year. 2000 COMPARED TO 1999 The increase in operating cash flow was primarily the result of growth in Life business, along with favorable underwriting cash flows in Property & Casualty. The decrease in cash used for financing activities was attributable to net financing for The HLI Repurchase as well as a lower level of disbursements for investment type contracts related to the leveraged block of COLI business. The financing activities, along with the increase in cash provided by operating activities, accounted for the change in cash from investing activities. Operating cash flows in each of the last three years have been more than adequate to meet liquidity requirements. RISK BASED CAPITAL The National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") has regulations establishing minimum capitalization requirements based on risk based capital ("RBC") formulas for both life and property and casualty companies. The requirements consist of formulas, which identify companies that are undercapitalized and require specific regulatory actions. The RBC formula for life companies establishes capital requirements relating to insurance, business, asset and interest rate risks. RBC is calculated for property and casualty companies after adjusting capital for certain underwriting, asset, credit and off balance sheet risks. As of December 31, 2001, each of The Hartfords insurance subsidiaries within Life and Property & Casualty had more than sufficient capital to meet the NAICs RBC requirements. 51 REGULATORY MATTERS AND CONTINGENCIES LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVES The business of insurance is primarily regulated by the states and is also affected by a range of legislative developments at the state and federal levels. Passage in November 1999 of the Financial Services Modernization Act, which permits affiliations among banks, insurance companies and securities firms, may have competitive, operational and other implications for the Company. Among other provisions, the measure includes privacy protections requiring all financial service providers to disclose their privacy policies and restrict the sharing of personal information for marketing purposes. Various states are considering even more restrictive privacy measures that could potentially affect the Companys operations. Enactment of the Financial Services Modernization Act at the federal level has also focused renewed attention on state regulation of insurance. Elements of the insurance industry are involved in a countrywide initiative to streamline regulatory procedures, either through the modification of rate and form filing requirements or Congressional adoption of optional federal charter legislation. Federal measures which have been previously considered or enacted by Congress and which, if revisited, could affect the insurance business, include tax law changes pertaining to the tax treatment of insurance companies and life insurance products, as well as changes in individual income tax rates and the estate tax, a number of which changes could have an impact on the relative desirability of various personal investment vehicles. Legislation to restructure the social security system, expand private pension plans, and create new retirement savings incentives also may be considered. It is too early to determine the future disposition of any of these proposals. Therefore, the potential impact to the Companys financial condition or results of operations cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Congress is expected to continue considering terrorism insurance backstop legislation and proposals to moderate the business communitys asbestos exposure. Both have the potential to reduce claim exposures; however, enactment of such legislation may not occur in the current Congress. Proposed legislation to reduce abusive class action lawsuits would also have a beneficial impact, but prospects for near term enactment are likewise uncertain. So called "patient protection" legislation introduced in Congress and passed in many states includes provisions permitting lawsuits against health maintenance organizations ("HMOs") for denial of coverage. Although the Company is not a health insurer or health care provider, passage of such legislation could affect medical claim costs to the extent that HMOs were constrained from actively managing care. INSOLVENCY FUND In all states, insurers licensed to transact certain classes of insurance are required to become members of an insolvency fund. In most states, in the event of the insolvency of an insurer writing any such class of insurance in the state, members of the fund are assessed to pay certain claims of the insolvent insurer. A particular states fund assesses its members based on their respective written premiums in the state for the classes of insurance in which the insolvent insurer is engaged. Assessments are generally limited for any year to one or two percent of premiums written per year depending on the state. Such assessments paid by The Hartford approximated $6 in 2001, $2 in 2000 and $4 in 1999. NAIC CODIFICATION The NAIC adopted the Codification of Statutory Accounting Principles ("Codification") in March 1998. The effective date for the statutory accounting guidance was January 1, 2001. Each of The Hartfords domiciliary states has adopted Codification, and the Company has made the necessary changes in its statutory reporting required for implementation. As of December 31, 2001, the impact of applying the new guidance resulted in a benefit of approximately $400 in statutory surplus. DEPENDENCE ON CERTAIN THIRD PARTY RELATIONSHIPS The Company distributes its annuity, life and certain property and casualty insurance products through a variety of distribution channels, including broker dealers, banks, wholesalers, its own internal sales force and other third party organizations. The Company periodically negotiates provisions and renewals of these relationships and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to the Company or such third parties. An interruption in the Companys continuing relationship with certain of these third parties could materially affect the Companys ability to market its products. During the first quarter of 1999, the Company modified its existing, exclusive contract with one such third party, Putnam Mutual Funds Corp. ("Putnam") to eliminate the exclusivity provision which allowed both parties to pursue new market opportunities. Putnam is contractually obligated to support and service the related annuity in force block of business and to market, support and service new business. However, there can be no assurance that this contract modification will not adversely impact the Companys ability to distribute Putnam related products.

EFFECT OF INFLATION The rate of inflation as measured by the change in the average consumer price index has not had a material effect on the revenues or operating results of The Hartford during the three most recent fiscal years.
