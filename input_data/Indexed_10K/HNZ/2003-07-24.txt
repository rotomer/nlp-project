ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. SPECIAL ITEMS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS On December 20, 2002, Heinz transferred to a wholly owned subsidiary ("SKF Foods") certain assets and liabilities, including its U.S. and Canadian pet food and pet snacks, U.S. tuna, U.S. retail private label soup and private label gravy, College Inn broths and U.S. infant feeding businesses and distributed all of the shares of SKF Foods common stock on a pro rata basis to its shareholders. Immediately thereafter, SKF Foods merged with a wholly owned subsidiary of Del Monte Foods Company ("Del Monte") resulting in SKF Foods becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Del Monte ("the Merger"). In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the operating results and net assets related to these businesses spun off to Del Monte have been included in discontinued operations in the Companys consolidated statements of income and consolidated balance sheets. Discontinued operations for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2003 and May 1, 2002, represent operating results for eight and twelve months, respectively. The net assets 10 distributed to Heinz shareholders have been treated as a dividend and charged to retained earnings. The discontinued operations generated sales of $1,091.3 million, $1,817.0 million and $1,833.2 million and net income of $88.7 million (net of $35.4 million in tax), net income of $158.7 million (net of $69.4 million in tax) and a net loss of $70.6 million (net of $12.4 million of a tax benefit) for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2003, May 1, 2002 and May 2, 2001, respectively. DEL MONTE AND OTHER REORGANIZATION COSTS In Fiscal 2003, Del Monte transaction costs and costs to reduce overhead of the remaining business totaled $164.6 million pretax ($113.1 million after tax) and were comprised of $61.8 million for legal, professional and other related costs, $51.3 million in employee termination and severance costs, $39.6 million related to the early retirement of debt and $12.0 million in non cash asset write downs. Of this amount, $6.1 million was included in cost of products sold, $118.9 million in selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A"), and $39.6 million in other expenses, net. Additionally, in Fiscal 2003, losses on the exit of non strategic businesses, primarily the UK frozen pizza business and a North American fish and frozen vegetable business, totaled $62.4 million pretax ($49.3 million after tax), comprising of $39.7 million in non cash asset write downs, $12.1 million in losses on the sale of businesses and $10.6 million in employee termination, severance and other exit costs. Of these amounts, $47.3 million was included in cost of products sold and $15.1 million in SG&A. To date, management estimates that these actions have impacted approximately 1,000 employees excluding those who were transferred to Del Monte. STREAMLINE In the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2001, the Company announced a restructuring initiative named "Streamline". This initiative included a worldwide organizational restructuring aimed at reducing overhead costs and was completed in the first half of Fiscal 2003. During Fiscal 2003, the Company utilized $19.4 million of severance and exit cost accruals, principally related to its global overhead reduction plan, primarily in Europe and North America. In addition, as a result of the spin off of SKF Foods, a $3.4 million restructuring liability related to ceasing canned pet food production at the Companys Terminal Island, California facility was transferred to Del Monte. During the first quarter of Fiscal 2002, the Company recognized restructuring and implementation charges totaling $8.3 million pretax ($6.1 million after tax). In the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2002, the Company recorded a net charge of $4.1 million pretax ($2.8 million after tax) to reflect revisions in original cost estimates. This charge was primarily a result of higher than expected severance costs (primarily in Europe and the U.S.). Total Fiscal 2002 pretax charges of $3.8 million were classified as cost of products sold and $8.6 million as SG&A. During Fiscal 2001, the Company recognized restructuring charges and implementation costs totaling $101.4 million pretax ($69.0 million after tax), which primarily include severance costs and were all classified as SG&A. Implementation costs were recognized as incurred in Fiscal 2002 ($2.6 million pretax) and Fiscal 2001 ($1.8 million pretax) and consist of incremental costs directly related to the implementation of the Streamline initiative. The Streamline initiative resulted in a net reduction of the Companys workforce of approximately 2,600 employees. OPERATION EXCEL In Fiscal 1999, the Company announced a growth and restructuring initiative named "Operation Excel." This initiative was a multi year, multi faceted program that established manufacturing centers of excellence, focused the product portfolio, realigned the Companys management 11 teams and invested in growth initiatives. The Company substantially completed Operation Excel in Fiscal 2002. During Fiscal 2001, the Company recognized restructuring charges of $12.1 million pretax ($7.7 million after tax). These charges were primarily associated with higher than originally expected severance costs associated with creating the single North American Grocery & Foodservice headquarters in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Of this charge, $9.7 million was recorded in cost of products sold and $2.4 million in SG&A. This charge was offset by reversals of unutilized Operation Excel accruals and asset write downs of $68.4 million pretax ($52.3 million after tax), of which $36.0 million was recorded in cost of products sold and $32.3 million in SG&A and were primarily the result of lower than expected lease termination costs related to exiting the Companys fitness business, revisions in estimates of fair values of assets which were disposed of as part of Operation Excel, and the Companys decision not to transfer certain European baby food production. Implementation costs of $202.8 million pretax ($135.8 million after tax) were also recognized in Fiscal 2001, of which $100.2 million were recorded in cost of products sold and $102.6 million in SG&A. Operation Excel resulted in a net reduction of the Companys workforce of approximately 7,100 employees. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In Fiscal 2001, the Company changed its method of accounting for revenue recognition in accordance with SAB No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements." Under this new accounting method, adopted retroactive to May 4, 2000, Heinz recognizes revenue upon the passage of title, ownership and risk of loss to the customer. The cumulative effect of the change in prior years resulted in a charge to income in Fiscal 2001 of $14.8 million (net of income taxes of $9.3 million). The change did not have a significant effect on revenues or results of operations for the fiscal year ended May 2, 2001. Effective May 2, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." Under this standard, goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized. This standard also requires, at a minimum, an annual assessment of the carrying value of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful lives. The reassessment of intangible assets, including the ongoing impact of amortization, was completed during the first quarter of Fiscal 2003. Net income from continuing operations for the fiscal years ended May 1, 2002 and May 2, 2001 would have been $720.4 million ($0.13 per share higher) and $583.7 million ($0.10 per share higher), respectively, had the provisions of the new standards been applied as of May 4, 2000. During the first half of Fiscal 2003, the Company completed its transitional impairment review of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, and recognized a transition adjustment of $77.8 million ($0.22 per share) to write down goodwill associated with businesses in Eastern Europe, Argentina, Spain, South Korea and South Africa. This adjustment is recorded as an effect of change in accounting principle as of May 2, 2002. Based on current and forecasted operating results, the Company does not anticipate any further goodwill impairment charges in the near term. Effective May 2, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 144 "Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long lived Assets." This Statement provides updated guidance concerning the recognition and measurement of an impairment loss for certain types of long lived assets, expands the scope of a discontinued operation to include a component of an entity and eliminates the current exemption to consolidation when control over a subsidiary is likely to be temporary. The adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2003. During Fiscal 2003, the Company adopted SFAS No. 146 "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities." SFAS No. 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for 12 costs associated with exit or disposal activities. This Statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. This Statement also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability. During Fiscal 2003, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 45 ("FIN 45"), "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others." FIN 45 elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued, and it requires the recognition of a liability at fair value by a guarantor at the inception of a guarantee. The initial recognition and measurement provisions of FIN 45 are effective on a prospective basis for all guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The Company has not issued or modified any material guarantees since December 31, 2002. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123". SFAS No. 148 provides alternative methods of transitions for entities that voluntarily change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation, and it also amends the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123 to require disclosure about the effects of an entitys accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation in both annual and interim financial reporting. The disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 148 were effective for the Company at April 30, 2003. The Company is currently evaluating its policy for recognizing expense related to stock options. In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity". This statement affects the classification, measurement and disclosure requirements of certain freestanding financial instruments, including mandatorily redeemable shares. SFAS No. 150 is effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective for the Company for the second quarter of Fiscal 2004. The adoption of SFAS No. 150 will require the reclassification of the Companys $325 million of mandatorily redeemable preferred shares from minority interest to long term debt on the consolidated balance sheet and the $20.2 million annual preferred dividend from other expenses, net, to interest expense on the consolidated statement of income with no resulting effect on the Companys profitability. RESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS 2003 VERSUS 2002 Sales for Fiscal 2003 increased $622.8 million, or 8.2%, to $8.24 billion. Sales were favorably impacted by pricing of 4.2%, foreign exchange translation rates of 5.6% and acquisitions of 2.2%. The favorable impact of acquisitions is primarily related to prior year acquisitions in the Heinz North America and U.S. Frozen segments. The favorable pricing was realized primarily in certain highly inflationary countries, Europe and Asia/Pacific. Sales were negatively impacted by unfavorable volumes of 2.0%, due mainly to certain highly inflationary countries and the U.S. Frozen segment, as well as the continued impact of the previously announced SKU ("Stock Keeping Unit") rationalization of low margin products across the Company. Divestitures reduced sales by 1.8%. Domestic operations contributed approximately 38% of consolidated sales in Fiscal 2003 compared to 41% in Fiscal 2002. The current years results were negatively impacted by special charges totaling $227.0 million pretax ($162.4 million after tax) related to the following items: Del Monte transaction costs, costs to reduce overhead of the remaining businesses and losses on the exit of non strategic businesses. The Fiscal 2003 special charges were classified as cost of products sold ($53.4 million), SG&A ($134.0 million) and other expenses ($39.6 million). Last years results were negatively impacted by net Streamline restructuring charges and implementation costs totaling $12.4 million pretax ($8.9 million after tax). Fiscal 2002 charges were classified as cost of products sold ($3.8 million) and SG&A ($8.6 million). 13 Gross profit increased $176.5 million, or 6.4%, to $2.93 billion and the gross profit margin decreased slightly to 35.6% from 36.2%. This increase was primarily a result of favorable pricing and exchange translation rates and the benefit of reduced amortization of intangible assets of approximately $47.9 million, partially offset by the impact related to the special items discussed above of $53.4 million in Fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2002 operating income was also unfavorably impacted by $3.8 million for the special items discussed above. SG&A increased $302.6 million, or 20.8%, to $1.76 billion and increased as a percentage of sales to 21.4% from 19.1%. The increase is primarily driven by the impact of the special items discussed above of $134.0 million in Fiscal 2003, increased Selling & Distribution ("S&D") expenses, increased marketing spend across all segments and increased General & Administrative ("G&A") expenses in the Europe, Heinz North America and Asia/Pacific segments. Fiscal 2002 SG&A was also impacted by $8.6 million for the special items discussed above. Total marketing support (recorded either as a reduction of revenue or as a component of SG&A) increased $199.2 million, or 9.7%, to $2.26 billion on a sales increase of 8.2%. Operating income decreased $126.1 million, or 9.7%, to $1.17 billion and decreased as a percentage of sales to 14.3% from 17.1%. This decrease was primarily driven by the impact of the special items discussed above of $187.4 million in Fiscal 2003 and the U.S. Frozen segment partially offset by increases in the Europe and Asia/Pacific segments due to favorable exchange rates and pricing. Fiscal 2002 operating income was also unfavorably impacted by $12.4 million for the special items discussed above. Net interest expense decreased $12.0 million to $192.4 million, driven by lower interest rates and lower average debt over the past year. Other expense increased $67.7 million to $112.6 million. The increase is primarily attributable to the $39.6 million pretax charge related to early retirement of debt and increases in minority interest expense, largely related to increased profitability in joint ventures in certain highly inflationary countries. The effective tax rate for Fiscal 2003 was 36.1% compared to 35.7% last year. The effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by 1.6% and 0.1% in Fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively, by the special items discussed above. Net income for Fiscal 2003 (before the effect of change in accounting principle related to the adoption of SFAS No. 142) was $555.4 million compared to $675.2 million last year. Diluted earnings per share (before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle related to the adoption of SFAS No. 142) was $1.57 in Fiscal 2003 compared to $1.91 in Fiscal 2002. Net income was negatively impacted by $162.4 million and $8.9 million in Fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively, by the special items discussed above. The impact of fluctuating exchange rates for Fiscal 2003 remained relatively consistent on a line by line basis throughout the consolidated statement of income. OPERATING RESULTS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT HEINZ NORTH AMERICA Sales of the Heinz North America segment increased $56.2 million, or 2.5%, to $2.27 billion. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased sales 1.7%, due primarily to the prior year acquisitions of Classico and Aunt Millies pasta sauce, Mrs. Grass Recipe soups, Wylers bouillons and soups and Diannes frozen desserts. Higher pricing increased sales 1.3%, due mainly to retail ketchup, Jack Daniels marinades and grilling sauces and frozen soup. Sales volume decreased 0.7% as increases in foodservice ketchup, specialty sauces and Diannes frozen desserts were offset by decreases primarily in Heinz retail ketchup and vinegar. Gross profit increased $0.1 million to $830.7 million; however, the gross profit margin decreased to 36.5% from 37.5% due primarily to unfavorable sales mix and increased manufacturing 14 costs, partially offset by reduced amortization expense on intangible assets with indefinite lives and favorable pricing. Gross profit was also unfavorably impacted by $6.0 million and $2.4 million in Fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively, related to the special items discussed above. Operating income decreased $94.5 million, or 19.8%, to $382.8 million due primarily to the unfavorable impact of the special items discussed above in Fiscal 2003 of $66.8 million, higher S&D and G&A expenses and increased marketing of $11.2 million primarily behind Heinz Easy Squeeze! ketchup, Classico pasta sauce and the foodservice ketchup "Insist on Heinz" campaign. Fiscal 2002 operating income was also unfavorably impacted by the special items of $6.1 million. U.S. FROZEN U.S. Frozens sales decreased $15.2 million, or 1.3%. to $1.16 billion. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased sales 5.1%, due primarily to the prior year acquisitions of Delimex frozen Mexican foods, Anchors Poppers retail frozen appetizers and licensing rights to the T.G.I. Fridays brand of frozen snacks and appetizers. Lower pricing decreased sales 1.9%, primarily due to Boston Market HomeStyle meals and appetizers and SmartOnes frozen entrees, partially offset by a reduction in trade promotions related to the launch of Hot Bites in the prior year and in Ore Ida frozen potatoes. Sales volume decreased 4.5% driven by Boston Market HomeStyle side dishes, Ore Ida Funky Fries and Hot Bites, partially offset by growth in SmartOnes frozen entrees. Gross profit decreased $24.0 million, or 5.4%, and the gross profit margin decreased to 36.2% from 37.8%. These decreases are primarily due to lower pricing, unfavorable sales mix, increased trade promotions and costs to exit the Ore Ida Funky Fries and Hot Bites product lines, partially offset by acquisitions. Operating income decreased $45.1 million, or 18.4%, to $199.7 million due primarily to the change in gross profit and increased consumer marketing on SmartOnes frozen entrees and Ore Ida frozen potatoes and increased S&D, partially offset by reduced G&A expenses. EUROPE Heinz Europes sales increased $314.0 million, or 11.1%, to $3.15 billion. Favorable exchange translation rates increased sales by 10.8%. Higher pricing increased sales 1.7%, primarily due to Heinz beans, ketchup and soups. Lower volume decreased sales 0.8%, driven primarily by planned SKU rationalizations and frozen pizza, partially offset by volume increases in ketchup and frozen entrees. Divestitures reduced sales by 0.6%. Gross profit increased $104.1 million, or 9.8%, to $1.17 billion; however, the gross profit margin decreased to 37.2% from 37.7%. The increase in gross profit is due primarily to favorable foreign exchange rates, pricing and reduced amortization expense related to intangible assets. This increase was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of $47.4 million related to the special items discussed above in Fiscal 2003. Operating income increased $11.8 million, or 2.2%, to $553.7 million, primarily attributable to the favorable change in gross profit, offset partially by increased SG&A expenses. Fiscal 2003 operating income was also unfavorably impacted by $58.9 million related to the special items discussed above, and Fiscal 2002 operating income was unfavorably impacted by the special items of $3.6 million. ASIA/PACIFIC Sales in Asia/Pacific increased $169.8 million, or 17.3%, to $1.15 billion. Favorable exchange translation rates increased sales by 12.0%. Higher pricing increased sales 3.7%, primarily due to Heinz ready to serve soups, poultry, juices/drinks and sauces. Volume increased sales 0.1%, driven primarily by increases in sauces, poultry and ketchup, partially offset by declines driven by planned SKU rationalizations and decreases in cooking oils and frozen vegetables. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased sales by 1.5%. Gross profit increased $75.0 million, or 25.6%, to $367.5 million, and the gross profit margin increased to 31.9% from 29.8%. These increases are due primarily to favorable foreign exchange 15 rates, increased pricing and reduced manufacturing costs. During Fiscal 2003, the Company made significant progress in improving its supply chain and net pricing across our businesses in Australia, New Zealand and Japan. Operating income increased $35.4 million, or 43.2%, to $117.5 million, primarily due to the change in gross profit, offset partially by increased marketing and G&A expenses. Fiscal 2003 operating income was also unfavorably impacted by $6.6 million related to the special items discussed above. OTHER OPERATING ENTITIES Sales for Other Operating Entities increased $98.0 million, or 23.9%, to $508.4 million primarily due to favorable pricing in certain highly inflationary countries. Gross profit increased $24.5 million, or 20.7%, due primarily to favorable pricing. Operating income increased $34.6 million due primarily to the increase in gross profit; however, more than half of this increase was offset by increased minority interest expense recorded below operating income. Zimbabwe remains in a period of economic uncertainty. Should the current situation continue, the Company could experience disruptions in its Zimbabwe operations. Therefore, as of the end of November 2002, the Company deconsolidated its Zimbabwean operations and classified its remaining net investment of approximately $110 million as a cost investment included in other non current assets on the consolidated balance sheet as of April 30, 2003. If this situation continues to deteriorate, the Companys ability to recover its investment could be impaired. RESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS 2002 VERSUS 2001 Sales for Fiscal 2002 increased $626.3 million, or 9.0%, to $7.61 billion. Acquisitions increased sales by 12.4% and higher pricing increased sales by 1.5%. Offsetting these improvements were decreases from divestitures of 2.2%, exchange translation rates of 2.1% and volume of 0.6%. Domestic operations contributed approximately 41% of consolidated sales in Fiscal 2002 compared to 40% in Fiscal 2001. The favorable impact of acquisitions is primarily related to Classico and Aunt Millies pasta sauce, Mrs. Grass Recipe soups and Wylers bouillons and soups in the North America segment; Delimex frozen Mexican foods, Anchors Poppers retail frozen appetizers and licensing rights to the T.G.I. Fridays brand of frozen snacks and appetizers in the U.S. Frozen segment; and the Honig brands of soups, sauces and pasta meals, HAK brand of vegetables packed in glass, KDR brand of sport drinks, juices, spreads and sprinkles in the Europe segment. The Fiscal 2002 results were negatively impacted by net Streamline restructuring charges and implementation costs totaling $12.4 million pretax ($8.9 million after tax). Fiscal 2002 charges of $3.8 million were classified as cost of products sold and $8.6 million as SG&A. Fiscal 2001 results were negatively impacted by special items that net to $366.7 million pretax ($163.8 million after tax). Fiscal 2001 special items include restructuring and implementation costs of $101.4 million pretax ($69.0 million after tax) for the Streamline initiative, net restructuring and implementation costs of $146.5 million pretax ($91.2 million after tax) for Operation Excel, a benefit of $93.2 million from tax planning and new tax legislation in Italy, a loss of $94.6 million pretax ($66.2 million after tax) on the sale of The All American Gourmet business, Company acquisition costs of $18.5 million pretax ($11.7 million after tax), a loss of $5.6 million pretax ($3.5 million after tax) which represents the Companys equity loss associated with The Hain Celestial Groups fourth quarter results and the after tax impact of adopting SAB No. 101 and SFAS No. 133 of $15.3 million. Fiscal 2001 charges of $73.9 million were classified as costs of products sold, $287.1 million as SG&A, and $5.6 million as other expenses, net. Gross profit increased $175.5 million, or 6.8%, to $2.76 billion; however, the gross profit margin decreased to 36.2% from 36.9%. The increase in gross profit is primarily driven by the impact of acquisitions and the special items discussed above. The special items unfavorably impacted gross profit by $3.8 million and $73.9 million in Fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively. 16 SG&A decreased $135.4 million, or 8.5%, to $1.46 billion, and decreased as a percentage of sales to 19.1% from 22.8%. This decrease is primarily attributable to the impact of the special items discussed above, partially offset by acquisitions, increased S&D costs in North America and increased G&A costs in Europe. The special items impacted SG&A by $8.6 million and $287.1 million in Fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively. Total marketing support (recorded either as a reduction of revenue or as a component of SG&A) increased $291.2 million, or 16.5%, to $2.06 billion on a sales increase of 9.0%. Operating income increased $310.9 million, or 31.4%, to $1.30 billion, and increased as a percentage of sales to 17.1% from 14.2%. This increase is primarily driven by the impact of acquisitions and the special items discussed above. The special items unfavorably impacted operating income by $12.4 million and $361.0 million in Fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively. Net interest expense decreased $35.5 million to $204.4 million driven by lower interest rates, partially offset by increased borrowings. Other expense increased $50.3 million to $44.9 million, primarily due to an increase in minority interest expense and gains from foreign currency hedge contracts recorded in Fiscal 2001, offset by a decrease of $5.6 million related to the special items discussed above. The effective tax rate for Fiscal 2002 was 35.7% compared to 25.3% in Fiscal 2001. The Fiscal 2001 rate includes a benefit of $93.2 million from tax planning and new tax legislation in Italy, partially offset by restructuring expenses in lower rate jurisdictions and nondeductible expenses. The effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by 0.1% in Fiscal 2002 and was favorably impacted by 11.2% in Fiscal 2001 by the special items discussed above. Net income increased $126.5 million to $675.2 million from $548.7 million in Fiscal 2001 and earnings per share increased to $1.91 from $1.56. Net income was negatively impacted by the special items identified above by $8.9 million and $163.8 million in Fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively. In Fiscal 2001, the Company changed its method of accounting for revenue recognition in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements". The cumulative effect of adopting SAB No. 101 was $14.8 million ($0.04 per share) in Fiscal 2001. The impact of fluctuating exchange rates for Fiscal 2002 remained relatively consistent on a line by line basis throughout the consolidated statement of income. HEINZ NORTH AMERICA Sales of the Heinz North America segment increased $130.2 million, or 6.2%, to $2.22 billion. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased sales 12.7%. Lower pricing decreased sales 2.7%, primarily related to increased marketing spend across all major brands and to foodservice ketchup. Sales volume decreased 3.2%, primarily in the foodservice business and Heinz steak sauces, partially offset by volume increases in grilling sauces. The weaker Canadian dollar decreased sales 0.5%. Gross profit increased $2.8 million, or 0.3%, to $830.6 million as the favorable impact of acquisitions was offset by lower pricing and a decrease in the foodservice business. Gross profit was also unfavorably impacted by $2.4 million and $7.0 million related to the special items discussed above in Fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively. Operating income decreased $14.4 million, or 2.9%, to $477.3 million due primarily to the decrease in gross profit driven by the foodservice business and higher S&D costs, partially offset by the favorable impact of acquisitions. Operating income in Fiscal 2002 and 2001 was also unfavorably impacted by $6.1 million and $50.0 million, respectively, related to the special items previously discussed. 17 U.S. FROZEN U.S. Frozens sales increased $214.9 million, or 22.5%, to $1.17 billion. Acquisitions increased sales 26.8%. Sales volume increased 4.7% due primarily to SmartOnes frozen entrees, Boston Market HomeStyle Meals and Bagel Bites snacks, partially offset by volume decreases in Ore Ida frozen potatoes. Lower pricing decreased sales 1.0%, primarily due to increased marketing spend across all major brands and lower pricing in Boston Market HomeStyle Meals, partially offset by higher pricing of SmartOnes frozen entrees and frozen potatoes. Divestures reduced sales by 8.0% due to the divestiture of Budget Gourmet. Gross profit increased $106.3 million, or 31.6%, to $442.6 million due primarily to acquisitions. In addition, gross profit in Fiscal 2001 was also unfavorably impacted by $16.5 million related to the special items. Operating income increased $160.8 million to $244.7 million as the favorable impact of acquisitions was partially offset by lower pricing, increased S&D costs and the divestiture of Budget Gourmet. Fiscal 2001 operating income was unfavorably impacted by $118.0 million related to the special items discussed above. EUROPE Heinz Europes sales increased $251.6 million, or 9.7%, to $2.83 billion. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased sales 11.0%. Higher pricing increased sales 1.5%, primarily due to higher pricing in seafood, infant feeding, beans and soup. Volume decreased by 0.4%, driven primarily by infant feeding, partially offset by increases in grocery ketchup, Heinz salad cream, tuna, and weight control entrees. Unfavorable exchange translation rates decreased sales by 2.4%. Gross profit increased $94.1 million, or 9.7%, to $1,067.4 million due primarily to acquisitions and increased pricing.

Gross profit decreased $41.5 million, or 12.4%, to $292.5 million due primarily to poor factory operations in connection with the movement of manufacturing to New Zealand from Australia and Japan and unfavorable foreign exchange rates, partially offset by increased pricing. Gross profit was also unfavorably impacted in Fiscal 2001 by $30.1 million related to the special items. During Fiscal 2002, New Zealands factories experienced inefficiencies as a result of significant changes in the supply chain matrix. Operating income decreased $14.1 million to $82.1 million, primarily attributable to the unfavorable operating performance brought about by the movement of manufacturing to New Zealand from Australia and Japan and the significant realignment of manufacturing facilities. Operating income was also unfavorably impacted in Fiscal 2001 by $51.5 million related to the special items. OTHER OPERATING ENTITIES Sales for Other Operating Entities increased $90.1 million, or 28.1%. Favorable pricing increased sales 34.4%, primarily in certain highly inflationary countries. Sales volume decreased 18 1.7%, primarily in tuna offset by infant feeding and grocery ketchup. Other items, net, reduced sales by 4.6% mainly due to the divestitures of the South African frozen and pet food businesses. Gross profit increased $18.0 million, or 17.9%, due primarily to favorable pricing. Operating income increased $5.8 million, or 11.9%, primarily due to higher pricing. Operating income was also favorably impacted in Fiscal 2001 by $11.3 million related to the special items discussed above. LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL POSITION Cash provided by continuing operating activities increased over 25% to $906.0 million from $714.4 million last year. The increase in Fiscal 2003 versus Fiscal 2002 is primarily due to improved working capital performance in accounts receivable and inventory offset by increased pension contributions and higher cash requirements for the special items discussed above. Cash provided by investing activities totaled $961.1 million compared to cash used by investing activities of $974.1 million last year. Cash provided by the spin off of SKF Foods was $1,063.6 million in the current year. Acquisitions in the prior year required $834.8 million, due primarily to the purchase of Borden Food Corporations pasta and dry bouillon and soup business, Delimex Holdings, Inc. and Anchor Food Products branded retail business which includes the retail licensing rights to the T.G.I. Fridays brand of frozen snacks and appetizers. Divestitures provided $55.0 million in Fiscal 2003 compared to $32.9 million in Fiscal 2002. Capital expenditures totaled $154.0 million compared to $193.9 million last year, a decrease of approximately 21%. As noted above, during Fiscal 2003, the Company focused on improving the efficiency of its working capital. The working capital improvements, reduced capital expenditures and the proceeds from the Del Monte transaction allowed the Company to reduce net debt (total debt net of interest rate swaps, less cash and cash equivalents) by approximately $1.3 billion to $3.8 billion in Fiscal 2003 from $5.1 billion in Fiscal 2002, despite pension contributions of $224 million in Fiscal 2003, compared to $111 million in Fiscal 2002. A portion of the Del Monte proceeds was used to retire $650 million of long term debt. Additional net debt reductions are anticipated in Fiscal 2004. Cash used for financing activities totaled $1,416.5 million compared to cash provided by financing activities of $181.3 million last year. There were no proceeds from long term debt in the current period compared to $2,009.1 million last year. Payments on long term debt required $741.2 million in Fiscal 2003, compared to $329.2 million last year. Payments on commercial paper and short term borrowings required $176.2 million this year compared to $1,271.0 million last year. In addition, $325.0 million was provided during the prior year via the issuance of preferred stock which is discussed below. Cash provided from stock options exercised totaled $7.5 million this year versus $63.7 million last year. Dividend payments totaled $521.6 million compared to $562.6 million for the same period last year reflecting a reduction in the dividend rate in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2003 as a result of the spin off of SKF Foods. Fiscal 2004 dividends are expected to approximate $380 million. There were no share repurchases in the current year and share repurchases required $45.4 million in the prior year. As discussed above, the Company made contributions to its pension plans totaling $224 million in Fiscal 2003. In addition, the Company recorded an additional minimum liability of $451.1 million as of April 30, 2003. Although this non cash adjustment did not impact the 2003 operating results, pension expense is expected to increase in 2004 primarily due to the lower fair value of pension assets due to poor equity market conditions, a reduction in the assumed discount rate and the estimated return on plan assets. Return on average shareholders equity ("ROE") was 32.7% in Fiscal 2003, 43.7% in Fiscal 2002 and 37.0% in Fiscal 2001. ROE was unfavorably impacted by 11.2%, 0.6% and 11.0% in Fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, related to the special items discussed above. Pretax return on 19 average invested capital ("ROIC") was 16.1% in Fiscal 2003, 18.8% in Fiscal 2002 and 16.6% in Fiscal 2001. ROIC was unfavorably impacted by 3.4%, 0.2% and 6.1% in Fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, related to the special items discussed above. In Fiscal 2002, H. J. Heinz Finance Company ("Heinz Finance"), a subsidiary of the Company, issued $325 million of 6.226% Voting Cumulative Preferred Stock. The preferred stock is required to be redeemed in July 2008. Also during Fiscal 2002, Heinz Finance privately placed $750 million of 6.625% Notes due July 2011, $700 million of 6.00% Notes due March 2012 and $550 million of 6.75% Notes due March 2032. All of these notes are guaranteed by the Company and they were exchanged in March 2003 for new notes, which were substantially identical in all respects, except for being registered under the Securities Act of 1933. The proceeds from the issuance of the preferred stock and the notes were used to retire commercial paper borrowings and for other general corporate purposes. In September 2001, the Company and Heinz Finance entered into a 364 Day Credit Agreement, which was renewed in September 2002, and a Five Year Credit Agreement, expiring in September 2006. The 364 day agreement permits the Company and Heinz Finance to borrow up to $800 million. The five year agreement permits the Company and Heinz Finance to borrow up to $1.5 billion. These agreements support the Companys commercial paper borrowings and the remarketable securities. As a result, these borrowings are classified as long term debt based upon the Companys ability to refinance these borrowings on a long term basis. In addition, the Company had $867 million of foreign lines of credit available at April 30, 2003. As of April 30, 2003, the Company had $800 million of remarketable securities due November 2020. The securities are subject to an annual remarketing on each November 15, and the interest rate will be reset on such dates. If the securities are not remarketed, then the Company is required to repurchase all of the securities on the remarketing date at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. On November 15, 2002, the securities were remarketed at an effective yield to the Company of 6.56%. In January 2003, $200 million of the remarketable securities were retired with proceeds from the Del Monte transaction as described above. At April 30, 2003, the Companys long term debt ratings were "A" at Standard & Poors and Fitch and "A3" at Moodys and the Companys short term debt ratings were "A1" at Standard & Poors, "F 1" at Fitch and "P2" at Moodys. Since the beginning of Fiscal 2002, the Company has significantly increased the proportion of long term debt to total debt such that at April 30, 2003 long term debt represented 96.7% of total debt as compared to a ratio of 61.7% at May 2, 2001. Through the use of interest rate swaps, the Company has converted $2.55 billion of fixed rate debt to floating rates in order to maintain our desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt, while continuing to maintain long term financing. The nature and amount of the Companys long term and short term debt as well as the proportionate amount of fixed rate and floating rate debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of April 30, 2003, the Company had repurchased a total of 15.4 million shares under the 20.0 million share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors in June 1999. However, in Fiscal 2003, the Company did not repurchase any shares of common stock. The Company may reissue repurchased shares upon the exercise of stock options, conversions of preferred stock and for general corporate purposes. In Fiscal 2003, the cash requirements of the Del Monte transaction and costs to reduce overhead of the remaining businesses were approximately $138 million. In addition, approximately $104 million of cash was utilized to purchase assets under operating lease obligations which were transferred to Del Monte. Fiscal 2004 cash requirements related to the Del Monte transaction and costs to reduce overhead of the remaining businesses are expected to be approxi 20 mately $50 million. In Fiscal 2003, the cash requirements of Streamline were $19.4 million, relating to severance and exit costs. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company is obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table represents the significant contractual cash obligations of the Company as of April 30, 2003. Due in Due in Due in Due in Due in Contractual Cash Obligations Total 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter (In millions) Long term debt (including capital leases of $54.4 million)........ $4,489 $ 8 $397 $510 $ 8 $300 $3,266 Operating leases.................. 508 67 54 43 156* 18 170 Total contractual cash obligations..................... $4,997 $75 $451 $553 $164 $318 $3,436 * Includes the purchase option related to certain warehouses and equipment currently utilized under synthetic leases. The Company has purchase commitments for materials, supplies, services and property, plant and equipment as part of the ordinary conduct of business. A few of these commitments are long term and are based on minimum purchase requirements. In the aggregate, such commitments are not at prices in excess of current markets. Due to the proprietary nature of some of the Companys materials and processes, certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions for early terminations. The Company does not believe that a material amount of penalties is reasonably likely to be incurred under these contracts based upon historical experience and current expectations. The Company does not have material financial guarantees or other contractual commitments that are reasonably likely to adversely affect liquidity. In addition, the Company does not have any related party transactions that materially affect the results of operations, cash flow or financial condition. MARKET RISK FACTORS The Company is exposed to market risks from adverse changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and production costs. As a policy, the Company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor does the Company hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE SENSITIVITY: The Companys cash flow and earnings are subject to fluctuations due to exchange rate variation. Foreign currency risk exists by nature of the Companys global operations. The Company manufactures and sells its products in a number of locations around the world, and hence foreign currency risk is diversified. The Company may attempt to limit its exposure to changing foreign exchange rates through both operational and financial market actions. These actions may include entering into forward or option contracts to hedge existing exposures, firm commitments and forecasted transactions. The 21 instruments are used to reduce risk by essentially creating offsetting currency exposures. The following table presents information related to foreign currency contracts held by the Company: Aggregate Notional Amount Net Unrealized Gains/(Losses) (Dollars in millions) April 30, 2003 May 1, 2002 April 30, 2003 May 1, 2002 Purpose of Hedge: Intercompany cash flows.............. $ 95 $380 $0.8 $ 1.8 Forecasted purchases of raw materials and finished goods and foreign currency denominated obligations... 470 335 0.5 (5.0) Forecasted sales and foreign currency denominated assets................. 150 130 2.3 3.8 $715 $845 $3.6 $ 0.6 As of April 30, 2003, the Companys contracts to hedge forecasted transactions mature within 24 months of the fiscal year end. Contracts that meet qualifying criteria are accounted for as foreign currency cash flow hedges. Accordingly, the effective portion of gains and losses is deferred as a component of other comprehensive loss and is recognized in earnings at the time the hedged item affects earnings. Any gains and losses due to hedge ineffectiveness or related to contracts which do not qualify for hedge accounting are recorded in current period earnings in other income and expense. Substantially all of the Companys foreign affiliates financial instruments are denominated in their respective functional currencies. Accordingly, exposure to exchange risk on foreign currency financial instruments is not material. (See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.) INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY: The Company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its borrowing and investing activities used to maintain liquidity and fund business operations. The nature and amount of the Companys long term and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. The Companys net debt obligations totaled $3.8 billion and $5.1 billion at April 30, 2003 and May 1, 2002, respectively. The Companys debt obligations are summarized in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. In order to manage interest rate exposure, the Company utilizes interest rate swaps under its fair value hedging strategy in order to convert fixed rate debt to floating. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of these derivatives, along with changes in the fair value of the hedged debt obligations that are attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current period earnings. Based on the amount of fixed rate debt converted to floating as of April 30, 2003, a variance of 1/8 % in the related interest rate would cause annual interest expense related to this debt to change by approximately $3.2 million. The following table presents additional information related to interest rate contracts designated as fair value hedges by the Company: (Dollars in millions) April 30 ,2003 May 1, 2002 Pay floating swaps notional amount.................... $2,550.0 $2,050.0 Net unrealized gains..................................... $ 294.8 $ 23.6 Average maturity (years)................................. 14.1 16.4 Weighted average receive rate............................ 6.47% 6.45% Weighted average pay rate................................ 2.32% 3.14% At April 30, 2003, the Company also maintained interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $400 million that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting but effectively mitigate interest rate exposures. These swaps mature within 12 months and are accounted for on a full 22 mark to market basis through current earnings. Net unrealized gains related to these swaps totaled $2.1 million at April 30, 2003. COMMODITY PRICE SENSITIVITY: The Company is the purchaser of certain commodities such as corn, soybean oil and soybean meal. The Company generally purchases these commodities based upon market prices that are established with the vendor as part of the purchase process. The Company may enter into commodity futures, swaps and option contracts to reduce the effect of price fluctuations on forecasted purchases. The Company held commodity contracts to hedge certain forecasted purchases with a notional amount of $21 million and $31 million at April 30, 2003 and May 1, 2002, respectively. Such contracts generally have a term of less than one year, and are accounted for as cash flow hedges if they meet certain qualifying criteria. Accordingly, the effective portion of gains and losses is deferred as a component of other comprehensive loss and is recognized as part of cost of products sold at the time the hedged item affects earnings. Any gains and losses due to hedge ineffectiveness or related to contracts which do not qualify for hedge accounting are recorded in current period earnings in other income and expense. Net unrealized losses related to commodity contracts held by the Company were not material at April 30, 2003 or May 1, 2002. EFFECT OF HYPOTHETICAL 10% FLUCTUATION IN MARKET PRICES: As of April 30, 2003, the potential gain or loss in the fair value of the Companys outstanding foreign currency contracts, interest rate contracts and commodity contracts assuming a hypothetical 10% fluctuation in currency rates, swap rates and market prices, respectively, would be approximately: (Dollars in millions) Fair Value Effect Foreign currency contracts................................ $ 56 Interest rate swap contracts.............................. $117 Commodity contracts....................................... $ 2 However, it should be noted that any change in the fair value of the contracts, real or hypothetical, would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items. In relation to currency contracts, this hypothetical calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. DISCUSSION OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In the ordinary course of business, the Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions. The Company believes that the following discussion addresses the Companys most critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results and require managements most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Marketing Costs Trade promotions are an important component of the sales and marketing of the Companys products, and are critical to the support of its business. Trade promotion costs include amounts paid to encourage retailers to offer temporary price reductions for the sale of the Companys products to consumers, amounts paid to obtain favorable display positions in retailers stores, and amounts paid to customers for shelf space in retail stores. Accruals for trade promotions are recorded primarily at the time of sale of product to the customer based on expected levels of performance. Settlement of these liabilities typically occurs in subsequent periods primarily through an authorized process for deductions taken by a customer from amounts otherwise due to the Company. As a result, the ultimate cost of a trade promotion program is dependent on the relative success of the events and the actions and level of deductions taken by the Companys 23 customers for amounts they consider due to them. Final determination of the permissible deductions may take extended periods of time. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost is principally determined by the average cost method. The Company records adjustments to the carrying value of inventory based upon its forecasted plans to sell its inventories. The physical condition (e.g., age and quality) of the inventories is also considered in establishing its valuation. These adjustments are estimates, which could vary significantly, either favorably or unfavorably, from actual requirements if future economic conditions, customer inventory levels or competitive conditions differ from our expectations. Property, Plant and Equipment Land, buildings and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated on a straight line method over the estimated useful lives of such assets. Changes in circumstances such as technological advances, changes to the Companys business model or changes in the Companys capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from the Companys estimates. In those cases where the Company determines that the useful life of buildings and equipment should be shortened, the Company would depreciate the net book value in excess of the salvage value, over its revised remaining useful life thereby increasing depreciation expense. Factors such as changes in the planned use of fixtures or software or closing of facilities could result in shortened useful lives. Long lived Assets Long lived assets including fixed assets and intangible assets with finite useful lives are evaluated periodically by the Company for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable. If the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value, the Company recognizes an impairment loss, measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. The estimate of cash flow requires significant management judgement and requires, among other things, certain assumptions about future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, foreign exchange rates, devaluation and inflation, and as such may differ from actual cash flows. Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangibles Carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed periodically for possible impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets". The Companys impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant management judgments similar to those noted above for long lived assets, and to the selection of an appropriate discount rate. Impairment occurs when the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the discounted present value of the cash flows for that reporting unit. An impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows, which represents the estimated fair value of the asset. The Company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations. Indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors, unanticipated technological change or competitive activities, loss of key personnel, acts by governments and courts, may signal that an asset has become impaired. Retirement Benefits The Company sponsors pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering substantially all employees who meet eligibility requirements. Several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, turnover rates and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the Company, within certain guidelines. The discount rate assumptions used to value pension and postretirement benefit obligations reflect the rates available on high quality fixed income investments available (in each country that the Company operates a benefit plan) as of the measurement date. The weighted average discount rate for the year ending April 30, 2003 was reduced to 5.9% from 6.6% as of May 1, 2002, and 6.7% as of May 2, 2001 reflecting the declining interest rate environment. 24 Over time, the expected rate of return on pension plan assets should approximate the actual long term returns. In developing the expected rate of return, the Company considers actual real historic returns of asset classes, the investment mix of plan assets, investment manager performance and projected future returns of asset classes developed by respected consultants. The weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets was 8.9% for the year ending April 30, 2003 and 9.2% as of May 1, 2002. For purposes of calculating Fiscal 2004 expense, the weighted average rate of return will be reduced to approximately 8.2%. In addition, the Companys actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate these factors. The actuarial assumptions used by the Company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants. These differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense recorded by the Company. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes". Judgment is required in determining the Companys worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of the Companys global business, there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. The Company adjusts its income tax provision in the period it is probable that actual results will differ from its estimates. Tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted. The Company records valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. When assessing the need for valuation allowances, the Company considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years, the Company would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding increase or charge to income. INFLATION In general, costs are affected by inflation and the effects of inflation may be experienced by the Company in future periods. Management believes, however, that such effects have not been material to the Company during the past three years in the United States or foreign non hyperinflationary countries. The Company operates in certain countries around the world, such as Argentina, Venezuela and Zimbabwe, that have experienced hyperinflation. In hyperinflationary foreign countries, the Company attempts to mitigate the effects of inflation by increasing prices in line with inflation, where possible, and efficiently managing its working capital levels. The impact of inflation on both the Companys financial position and results of operations is not expected to adversely affect Fiscal 2004 results. The Companys financial position continues to remain strong, enabling it to meet cash requirements for operations, including anticipated additional pension plan contributions, capital expansion programs and dividends to shareholders. 25 STOCK MARKET INFORMATION H.
