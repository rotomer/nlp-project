ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW We manufacture and market an extensive line of processed food products throughout the world. Our principal products include ketchup, condiments and sauces, frozen food, soups, beans and pasta meals, tuna and other seafood products, infant food and other processed food products. Our products are sold under highly competitive conditions, with many large and small competitors. We regard our principal competition to be other manufacturers of processed foods, including branded retail products, foodservice products and private label products that compete with us for consumer preference, distribution, shelf space and merchandising support. Product quality and consumer value are important areas of competition. The following is a summary of the business measures for Fiscal 2004 and 2003 utilized by Senior Management and the Board of Directors to gauge our business operating performance. Management believes the adjusted GAAP measures provide additional clarity in understanding the trends of the business as they provide management with a view of the business excluding special items in both periods: KEY PERFORMANCE MEASURES Change Better/(Worse) April 28, 2004 April 30, 2003 Continuing Operations (FY04) (FY03) FY04 vs. FY03 (Dollars in millions) Net Sales............................................... $8,415 $8,237 2.2% Gross Profit Margin..................................... 36.7% 35.6% 1.1pp Adjusted Gross Profit Margin (1)........................ 36.7% 36.3% 0.5pp Marketing (% of Net Sales).............................. 3.6% 3.6% Operating Income........................................ $1,379 $1,174 17.5% Adjusted Operating Income (2)........................... $1,372 $1,361 0.8% Capital Expenditures (% of Net Sales)................... 2.8% 1.9% (0.9)pp Cash Conversion Cycle................................... 64 75 11 days Cash provided by operations less capital expenditures ("Operating Free Cash Flow").......................... $1,017 $ 752 $265 Net Debt Excl.

Adjusted gross profit for Fiscal 2003 excludes from reported gross profit ($2,932.5 million) Del Monte transaction related costs and costs to reduce overhead of the remaining businesses of $6.1 million and losses on the exit of non strategic businesses of $47.3 million. (2) Adjusted operating income for Fiscal 2004 excludes from reported operating income ($1,379.3 million) the gain on the disposal of a bakery business in Northern Europe of $28.8 million, reorganization costs of $17.1 million, and $4.0 million for the write down of pizza crust assets in the United Kingdom. Adjusted operating income for Fiscal 2003 excludes from reported operating income ($1,173.8 million) Del Monte transaction related costs and costs to reduce 11 overhead of the remaining businesses of $125.0 million and losses on the exit of non strategic businesses of $62.4 million. (3) Net debt is defined as total debt, less cash and cash equivalents and the value of interest rate swaps of $125.3 million and $294.8 million for Fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively. Also, in order to provide more meaningful comparisons in prior periods, the current period calculation of net debt is shown excluding the effects of the prospective classification of Heinz Finance Companys $325 million of mandatorily redeemable preferred shares from minority interest to long term debt beginning in the second quarter of Fiscal 2004 as a result of the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 150. Management uses the net debt balance of the Company as an additional important measure of the Companys liquidity and financial condition. (4) Adjusted Pre Tax ROIC for Fiscal 2004 excludes from reported ROIC (24.5%) the gain on the disposal of a bakery business in Northern Europe of $26.3 million, reorganization costs of $17.1 million, and $4.0 million for the write down of pizza crust assets in the United Kingdom. Adjusted Pre Tax ROIC for Fiscal 2003 excludes from reported ROIC (19.0%) Del Monte transaction related costs and costs to reduce overhead of the remaining businesses of $164.6 million and losses on the exit of non strategic businesses of $62.4 million. The Fiscal 2004 results were in line with the Companys expectations as: Overall, net sales increased 2.2% to $8.41 billion. Volume improved 0.4%, driven by solid growth in the U.S. Foodservice and Asia/Pacific segments. These increases were partially offset by declines in Europe, relating primarily to a reduction in promotional support and trade inventories in advance of a major restage of the Italian infant feeding business in Fiscal 2005. Overall, this positive volume performance was a solid result in light of our significant reduction of low volume and low profit Stock Keeping Units ("SKUs"). Average pricing was down 0.3%, largely as a result of our Every Day Low Pricing strategy in U.S. Consumer Products and market price pressure in our Tegel poultry business in New Zealand. Foreign exchange for the year contributed 7.3% to growth, which was largely offset by net divestitures and the deconsolidation of Zimbabwe in Fiscal 2003. Adjusted gross profit margin (defined as adjusted gross profit as a percentage of net sales) increased by 50 basis points to 36.7%, primarily driven by our continuing focus on process and system improvements, productivity initiatives and elimination of low profit SKUs. These gains were partially offset by lower average net pricing and increased supply chain costs in the European seafood business. Consumer marketing was stable for the year at 3.6% of net sales as resources were focused on improved pricing. Adjusted operating income increased 0.8% as improvements in the base business were partially offset by the negative impact of the deconsolidation of Zimbabwe and increased pension costs. Capital expenditures were 2.8% of net sales, resulting in a two year average of 2.3% for Fiscal 2003 and 2004. The cash conversion cycle continued to show strong improvement, dropping by 11 days to 64 days. As a result, our operating free cash flow was very strong for the year, improving 35.2% to $1.02 billion. This strong operating free cash continues to allow the Company to reinvest in the business, pay dividends, repurchase shares, and retire debt. Net Debt, excluding the impact of SFAS No. 150, was $490 million better than last year, bringing the cumulative reduction to $1.8 billion over two years. Adjusted pre tax ROIC was up 200 basis points at 24.4%. 12 SPECIAL ITEMS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS On December 20, 2002, Heinz transferred to a wholly owned subsidiary ("SKF Foods") certain assets and liabilities, including its U.S. and Canadian pet food and pet snacks, U.S. tuna, U.S. retail private label soup and private label gravy, College Inn broths and its U.S. infant feeding businesses and distributed all of the shares of SKF Foods common stock on a pro rata basis to its shareholders. Immediately thereafter, SKF Foods merged with a wholly owned subsidiary of Del Monte Foods Company ("Del Monte") resulting in SKF Foods becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Del Monte. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the operating results related to these businesses spun off to Del Monte have been treated as discontinued operations in the Companys consolidated statements of income. Income from discontinued operations for Fiscal 2004 relates to a favorable settlement of prior year tax liabilities related to the spun off businesses. The discontinued operations generated sales of $1,091.3 million and $1,817.0 million and net income of $88.7 million (net of $35.4 million in tax) and $158.7 million (net of $69.4 million in tax) for Fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively. DIVESTITURES AND OTHER REORGANIZATION COSTS During Fiscal 2004, the Company sold its bakery business in Northern Europe for $57.9 million. The transaction resulted in a pretax gain of $26.3 million ($13.3 million after tax) which was used to offset the reorganization costs discussed below and was recorded as a component of Selling, General and Administrative expense ("SG&A"). This sale impacted approximately 70 employees. Additionally, the Company recognized reorganization costs of $17.1 million pretax ($11.0 million after tax) in Fiscal 2004. These costs were recorded as a component of SG&A and were primarily due to employee termination and severance costs. Also, during Fiscal 2004, the Company wrote down pizza crust assets in the United Kingdom totaling $4.0 million pretax ($2.8 million after tax) which has been included as a component of cost of products sold. Management estimates that these actions impacted approximately 100 employees. In Fiscal 2003, Del Monte transaction costs and costs to reduce overhead of the remaining business totaled $164.6 million pretax ($113.1 million after tax) and were comprised of $61.8 million for legal, professional and other related costs, $51.3 million in employee termination and severance costs, $39.6 million related to the early retirement of debt and $12.0 million in non cash asset write downs. Of this amount, $6.1 million was included in cost of products sold, $118.9 million in SG&A, and $39.6 million in other expenses, net. Management estimates that these actions impacted approximately 400 employees excluding those who were transferred to Del Monte. In Fiscal 2003, losses on the exit of non strategic businesses, primarily the U.K. frozen pizza business and a North American fish and frozen vegetable business, totaled $62.4 million pretax ($49.3 million after tax), and were comprised of $39.7 million in non cash asset write downs, $12.1 million in losses on the sale of businesses and $10.6 million in employee termination, severance and other exit costs. Of these amounts, $47.3 million was included in cost of products sold and $15.1 million in SG&A. Management estimates that these actions impacted approximately 600 employees. During Fiscal 2004, the Company utilized $49.7 million in severance and exit cost accruals related to reorganization costs. 13 STREAMLINE In the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2001, the Company announced a restructuring initiative named "Streamline". This initiative included a worldwide organizational restructuring aimed at reducing overhead costs and was completed in the first half of Fiscal 2003. During Fiscal 2003, the Company utilized $19.4 million of severance and exit cost accruals, principally related to its global overhead reduction plan, primarily in Europe and North America. In addition, as a result of the spin off of SKF Foods, a $3.4 million restructuring liability related to ceasing canned pet food production at the Companys Terminal Island, California facility was transferred to Del Monte. During the first quarter of Fiscal 2002, the Company recognized restructuring and implementation charges totaling $8.3 million pretax ($6.1 million after tax). In the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2002, the Company recorded a net charge of $4.1 million pretax ($2.8 million after tax) to reflect revisions in original cost estimates. This charge was primarily a result of higher than expected severance costs (primarily in Europe and the U.S.). Total Fiscal 2002 pretax charges of $3.8 million were classified as cost of products sold and $8.6 million as SG&A. RESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS In the first quarter of Fiscal 2004, the Company changed its segment reporting to reflect changes in organizational structure and the management of its business. The Company is now managing and reporting its North American businesses under two segments, which are designated North American Consumer Products and U.S. Foodservice. Certain changes were also made to the composition of the remaining segments. These changes involve the reclassification of certain operating and non operating businesses between existing segments. Prior periods have been restated to conform with the current presentation. (Segment information is set forth in this report on pages 58 through 61 in Note 16, "Segment Information" in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.") FISCAL YEARS ENDED APRIL 28, 2004 AND APRIL 30, 2003 Sales for Fiscal 2004 increased $177.7 million, or 2.2%, to $8.41 billion. Sales were favorably impacted by volume of 0.4% and exchange translation rates of 7.3%. The favorable volume impact is primarily due to strong increases in the U.S. Foodservice and Asia/Pacific segments. These increases were partially offset by the impact of SKU rationalization and declines in Europe, relating primarily to a reduction in promotional support and trade inventories in advance of a major restage of the Italian infant feeding business in Fiscal 2005. Lower pricing decreased sales by 0.3%, primarily reflecting the Companys goal to achieve more competitive net pricing under the Every Day Low Pricing Strategy in the U.S. retail businesses as well as market price pressure in the Tegel poultry business in New Zealand. Divestitures, net of acquisitions, reduced sales 5.3% due primarily to the deconsolidation of Zimbabwe in the third quarter of the prior year. Domestic operations contributed approximately 38% of consolidated sales in Fiscal 2004 and Fiscal 2003. Gross profit increased $155.8 million, or 5.3%, to $3.09 billion, and the gross profit margin increased to 36.7% from 35.6%. The gross profit margin increase was primarily driven by the Companys continuing focus on process and system improvements, productivity initiatives and elimination of less profitable SKUs. These gains were partially offset by lower overall net pricing for the Company and increased supply chain costs in the European seafood business. The aggregate increase in gross profit also benefited from favorable exchange translation rates, partially offset by the impact of higher pension costs, divestitures and the write down of U.K. pizza crust assets in the U.K. For Fiscal 2003, gross profit was also impacted by Del Monte transaction related costs, costs to reduce overhead of the remaining businesses of $6.1 million and losses on the exit of non strategic businesses of $47.3 million. 14 SG&A decreased $49.7 million, or 2.8%, to $1.71 billion, and, as a percentage of sales, was reduced to 20.3% from 21.4%. The decrease is primarily due to the gain recorded on the sale of the Northern European Bakery business in the current year, and decreased marketing expense primarily in the North American Consumer Products segment reflecting the Companys goal to achieve more competitive net pricing as discussed above. Additionally, SG&A was impacted in Fiscal 2004 by reorganization costs of $17.1 million, and in Fiscal 2003 by Del Monte transaction related costs, costs to reduce overhead of the remaining businesses of $118.9 million, and losses on the exit of non strategic businesses of $15.1 million. The favorable impact of these items was offset by increases in pension and personnel costs. Total marketing support (recorded either as a reduction of revenue or as a component of SG&A) increased $179.4 million, or 8.0%, to $2.44 billion on a sales increase of 2.2%. Operating income increased $205.4 million, or 17.5%, to $1.38 billion, and increased as a percentage of sales to 16.4% from 14.3% as a result of the changes noted above. Net interest expense decreased $3.9 million, to $188.5 million, due to lower debt balances and lower interest rates. This decrease was partially offset by the prospective classification of the Heinz Finance Companys dividend on its mandatorily redeemable preferred shares to interest expense from other expense. This treatment is in accordance with the adoption of SFAS No. 150 (see below for further discussion) beginning in the second quarter of Fiscal 2004. Other expense, net, decreased $90.4 million, to $22.2 million, attributable to a $39.6 million pretax charge related to early retirement of debt in Fiscal 2003, decreased minority interest expense as a result of the Zimbabwe deconsolidation, the SFAS No. 150 reclassification previously discussed and increased equity income. The effective tax rate for the current year was 33.3% compared to 36.1% last year due primarily to improved country mix and effective tax planning. The current year effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by 0.4 percentage points due to the sale of the Northern European bakery business and the prior year effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by 1.6 percentage points due in part to the loss on the disposal of a North American fish and vegetable business. Income from continuing operations for Fiscal 2004 was $778.9 million compared to $555.4 million in Fiscal 2003 (before the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle related to the adoption of SFAS No. 142). Diluted earnings per share was $2.20 in the current year compared to $1.57 in the prior year (before the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle related to the adoption of SFAS No. 142). The impact of fluctuating exchange rates for Fiscal 2004 remained relatively consistent on a line by line basis throughout the consolidated statement of income. FISCAL YEAR 2004 OPERATING RESULTS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT NORTH AMERICAN CONSUMER PRODUCTS Sales of the North American Consumer Products segment decreased $49.1 million, or 2.3%. Sales volume decreased 0.2% as strong increases in Heinz ketchup and frozen potatoes were more than offset by declines in SmartOnes frozen entrees, related to the increased popularity of low carb dieting, which drove declines in the nutritional frozen entree category in the U.S., as well as the effects of the rationalization of Boston Market side dishes and Hot Bites snacks. Lower pricing decreased sales 1.6% consistent with our strategy to obtain more competitive consumer price points on Boston Market HomeStyle meals, Heinz gravy, Classico pasta sauces, SmartOnes frozen entrees and Delimex frozen snacks. Sales increased 0.4% due to the Canadian acquisition of Unifine Richardson B.V., which manufactures and sells salad dressings, sauces, and dessert toppings. Divestitures in the prior year reduced sales 2.9% and favorable exchange translation rates increased sales 1.9%. 15 Gross profit decreased $2.9 million, or 0.3%, to $872.8 million; however, the gross profit margin increased to 42.3% from 41.4% as manufacturing cost savings, reflecting significant productivity initiatives and more effective and efficient new product launches, offset unfavorable pricing and higher commodity costs. In addition, reorganization costs unfavorably impacted gross profit by $4.9 million in Fiscal 2003. Operating income increased $82.5 million, or 21.1%, to $474.1 million, primarily due to decreased consumer marketing expenses related to the prior year launch of Easy Squeeze!, Boston Market frozen entrees and Hot Bites snacks, and Ore Ida Funky Fries. In addition, Fiscal 2004 operating income was unfavorably impacted by reorganization costs of $5.3 million and Fiscal 2003 operating income was unfavorably impacted by Del Monte transaction related costs and costs to reduce overhead of the remaining businesses and losses on the exit of non strategic businesses of $60.9 million. U.S. FOODSERVICE U.S. Foodservices sales increased $113.2 million, or 8.6%. Sales volume increased sales 2.4% primarily due to increases in Heinz ketchup, Escalon processed tomato products, Diannes frozen desserts and single serve condiments as a result of new customers, successful product innovation and a strengthening trend in the U.S. restaurant industry. Higher pricing increased sales by 2.7% chiefly due to Heinz ketchup and single serve condiments. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased sales 3.6%, primarily due to the acquisition of Truesoups LLC, a manufacturer and marketer of premium frozen soups. Gross profit increased $34.8 million, or 9.3%, to $409.3 million, and the gross profit margin increased slightly to 28.6% from 28.5%. These increases are primarily due to favorable pricing and sales mix, partially offset by higher commodity costs. In addition, reorganization costs unfavorably impacted gross profit by $1.1 million for Fiscal 2003. Operating income increased $19.4 million, or 10.1%, to $211.1 million, primarily due to the growth in gross profit, partially offset by the impact of higher sales volume on Selling & Distribution expenses ("S&D") and increased General & Administrative expenses ("G&A") attributable to increased personnel and systems costs. In addition, reorganization costs unfavorably impacted operating income by $3.9 million in Fiscal 2004 and Del Monte transaction related costs and costs to reduce overhead of the remaining businesses and losses on the exit of non strategic businesses unfavorably impacted operating income by $5.9 million for Fiscal 2003. EUROPE Heinz Europes sales increased $251.2 million, or 8.3%. Favorable exchange translation rates increased sales by 12.2%. Volumes declined 1.4% due to decreases in Italian infant feeding, in advance of a restaging in early Fiscal 2005, and in convenience meals, due to promotional timing and the impact of our previously announced program to reduce low margin SKUs. These decreases were partially offset by increases in Heinz ketchup from the successful introduction of the top down bottle, and increases in Heinz salad cream, Petite Navire seafood due to the rebound from the prior year recall and frozen food products. Pricing decreased 0.3% as price increases on Heinz beans, ready to serve soups, and pasta meals were offset by increased trade promotion spending related to seafood. Also, prices were lower in Northern Europe as a result of the Netherlands largest retailer rolling back prices in excess of 8% beginning in the second quarter. Divestitures reduced sales 2.2%, primarily related to the sale of the U.K. frozen pizza business, the Northern European bakery business and a foodservice business in Italy. Gross profit increased $128.8 million, or 11.3%, to $1,264.8 million, and the gross profit margin increased to 38.5% from 37.4%. The increase in gross profit is primarily due to favorable exchange translation rates, partially offset by increased supply chain costs in our European seafood business, the volume related impact of reduced promotions in Heinzs Italian baby food business, the impact of divestitures and the write down of the U.K. pizza assets. Additionally, gross profit was unfavorably impacted by $47.4 million for reorganization costs and losses on the 16 exit of non strategic businesses in Fiscal 2003. Operating income increased $97.4 million, or 18.0%, to $639.2 million, primarily attributable to the favorable change in gross profit and the gain on the sale of the Northern European bakery business, partially offset by increased G&A expense primarily related to increased pension expense in the U.K. Operating income was unfavorably impacted by $58.9 million for reorganization costs and losses on the exit of non strategic businesses in Fiscal 2003. ASIA/PACIFIC Sales in Asia/Pacific increased $179.7 million, or 16.7%. Favorable exchange translation rates increased sales by 16.2%. Volume increased sales 2.6% primarily due to strong sales of Heinz ketchup, Tegel poultry in New Zealand, Heinz soups in Australia, and ABC sauces in Indonesia. Lower pricing decreased sales 1.8% related to lower prices on Tegel poultry in New Zealand, partially offset by price increases in Indonesia on ABC sauces and juice concentrates. Divestitures, net of acquisitions, reduced sales 0.5%. Gross profit increased $67.9 million, or 19.8%, to $410.5 million, and the gross profit margin increased to 32.6% from 31.8%. These increases are primarily due to favorable exchange translation rates and supply chain improvements in our Australian and Watties businesses, partially offset by Tegel poultrys lower pricing and higher commodity costs. Operating income increased $45.7 million, or 45.5%, to $146.2 million, primarily due to the growth in gross profit and G&A reductions in our Australian and Watties businesses, partially offset by the impact of exchange translation rates on SG&A expenses. Additionally, operating income was unfavorably impacted by reorganization costs of $6.6 million in Fiscal 2003. OTHER OPERATING ENTITIES Sales for Other Operating Entities decreased $317.3 million, or 45.9%, primarily due to the deconsolidation of the Companys Zimbabwe operations in Fiscal 2003. The deconsolidation also impacted gross profit and operating income. Gross profit decreased $83.1 million, or 40.9%, to $120.2 million, and operating income decreased $81.3 million, or 73.1%, to $29.9 million. Excluding the Zimbabwe operations in the prior year, sales increased 14.3%, primarily due to volume increases of 6.2%, and operating income decreased 15.3%. Other than the impact of Zimbabwe, the other significant impact on operating income was the recall in the third quarter of Fiscal 2004 of a soy based infant formula product sold under the Remedia brand in Israel. Zimbabwe remains in a period of economic uncertainty. Should the current situation continue, the Company could experience disruptions and delays associated with its Zimbabwe operations. Therefore, as of the end of November 2002, the Company deconsolidated its Zimbabwean operations and classified its remaining net investment of approximately $110 million as a cost investment included in other non current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Although the Companys business continues to operate and it is able to source raw materials, the countrys economic situation remains uncertain and the Companys ability to recover its investment could become impaired. FISCAL YEARS ENDED APRIL 30, 2003 AND MAY 1, 2002 Sales for Fiscal 2003 increased $622.8 million, or 8.2%, to $8.24 billion. Sales were favorably impacted by pricing of 4.2%, foreign exchange translation rates of 5.6% and acquisitions of 2.2%. The favorable impact of acquisitions is primarily related to prior year acquisitions in the North American Consumer Products and U.S. Foodservice segments. The favorable pricing was realized primarily in certain highly inflationary countries, Europe and Asia/Pacific. Sales were negatively impacted by unfavorable volumes of 2.0%, due mainly to certain highly inflationary countries and the North American Consumer Products segment, as well as the continued impact of the previously announced SKU rationalization of low margin products across the Company. Divestitures 17 reduced sales by 1.8%. Domestic operations contributed approximately 38% of consolidated sales in Fiscal 2003 compared to 41% in Fiscal 2002. Gross profit increased $176.5 million, or 6.4%, to $2.93 billion and the gross profit margin decreased slightly to 35.6% from 36.2%. This gross profit increase was primarily a result of favorable pricing and exchange translation rates and the benefit of reduced amortization of intangible assets of approximately $47.9 million, partially offset by the impact related to Del Monte transaction related costs and costs to reduce overhead of the remaining businesses and losses on the exit of non strategic businesses of $53.4 million in Fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2002 operating income was also unfavorably impacted by $3.8 million for net Streamline restructuring charges and implementation costs. SG&A increased $302.6 million, or 20.8%, to $1.76 billion and increased as a percentage of sales to 21.4% from 19.1%. The increase is primarily driven by the impact of Del Monte transaction related costs and costs to reduce overhead of the remaining businesses and losses on the exit of non strategic businesses of $134.0 million in Fiscal 2003, increased S&D expenses, increased marketing spend across all segments and increased G&A expenses in the Europe and Asia/Pacific segments. Fiscal 2002 SG&A was also impacted by $8.6 million for net Streamline restructuring charges and implementation costs. Total marketing support (recorded either as a reduction of revenue or as a component of SG&A) increased $199.2 million, or 9.7%, to $2.26 billion on a sales increase of 8.2%. Operating income decreased $126.1 million, or 9.7%, to $1.17 billion and decreased as a percentage of sales to 14.3% from 17.1%. This decrease was primarily driven by the impact of Del Monte transaction related costs and costs to reduce overhead of the remaining businesses and losses on the exit of non strategic businesses of $187.4 million in Fiscal 2003 and the North American Consumer Products and U.S. Foodservice segments partially offset by increases in the Europe and Asia/Pacific segments due to favorable exchange rates and pricing. Fiscal 2002 operating income was also unfavorably impacted by $12.4 million net Streamline restructuring charges and implementation costs. Net interest expense decreased $12.0 million to $192.4 million, driven by lower interest rates and lower average debt. Other expense increased $67.7 million to $112.6 million. The increase is primarily attributable to the $39.6 million pretax charge related to early retirement of debt and increases in minority interest expense, largely related to increased profitability in the joint venture in Zimbabwe. The effective tax rate for Fiscal 2003 was 36.1% compared to 35.7% in Fiscal 2002. The effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by 1.6 percentage points in Fiscal 2003 due in part to the loss on disposal of a North American fish and vegetable business. Net income for Fiscal 2003 (before the effect of change in accounting principle related to the adoption of SFAS No. 142) was $555.4 million compared to $675.2 million in the prior year. Diluted earnings per share (before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle related to the adoption of SFAS No. 142) was $1.57 in Fiscal 2003 compared to $1.91 in Fiscal 2002. The impact of fluctuating exchange rates for Fiscal 2003 remained relatively consistent on a line by line basis throughout the consolidated statement of income. FISCAL YEAR 2003 OPERATING RESULTS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT NORTH AMERICAN CONSUMER PRODUCTS Sales of the North American Consumer Products segment increased $8.1 million, or 0.4%, to $2.11 billion. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased sales 3.3%, due primarily to the prior year acquisitions of Classico and Aunt Millies pasta sauces, Mrs. Grass Recipe soups, Wylers bouillons and soups, Delimex frozen Mexican foods, Poppers retail frozen appetizers and licensing rights to the T.G.I. Fridays brand of frozen snacks and appetizers. Higher pricing increased sales 0.5%, due 18 mainly to Heinz ketchup, Jack Daniels marinades and grilling sauces, Ore Ida frozen potatoes and a reduction in trade promotions related to the launch of Hot Bites in the prior year, partially offset by Boston Market HomeStyle meals and appetizers and SmartOnes frozen entrees. Sales volume decreased 3.5% as growth in SmartOnes frozen entrees and specialty sauces was offset by decreases primarily in Heinz ketchup and vinegar, Boston Market HomeStyle side dishes, Ore Ida Funky Fries and Hot Bites. Favorable exchange translation rates increased sales 0.3%. Gross profit decreased $27.2 million, or 3.0%, to $875.7 million, and the gross profit margin decreased to 41.4% from 42.9% due primarily to unfavorable sales mix, increased manufacturing costs and costs to exit the Ore Ida Funky Fries and Hot Bites product lines, partially offset by reduced amortization expense on intangible assets with indefinite lives, favorable pricing and acquisitions. Gross profit was also unfavorably impacted in Fiscal 2003 by $4.9 million for Del Monte transaction related costs and costs to reduce overhead of the remaining businesses, and in Fiscal 2002 by $2.4 million for net Streamline restructuring charges and implementation costs. Operating income decreased $114.1 million, or 22.6%, to $391.7 million due primarily to the change in gross profit, higher S&D and increased marketing primarily behind Heinz Easy Squeeze! ketchup, Classico pasta sauce, SmartOnes frozen entrees and Ore Ida frozen potatoes. Additionally, operating income was unfavorably impacted by Del Monte transaction related costs and costs to reduce overhead of the remaining businesses and losses on the exit of non strategic businesses in Fiscal 2003 of $60.9 million and in Fiscal 2002 by net Streamline restructuring charges and implementation costs of $6.1 million. U.S. FOODSERVICE Sales of the U.S. Foodservice segment increased $32.9 million, or 2.6%, to $1.32 billion. Acquisitions increased sales 2.3%, due to the acquisition of Diannes frozen desserts. Lower pricing decreased sales 0.3%. Sales volume increased 0.5% due primarily to Heinz ketchup and Diannes frozen desserts. Gross profit decreased $2.2 million, or 0.6%, to $374.5 million, and the gross profit margin decreased to 28.5% from 29.4% due primarily to unfavorable sales mix and increased manufacturing costs, partially offset by favorable pricing. Operating income decreased $31.0 million, or 13.9%, to $191.7 million due primarily to higher S&D and G&A expenses, increased marketing primarily behind the ketchup "Insist on Heinz" campaign. Operating income was also unfavorably impacted by costs to reduce overhead of the remaining businesses and losses on the exit of non strategic businesses in Fiscal 2003 of $5.9 million. EUROPE Heinz Europes sales increased $300.9 million, or 11.0%, to $3.04 billion. Favorable exchange translation rates increased sales by 11.5%. Higher pricing increased sales 1.5%, primarily due to Heinz beans, ketchup and soups. Lower volume decreased sales 1.3%, driven primarily by planned SKU rationalizations and frozen pizza, partially offset by volume increases in ketchup and frozen entrees. Divestitures reduced sales by 0.7%. Gross profit increased $101.4 million, or 9.8%, to $1.14 billion; however, the gross profit margin decreased to 37.4% from 37.8%. The increase in gross profit is due primarily to favorable foreign exchange rates, pricing and reduced amortization expense related to intangible assets. This increase was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of $47.4 million related to reorganization costs and losses on the exit of non strategic businesses in Fiscal 2003. Operating income increased $12.8 million, or 2.4%, to $541.7 million, primarily attributable to the favorable change in gross profit, offset partially by increased SG&A expenses. Fiscal 2003 operating income was also unfavorably impacted by $58.9 million related to reorganization costs and losses on the exit of non strategic businesses, and Fiscal 2002 operating income was unfavorably impacted by net Streamline restructuring charges and implementation costs of $3.6 million. 19 ASIA/PACIFIC Sales in Asia/Pacific increased $166.3 million, or 18.2%, to $1.08 billion. Favorable exchange translation rates increased sales by 12.9%. Higher pricing increased sales 3.8%, primarily due to Heinz ready to serve soups, poultry, juices/drinks and sauces. Volume decreased sales 0.1%, driven primarily by declines driven by planned SKU rationalizations and decreases in cooking oils and frozen vegetables offset by increases in sauces, poultry and ketchup. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased sales by 1.6%. Gross profit increased $73.7 million, or 27.4%, to $342.7 million, and the gross profit margin increased to 31.8% from 29.5%. These increases were due primarily to favorable foreign exchange rates, increased pricing and reduced manufacturing costs. During Fiscal 2003, the Company made significant progress in improving its supply chain and net pricing across our businesses in Australia, New Zealand and Japan. Operating income increased $29.0 million, or 40.5%, to $100.5 million, primarily due to the change in gross profit, offset partially by increased marketing and G&A expenses. Fiscal 2003 operating income was also unfavorably impacted by $6.6 million related to reorganization costs. OTHER OPERATING ENTITIES Sales for Other Operating Entities increased $114.6 million, or 19.8%, to $691.9 million primarily due to favorable pricing in Zimbabwe. Gross profit increased $28.5 million, or 16.3%, due primarily to favorable pricing. Operating income increased $35.2 million due primarily to the increase in gross profit; however, more than half of this increase was offset by increased minority interest expense recorded below operating income. LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL POSITION Cash provided by continuing operating activities in Fiscal 2004 increased by more than 37% to $1,249.0 million from $906.0 million last year. The increase in Fiscal 2004 versus Fiscal 2003 is primarily due to reductions in working capital, particularly accounts receivable and accounts payable, across the Company which resulted in the 11 day improvement in the Companys cash conversion cycle versus the year ago period. The Company contributed $202 million to its pension plans in Fiscal 2004 compared to $224 million of contributions in Fiscal 2003. Cash used for investing activities totaled $261.1 million compared to cash provided by investing activities of $961.1 million last year. Cash provided by the spin off of assets to Del Monte was $1,063.6 million in the prior year. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, used $41.7 million in cash in Fiscal 2004 compared to providing $41.4 million in the prior year. Capital expenditures totaled $232.0 million compared to $154.0 million last year and are expected to increase slightly in Fiscal 2005 when compared with Fiscal 2004. Cash used for financing activities totaled $643.9 million compared to $1,416.5 million last year. The Company paid down $74.3 million in long term debt during Fiscal 2004, compared to $741.2 million last year. Payments on commercial paper and short term borrowings required $144.7 million in Fiscal 2004 compared to $176.2 million last year. Cash used for purchases of treasury stock, net of proceeds from option exercises, was $57.4 million this year. There were no treasury stock purchases in the prior year, and proceeds from option exercises provided $7.5 million in the prior year. Dividend payments totaled $379.9 million compared to $521.6 million for the same period last year reflecting a reduction in the dividend rate in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2003 as a result of the spin off of SKF Foods. On March 10, 2004, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a 5.5% increase in the annual dividend on common stock for Fiscal 2005 (from 27 cents to 28.5 cents per quarter), effective with the July 2004 dividend. Fiscal 2005 dividends are expected to approximate $400 million. 20 The Companys primary measure of cash flow performance is operating free cash flow. For Fiscal 2004, the Company achieved record operating free cash flow totaling $1,017.0 million as compared to $752.1 million for the same period a year ago, or an increase of 35.2%. The increase in operating free cash flow is the result of higher net income and improved working capital performance, partially offset by increased capital expenditures. The strong cash flow performance allowed the Company to make voluntary contributions to several of the Companys pension plans in the amount of $152 million. The Company anticipates that operating free cash flow for Fiscal 2005 should be in the range of $800 million to $1.0 billion. In Fiscal 2004, the Company continued its debt reduction efforts by retiring approximately $219 million of debt, offset by an increase in debt of $89 million as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates. At April 28, 2004, the Companys net debt was $3.7 billion. Excluding the reclassification of Heinz Finance Companys preferred stock (see below for further discussion), net debt would have been $3.3 billion, down approximately $490 million compared to the year earlier period and down $1.8 billion since the beginning of Fiscal 2003. The Company expects that over $400 million of long term debt maturing in Fiscal 2005 will be retired. The Company has enhanced its liquidity over the past year by reducing short term debt to $11.4 million at April 28, 2004 from $146.8 million at April 30, 2003. Over the same time period, cash and cash equivalents have increased by 47.2% to $1.18 billion from $801.7 million. The Companys cash balance together with its anticipated strong operating cash flow and access to committed and uncommitted credit facilities and the capital market, if required, should enable the Company to meet its cash requirements for operations, including capital expansion programs and dividends to shareholders. Since the beginning of Fiscal 2002, the Company has significantly increased the proportion of long term debt to total debt such that at April 28, 2004 long term debt represented 91.2% of total debt as compared to a ratio of 61.7% at May 2, 2001. Through the use of interest rate swaps, the Company has converted $2.875 billion of fixed rate debt to floating rates in order to maintain our desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt, while continuing to maintain long term financing. The nature and amount of the Companys long term and short term debt as well as the proportionate amount of fixed rate and floating rate debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. Return on average shareholders equity ("ROE") was 51.6% in Fiscal 2004, 34.7% in Fiscal 2003 and 54.8% in Fiscal 2002. ROE was unfavorably impacted by 9.9% in Fiscal 2003 related to Del Monte transaction related costs, costs to reduce overhead of the remaining business and losses on the exit of non strategic businesses, and 0.6% in Fiscal 2002 related to restructuring and implementation costs of the Streamline initiative. Pretax return on average invested capital ("ROIC") was 24.5% in Fiscal 2004, 19.0% in Fiscal 2003 and 22.7% in Fiscal 2002. ROIC was favorably impacted by 0.1% in Fiscal 2004 related to the gain on the disposal of a bakery business in Northern Europe offset by reorganization costs and the write down of pizza crust assets in the United Kingdom. ROIC was unfavorably impacted by 3.5% in Fiscal 2003 related to Del Monte transaction related costs, costs to reduce overhead of the remaining business and losses on the exit of non strategic businesses, and unfavorably impacted by 0.2% in Fiscal 2002 related to restructuring and implementation costs of the Streamline initiative. In September 2001, the Company and H.J. Heinz Finance Company, a subsidiary of the Company, entered into an $800 million 364 Day Credit Agreement, and a $1.5 billion Five Year Credit Agreement, expiring in September 2006. In September 2003, the 364 day agreement was renewed and the borrowing amount was reduced to $600 million. These agreements support the Companys commercial paper borrowings and the remarketable securities. As a result, these borrowings are classified as long term debt based upon the Companys ability to refinance these borrowings on a long term basis. In addition, the Company had $944 million of foreign lines of credit available at April 28, 2004. 21 As of April 28, 2004, the Company had $800 million of remarketable securities due November 2020. These securities are subject to an annual remarketing on each November 15, and the interest rate is reset on such dates. If the securities are not remarketed, then the Company is required to repurchase all of the securities at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. On November 15, 2003, the securities were remarketed at a coupon of 5.772%. At April 28, 2004, the Companys long term debt ratings were A at Standard & Poors and Fitch and A 3 at Moodys and the Companys short term debt ratings were A 1 at Standard & Poors, F 1 at Fitch and P 2 at Moodys. In Fiscal 2004, the cash requirements of reorganization costs were approximately $47.3 million. Fiscal 2005 cash requirements related to reorganization costs are expected to be approximately $13 million. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The Company is obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. In addition, the Company has purchase obligations for materials, supplies, services and property, plant and equipment as part of the ordinary conduct of business. A few of these obligations are long term and are based on minimum purchase requirements. In the aggregate, such commitments are not at prices in excess of current markets. Due to the proprietary nature of some of the Companys materials and processes, certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions for early terminations. The Company does not believe that a material amount of penalties is reasonably likely to be incurred under these contracts based upon historical experience and current expectations. The following table represents the contractual obligations of the Company as of April 28, 2004. Less than More than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 Years 5 years Total (Dollars in millions) Long Term Debt............ $424,300 $ 498,582 $627,014 $3,265,668 $4,815,564 Capital Lease Obligations............. 3,012 5,692 5,648 37,430 51,782 Operating Leases.......... 63,928 88,457 55,237 248,448 456,070 Purchase Obligations...... 440,723 252,543 34,541 11,344 739,151 Other Long Term Liabilities Recorded on the Balance Sheet....... 60,000 167,474 145,000 158,000 530,474 Total................ $991,963 $1,012,748 $867,440 $3,720,890 $6,593,041 Other long term liabilities primarily consist of certain specific incentive compensation arrangements. The following long term liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheet are excluded from the table above: income taxes, minority interest and insurance accruals. The Company is unable to estimate the timing of the payments for these items. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS The Company does not have material financial guarantees or other contractual commitments that are reasonably likely to adversely affect liquidity. In addition, the Company does not have any related party transactions that materially affect the results of operations, cash flow or financial condition. 22 MARKET RISK FACTORS The Company is exposed to market risks from adverse changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and production costs. As a policy, the Company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor does the Company hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE SENSITIVITY: The Companys cash flow and earnings are subject to fluctuations due to exchange rate variation. Foreign currency risk exists by nature of the Companys global operations. The Company manufactures and sells its products in a number of locations around the world, and hence foreign currency risk is diversified. The Company may attempt to limit its exposure to changing foreign exchange rates through both operational and financial market actions. These actions may include entering into forward or option contracts to hedge existing exposures, firm commitments and forecasted transactions. The instruments are used to reduce risk by essentially creating offsetting currency exposures. The following table presents information related to foreign currency contracts held by the Company: Aggregate Notional Amount Net Unrealized Gains/(Losses) April 28, 2004 April 30, 2003 April 28, 2004 April 30, 2003 (Dollars in millions) Purpose of Hedge: Intercompany cash flows......... $302 $ 95 $(0.8) $0.8 Forecasted purchases of raw materials and finished goods and foreign currency denominated obligations....... 466 470 (5.8) 0.5 Forecasted sales and foreign currency denominated assets... 215 150 2.3 $983 $715 $(6.6) $3.6 As of April 28, 2004, the Companys contracts to hedge forecasted transactions mature in one year. Contracts that meet qualifying criteria are accounted for as foreign currency cash flow hedges. Accordingly, the effective portion of gains and losses is deferred as a component of other comprehensive loss and is recognized in earnings at the time the hedged item affects earnings. Any gains and losses due to hedge ineffectiveness or related to contracts which do not qualify for hedge accounting are recorded in current period earnings in other income and expense. Substantially all of the Companys foreign affiliates financial instruments are denominated in their respective functional currencies. Accordingly, exposure to exchange risk on foreign currency financial instruments is not material. (See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.) INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY: The Company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its borrowing and investing activities used to maintain liquidity and fund business operations. The nature and amount of the Companys long term and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. The Companys net debt obligations totaled $3.67 billion (or $3.34 billion excluding the reclassification of preferred stock) and $3.8 billion at April 28, 2004 and April 30, 2003, respectively. The Companys debt obligations are summarized in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. In order to manage interest rate exposure, the Company utilizes interest rate swaps in order to convert fixed rate debt to floating. These derivatives are primarily accounted for as fair value hedges. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of these derivatives, along with changes in the fair value of the hedged debt obligations that are attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in current period earnings. Based on the amount of fixed rate debt converted to floating as of April 28, 2004, a variance of 1/8% in the related interest rate would cause annual interest expense 23 related to this debt to change by approximately $3.6 million. The following table presents additional information related to interest rate contracts designated as fair value hedges by the Company: April 28, 2004 April 30, 2003 (Dollars in millions) Pay floating swaps notional amount..................... $2,767.4 $2,550.0 Net unrealized gains.................................... $ 125.3 $ 294.8 Weighted average maturity (years)....................... 12.4 14.1 Weighted average receive rate........................... 6.37% 6.47% Weighted average pay rate............................... 2.18% 2.32% The Company had interest rate contracts with total notional amounts of $907.6 million and $400 million at April 28, 2004 and April 30, 2003, respectively, that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting but effectively mitigate interest rate exposures. These derivatives are accounted for on a full mark to market basis through current earnings and their weighted average maturity is less than twelve months from the fiscal year end. In connection with one of the interest rate swaps, the Company maintains a cash investment with the counterparty and receives a market rate of interest. The amount of the cash investment fluctuates and was $165.6 million at April 28, 2004. Net unrealized gains related to these interest rate contracts totaled $4.5 million and $2.1 million at April 28, 2004 and April 30, 2003, respectively. COMMODITY PRICE SENSITIVITY: The Company is the purchaser of certain commodities such as corn, soybean oil and soybean meal. The Company generally purchases these commodities based upon market prices that are established with the vendor as part of the purchase process. The Company may enter into commodity futures, swaps and option contracts to reduce the effect of price fluctuations on forecasted purchases. The Company had no outstanding commodity contracts at April 28, 2004. The Company held commodity contracts to hedge certain forecasted purchases with a notional amount of $21 million at April 30, 2003. Such contracts generally have a term of less than one year, and are accounted for as cash flow hedges if they meet certain qualifying criteria. Accordingly, the effective portion of gains and losses is deferred as a component of other comprehensive loss and is recognized as part of cost of products sold at the time the hedged item affects earnings. Any gains and losses due to hedge ineffectiveness or related to contracts which do not qualify for hedge accounting are recorded in current period earnings in other income and expense. Net unrealized losses related to commodity contracts held by the Company were not significant at April 30, 2003. EFFECT OF HYPOTHETICAL 10% FLUCTUATION IN MARKET PRICES: As of April 28, 2004, the potential gain or loss in the fair value of the Companys outstanding foreign currency contracts and interest rate contracts assuming a hypothetical 10% fluctuation in currency rates and swap rates, respectively, would be approximately: Fair Value Effect (Dollars in millions) Foreign currency contracts.................................. $ 85 Interest rate swap contracts................................ $119 However, it should be noted that any change in the fair value of the contracts, real or hypothetical, would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items. In relation to currency contracts, this hypothetical calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. 24 RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In December, 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued a revision to SFAS No. 132, "Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits." This revised statement requires additional annual disclosures regarding types of pension plan assets, investment strategy, future plan contributions, expected benefit payments and other items. The statement also requires quarterly disclosure of the components of net periodic benefit cost and plan contributions. The annual disclosures have been included in the Companys Form 10 K for its fiscal year ended April 28, 2004, and the quarterly disclosures will be required beginning in the first quarter of Fiscal 2005. In December, 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 ("the Act") was signed into law. The Act introduced a prescription drug benefit under Medicare (Medicare Part D) and a federal subsidy to sponsors of retirement health care plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. In accordance with FASB Staff Position 106 1, the Company elected to defer recognizing the effects of the Act on the accounting for its retirement health care plans in Fiscal 2004. In May 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position 106 2, providing final guidance on accounting for the Act. The Staff Position 106 2 will be implemented by the Company in the second quarter of Fiscal 2005. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In December 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation ("FIN") No. 46 R, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities." FIN No. 46 R, which modifies certain provisions and effective dates of FIN No. 46, sets forth criteria to be used in determining whether an investment in a variable interest entity should be consolidated, and is based on the general premise that companies that control another entity through interests other than voting interests should consolidate the controlled entity. The provisions of FIN No. 46 became effective for the Company during its fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004. The adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity". This statement affects the classification, measurement and disclosure requirements of certain freestanding financial instruments including mandatorily redeemable shares. SFAS No. 150 was effective for the Company for the second quarter of Fiscal 2004. The adoption of SFAS No. 150 required the prospective classification of Heinz Finance Companys $325 million of mandatorily redeemable preferred shares from minority interest to long term debt and the $5.1 million quarterly preferred dividend from other expenses to interest expense beginning in the second quarter ending October 29, 2003, with no resulting effect on the Companys profitability. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123". SFAS No. 148 provides alternative methods of transition for entities that voluntarily change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation, and it also amends the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosure about the effects of an entitys accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation in both annual and interim financial reporting. The disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 148 were effective for the Company at April 30, 2003. The Company is currently evaluating its policy for recognizing expense related to stock options. Effective May 2, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." Under this standard, goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized. As a result of adopting SFAS No. 142, the Company recorded a transitional impairment charge which was calculated as of May 2, 2002, and recorded as an effect of a change in accounting principle in the fiscal year ended April 30, 2003, of $77.8 million. There was no tax effect associated 25 with this charge. The charge, which relates to certain of the Companys reporting units, has been reflected in its segments as follows: Europe $54.6 million, Asia/Pacific $2.7 million and Other Operating Entities $20.5 million. DISCUSSION OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In the ordinary course of business, the Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions. The Company believes that the following discussion addresses the Companys most critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results and require managements most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Marketing Costs Trade promotions are an important component of the sales and marketing of the Companys products, and are critical to the support of its business. Trade promotion costs include amounts paid to encourage retailers to offer temporary price reductions for the sale of the Companys products to consumers, amounts paid to obtain favorable display positions in retailers stores, and amounts paid to customers for shelf space in retail stores. Accruals for trade promotions are recorded primarily at the time of sale of product to the customer based on expected levels of performance. Settlement of these liabilities typically occurs in subsequent periods primarily through an authorized process for deductions taken by a customer from amounts otherwise due to the Company. As a result, the ultimate cost of a trade promotion program is dependent on the relative success of the events and the actions and level of deductions taken by the Companys customers for amounts they consider due to them. Final determination of the permissible deductions may take extended periods of time. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost is principally determined by the average cost method. The Company records adjustments to the carrying value of inventory based upon its forecasted plans to sell its inventories. The physical condition (e.g., age and quality) of the inventories is also considered in establishing its valuation. These adjustments are estimates, which could vary significantly, either favorably or unfavorably, from actual requirements if future economic conditions, customer inventory levels or competitive conditions differ from our expectations. Property, Plant and Equipment Land, buildings and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated on a straight line method over the estimated useful lives of such assets. Changes in circumstances such as technological advances, changes to the Companys business model or changes in the Companys capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from the Companys estimates. In those cases where the Company determines that the useful life of buildings and equipment should be shortened, the Company would depreciate the net book value in excess of the salvage value, over its revised remaining useful life thereby increasing depreciation expense. Factors such as changes in the planned use of fixtures or software or closing of facilities could result in shortened useful lives. Investments and Long lived Assets Investments and long lived assets, including fixed assets and intangible assets with finite useful lives, are evaluated periodically by the Company for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable. If the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value, the Company recognizes an impairment loss, measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. The estimate of cash flow requires significant management judgement and requires, among other things, certain assumptions about future 26 volume, revenue and expense growth rates, foreign exchange rates, market value devaluation and inflation, and as such may differ from actual cash flows. Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangibles Carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed periodically for possible impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets". The Companys impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant management judgments similar to those noted above for long lived assets, and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. Impairment occurs when the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the discounted present value of the cash flows for that reporting unit. An impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows, which represents the estimated fair value of the asset. The Company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations. Indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors, unanticipated technological change or competitive activities, loss of key personnel, and acts by governments and courts, may signal that an asset has become impaired. Retirement Benefits The Company sponsors pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering substantially all employees who meet eligibility requirements. Several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, turnover rates and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the Company, within certain guidelines. The discount rate assumptions used to value pension and postretirement benefit obligations reflect the rates available on high quality fixed income investments available (in each country in which the Company operates a benefit plan) as of the measurement date. The weighted average discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation for the year ending April 28, 2004 was reduced to 5.8% as of April 28, 2004 from 5.9% as of April 30, 2003. Over time, the expected rate of return on pension plan assets should approximate the actual long term returns. In developing the expected rate of return, the Company considers actual real historic returns on asset classes, the investment mix of plan assets, investment manager performance and projected future returns of asset classes developed by respected consultants. The weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets used to calculate annual expense was 8.2% for the year ended April 28, 2004, 8.9% for the year ended April 30, 2003 and 9.2% for the year ended May 1, 2002. For purposes of calculating Fiscal 2005 expense, the weighted average rate of return will remain at approximately 8.2%. In addition, the Companys actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate these factors. The actuarial assumptions used by the Company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants. These differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense recorded by the Company. Income Taxes The Company computes its annual tax rate based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to it in the various jurisdictions in which it earns income. Significant judgment is required in determining the Companys annual tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions. The Company establishes reserves when it becomes probable that a tax return position that it considers supportable may be challenged and that the Company may not succeed in completely defending that challenge. The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the settlement of a tax audit. The Companys annual tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, the Company believes that its reserves reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies. Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to the Companys annual tax rate in the year of 27 resolution. The Companys tax reserves are presented in the balance sheet principally within accrued income taxes. The Company records valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. When assessing the need for valuation allowances, the Company considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years, the Company would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding increase or charge to income. INFLATION In general, costs are affected by inflation and the effects of inflation may be experienced by the Company in future periods. Management believes, however, that such effects have not been material to the Company during the past three years in the United States or in foreign non hyperinflationary countries. The Company operates in certain countries around the world, such as Argentina, Venezuela and Zimbabwe, that have experienced hyperinflation. In hyperinflationary foreign countries, the Company attempts to mitigate the effects of inflation by increasing prices in line with inflation, where possible, and efficiently managing its working capital levels. The impact of inflation on both the Companys financial position and results of operations is not expected to adversely affect Fiscal 2005 results. The Companys financial position continues to remain strong, enabling it to meet cash requirements for operations, including anticipated additional pension plan contributions, capital expansion programs and dividends to shareholders. STOCK MARKET INFORMATION H. J. Heinz Company common stock is traded principally on The New York Stock Exchange and the Pacific Exchange, under the symbol HNZ.
