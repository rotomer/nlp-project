ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. SPECIAL ITEMS ASSET IMPAIRMENTS In the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005, the Company recognized a non cash asset impairment charge of $27.0 million pre tax ($18.0 million after tax) on the HAK vegetable product line in Northern Europe. The charge, which is recorded as a component of cost of products sold, relates to the anticipated sale of the product line in early Fiscal 2006. The Company holds an equity investment in The Hain Celestial Group, Inc. ("Hain"), a natural, specialty and snack food company. Hain shares traded at less than 80% of Heinzs carrying value since late January 2004. Due to the length of time and the amount that Hain stock had traded below the Companys basis, the Company determined that the decline was other than temporary as defined by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18 and as a result, recognized a $64.5 million non cash impairment charge during the third quarter of Fiscal 2005. The charge reduced Heinzs carrying value in Hain to fair market value as of January 26, 2005, with no resulting impact on cash flows. Heinz currently owns approximately six million shares of Hain stock, with a book value of approximately $20.00 per share as of April 27, 2005. In the future, should the market value of Hain common stock decline and remain below current market value for a substantial time, the Company could be required to record additional writedowns of its investment in Hain. The Company also recorded a $9.3 million non cash charge in the third quarter of Fiscal 2005 to recognize the impairment of a cost basis investment in a grocery industry sponsored e commerce business venture. There was no tax benefit associated with these impairment charges. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS On December 20, 2002, Heinz transferred to a wholly owned subsidiary ("SKF Foods") certain assets and liabilities, including its U.S. and Canadian pet food and pet snacks, U.S. tuna, U.S. retail private label soup and private label gravy, College Inn broths and its U.S. infant feeding businesses and distributed all of the shares of SKF Foods common stock on a pro rata basis to its shareholders. Immediately thereafter, SKF Foods merged with a wholly owned subsidiary of Del Monte Foods Company ("Del Monte") resulting in SKF Foods becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Del Monte. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the operating results related to these businesses spun off to Del Monte have been treated as discontinued operations in the Companys consolidated statements of income. Net income from discontinued operations for the years ended April 27, 2005 and April 28, 2004 was $16.9 million and $25.3 million, respectively, and reflects the favorable settlement of tax liabilities related to the businesses spun off to Del Monte on December 20, 2002. The discontinued operations generated sales of $1,091.3 million and net income of $88.7 million (net of $35.4 million in tax) for Fiscal 2003. DIVESTITURES AND OTHER REORGANIZATION COSTS During the first quarter of Fiscal 2004, the Company sold its bakery business in Northern Europe for $57.9 million. The transaction resulted in a pretax gain of $26.3 million ($13.3 million after tax), which was recorded as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A"). This sale impacted approximately 70 employees. During Fiscal 2004, the Company recognized $17.1 million pretax ($11.0 million after tax) of reorganization costs. These costs were recorded as a component of SG&A and were primarily due to employee termination and severance costs. Also, during Fiscal 2004, the Company wrote down pizza crust assets in the United Kingdom totaling $4.0 million pretax ($2.8 million after tax) which 11 have been included as a component of cost of products sold. Management estimates that these actions impacted approximately 100 employees. In Fiscal 2003, Del Monte transaction costs and costs to reduce overhead of the remaining business totaled $164.6 million pretax ($113.1 million after tax) and were comprised of $61.8 million for legal, professional and other related costs, $51.3 million in employee termination and severance costs, $39.6 million related to the early retirement of debt, and $12.0 million in non cash asset write downs. Of this amount, $6.1 million was included in cost of products sold, $118.9 million in SG&A, and $39.6 million in other expense, net. Management estimates that these actions impacted approximately 400 employees excluding those who were transferred to Del Monte. In Fiscal 2003, losses on the exit of non strategic businesses, primarily the UK frozen pizza business and a North American fish and frozen vegetable business, totaled $62.4 million pretax ($49.3 million after tax), and were comprised of $39.7 million in non cash asset write downs, $12.1 million in losses on the sale of businesses and $10.6 million in employee termination, severance and other exit costs. Of these amounts, $47.3 million was included in cost of products sold and $15.1 million in SG&A. Management estimates that these actions impacted approximately 600 employees. During Fiscal 2005, the Company utilized $9.9 million of severance and exit cost accruals related to reorganization costs. RESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS FISCAL YEARS ENDED APRIL 27, 2005 AND APRIL 28, 2004 Sales for Fiscal 2005 increased $497.8 million, or 5.9%, to $8.91 billion. Sales were favorably impacted by volume growth of 1.9% and exchange translation rates of 3.9%. The favorable volume was primarily a result of strong increases in the North American Consumer Products and U.S. Foodservice segments. Lower pricing decreased sales by 0.2%, principally due to the restage of our Italian infant nutrition business, market price pressures impacting the Tegel poultry business in New Zealand and the trade in Northern Europe, and a $34.1 million charge for trade spending for the Italian infant nutrition business. The trade spending charge in the Italian infant nutrition business related to prior years and reflected an under accrual quantified as the Company was upgrading trade management processes and systems in Italy. These price decreases were partially offset by the North American Consumer Products and U.S. Foodservice segments and U.K. convenience meals. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased sales by 0.3%. Domestic operations contributed approximately 38% of consolidated sales in Fiscal 2005 and Fiscal 2004. Gross profit increased $118.1 million, or 3.8%, to $3.21 billion; the gross profit margin decreased to 36.0% from 36.7%. The decrease in the gross profit margin is mainly due to increased commodity and fuel costs, lower pricing as discussed above, increased production costs in the European seafood business and a $27.0 million non cash asset impairment charge related to the anticipated disposition of the HAK vegetable product line in Northern Europe in early Fiscal 2006. The 3.8% increase in gross profit is primarily a result of higher volume and favorable exchange translation rates. Last years gross profit was unfavorably impacted by the write down of U.K. pizza crust assets totaling $4.0 million. SG&A increased $142.5 million, or 8.3%, to $1.85 billion, and increased as a percentage of sales to 20.8% from 20.3%. The increase as a percentage of sales is primarily due to the $26.3 million gain recorded on the sale of the Northern European bakery business in the prior year and increased Selling and Distribution costs ("S&D") and General and Administrative expenses ("G&A") in the current year. The increase in S&D is largely a result of higher fuel and transportation costs, and the increase in G&A is chiefly due to employee related and litigation costs, and professional fees related to various projects across the Company, including increased administrative costs associated with Section 404 of Sarbanes Oxley. These increases were partially offset by 12 decreased marketing expense, primarily in Europe. Last years SG&A was unfavorably impacted by reorganization costs totaling $17.1 million. Operating income decreased $24.4 million, or 1.8%, to $1.35 billion. Total marketing support (recorded as a reduction of revenue or as a component of SG&A) increased $82.0 million, or 3.4%, to $2.52 billion on a sales increase of 5.9%. Marketing support recorded as a reduction of revenue, typically deals and allowances, increased $98.9 million, or 4.6%, to $2.23 billion, which is largely a result of foreign exchange translation rates, the Italian infant nutrition business, and increased promotional spending in European seafood and Tegel poultry in New Zealand, partially offset by reduced trade promotion spending in the U.S. Consumer Products and the U.K. businesses. Marketing support recorded as a component of SG&A decreased $16.9 million, or 5.7%, to $282.8 million, primarily in the Europe segment. Net interest expense increased $16.1 million, to $204.7 million. Net interest expense was unfavorably impacted by higher interest rates during Fiscal 2005, partially offset by the benefits of lower average net debt. Fiscal 2005 income from continuing operations was also unfavorably impacted by the $73.8 million non cash impairment charges discussed previously. Other expenses, net, decreased $4.5 million, resulting primarily from the impact of the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 150 (see below for further discussion) beginning in the second quarter of Fiscal 2004. The effective tax rate for the current year was 30.5% compared to 33.3% last year. The reduction in the effective tax rate is attributable to changes to the capital structure in several foreign subsidiaries, tax credits resulting from tax planning associated with a change in certain foreign tax legislation, reduction of the charge associated with remittance of foreign dividends and the settlement of tax audits, partially offset by the impairment charges and other operating losses for which no tax benefit can currently be recorded. In addition, the prior year effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by 0.4 percentage points due to the sale of the Northern European bakery business. Income from continuing operations for Fiscal 2005 was $735.8 million compared to $778.9 million in the prior year, a decrease of 5.5%. Diluted earnings per share was $2.08 in the current year compared to $2.20 in the prior year, down 5.5%. The impact of fluctuating exchange rates for Fiscal 2005 remained relatively consistent on a line by line basis throughout the consolidated statement of income. FISCAL YEAR 2005 OPERATING RESULTS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT NORTH AMERICAN CONSUMER PRODUCTS Sales of the North American Consumer Products segment increased $191.9 million, or 9.3%, to $2.26 billion. Sales volume increased 5.7% due to significant growth in Ore Ida frozen potatoes and SmartOnes frozen entrees, aided by the introduction of Ore Ida Extra Crispy Potatoes, new microwavable Easy Fries, and several new SmartOnes frozen entrees. Strong performance in Boston Market HomeStyle meals and in the frozen snack brands of Delimex, Bagel Bites and TGI Fridays, as well as new distribution related to a co packing agreement also contributed to the volume increase. Pricing increased sales 2.7% largely due to reduced trade spending and decreased product placement fees on SmartOnes frozen entrees and Ore Ida potatoes as well as increased price related to Classico pasta sauces and Heinz ketchup. Sales increased 1.6% due to the prior year acquisition of the Canadian business of Unifine Richardson B.V., which manufactures and sells salad dressings, sauces and dessert toppings. Divestitures reduced sales 1.6% due to the sale of Ethnic Gourmet Food and Rosetto pasta to Hain in the first quarter. Exchange translation rates increased sales 0.9%. 13 Gross profit increased $70.0 million, or 8.0%, to $942.8 million driven by the increase in sales. The gross profit margin decreased to 41.8% from 42.3% due primarily to higher commodity and fuel costs, partially offset by higher net pricing. Operating income increased $56.3 million, or 11.9%, to $530.4 million, due to the increase in gross profit, which was partially offset by higher selling and distribution costs, related to higher volume and higher fuel costs. Operating income for Fiscal 2004 was unfavorably impacted by reorganization costs totaling $5.3 million. U.S. FOODSERVICE Sales of the U.S. Foodservice segment increased $75.2 million, or 5.3%, to $1.50 billion. Sales volume increased sales 2.9% due to growth in Heinz ketchup, strong performance on Truesoups frozen soup and growth in custom recipe tomato products. Higher pricing increased sales by 1.5%, as price increases were initiated to offset fuel and commodity cost pressures. Acquisitions increased sales 0.9%, due to the prior year acquisition of Truesoups LLC, a manufacturer and marketer of premium frozen soups. Gross profit increased $48.1 million, or 11.8%, to $457.4 million, and the gross profit margin increased to 30.4% from 28.6%. The gross profit margin increase was primarily due to favorable pricing, partly offset by increases in commodity costs. Operating income increased $13.7 million, or 6.5%, to $224.8 million, related to the growth in gross profit, which was partially offset by increased selling and distribution costs, related to a substantial increase in fuel and trucking costs. Operating income for Fiscal 2004 was unfavorably impacted by reorganization costs totaling $3.9 million. EUROPE Heinz Europes sales increased $159.6 million, or 4.9%, to $3.45 billion. Favorable exchange translation rates increased sales by 7.5%. Volume decreased 0.3% as increases in Heinz ketchup resulting from the successful introduction of the Top Down bottle, increases in frozen desserts in the U.K., share gains from the successful restage of the Italian infant nutrition business, new products in U.K. frozen potatoes and increases in Heinz ready to serve soups were offset by declines in European seafood, frozen entrees in the U.K. and jarred vegetables in Northern Europe. Lower pricing decreased sales 1.8%, primarily due to the restage of the Italian infant nutrition business, the trade spending charge in the Italian infant nutrition business and increased promotional activity in The Netherlands. The $34.1 million trade spending charge in the Italian infant nutrition business related to prior years and reflected an under accrual quantified as the Company was upgrading trade management processes and systems in Italy. These decreases were partially offset by price increases in Heinz beans and ready to serve soups in the U.K. Divestitures reduced sales 0.6%. Gross profit decreased $21.2 million, or 1.7%, to $1.24 billion, and the gross profit margin decreased to 36.1% from 38.5%. The decrease in gross profit margin is primarily related to lower pricing as discussed above, increased commodity and production costs, particularly in the European seafood and the UK businesses and a $27.0 million asset impairment charge related to the HAK vegetable product line in Northern Europe. These decreases were partially offset by supply chain improvements in The Netherlands. Gross profit in Fiscal 2004 was unfavorably impacted by the write down of the U.K. pizza crust assets totaling $4.0 million. Operating income decreased $88.6 million, or 13.9%, to $550.6 million, largely due to the decrease in gross profit, the gain recognized in the prior year on the sale of the Northern European bakery business, and increased G&A. The increase in G&A is largely due to increased pension costs, litigation costs and professional fees from various projects across Europe. ASIA/PACIFIC Sales in Asia/Pacific increased $49.1 million, or 3.9%, to $1.31 billion. Favorable exchange translation rates increased sales by 4.4%. Volume increased sales 0.5%, chiefly due to new product introductions in the frozen foods and convenience meals categories in the Australia and New 14 Zealand businesses. These were partially offset by the discontinuation of an Indonesian energy drink and volume declines in Tegel poultry and China. The volume decline in China was due primarily to an industry related recall issue pertaining to the colorant Sudan I. Lower pricing reduced sales 2.0% primarily due to market price pressures on Tegel poultry. The acquisition of Shanghai LongFong Foods, a maker of popular frozen Chinese snacks and desserts, increased sales 2.3%. The divestiture of a Korean oils and fats product line reduced sales 1.3%. Gross profit increased $5.6 million, or 1.4%, to $416.1 million. The gross profit margin decreased to 31.8% from 32.6%. The decrease in gross profit margin is primarily due to lower pricing and increased commodity costs, partially offset by cost improvements in Australia and New Zealand. Operating income decreased $10.6 million, or 7.3%, to $135.6 million, primarily due to increased SG&A, resulting primarily from exchange translation rates and increased volume. OTHER OPERATING ENTITIES Sales for Other Operating Entities increased $22.0 million, or 5.9%, to $396.6 million. Volume increased 1.2% due primarily to strong sales of ketchup and beverages in India and new product launches in Latin America, partially offset by lower sales in Israel, following a product recall in the third quarter of Fiscal 2004. Lower pricing reduced sales by 2.2%, mainly due to decreases in Latin America as a result of market price pressures and price declines in Israel resulting from the effects of the recall. The prior year acquisition of a frozen food business in South Africa increased sales by 5.8%. Exchange translation rates increased sales 1.0%. Gross profit increased $7.7 million, or 6.4%, to $127.9 million. Operating income increased $4.8 million, primarily due to the acquisition in South Africa. Zimbabwe remains in a period of economic uncertainty. Should the current situation continue, the Company could experience disruptions and delays in its Zimbabwean operations. As of the end of November 2002, the Company deconsolidated its Zimbabwean operations and classified its remaining net investment of approximately $110 million as a cost investment included in other non current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Although the Companys business continues to operate profitably and is able to source raw materials, the countrys economic situation remains uncertain and there are government restrictions on the repatriation of earnings. The Companys ability to recover its investment could become impaired if the economic and political uncertainties continue to deteriorate. FISCAL YEARS ENDED APRIL 28, 2004 AND APRIL 30, 2003 Sales for Fiscal 2004 increased $177.7 million, or 2.2%, to $8.41 billion. Sales were favorably impacted by volume of 0.4% and exchange translation rates of 7.3%. The favorable volume impact is primarily due to strong increases in the U.S. Foodservice and Asia/Pacific segments. These increases were partially offset by the impact of Stock Keeping Unit ("SKU") rationalization and declines in Europe, relating primarily to a reduction in promotional support and trade inventories in advance of a major restage of the Italian infant feeding business in Fiscal 2005. Lower pricing decreased sales by 0.3%, primarily reflecting the Companys goal to achieve more competitive net pricing under the Every Day Low Pricing strategy in the U.S. retail businesses as well as market price pressure in the Tegel poultry business in New Zealand. Divestitures, net of acquisitions, reduced sales 5.3% due primarily to the deconsolidation of Zimbabwe in the third quarter of Fiscal 2003. Domestic operations contributed approximately 38% of consolidated sales in Fiscal 2004 and Fiscal 2003. Gross profit increased $155.8 million, or 5.3%, to $3.09 billion, and the gross profit margin increased to 36.7% from 35.6%. The gross profit margin increase was primarily driven by the Companys continuing focus on process and system improvements, productivity initiatives and elimination of less profitable SKUs. These gains were partially offset by lower overall net pricing for the Company and increased supply chain costs in the European seafood business. The aggre 15 gate increase in gross profit also benefited from favorable exchange translation rates, partially offset by the impact of higher pension costs, divestitures and the write down of U.K. pizza crust assets in the U.K. For Fiscal 2003, gross profit was also impacted by Del Monte transaction related costs and costs to reduce overhead of the remaining businesses of $6.1 million, and losses on the exit of non strategic businesses of $47.3 million. SG&A decreased $49.7 million, or 2.8%, to $1.71 billion, and, as a percentage of sales, was reduced to 20.3% from 21.4%. The decrease was primarily due to the gain recorded on the sale of the Northern European Bakery business in Fiscal 2004, and decreased marketing expense primarily in the North American Consumer Products segment reflecting the Companys goal to achieve more competitive net pricing as discussed above. Additionally, SG&A was impacted in Fiscal 2004 by reorganization costs of $17.1 million, and in Fiscal 2003 by Del Monte transaction related costs and costs to reduce overhead of the remaining businesses of $118.9 million, and losses on the exit of non strategic businesses of $15.1 million. The favorable impact of these items was offset by increases in pension and personnel costs. Total marketing support (recorded either as a reduction of revenue or as a component of SG&A) increased $179.4 million, or 8.0%, to $2.44 billion on a sales increase of 2.2%. Marketing support recorded as a reduction of revenue increased $179.0 million, or 9.1%, to $2.14 billion, which is primarily a result of the Companys goal to achieve more competitive net pricing under the Every Day Low Pricing strategy. Marketing support recorded as a component of SG&A increased by $0.4 million, or 0.1%, to $299.7 million, as most marketing resources were focused on sharpening retail price points. Operating income increased $205.4 million, or 17.5%, to $1.38 billion, and increased as a percentage of sales to 16.4% from 14.3% as a result of the changes noted above. Net interest expense decreased $3.9 million, to $188.5 million, due to lower debt balances and lower interest rates. This decrease was partially offset by the prospective classification of the Heinz Finance Companys dividend on its mandatorily redeemable preferred shares to interest expense from other expense. This treatment is in accordance with the adoption of SFAS No. 150 (see below for further discussion) beginning in the second quarter of Fiscal 2004. Other expense, net, decreased $90.4 million, to $22.2 million, attributable to a $39.6 million pretax charge related to early retirement of debt in Fiscal 2003, decreased minority interest expense as a result of the Zimbabwe deconsolidation, the SFAS No. 150 reclassification previously discussed and increased equity income. The effective tax rate for Fiscal 2004 was 33.3% compared to 36.1% for Fiscal 2003 due primarily to improved country mix and effective tax planning. The Fiscal 2004 effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by 0.4 percentage points due to the sale of the Northern European bakery business and the Fiscal 2003 effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by 1.6 percentage points due in part to the loss on the disposal of a North American fish and vegetable business. Income from continuing operations for Fiscal 2004 was $778.9 million compared to $555.4 million in Fiscal 2003 (before the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle related to the adoption of SFAS No. 142). Diluted earnings per share was $2.20 in Fiscal 2004 compared to $1.57 in Fiscal 2003 (before the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle related to the adoption of SFAS No. 142). The impact of fluctuating exchange rates for Fiscal 2004 remained relatively consistent on a line by line basis throughout the consolidated statement of income. FISCAL YEAR 2004 OPERATING RESULTS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT NORTH AMERICAN CONSUMER PRODUCTS Sales of the North American Consumer Products segment decreased $49.1 million, or 2.3%. Sales volume decreased 0.2% as strong increases in Heinz ketchup and frozen potatoes were more 16 than offset by declines in SmartOnes frozen entrees, related to the increased popularity of low carb dieting, which drove declines in the nutritional frozen entree category in the U.S., as well as the effects of the rationalization of Boston Market side dishes and Hot Bites snacks. Lower pricing decreased sales 1.6% consistent with our strategy to obtain more competitive consumer price points on Boston Market HomeStyle meals, Heinz gravy, Classico pasta sauces, SmartOnes frozen entrees and Delimex frozen snacks. Sales increased 0.4% due to the Canadian acquisition of Unifine Richardson B.V., which manufactures and sells salad dressings, sauces, and dessert toppings. Divestitures in Fiscal 2003 reduced sales 2.9% and favorable exchange translation rates increased sales 1.9%. Gross profit decreased $2.9 million, or 0.3%, to $872.8 million; the gross profit margin increased to 42.3% from 41.4% as manufacturing cost savings, reflecting significant productivity initiatives and more effective and efficient new product launches, offset unfavorable pricing and higher commodity costs. In addition, reorganization costs unfavorably impacted gross profit by $4.9 million in Fiscal 2003. Operating income increased $82.5 million, or 21.1%, to $474.1 million, primarily due to decreased consumer marketing expenses related to the Fiscal 2003 launch of Easy Squeeze!, Boston Market frozen entrees and Hot Bites snacks, and Ore Ida Funky Fries. In addition, Fiscal 2004 operating income was unfavorably impacted by reorganization costs of $5.3 million and Fiscal 2003 operating income was unfavorably impacted by Del Monte transaction related costs and costs to reduce overhead of the remaining businesses and losses on the exit of non strategic businesses of $60.9 million. U.S. FOODSERVICE U.S. Foodservices sales increased $113.2 million, or 8.6%. Sales volume increased sales 2.4% primarily due to increases in Heinz ketchup, Escalon processed tomato products, Diannes frozen desserts and single serve condiments as a result of new customers, successful product innovation and a strengthening trend in the U.S. restaurant industry. Higher pricing increased sales by 2.7% chiefly due to Heinz ketchup and single serve condiments. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased sales 3.6%, primarily due to the acquisition of Truesoups LLC, a manufacturer and marketer of premium frozen soups. Gross profit increased $34.8 million, or 9.3%, to $409.3 million, and the gross profit margin increased slightly to 28.6% from 28.5%. These increases were primarily due to favorable pricing and sales mix, partially offset by higher commodity costs. In addition, reorganization costs unfavorably impacted gross profit by $1.1 million for Fiscal 2003. Operating income increased $19.4 million, or 10.1%, to $211.1 million, primarily due to the growth in gross profit, partially offset by the impact of higher sales volume on S&D and increased G&A attributable to increased personnel and systems costs. In addition, reorganization costs unfavorably impacted operating income by $3.9 million in Fiscal 2004 and Del Monte transaction related costs and costs to reduce overhead of the remaining businesses and losses on the exit of non strategic businesses unfavorably impacted operating income by $5.9 million for Fiscal 2003. EUROPE Heinz Europes sales increased $251.2 million, or 8.3%. Favorable exchange translation rates increased sales by 12.2%. Volumes declined 1.4% due to decreases in Italian infant feeding, in advance of a restaging in early Fiscal 2005, and in convenience meals, due to promotional timing and the impact of our previously announced program to reduce low margin SKUs. These decreases were partially offset by increases in Heinz ketchup from the successful introduction of the top down bottle, Heinz salad cream, Petite Navire seafood due to the rebound from the prior year recall and frozen food products. Pricing decreased 0.3% as price increases on Heinz beans, ready to serve soups, and pasta meals were offset by increased trade promotion spending related to seafood. Also, prices were lower in Northern Europe as a result of The Netherlands largest retailer rolling back prices in excess of 8% beginning in the second quarter of Fiscal 2004. Divestitures reduced sales 17 2.2%, primarily related to the sale of the U.K. frozen pizza business, the Northern European bakery business and a foodservice business in Italy. Gross profit increased $128.8 million, or 11.3%, to $1,264.8 million, and the gross profit margin increased to 38.5% from 37.4%. The increase in gross profit is primarily due to favorable exchange translation rates, partially offset by increased supply chain costs in our European seafood business, the volume related impact of reduced promotions in Heinzs Italian baby food business, the impact of divestitures and the write down of the U.K. pizza assets. Additionally, gross profit was unfavorably impacted by $47.4 million for reorganization costs and losses on the exit of non strategic businesses in Fiscal 2003. Operating income increased $97.4 million, or 18.0%, to $639.2 million, primarily attributable to the favorable change in gross profit and the gain on the sale of the Northern European bakery business, partially offset by increased G&A expense primarily related to increased pension expense in the U.K. Operating income was unfavorably impacted by $58.9 million for reorganization costs and losses on the exit of non strategic businesses in Fiscal 2003. ASIA/PACIFIC Sales in Asia/Pacific increased $179.7 million, or 16.7%. Favorable exchange translation rates increased sales by 16.2%. Volume increased sales 2.6% primarily due to strong sales of Heinz ketchup, Tegel poultry in New Zealand, Heinz soups in Australia and ABC sauces in Indonesia. Lower pricing decreased sales 1.8% related to lower prices on Tegel poultry in New Zealand, partially offset by price increases in Indonesia on ABC sauces and juice concentrates. Divestitures, net of acquisitions, reduced sales 0.5%. Gross profit increased $67.9 million, or 19.8%, to $410.5 million, and the gross profit margin increased to 32.6% from 31.8%. These increases were primarily due to favorable exchange translation rates and supply chain improvements in our Australian and Watties businesses, partially offset by Tegel poultrys lower pricing and higher commodity costs. Operating income increased $45.7 million, or 45.5%, to $146.2 million, primarily due to the growth in gross profit and G&A reductions in our Australian and Watties businesses, partially offset by the impact of exchange translation rates on SG&A expenses. Additionally, operating income was unfavorably impacted by reorganization costs of $6.6 million in Fiscal 2003. OTHER OPERATING ENTITIES Sales for Other Operating Entities decreased $317.3 million, or 45.9%, primarily due to the deconsolidation of the Companys Zimbabwe operations in Fiscal 2003. The deconsolidation also impacted gross profit and operating income. Gross profit decreased $83.1 million, or 40.9%, to $120.2 million, and operating income decreased $81.3 million, or 73.1%, to $29.9 million. Excluding the Zimbabwe operations in Fiscal 2003, sales increased 14.3%, primarily due to volume increases of 6.2%, and operating income decreased 15.3%. Other than the impact of Zimbabwe, the other significant impact on operating income was the recall in the third quarter of Fiscal 2004 of a soy based infant formula product sold under the Remedia brand in Israel. LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL POSITION The following discussion of liquidity and financial position references the business measures of operating free cash flow and net debt as defined below. These measures are utilized by senior management and the board of directors to gauge our business operating performance, and management believes these measures provide clarity in understanding the trends of the business. Management, and investors, can benefit from the use of the operating free cash flow measure as it provides cash flow derived from product sales and the short term application of cash, including the effect of capital expenditures. 18 The limitation of operating free cash flow is that it adjusts the GAAP measure cash flow from operations for cash used for capital expenditures that is no longer available to the Company for other purposes. Management compensates for this limitation by using the GAAP operating cash flow number as well. Operating free cash flow does not represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures and does not provide insight into the entire scope of the historical cash inflows or outflows of our operations that are captured in the other cash flow measures reported in the statement of cash flows. The Companys primary measure of cash flow performance is operating free cash flow (cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures). The following is the Companys calculation of operating free cash flow for the years ended April 27, 2005, April 28, 2004 and April 30, 2003 (amounts in millions): Fiscal Year Ended April 27, 2005 April 28, 2004 April 30, 2003 FY 2005 FY 2004 FY 2003 Cash provided by operating activities.......................... $1,160.8 $1,249.0 $ 906.0 Capital expenditures.................. $ (240.7) $ (232.0) $(154.0) Operating Free Cash Flow............ $ 920.1 $1,017.0 $ 752.0 Cash provided by continuing operating activities in Fiscal 2005 was $1.16 billion, a decrease of $88.2 million from the prior year. The decrease in Fiscal 2005 versus Fiscal 2004 is primarily due to a planned tax pre payment of $125 million made in Europe during the third quarter and working capital movements, particularly inventories, partially offset by lower contributions to the Companys pension plans in Fiscal 2005. While we continue to make progress in reducing our cash conversion cycle (six days lower than a year ago), the rate of improvement has lessened when compared to last fiscal year, as expected. Cash used for investing activities totaled $264.1 million compared to $301.1 million last year. Proceeds from divestitures provided $51.2 million in Fiscal 2005 and related primarily to the sale of an oil and fats product line in Korea, which was completed during the third quarter. Acquisitions used $126.5 million in Fiscal 2005 primarily related to the Companys purchase in the fourth quarter of Appetizers And, Inc., a manufacturer and marketer of high quality, frozen hors doeuvres sold primarily to the U.S. foodservice industry, and in the third quarter of a controlling interest in Shanghai LongFong Foods, a maker of frozen Chinese snacks and desserts. In Fiscal 2004, acquisitions, net of divestitures, used $41.7 million in cash. Capital expenditures totaled $240.7 million (2.7% of sales) in Fiscal 2005 compared to $232.0 million (2.8% of sales) last year. Cash used for financing activities totaled $1.05 billion compared to $643.9 million last year. Payments on long term debt were $480.5 million during Fiscal 2005, compared to $74.3 million last year. Proceeds from short term borrowings were $26.5 million in Fiscal 2005, compared to payments of $144.7 million in the prior year. Cash used for the purchases of treasury stock, net of proceeds from option exercises, was $212.0 million in Fiscal 2005, compared to $57.4 million in the prior year, in line with the Companys strategy of flat or reduced fully diluted shares. Dividend payments totaled $398.9 million, compared to $379.9 million last year, reflecting a 5.5% increase in the annual dividend per share on common stock. On May 18, 2005, the Company announced that is Board of Directors approved a 5.3% increase in the annual dividend on common stock for Fiscal 2006 (from 28.5 cents to 30 cents per quarter), effective with the July 2005 dividend. Fiscal 2006 dividends are expected to approximate $410 million. Net debt is an additional measure that management utilizes to judge our liquidity and financial condition. Net debt is defined as total debt, net of the value of interest rate swaps, less cash and 19 cash equivalents and short term investments. The following is the Companys calculation of net debt as of April 27, 2005 and April 28, 2004 (amounts in millions): April 27, 2005 April 28, 2004 FY 2005 FY 2004 Short term debt......................................... $ 28.5 $ 11.4 Long term debt, including current portion............... 4,666.8 4,963.0 Total debt......................................... 4,695.3 4,974.4 Less: Value of interest rate swaps.......................... (186.1) (125.3) Cash and cash equivalents............................. (1,083.7) (1,140.0) Short term investments................................ (40.0) Net Debt................................................ $ 3,425.5 $ 3,669.1 Overall, net debt decreased $243.6 million, or 6.6%, versus prior year. Long term debt decreased $296.2 million from the prior year primarily due to the repayment of $480 million of debt in Fiscal 2005; offset by increases in debt as a result of higher foreign exchange rates and debt assumed through acquisitions. At April 27, 2005, the Companys net debt was $3.4 billion. Excluding the reclassification of H.J. Heinz Finance Companys $325 million of preferred stock and the impact of the changes in foreign exchange on net debt, the Companys net debt would have been $3.1 billion, a decrease of $2.3 billion since the beginning of Fiscal 2003. The Company anticipates that it will have additional long term debt reductions in Fiscal 2006, principally the retirement of E417.9 million of bonds ($540.6 million) which mature in April 2006. Return on average shareholders equity ("ROE") is calculated by taking net income divided by average shareholders equity. Average shareholders equity is a five point quarterly average. ROE was 34.4% in Fiscal 2005, 51.6% in Fiscal 2004 and 34.7% in Fiscal 2003. ROE in Fiscal 2005 was unfavorably impacted by increased average equity reflecting fluctuations in foreign exchange. In addition, ROE was unfavorably impacted by 4.2% in Fiscal 2005 related to the asset impairment charges. ROE was unfavorably impacted by 9.9% in Fiscal 2003 related to Del Monte transaction related costs, costs to reduce overhead of the remaining business and losses on the exit of non strategic businesses. Pretax return on average invested capital ("ROIC") is calculated by taking net operating profit before income taxes divided by average invested capital. Net operating profit before income taxes excludes net interest expense. Average invested capital is a five point quarterly average of debt plus total equity less cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. ROIC was 21.7% in Fiscal 2005, 24.5% in Fiscal 2004 and 19.0% in Fiscal 2003. ROIC was unfavorably impacted by 1.7% in Fiscal 2005 related to the asset impairment charges for the HAK vegetable product line, the equity investment in Hain and the cost basis investment in a grocery industry sponsored e commerce business venture. ROIC was favorably impacted by 0.1% in Fiscal 2004 related to the gain on the disposal of a bakery business in Northern Europe offset by reorganization costs and the write down of pizza crust assets in the United Kingdom. ROIC was unfavorably impacted by 3.5% in Fiscal 2003 related to Del Monte transaction related costs, costs to reduce overhead of the remaining business and losses on the exit of non strategic businesses. In August 2004, the Company and H.J. Heinz Finance Company amended their $600 million 364 Day Credit Agreement and their $1.5 billion Five Year Credit Agreement by combining the agreements into a $2.0 billion Five Year Credit Agreement, expiring August 2009. The Credit Agreement supports the Companys commercial paper borrowings and the remarketable securities. As a result, these borrowings are classified as long term debt based upon the Companys intent and ability to refinance these borrowings on a long term basis. In addition, the Company has $1.1 billion of foreign lines of credit available at April 27, 2005. These resources, the Companys year end 20 cash balance of more than $1 billion, strong operating cash flow and access to the capital market, if required, should enable the Company to meet its cash requirements for operations, including capital expansion programs, debt maturities, stock repurchases and dividends to shareholders. At April 27, 2005, the Companys long term debt ratings were A at Standard & Poors and Fitch and A 3 at Moodys, and the Companys short term debt ratings were A 1 at Standard & Poors, F 1 at Fitch and P 2 at Moodys. In Fiscal 2005, cash required for reorganization costs was approximately $9.9 million. Fiscal 2006 cash requirements related to reorganization costs to streamline the Companys organization structure, primarily in Europe, are expected to approximate $75 to $100 million. Additionally, the Company is reexamining its portfolio strategy which could result in the disposition of several non core businesses, the proceeds of which could approximate $1 billion. If implemented, these proceeds could be used for debt reduction, share repurchases, acquisitions and operations. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The Company is obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. In addition, the Company has purchase obligations for materials, supplies, services and property, plant and equipment as part of the ordinary conduct of business. A few of these obligations are long term and are based on minimum purchase requirements. In the aggregate, such commitments are not at prices in excess of current markets. Due to the proprietary nature of some of the Companys materials and processes, certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions for early terminations. The Company does not believe that a material amount of penalties is reasonably likely to be incurred under these contracts based upon historical experience and current expectations. The following table represents the contractual obligations of the Company as of April 27, 2005. Less than More than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years 5 years Total Long Term Debt........... $ 543,868 $ 302,672 $327,394 $3,297,305 $4,471,239 Capital Lease Obligations............ 1,103 2,093 2,402 19,735 25,333 Operating Leases......... 79,836 249,363 62,813 189,107 581,119 Purchase Obligations..... 314,468 475,415 173,250 93,958 1,057,091 Other Long Term Liabilities Recorded on the Balance Sheet...... 85,465 166,119 151,565 170,303 573,452 Total............... $1,024,740 $1,195,662 $717,424 $3,770,408 $6,708,234 Other long term liabilities primarily consist of certain specific incentive compensation arrangements and pension and postretirement benefit commitments. The following long term liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheet are excluded from the table above: interest payments, income taxes, minority interest and insurance accruals. The Company is unable to estimate the timing of the payments for these items. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS The Company does not have material financial guarantees or other contractual commitments that are reasonably likely to adversely affect liquidity. In addition, the Company does not have any related party transactions that materially affect the results of operations, cash flow or financial condition. 21 MARKET RISK FACTORS The Company is exposed to market risks from adverse changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and production costs. As a policy, the Company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor does the Company hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE SENSITIVITY: The Companys cash flow and earnings are subject to fluctuations due to exchange rate variation. Foreign currency risk exists by nature of the Companys global operations. The Company manufactures and sells its products in a number of locations around the world, and hence foreign currency risk is diversified. The Company may attempt to limit its exposure to changing foreign exchange rates through both operational and financial market actions. These actions may include entering into forward or option contracts to hedge existing exposures, firm commitments and forecasted transactions. The instruments are used to reduce risk by essentially creating offsetting currency exposures. The following table presents information related to foreign currency contracts held by the Company: Aggregate Notional Amount Net Unrealized Gains/(Losses) April 27, 2005 April 28, 2004 April 27, 2005 April 28, 2004 (Dollars in millions) Purpose of Hedge: Intercompany cash flows........ $ 737 $302 $(1.7) $(0.8) Forecasted purchases of raw materials and finished goods and foreign currency denominated obligations...... 417 466 (7.1) (5.8) Forecasted sales and foreign currency denominated assets.. 115 215 1.8 $1,269 $983 $(7.0) $(6.6) As of April 27, 2005, the Companys contracts to hedge forecasted transactions mature in one year. Contracts that meet qualifying criteria are accounted for as foreign currency cash flow hedges. Accordingly, the effective portion of gains and losses is deferred as a component of other comprehensive income/loss and is recognized in earnings at the time the hedged item affects earnings. Any gains and losses due to hedge ineffectiveness or related to contracts which do not qualify for hedge accounting are recorded in current period earnings in other income and expense. Substantially all of the Companys foreign affiliates financial instruments are denominated in their respective functional currencies. Accordingly, exposure to exchange risk on foreign currency financial instruments is not material. (See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.) INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY: The Company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its borrowing and investing activities used to maintain liquidity and fund business operations. The nature and amount of the Companys long term and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. The Companys net debt obligations totaled $3.43 billion and $3.67 billion at April 27, 2005 and April 28, 2004, respectively. The Companys debt obligations are summarized in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. In order to manage interest rate exposure, the Company utilizes interest rate swaps in order to convert fixed rate debt to floating. These derivatives are primarily accounted for as fair value hedges. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of these derivatives, along with changes in the fair value of the hedged debt obligations that are attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in current period earnings. Based on the amount of fixed rate debt converted to floating as of April 27, 2005, a variance of 1/8% in the related interest rate would cause annual interest expense related to 22 this debt to change by approximately $3.6 million. The following table presents additional information related to interest rate contracts designated as fair value hedges by the Company: April 27, 2005 April 28, 2004 (Dollars in millions) Pay floating swaps notional amount..................... $2,767.4 $2,767.4 Net unrealized gains.................................... $ 186.1 $ 125.3 Weighted average maturity (years)....................... 11.4 12.4 Weighted average receive rate........................... 6.37% 6.37% Weighted average pay rate............................... 2.95% 2.18% The Company had interest rate contracts with total notional amounts of $107.6 million and $907.6 million at April 27, 2005 and April 28, 2004, respectively, that did not meet the criteria for hedge accounting but effectively mitigated interest rate exposures. These derivatives are accounted for on a full mark to market basis through current earnings and they mature approximately three years from the current fiscal year end. Net unrealized gains/(losses), which are presented as a component of other noncurrent assets/liabilities, related to these interest rate contracts totaled $(2.5) million and $4.5 million at April 27, 2005 and April 28, 2004, respectively. EFFECT OF HYPOTHETICAL 10% FLUCTUATION IN MARKET PRICES: As of April 27, 2005, the potential gain or loss in the fair value of the Companys outstanding foreign currency contracts and interest rate contracts assuming a hypothetical 10% fluctuation in currency rates and swap rates, respectively, would be approximately: Fair Value Effect (Dollars in millions) Foreign currency contracts.................................. $130 Interest rate swap contracts................................ $110 However, it should be noted that any change in the fair value of the contracts, real or hypothetical, would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items. In relation to currency contracts, this hypothetical calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 123(R), "Share Based Payment", which revises SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation" and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees". This Statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity compensates employee services through share based payments. This Statement requires an entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award. That cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the reward. On April 18, 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a new rule that amended the compliance dates of SFAS No. 123(R) to require the implementation no later than the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. Early adoption of the Statement is permissable. The Company plans on adopting this Statement in Fiscal 2007. In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") No. FAS 109 2, "Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004". The FSP provided guidance on the accounting and disclosures for the temporary repatriation provision of the American Jobs Creation Act. The Company has adopted the disclosure provisions of the FSP which apply to entities that have not yet completed their 23 evaluation of the repatriation provision, and will expand its disclosures in accordance with the FSP upon completion of the final evaluation. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, "Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4". This Statement is meant to eliminate any narrow differences existing between the FASB standards and the standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board by clarifying that any abnormal idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and spoilage be recognized as current period charges. This Statement is required to be adopted by the Company in the first quarter of Fiscal 2007; however, early application is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this Statement to have a material impact on results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 ("the Act") was signed into law. The Act introduced a prescription drug benefit under Medicare (Medicare Part D) and a federal subsidy to sponsors of retirement health care plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. In January 2005, final Medicare prescription drug rules were issued. The adoption of the Act during Fiscal 2005 resulted in a reduction of the Companys benefit obligation of approximately $18.8 million and has been reflected as an actuarial gain. The total reduction in benefit cost for Fiscal 2005 is $2.3 million, comprised of $0.9 million of interest cost, $0.1 million of service cost, and $1.4 million reduction in unrecognized loss amortization, recognized on a pro rata basis. In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity". This statement affects the classification, measurement and disclosure requirements of certain freestanding financial instruments including mandatorily redeemable shares. SFAS No. 150 was effective for the Company for the second quarter of Fiscal 2004. The adoption of SFAS No. 150 required the prospective classification of H. J. Heinz Finance Companys $325 million of mandatorily redeemable preferred shares from minority interest to long term debt and the $5.1 million quarterly preferred dividend from other expenses to interest expense beginning in the second quarter ended October 29, 2003, with no resulting effect on the Companys profitability. DISCUSSION OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In the ordinary course of business, the Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions. The Company believes that the following discussion addresses the Companys most critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results and require managements most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Marketing Costs Trade promotions are an important component of the sales and marketing of the Companys products and are critical to the support of the business. Trade promotion costs include amounts paid to retailers to offer temporary price reductions for the sale of the Companys products to consumers, amounts paid to obtain favorable display positions in retailers stores, and amounts paid to customers for shelf space in retail stores. Accruals for trade promotions are recorded primarily at the time of sale of product to the customer based on an estimate of the expected levels of performance of the trade promotion, which is dependent upon factors such as historical trends with similar promotions, expectations regarding customer participation, and sales and payment trends with similar previously offered programs. Our original estimated costs of trade promotions may change in the future as a result of changes in customer participation, particularly for new programs and for programs related to the introduction of new products. We 24 perform monthly and quarterly evaluations of our outstanding trade promotions; making adjustments, where appropriate, to reflect changes in our estimates. Settlement of these liabilities typically occurs in subsequent periods primarily through an authorized process for deductions taken by a customer from amounts otherwise due to the Company. As a result, the ultimate cost of a trade promotion program is dependent on the relative success of the events and the actions and level of deductions taken by the Companys customers for amounts they consider due to them. Final determination of the permissible deductions may take extended periods of time and could have a significant impact on the Companys results of operations depending on how actual results of the programs compare to original estimates. We offer coupons to consumers in the normal course of our business. Costs associated with this activity, which we refer to as coupon redemption costs, are accrued in the period in which the coupons are offered. The initial estimates made for each coupon offering are based upon historical redemption experience rates for similar products or coupon amounts. We perform subsequent estimates that compare our actual redemption rates to the original estimates. We review the assumptions used in the valuation of the estimates and determine an appropriate accrual amount. Adjustments to our initial accrual may be required if our actual redemption rates vary from our estimated redemption rates. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost is principally determined by the average cost method. The Company records adjustments to the carrying value of inventory based upon its forecasted plans to sell its inventories. The physical condition (e.g., age and quality) of the inventories is also considered in establishing its valuation. These adjustments are estimates, which could vary, either favorably or unfavorably, from actual requirements if future economic conditions, customer inventory levels or competitive conditions differ from our expectations. Investments and Long lived Assets and Property, Plant and Equipment Investments and long lived assets are recorded at their respective cost basis on the date of acquisition. Buildings, equipment and leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of such assets. The Company reviews investments and long lived assets, including intangibles with finite useful lives, and property, plant and equipment, whenever circumstances change such that the indicated recorded value of an asset may not be recoverable or has suffered an other than temporary impairment. Factors that may affect recoverability include changes in planned use of equipment or software, the closing of facilities and changes in the underlying financial strength of investments. The estimate of current value requires significant management judgment and requires assumptions that can include: future volume trends, revenue and expense growth rates and foreign exchange rates developed in connection with the Companys internal projections and annual operating plans, and in addition, external factors such as market devaluation and inflation which are developed in connection with the Companys longer term strategic planning. As each is managements best estimate on then available information, resulting estimates may differ from actual cash flows. Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangibles Carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment at least annually, or when circumstances indicate that a possible impairment may exist, in accordance with SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." Indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors, unanticipated technological change or competitive activities, loss of key personnel, and acts by governments and courts, may signal that an asset has become impaired. The Companys measure of impairment is based on a discounted cash flow model that requires significant judgment and requires assumptions about future volume trends, revenue and expense growth rates and foreign exchange rates developed in connection with the Companys internal projections and annual operating plans, and in addition, external factors such as changes in macroeconomic trends and cost of capital developed in connection with the Companys longer term strategic planning. Inherent in estimating future performance, in particular assumptions regarding external factors such as capital markets, are 25 uncertainties beyond the Companys control. Management believes that because fair values of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives significantly exceed carrying value, it is unlikely that a material impairment charge would be recognized. Retirement Benefits The Company sponsors pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering substantially all employees who meet eligibility requirements. Several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, turnover rates and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the Company, within certain guidelines. The discount rate assumptions used to value pension and postretirement benefit obligations reflect the rates available on high quality fixed income investments available (in each country that the Company operates a benefit plan) as of the measurement date. The weighted average discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation for the year ending April 27, 2005 was reduced to 5.5% from 5.8% as of April 28, 2004. Over time, the expected rate of return on pension plan assets should approximate the actual long term returns. In developing the expected rate of return, the Company considers actual real historic returns on asset classes, the investment mix of plan assets, investment manager performance and projected future returns of asset classes developed by respected consultants. The weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets used to calculate annual expense was 8.2% for the years ended April 27, 2005 and April 28, 2004 and 8.9% for the year ended April 30, 2003. For purposes of calculating Fiscal 2006 expense, the weighted average rate of return will remain at approximately 8.2%. In addition, the Companys actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate these elements. The actuarial assumptions used by the Company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants. These differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense recorded by the Company. SENSITIVITY OF ASSUMPTIONS If we assumed a 100 basis point change in the following assumptions, our Fiscal 2005 projected benefit obligation and expense would increase (decrease) by the following amounts (in millions): 100 Basis Point Increase Decrease PENSION BENEFITS Discount rate used in determining projected benefit obligation................................................ $(304.3) $365.1 Discount rate used in determining net pension expense....... $ (34.4) $ 38.2 Long term rate of return on assets used in determining net pension expense........................................... $ (20.6) $ 20.6 OTHER BENEFITS Discount rate used in determining projected benefit obligation................................................ $ (25.4) $ 29.7 Income Taxes The Company computes its annual tax rate based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to it in the various jurisdictions in which it earns income. Significant judgment is required in determining the Companys annual tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions. The Company establishes reserves when it becomes probable that a tax return position that it considers supportable may be challenged and that the Company may not succeed in completely defending that challenge. The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the settlement of a tax audit. The Companys annual tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, the Company believes that 26 its reserves reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies. Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to the Companys annual tax rate in the year of resolution. The Companys tax reserves are presented in the balance sheet principally within accrued income taxes. The Company records valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. When assessing the need for valuation allowances, the Company considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years, the Company would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding increase or charge to income. The American Jobs Creation Act ("the AJCA") provides a deduction of 85% on certain foreign earnings repatriation. The Company may elect to apply this provision in Fiscal 2006. The Company does not expect to be able to complete its evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provisions until after the Treasury Department provides additional guidance on key elements of the provision. The Company expects to complete its evaluation within a reasonable period of time after final guidance is issued. The range of amounts that the Company is currently considering for repatriation under this provision is between zero and $750 million. The related potential range of income tax (based upon our expectation of how certain technical issues will be resolved in the final guidance) is between zero and $20 million. The AJCA provides a deduction calculated as a percentage of qualified income from manufacturing in the United States. The percentage increases from 3% to 9% over a 6 year period beginning with the Companys 2006 fiscal year. In December 2004, the FASB issued a new staff position providing for this deduction to be treated as a special deduction, as opposed to a tax rate reduction, in accordance with SFAS No. 109. The benefit of this deduction is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys effective tax rate in Fiscal 2006. INFLATION In general, costs are affected by inflation and the effects of inflation may be experienced by the Company in future periods. Management believes, however, that such effects have not been material to the Company during the past three years in the United States or in foreign non hyperinflationary countries. The Company operates in certain countries around the world, such as Argentina, Venezuela and Zimbabwe, that have experienced hyperinflation. In hyperinflationary foreign countries, the Company attempts to mitigate the effects of inflation by increasing prices in line with inflation, where possible, and efficiently managing its working capital levels. The impact of inflation on both the Companys financial position and results of operations is not expected to adversely affect Fiscal 2006 results. The Companys financial position continues to remain strong, enabling it to meet cash requirements for operations, including anticipated additional pension plan contributions, capital expansion programs and dividends to shareholders. STOCK MARKET INFORMATION H. J. Heinz Company common stock is traded principally on The New York Stock Exchange and the Pacific Exchange, under the symbol HNZ. The number of shareholders of record of the Companys common stock as of May 31, 2005 approximated 45,200.
