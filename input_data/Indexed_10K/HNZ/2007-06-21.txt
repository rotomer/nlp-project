Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Executive Overview Fiscal 2007 The H.J. Heinz Company has been a pioneer in the food industry for 138 years and possesses one of the worlds best and most recognizable brands Heinz. While the Company has prospered for a long time, we are constantly finding new ways to capitalize on emerging consumer trends and better methods of doing business. Over the past several years, we have been making great progress in simplifying and focusing the Company on three core businesses. This strategic transformation began with the spin off of our non core U.S. businesses in December 2002, and was completed in Fiscal 2006 with the sales of our European Seafood and New Zealand Poultry businesses. On June 1, 2006, the Company presented its Superior Value and Growth Plan for fiscal years 2007 and 2008. Under this plan, the Company set forth three key operational imperatives: grow the core portfolio, reduce costs to drive margins and generate cash to deliver superior value. Under each of these imperatives, the Company set financial and operational targets, aimed at increasing shareholder value. The Company achieved its targets for Fiscal 2007 and is well positioned for continued growth in Fiscal 2008. Specifically: Net sales grew over 4% to $9.0 billion. Operating income grew 7.2%, excluding special items in the prior year, including an incremental $64 million (or 24%) in consumer marketing investment (see table in Fiscal 2006 Transformation Costs which reconciles Fiscal 2006 reported amounts to amounts excluding special items). Operating free cash flow (cash flow from operations of $1,062 million less capital expenditures of $245 million plus proceeds from disposals of PPE of $61 million) grew to $878 million. EPS grew to $2.38, an increase of 13% excluding prior year special items. The following is a detailed update on the Companys progress against the three imperatives under our Superior Value and Growth Plan at the end of Fiscal 2007 as well as a summary of our expectations under these imperatives for Fiscal 2008. Grow the Core Portfolio This imperative is focused on a strategy to grow our largest brands in our three core categories. This strategy established targets for increased marketing spending of $50 million and double digit increases in research and development costs (RD). In addition, this strategy also focused on growth in various emerging markets, where growth potential was viewed as high. During Fiscal 2007, we made excellent progress against this imperative as evidenced by the following: Our top 15 brands, which generate nearly 70% of total sales, grew 8.5%. We launched more than 100 new products supported by a 24% increase in marketing. RD increased nearly 20% as we increased capabilities in the areas of innovation and consumer insight. Innovation in our emerging markets drove strong growth, with a sales increase of 12% in our RICIP markets (Russia, India, China, Indonesia and Poland) and Latin America. These markets accounted for approximately 10% of sales and 27% of the Companys total sales growth in Fiscal 2007. Looking forward to Fiscal 2008, the Companys innovation pipeline contains over 200 consumer validated new products across our markets. The Company is planning incremental improvements in the health and wellness profile of its products in Fiscal 2008 as well as convenience products like 12 Table of Contents portable hand held snacks under the Smart Ones brand and microwavable soups in the UK, Australia and New Zealand. The Company plans to support new products introduced in Fiscal 2008 with an additional $30 to $40 million of incremental marketing spending, completing a two year increase of around $100 million. The Company will continue to invest for growth in our emerging RICIP and Latin American markets, which we expect to continue delivering double digit growth in Fiscal 2008. By the end of Fiscal 2008, we expect these markets to reach $1 billion in sales. Reduce Costs to Drive Margins The Companys investment in growth behind the core portfolio has been fueled by the second pillar of our two year plan, Reducing Costs to Drive Margins. Key targets set under this imperative included productivity improvements on deals and allowances (DA), cost of goods sold (COGS) and selling, general and administrative expenses (SGA). The following summarizes our progress in Fiscal 2007 relative to this imperative: DA as a percentage of gross sales was reduced by 100 basis points, slightly ahead of our original target. COGS was reduced by 90 basis points as a percentage of sales, excluding prior year special items, and total gross profit exceeded target expectations. The Company divested or closed 16 plants around the globe, one more than our original goal for the year. As a result of productivity gains and, despite increasing consumer marketing by 60 basis points as a percentage of sales, operating income margin increased by 50 basis points, excluding prior year special items. In Fiscal 2008, the Company will continue to invest in improved business systems in order to boost the efficiency of its promotional programs, particularly in Europe. We expect further decreases in trade spending with a goal of reducing it by 130 basis points as a percentage of gross sales over the two year plan. Trade promotion reductions and other productivity measures coupled with strategic pricing are expected to drive gross margin expansion. A Global Supply Chain Task Force has been established with the goal of further driving cost reductions, primarily in COGS. We expect additional SGA savings in Fiscal 2008 aided by headcount reductions, pension savings and more efficient indirect procurement. The Companys total anticipated productivity is now $380 million over two years, which exceeds its previous estimates. Generate Cash to Deliver Superior Value Heinzs growth, cost savings and working capital productivity drove operating free cash flow of $878 million, or almost 10% of revenue. This was 10% ahead of the goal for the year and better than the prior year. Much of this increased cash flow has been returned directly to shareholders, as evidenced by the following: Increase in the Companys dividend in Fiscal 2007 by 17%, to a payout ratio of close to 60%. Decrease in average shares outstanding by 2.8%, resulting from net share repurchases in Fiscal 2007 of $501 million. Total shareholder return in Fiscal 2007 of almost 15%. After tax return on invested capital (ROIC) improved 100 basis points to 15.8%. In Fiscal 2008, we expect to continue to generate strong cash flow. Based on this confidence, the Board of Directors increased the dividend for Fiscal 2008 by 8.6%, for an annual indicative rate of $1.52 per share. We expect to return approximately 60% of our earnings to our shareholders in the 13 Table of Contents form of dividends. We also expect to return an additional $500 million to shareholders through net share repurchases in Fiscal 2008. Results of Continuing Operations The Companys revenues are generated via the sale of products in the following categories: Fiscal Year Ended May 2, May 3, April 27, 2007 2006 2005 (52 Weeks) (53 Weeks) (52 Weeks) (Dollars in thousands) Ketchup and sauces $ 3,682,102 $ 3,530,346 $ 3,234,229 Meals and snacks 4,026,168 3,876,743 3,680,920 Infant foods 929,075 863,943 855,558 Other 364,285 372,406 332,749 Total $ 9,001,630 $ 8,643,438 $ 8,103,456 Fiscal Years Ended May 2, 2007 and May 3, 2006 Sales for Fiscal 2007 increased $358.2 million, or 4.1%, to $9.00 billion. Sales were favorably impacted by a volume increase of 0.7%, despite one less selling week in Fiscal 2007 compared with Fiscal 2006. Volume growth was led by North American Consumer Products, Australia, New Zealand and Germany, and the emerging markets of India, China and Poland. These increases were partially offset by declines in the U.K. and Russian businesses. Pricing increased sales by 2.1%, mainly due to our businesses in North America, the U.K, Indonesia and Latin America. Divestitures, net of acquisitions, decreased sales by 1.6%. Foreign exchange translation rates increased sales by 2.9%. Gross profit increased $299.8 million, or 9.7%, to $3.39 billion, and the gross profit margin increased to 37.7% from 35.8%. These improvements reflect higher volume, increased pricing, productivity improvements and favorable foreign exchange, partially offset by commodity cost increases. Also contributing to the favorable comparison are the $91.6 million of prior year strategic transformation costs discussed below. SGA decreased $33.3 million, or 1.7%, to $1.95 billion and decreased as a percentage of sales to 21.6% from 22.9%. These decreases are primarily due to the favorable impact of the prior year targeted workforce reductions, particularly in Europe and Asia, and the $144.8 million of prior year strategic transformation costs discussed below. These declines were partially offset by increased marketing and RD expenses, costs related to the proxy contest affecting the Companys 2006 election of directors, and higher incentive compensation costs, including the expensing of stock options (SFAS No. 123R). Selling and distribution costs (SD) were higher as a result of the volume increase; however as a percentage of sales, SD declined. Total marketing support (recorded as a reduction of revenue or as a component of SGA) increased $4.4 million, or 0.2%, to $2.18 billion on a gross sales increase of 2.8%. Marketing support recorded as a reduction of revenue, typically deals and allowances, decreased $59.7 million, or 3.1%, to $1.85 billion. This decrease is largely due to spending reductions on less efficient promotions and a realignment of list prices, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation rates. Marketing support recorded as a component of SGA increased $64.1 million, or 23.8%, to $333.5 million, consistent with the Companys continued strategy to invest behind its key brands. Operating income increased $333.1 million, or 29.9%, to $1.45 billion, which was favorably impacted by increased volume, the higher gross profit margin and the $236.4 million of prior year strategic transformation costs discussed below. Net interest expense increased $8.3 million, to $291.4 million, due primarily to higher average interest rates and higher average debt in Fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2006 income from continuing operations 14 Table of Contents was unfavorably impacted by the $111.0 million write down of the Companys net investment in Zimbabwe. Other expenses, net, increased $4.9 million, to $30.9 million, largely due to increased currency losses and minority interest expense, the later of which is a result of improved business performance in our joint ventures, partially offset by the $6.9 million loss on the sale of the Companys equity investment in The Hain Celestial Group, Inc. (Hain) in the prior year. The current year effective tax rate was 29.6% compared to 36.2% for the prior year. During the first quarter of Fiscal 2007, a foreign subsidiary of the Company revalued certain of its assets, under local law, increasing the local tax basis by approximately $245 million. This revaluation reduced Fiscal 2007 tax expense by approximately $35 million. During the third quarter of Fiscal 2007, final conditions necessary to reverse a foreign tax reserve related to a prior year transaction were achieved. As a result, the Company realized a non cash tax benefit of $64.1 million. At the same time, the Company modified its plans for repatriation of foreign earnings, ultimately incurring an additional charge of $89.8 million. Full year Fiscal 2007 repatriation costs were $107.8 million, exceeding Fiscal 2006s repatriation costs by approximately $78.2 million. In addition, Fiscal 2007 tax expense benefited from reductions in foreign statutory tax rates and initiatives associated with RD tax credits. The Fiscal 2006 tax expense benefited from the reversal of a tax provision of $23.4 million related to a foreign affiliate along with an additional benefit of $16.3 million resulting from tax planning initiatives related to foreign tax credits, which was partially offset by the non deductibility of certain asset write offs. Income from continuing operations was $791.6 million compared to $442.8 million in the prior year, an increase of 78.8%, primarily due to the increase in operating income and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by higher net interest expense. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $2.38 in the current year compared to $1.29 in the prior year, an increase of 84.5%, which also benefited from a 2.8% reduction in fully diluted shares outstanding. FISCAL YEAR 2007 OPERATING RESULTS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT North American Consumer Products Sales of the North American Consumer Products segment increased $185.4 million, or 7.3%, to $2.74 billion. Volume increased 2.6%, largely resulting from strong growth in Smart Ones and Boston Market frozen entrees and desserts, Classico pasta sauces and Ore Ida frozen potatoes. The increases reflect new distribution, increased consumption driven by new product launches and increased marketing support. These increases were partially offset by the expected volume decline in Heinz ketchup, reflecting a reduction in promotion expense as part of the strategy to increase consumption of more profitable larger sizes. Pricing increased 2.1% largely due to Heinz ketchup, Ore Ida frozen potatoes, Smart Ones frozen entrees and Bagel Bites and TGIF frozen snacks, all resulting primarily from reduced inefficient promotions. Acquisitions increased sales 1.9%, primarily from the prior year acquisitions of Nancys Specialty Foods and HP Foods as well as the current year acquisition of Renes Gourmet Foods. Favorable Canadian exchange translation rates increased sales 0.7%. Gross profit increased $85.8 million, or 8.2%, to $1.14 billion, and the gross profit margin increased to 41.4% from 41.1%. These improvements were due primarily to increased volume, higher pricing and the favorable impact of acquisitions, partially offset by increased commodity costs. Operating income increased $42.3 million, or 7.3%, to $625.7 million, mainly due to the improvement in gross profit and $6.6 million of prior year transformation costs discussed below. This increase was partially offset by a $32.2 million or 40.4% increase in consumer marketing, primarily for Heinz ketchup, Smart Ones frozen entrees, Ore Ida frozen potatoes and frozen snacks, and increased RD costs. In addition, operating income benefited from reduced SD as a percentage of sales due to reduced transportation costs resulting from distribution efficiencies. 15 Table of Contents U.S. Foodservice Sales of the U.S. Foodservice segment decreased $13.5 million, or 0.9%, to $1.56 billion, primarily due to the impact of divestitures. Divestitures, net of acquisitions, reduced sales 2.1%. Pricing increased 1.7%, largely due to Heinz ketchup and tomato products, single serve condiments and frozen desserts. Volume decreased 0.4%, as higher volume in Heinz ketchup was offset by declines resulting primarily from one less week in the fiscal year and a decision to exit certain low margin accounts. Gross profit increased $29.0 million, or 6.6%, to $465.3 million, and the gross profit margin increased to 29.9% from 27.8%, due to $7.5 million of prior year reorganization costs discussed below and a $21.5 million impairment charge in the prior year related to the sale of the Portion Pac Bulk product line. In addition, increased pricing was offset by higher commodity costs. Operating income increased $38.8 million, or 21.9%, to $216.1 million, largely due to the increase in gross profit and reduced SD expense as a percentage of sales resulting from productivity initiatives. Europe Heinz Europes sales increased $89.0 million, or 3.0%, to $3.08 billion. Pricing increased 1.7%, driven primarily by value added innovation and reduced promotions on Heinz soup and pasta meals in the U.K and in the Italian infant nutrition business. Volume declined 2.4% as improvements in Heinz ketchup, Heinz beans, Weight Watchers branded products and Pudliszki ketchup and ready meals in Poland were more than offset by market softness in non Heinz branded products in Russia and the non branded European frozen business and declines in U.K. ready to serve soups and pasta convenience meals. Volume was also unfavorably impacted by one less week in the current fiscal year. The acquisition of HP Foods and Petrosoyuz in Fiscal 2006 increased sales 1.9%, while divestitures reduced sales 5.6%. Favorable exchange translation rates increased sales by 7.3%. Gross profit increased $112.0 million, or 10.0%, to $1.24 billion, and the gross profit margin increased to 40.2% from 37.6%. These improvements are due to higher pricing, favorable impact of exchange translation rates and $36.3 million of prior year transformation costs discussed below. These improvements were partially offset by reduced volume and increased commodity and manufacturing costs. Operating income increased $152.2 million, or 36.7%, to $566.4 million, due to the increase in gross profit, the $112.2 million of prior year transformation costs discussed below, and reduced general and administrative expenses (GA), partially offset by increased marketing expense. The decrease in GA is driven by the workforce reductions, including the elimination of European headquarters. Asia/Pacific Sales in Asia/Pacific increased $85.1 million, or 7.6%, to $1.20 billion. Volume increased sales 4.2%, reflecting strong volume in Australia, New Zealand and China, largely due to increased marketing and new product introductions. Higher pricing increased sales 2.1%, mainly due to commodity related price increases taken on Indonesian sauces and drinks. Divestitures reduced sales 0.3%, and foreign exchange translation rates increased sales by 1.7%. Gross profit increased $51.5 million, or 15.4%, to $386.8 million, and the gross profit margin increased to 32.2% from 30.0%. These improvements were due to volume increases and higher pricing, partially offset by increased commodity costs, most notably in Indonesia. The prior year also included an $18.8 million asset impairment charge on an Indonesian noodle business. Operating income increased $50.6 million, to $135.8 million, largely reflecting the increase in gross profit and reduced GA, partially offset by increased marketing. The reduction in GA is a result of effective cost control in our Chinese businesses, targeted workforce reductions, including the elimination of Asian headquarters in the prior year, and $10.2 million of reorganization costs in the prior year related to the workforce reductions discussed below. 16 Table of Contents Rest of World Sales for Rest of World increased $12.2 million, or 2.9%, to $427.1 million. Volume increased 6.1% due primarily to market and share growth in nutritional drinks in India, ketchup and baby food in Latin America and in our business in South Africa. Higher pricing increased sales by 7.6%, largely due to reduced promotions on ketchup and price increases taken on baby food in Latin America. Divestitures reduced sales 8.8% and foreign exchange translation rates reduced sales 1.9%. Gross profit increased $16.1 million, or 12.1%, to $148.9 million, as increased volume and higher pricing were partially offset by higher commodity costs in India and the impact of divestitures. The prior year also included $5.8 million of asset impairment charges discussed below. Operating income increased $36.0 million, to $53.9 million, due primarily to the increase in gross profit and the $27.9 million in prior year transformation costs primarily related to divestitures. As a result of general economic uncertainty, coupled with restrictions on the repatriation of earnings, as of the end of November 2002 the Company deconsolidated its Zimbabwean operations and classified its remaining net investment of approximately $111 million as a cost investment. In the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006, the Company wrote off its net investment in Zimbabwe. The decision to write down the Zimbabwe investment related to managements determination that this investment was not a core business and, as a consequence, the Company would explore strategic options to exit this business. The Company is still exploring such options. Managements determination was based on an evaluation of political and economic conditions existing in Zimbabwe and the ability for the Company to recover its cost in this investment. This evaluation considered the continued economic turmoil, further instability in the local currency and the uncertainty regarding the ability to source raw material in the future. Fiscal Years Ended May 3, 2006 and April 27, 2005 Sales for Fiscal 2006 increased $540.0 million, or 6.7%, to $8.6 billion. Sales were favorably impacted by a volume increase of 3.8% driven primarily by the North American Consumer Products segment, as well as the Australian, Indonesian and Italian businesses. These volume increases were partially offset by declines in the European frozen food business. Pricing decreased sales slightly, by 0.1%, as improvements in Latin America, Indonesia and North America were offset by declines in Australia, U.K and Northern Europe. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased sales by 4.4%. Foreign exchange translation rates decreased sales by 1.5%. Gross profit increased $59.5 million, or 2.0%, to $3.1 billion, primarily due to the favorable impact of acquisitions and higher sales volume, partially offset by unfavorable exchange translation rates. The gross profit margin decreased to 35.8% from 37.4% mainly due to the strategic transformation costs discussed below, pricing declines in the Europe segment, particularly in Northern Europe and in the U.K. and due to increased commodity costs, particularly in the North American and Indonesian businesses. SGA increased $227.4 million, or 13.0%, to $2.0 billion, and increased as a percentage of sales to 22.9% from 21.6%. The increase as a percentage of sales is primarily due to the $144.8 million (1.7% of sales) of strategic transformation costs discussed below, the impact of acquisitions, and higher fuel and transportation costs. These increases were partially offset by decreased GA in Europe, due primarily to the elimination of European Headquarters and reduced litigation costs. Total marketing support (recorded as a reduction of revenue or as a component of SGA) increased $108.8 million, or 5.3%, to $2.2 billion on a gross sales increase of 6.5%. Marketing support recorded as a reduction of revenue, typically deals and allowances, increased $107.0 million, or 5.9%, to $1.9 billion. This increase is largely a result of increased trade promotion spending in the U.K. and Australia and the impact of acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by decreases in the Italian infant nutrition business and foreign exchange translation rates. Marketing support recorded 17 Table of Contents as a component of SGA increased $1.8 million, or 0.7%, to $269.4 million, as increases from acquisitions were largely offset by declines in the U.K. Operating income decreased $167.9 million, or 13.1%, to $1.1 billion. Net interest expense increased $78.0 million, to $283.1 million due to higher average interest rates and higher average debt in Fiscal 2006 due to acquisitions and share repurchases. Fiscal 2006 income from continuing operations was unfavorably impacted by the $111.0 million write down of the Companys net investment in Zimbabwe. Fiscal 2005 includes the non cash impairment charges totaling $73.8 million related to the cost and equity investments discussed below. Other expenses, net, increased $11.1 million to $26.1 million primarily due to the loss on the sale of equity investments in Fiscal 2006. The Fiscal 2006 effective tax rate was 36.2% compared to 30.3% in Fiscal 2005. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of increased costs of repatriation including the effects of the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA), a reduction in tax benefits associated with tax planning, increased costs associated with audit settlements and the write off of investment in affiliates for which no tax benefit could be recognized, offset by the reversal of valuation allowances, the benefit of increased profits in lower tax rate jurisdictions and a reduction in tax reserves. Income from continuing operations was $442.8 million compared to $688.0 million in Fiscal 2005, a decrease of 35.6%. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.29 in Fiscal 2006 compared to $1.95 in Fiscal 2005. FISCAL YEAR 2006 OPERATING RESULTS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT North American Consumer Products Sales of the North American Consumer Products segment increased $297.3 million, or 13.2%, to $2.6 billion. Volume increased significantly, up 7.7%, as a result of strong growth in Heinz ketchup, TGI Fridays and Delimex brands of frozen snacks, Classico pasta sauces, Smart Ones frozen entrees and in Ore Ida potatoes. Pricing was up 0.4% and the HP Foods and Nancys acquisitions increased sales 3.9%. Divestitures reduced sales 0.1% and favorable Canadian exchange translation rates increased sales 1.3%. Gross profit increased $106.6 million, or 11.3%, to $1.0 billion, driven primarily by volume growth and acquisitions. The gross profit margin declined to 41.1% from 41.8%, primarily due to increased commodity costs and a benefit in Fiscal 2005 from the favorable termination of a long term co packing arrangement with a customer. Operating income increased $52.9 million, or 10.0%, to $583.4 million, due to the increase in gross profit, partially offset by increased SD, primarily due to acquisitions and increased volume, $6.6 million of transformation costs, and increased RD costs associated with the new Heinz Global Innovation and Quality Center. U.S. Foodservice Sales of the U.S. Foodservice segment increased $66.0 million, or 4.4%, to $1.6 billion. The acquisition of AAI and Kabobs, Inc. increased sales 3.9%. Volume increased sales 0.2%, as increases in Truesoups frozen soups were partially offset by declines in Heinz ketchup. Pricing increased sales 0.3% as increases in custom recipe tomato products and frozen desserts were partially offset by declines in ketchup. Gross profit decreased $21.2 million, or 4.6%, to $436.3 million, as the favorable benefit of the AAI acquisition was partially offset by $7.5 million of reorganization costs discussed below and a $21.5 million impairment charge for the planned sale of the Portion Pac Bulk product line. The gross profit margin decreased to 27.8% from 30.4% primarily due to the reorganization costs and the asset impairment charge, as well as increased commodity and fuel costs. Operating income decreased 18 Table of Contents $47.5 million, or 21.1%, to $177.3 million, chiefly due to $34.8 million of reorganization and asset impairment charges and increased SGA, largely due to higher fuel and distribution costs and marketing support. Europe Heinz Europes sales increased $79.1 million, or 2.7%, to $3.0 billion. The HP Foods and Petrosoyuz acquisitions increased sales 9.1%. Volume increased 1.2%, principally due to the Italian infant feeding business, convenience meals in Poland and the U.K., and ketchup growth across Europe. These increases were partially offset by the frozen foods business in the U.K., resulting from general category softness. Lower pricing decreased sales 1.4%, driven by increased promotional spending in the U.K on Heinz soup, partially offset by price increases on Heinz beans and improvements in the Italian infant feeding business. Divestitures reduced sales 1.8%, and unfavorable exchange translation rates decreased sales by 4.3%. Gross profit decreased $10.9 million, or 1.0%, to $1.1 billion, and the gross profit margin decreased to 37.6% from 39.0%. These decreases are primarily due to $36.3 million of transformation costs discussed below, unfavorable exchange translation rates, decreased pricing in the U.K and higher manufacturing costs in Northern Europe. Operating income decreased $85.8 million, or 17.2%, to $414.2 million, due largely to the gross profit decrease, unfavorable exchange translation rates and the $112.2 million of transformation costs discussed below, partially offset by the favorable impact of acquisitions, reduced GA and decreased marketing expense in the U.K. Asia/Pacific Sales in Asia/Pacific increased 7.6%. Volume increased sales 8.1%, reflecting double digit volume growth in Australia along with strong performances in the Watties business and in Indonesia. These increases reflect new product introductions and increased promotional programs. Unfavorable exchange translation rates decreased sales by 1.0%, while lower pricing reduced sales 0.5%, primarily in the Australian business. The acquisition of LongFong in China, net of a small divestiture, increased sales 1.1%. Gross profit decreased $16.1 million, or 4.6%, to $335.3 million, and the gross profit margin declined to 30.0% from 33.9%. These declines were primarily a result of an $18.8 million asset impairment charge on an Indonesian noodle product line divested in Fiscal 2007 and increased commodity and manufacturing costs in Indonesia and China, partially offset by the favorable impact of acquisitions and sales volume. Operating income decreased $27.9 million, or 24.7%, to $85.2 million, primarily due to the decline in gross profit margin, increased SD and $10.2 million of reorganization costs related to targeted workforce reductions discussed below. Rest of World Sales for Rest of World increased 4.6%. Volume increased 3.8% reflecting strong infant feeding sales in Latin America and beverage sales in India. Higher pricing increased sales by 6.2%, largely due to price increases and reduced promotions in Latin America. Divestitures, net of acquisitions, reduced sales by 2.6%, and foreign exchange translation rates reduced sales by 2.8%. Gross profit increased $5.0 million, or 3.9%, to $132.8 million, due mainly to increased pricing which was partially offset by $5.8 million in asset impairment charges discussed below. Operating income decreased $16.9 million, to $17.9 million, as the increase in gross profit was more than offset by the $27.9 million in transformation costs primarily related to divestitures. In addition, Fiscal 2005s results include the proceeds of an agreement related to the recall in Israel. 19 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations During fiscal years 2003 through 2006, the Company focused on exiting non strategic business operations. Certain of these businesses which were sold are accounted for as discontinued operations. In the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006, the Company completed the sale of the European seafood business, which included the brands of John West, Petit Navire, Marie Elisabeth and Mareblu. The Company received net proceeds of $469.3 million for this disposal and recognized a $199.8 million pretax ($122.9 million after tax) gain which has been recorded in discontinued operations. Also in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006, the Company completed the sale of the Tegel poultry business in New Zealand and received net proceeds of $150.4 million, and recognized a $10.4 million non taxable gain, which is also recorded in discontinued operations. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the operating results related to these businesses have been included in discontinued operations in the Companys consolidated statements of income for all periods presented. The Company recorded a loss of $3.3 million ($5.9 million after tax) from these businesses for the year ended May 2, 2007, primarily resulting from purchase price adjustments pursuant to the transaction agreements. These discontinued operations generated sales of $688.0 million (partial year) and $808.8 million and net income of $169.1 million (net of $90.2 million in tax expense) and $47.8 million (net of $23.3 million in tax expense) for the years ended May 3, 2006 and April 27, 2005, respectively. In addition, net income from discontinued operations includes amounts related to the favorable settlement of tax liabilities associated with the businesses spun off to Del Monte in Fiscal 2003. Such amounts totaled $33.7 million and $16.9 million for the years ended May 3, 2006 and April 27, 2005, respectively. Fiscal 2006 Transformation Costs In executing its strategic transformation during Fiscal 2006, the Company incurred the following associated costs. These costs were directly linked to the Companys transformation strategy. Reorganization Costs In Fiscal 2006, the Company recorded pretax integration and reorganization charges for targeted workforce reductions consistent with the Companys goals to streamline its businesses totaling $124.7 million ($80.3 million after tax). Approximately 1,000 positions were eliminated as a result of this program, primarily in the GA area. Additionally, pretax costs of $22.0 million ($16.3 million after tax) were incurred in Fiscal 2006, primarily as a result of the strategic reviews related to the portfolio realignment.

Also during the third quarter of Fiscal 2006, the Company sold its equity investment in Hain and recognized a $6.9 million ($4.5 million after tax) loss which is recorded within other expense, net. Net proceeds from the sale of this investment were $116.1 million. During the third quarter of Fiscal 2005, the Company recognized a $64.5 million impairment charge on its equity investment in Hain. The charge reduced Heinzs carrying value in Hain to fair market value as of January 26, 2005, with no resulting impact on cash flows. The Company also recorded a $9.3 million non cash charge in the third quarter of Fiscal 2005 to recognize the impairment of a cost basis investment in a grocery industry sponsored e commerce business venture. Due to the uncertainty of realizability and executing possible tax planning strategies, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $27.3 million against the potential tax benefits primarily related to the Hain impairment. This valuation allowance was subsequently released in Fiscal 2006 based upon tax planning strategies that are expected to generate sufficient capital gains that will occur during the capital loss carryforward period.
