Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Executive Overview Fiscal 2008 The H.J. Heinz Company has been a pioneer in the food industry for 139 years and possesses one of the worlds best and most recognizable brands Heinz. In the first half of this decade, the Company was reshaped around three core categories, Ketchup, Condiments and Sauces, Meals and Snacks and Infant/Nutrition. Beginning with the spin off of non core U.S. businesses in December 2002 and ending in Fiscal 2006 with the sales of our non core European Seafood and New Zealand Poultry businesses, we divested over $3 billion of non core sales from businesses where we lacked scale and competitive advantage. During this same time period, we acquired almost $1.5 billion of new revenue in core categories and faster growing emerging markets. Consequently, our core categories now generate almost 96% of our sales and each is showing strong growth. Additionally, our top 15 brands, each of which exceeds $100 million in annual sales, drive approximately 70% of our sales. The Heinz brand generates almost $4 billion of annual sales and has extraordinary reach across all of our categories and most of our markets. Our focus on three core categories, our top 15 brands and emerging markets has enhanced our growth trajectory and enabled us to achieve improved productivity. Performance under the Fiscal 2007 2008 Superior Value and Growth Plan Unless specifically noted, all amounts in this section represent figures over the two year time frame of the Plan (Fiscal 2007 2008). Also, all growth rates represent compounded annual growth rates (CAGR) over this same two year period, using Fiscal 2006 continuing operations, excluding special items as the base (see table in Fiscal 2006 Transformation Costs which reconciles Fiscal 2006 reported amounts to amounts excluding special items). On June 1, 2006, the Company presented its Superior Value and Growth Plan for fiscal years 2007 and 2008. Under this Plan, the Company set forth three key operational imperatives: grow the core portfolio, reduce costs to drive margins and generate cash to deliver superior value. Under each of these imperatives, the Company established financial and operational targets aimed at increasing shareholder value. The Company has met or exceeded virtually all of the targets established in the two year Plan and believes that it is well positioned for continued growth in Fiscals 2009 and 2010. For the two years ending with Fiscal 2008: Net sales grew at a CAGR of 8%, to over $10 billion for the first time in the Companys history, driven primarily by strong volume and net pricing as well as favorable foreign exchange. Operating income grew at a CAGR of 8%, as strong top line growth and productivity more than offset higher commodity costs and incremental marketing investments, which grew at a CAGR of 19%. Operating free cash flow in Fiscal 2008 (cash flow from operations of $1,188 million less capital expenditures of $302 million plus proceeds from disposals of PPE of $9 million) grew to $895 million and was nearly $1.8 billion over the two year Plan period. EPS grew to $2.63, an average annual increase of 12%. The following is a detailed analysis of the Companys overall performance against the three imperatives under our Superior Value and Growth Plan. Grow the Core Portfolio This imperative focused on a strategy to grow our largest brands in our three core categories. This strategy established targets for average annual increased marketing spending of 17% and double digit increases in research and development investment (RD). This strategy also focused on expansion in various emerging markets, where growth potential was viewed as high. During 13 Table of Contents Fiscal 2008 and over the entire two year Plan period, we delivered excellent results relative to this imperative as evidenced by the following: Our top 15 brands, which generate nearly 70% of total sales, grew at a CAGR of 12%, driven by strong volume and net price increases as well as favorable impacts from foreign exchange. Over the two year Plan period, we launched a number of new products, which accounted for approximately 11% of sales and was supported by a 19% average annual increase in marketing. RD increased at a CAGR of 18% as we increased capabilities in the areas of innovation and consumer insight. Innovation in our emerging markets (Russia, Poland, the Czech Republic, Indonesia, China, India, South Africa, the Middle East and Latin America) drove strong growth, with an average annual sales increase of 19%, which accounted for 26% of the Companys total sales growth over the two year period. These markets accounted for approximately 13% of total Company sales in Fiscal 2008. Reduce Costs to Drive Margins The Companys investment in growth behind the core portfolio has been fueled by the second pillar of our two year Plan, Reducing Costs to Drive Margins. Key targets set under this imperative included productivity improvements on deals and allowances (DA), cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative expenses (SGA). The following summarizes our results relative to this imperative: DA as a percentage of gross sales was reduced by 170 basis points, 30 basis point ahead of our original target. Total gross profit dollars exceeded target expectations by $200 million, or almost 6%, although gross margin was 200 basis points below target due to higher than expected commodity inflation. As a result of new product introductions, volume growth, pricing, productivity and foreign exchange, the Company has successfully offset commodity costs and achieved strong gross profit growth. The Company divested or closed 20 plants around the globe, 4 of which were during Fiscal 2008. SGA, excluding marketing, was 17.2% as a percentage of sales in Fiscal 2008, 30 basis points better than target. As a result of productivity gains in SGA and despite a 19% average annual increase in consumer marketing, we delivered consistent operating income growth at a CAGR of 8%. Generate Cash to Deliver Superior Value The Companys growth, cost savings and working capital productivity drove operating free cash flow of almost $1.8 billion, which averaged 9% of revenue and 109% of net income over the two years. This was $123 million, or 7% ahead of the target. A key driver in achieving our strong cash flow results was the significant reduction in our Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) of 7 days, which is a 12% reduction when comparing Fiscal 2006 to 2008. Much of this increased cash flow has been returned directly to shareholders, as evidenced by the following: Increase in the Companys dividend by 32 cents, or a CAGR of 12.5%, to $1.52. This increase was to maintain our target payout ratio of approximately 60%. 14 Table of Contents Decrease in average shares outstanding by 6% when comparing Fiscal 2006 to 2008, resulting from net share repurchases of $1 billion. Combining dividends and share repurchases over the last two years, the Company has returned more than $2 billion to shareholders. High Performance Growth Plan for Fiscal 2009 2010 The following are the major targets the Company has set under its new High Performance Growth Plan for Fiscals 2009 2010: For Fiscal 2009 and Fiscal 2010, the Company expects combined sales volume and net price growth of 6%+ annually and EPS growth of 8% to 11% per year. Emerging market revenues are targeted to grow in the high teens over the next two years. The Plan calls for 6% to 7% annual growth in operating income, while increasing the investment in marketing by $60 million to $100 million over the two year period. Pricing and productivity gains are expected to help offset the 8 to 9% inflation expected in commodities to maintain the current gross profit and operating income margins realized in Fiscal 2008. Annualized dividend raised to $1.66 per share, an increase of 9.2%, for Fiscal 2009 and the Company anticipates a dividend payout ratio of around 60% for Fiscal 2010. The Company expects operating free cash flow of approximately $1.7 billion over the two year period, driven by a 2 to 3 day reduction per year in CCC. Results of Continuing Operations The Companys revenues are generated via the sale of products in the following categories: Fiscal Year Ended April 30, May 2, May 3, 2008 2007 2006 (52 Weeks) (52 Weeks) (53 Weeks) (Dollars in thousands) Ketchup and sauces $ 4,081,864 $ 3,682,102 $ 3,530,346 Meals and snacks 4,521,697 4,026,168 3,876,743 Infant/Nutrition 1,089,544 929,075 863,943 Other 377,673 364,285 372,406 Total $ 10,070,778 $ 9,001,630 $ 8,643,438 Fiscal Year Ended April 30, 2008 compared to Fiscal Year Ended May 2, 2007 Sales for Fiscal 2008 increased $1.07 billion, or 11.9%, to $10.07 billion, reflecting growth in all five business segments. Volume increased 3.6%, as continued solid growth in the North American Consumer Products segment, Australia, New Zealand and the emerging markets were combined with strong performance of beans, soup and pasta meals in the U.K. and Heinz ketchup across Europe. The emerging markets produced a 9.1% volume increase and accounted for over 24% of the Companys total sales growth for the year. These volume increases were partially offset by declines in U.S. Foodservice. Net pricing increased sales by 3.3%, mainly in the North American Consumer Products, European and U.S. Foodservice segments and our businesses in Latin America and Indonesia. Divestitures, net of acquisitions, decreased sales by 0.2%. Foreign exchange translation rates increased sales by 5.1%. Sales of the Companys top 15 brands grew 13.4% from prior year, led by strong increases in Heinz, Smart Ones, Classico, Boston Market, Pudliszki, Weight Watchers and ABC. These 15 Table of Contents increases are a result of the Companys strategy of focused innovation and marketing support behind these top brands. Gross profit increased $288 million, or 8.5%, to $3.68 billion, benefiting from favorable volume, pricing and foreign exchange translation rates. The gross profit margin decreased to 36.5% from 37.7%, as pricing and productivity improvements were more than offset by increased commodity costs. The most significant commodity cost increases were for dairy, oils and grains. SGA increased $166 million, or 8.5%, to $2.11 billion. As a percentage of sales, SGA decreased to 21.0% from 21.6%. The increase in SGA is due to a 14.9% increase in marketing expense, a 16.9% increase in RD and higher selling and distribution costs (SD) resulting from increased volume, higher fuel costs and foreign exchange translation rates. Additional investments were also made in the current year for global task force initiatives, streamlining and system capability improvements. These increases were partially offset by the benefits of effective cost control and prior year workforce reductions and costs related to the proxy contest. Total marketing support (recorded as a reduction of revenue or as a component of SGA) increased $177 million, or 8.1%, to $2.36 billion on a gross sales increase of 11.0%. Marketing support recorded as a reduction of revenue, typically DA, increased $127 million, or 6.9%, to $1.98 billion, but decreased as a percentage of gross sales to 16.4% from 17.1%, in line with the Companys strategy to reduce spending on less efficient promotions and realignment of some list prices. Marketing support recorded as a component of SGA increased $50 million, or 14.9%, to $383 million, as we increased consumer marketing across the Companys businesses supporting innovation and our top brands. Operating income increased $122 million, or 8.5%, to $1.57 billion, reflecting the strong sales growth, productivity improvements and favorable impacts from foreign exchange, partially offset by increased commodity costs. Net interest expense increased $32 million, to $323 million, largely as a result of higher debt in Fiscal 2008 related to share repurchase activity. Other expenses, net, decreased $3 million to $28 million, primarily due to an insignificant gain recognized on the sale of our business in Zimbabwe. The current year effective tax rate was 30.6% compared to 29.6% for the prior year. The current years tax rate was higher than the prior years primarily due to benefits recognized in Fiscal 2007 for reversal of a foreign tax reserve, tax planning completed in a foreign jurisdiction, and RD tax credits. Those prior year benefits were partially offset by lower repatriation costs and increased benefits from tax audit settlements occurring during Fiscal 2008, along with changes in valuation allowances for foreign losses. Income from continuing operations was $845 million compared to $792 million in the prior year, an increase of 6.7%, due to the increase in operating income, which was partially offset by higher net interest expense and a higher effective tax rate. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.63 in the current year compared to $2.38 in the prior year, up 10.5%, which also benefited from a 3.2% reduction in fully diluted shares outstanding. FISCAL YEAR 2008 OPERATING RESULTS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT During the first quarter of Fiscal 2008, the Company changed its segment reporting to reclassify its business in India from the Rest of World segment to the Asia/Pacific segment, reflecting organizational changes. Prior periods have been conformed to the current presentation. (See Note 15, Segments in
