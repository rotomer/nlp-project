Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Executive Overview Fiscal 2009 The H.J. Heinz Company has been a pioneer in the food industry for 140 years and possesses one of the worlds best and most recognizable brands Heinz. The Company has a global portfolio of leading brands focused in three core categories, Ketchup and Sauces, Meals and Snacks, and Infant/Nutrition. In Fiscal 2009, Heinz delivered record sales of over $10.1 billion and record high net income of $923 million. Diluted EPS increased by more than 10% to $2.90 and the Company generated $880 million of operating free cash flow (cash flow from operations of $1.167 billion, less capital expenditures of $292 million plus proceeds from disposals of PPE of $5 million). Management believes these results are indicative of the effectiveness of the Companys business plan, which is focused on the following four strategic pillars: Grow the Core Portfolio Accelerate Growth in Emerging Markets Strengthen and Leverage Global Scale Make Talent an Advantage Management believes this strategy has enabled Heinz to drive growth, deliver consistent performance and sustain momentum, despite the weakened global economic environment. The recent global recession has dramatically affected consumer confidence, behavior, spending and ultimately food consumption patterns. The Company has adapted its strategies to address this difficult environment, with a concentration on the following: Investing behind core brands and proven ideas to drive growth; Shifting investments in marketing and research and development toward delivering value to consumers; Continuing its focus on emerging markets where economic growth remains well above the global average; Increasing emphasis on margins through productivity initiatives, reductions in discretionary spending and tight management of fixed costs; and Increasing cash flow with a focus on reducing the cash conversion cycle and tight management of capital spending. During Fiscal 2009, key foreign currencies declined precipitously versus the U.S. dollar. Given that approximately 60% of the Companys sales and the majority of its net income are generated outside of the U.S., foreign currency movements can have a significant impact on the Companys financial results. Inflationary increases in commodity input costs also continued in Fiscal 2009, and some key input costs remain above historic levels. While we expect Fiscal 2010 results to be impacted by unfavorable foreign currency rates and commodity input costs, the Company remains confident in its business fundamentals and plans to continue executing its strategy. 15 Table of Contents Results of Continuing Operations The Companys revenues are generated via the sale of products in the following categories: Fiscal Year Ended April 29, April 30, May 2, 2009 2008 2007 (52 Weeks) (52 Weeks) (52 Weeks) (Dollars in thousands) Ketchup and sauces $ 4,251,583 $ 4,081,864 $ 3,682,102 Meals and snacks 4,361,878 4,521,697 4,026,168 Infant/Nutrition 1,105,313 1,089,544 929,075 Other 429,308 377,673 364,285 Total $ 10,148,082 $ 10,070,778 $ 9,001,630 Fiscal Year Ended April 29, 2009 compared to Fiscal Year Ended April 30, 2008 Sales for Fiscal 2009 increased $77 million, or 0.8%, to $10.15 billion. Net pricing increased sales by 7.0%, as price increases were taken across the Companys portfolio to help compensate for increases in commodity costs. Volume decreased 1.5%, as a net volume improvement in emerging markets was more than offset by declines in the U.S., Australian and New Zealand businesses, which have been impacted by the recessionary economic environment. Volume also declined on frozen products in the U.K. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased sales by 1.9%. Foreign exchange translation rates reduced sales by 6.6%, reflecting the impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar on sales generated in international markets. Sales of the Companys top 15 brands grew 2.1% from prior year, as combined volume and pricing gains exceeded the 6.3% unfavorable impact of foreign exchange translation rates on sales. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, the top 15 brands grew by 8.4%, led by strong growth in Heinz, Ore Ida, Classico, Pudliszki and ABC branded products. In addition, global ketchup sales increased 3.2% despite a 5.9% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, resulting in a 9.1% increase excluding the impact of currency translation. Emerging markets continued to be an important growth driver, with sales up 8.8%. Excluding a 7% impact from unfavorable foreign exchange, emerging markets sales grew 15.8%. Gross profit decreased $97 million, or 2.6%, to $3.58 billion, as higher net pricing and the favorable impact of acquisitions was more than offset by a $238 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange translation rates as well as higher commodity costs, including transaction currency costs in the U.K., and lower volume. The gross profit margin decreased to 35.3% from 36.5%, as pricing and productivity improvements were more than offset by increased commodity costs, which includes the impact of cross currency sourcing of ingredients, most notably in the U.K. Selling, general and administrative expenses (SGA) decreased $22 million, or 1.0%, to $2.09 billion, and improved as a percentage of sales to 20.6% from 21.0%. The $22 million decrease in SGA is due to a $117 million impact from foreign exchange translation rates, decreased marketing expense, a life insurance settlement benefit received in the current year and a gain on the sale of a small portion control business in the U.S. These decreases were partially offset by increased spending on global task force initiatives, including system capability improvements, the SGA from recent acquisitions and inflation in Latin America. Operating income decreased $75 million, or 4.8%, to $1.49 billion, reflecting the items above, particularly a $121 million (7.7%) unfavorable impact from foreign exchange translation rates, and higher commodity costs. Net interest expense decreased $48 million, to $275 million, reflecting a $25 million decrease in interest expense and a $23 million increase in interest income. Interest expense benefited from lower average interest rates in Fiscal 2009, which more than offset a higher coupon on the dealer securities 16 Table of Contents which were remarketed on December 1, 2008 (see Note 7 in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information). The improvement in interest income is due to a $20 million mark to market gain in the current year on a total rate of return swap which was entered into in conjunction with the Companys remarketable securities on December 1, 2008. Future mark to market adjustments on the total rate of return swap will be primarily derived from changes in the fair value of the dealer remarketable securities which will reflect fluctuations in the credit market. Other income/(expense), net, improved by $106 million, to $78 million of income compared to $28 million of expense in the prior year, as a $113 million increase in currency gains was partially offset by an insignificant gain recognized on the sale of our business in Zimbabwe in the prior year. The currency gains resulted primarily from forward contracts that were put in place to help mitigate the unfavorable translation impact on profit associated with movements in key foreign currencies for all of Fiscal 2009. The effective tax rate for Fiscal 2009 was 28.8% compared to 30.6% for the prior year. The current year tax rate was lower than the prior year primarily due to reduced repatriation costs partially offset by decreased benefits from the revaluation of tax basis of foreign assets. Net income was $923 million compared to $845 million in the prior year, an increase of 9.2%, due to increased currency gains, reduced net interest expense and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by lower operating income reflecting unfavorable foreign currency movements. Diluted earnings per share was $2.90 in the current year, an increase of 10.3%, compared to $2.63 in the prior year. Earnings per share also benefited from a 1.1% reduction in fully diluted shares outstanding. The translation impact of fluctuating exchange rates in Fiscal 2009 has had a relatively consistent impact on all components of operating income on the consolidated statement of income. The impact of cross currency sourcing of ingredients, most notably in the U.K., reduced gross profit and operating income but did not affect sales. FISCAL YEAR 2009 OPERATING RESULTS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT North American Consumer Products Sales of the North American Consumer Products segment increased $124 million, or 4.1%, to $3.14 billion. Net prices grew 6.8% reflecting price increases taken across the majority of the product portfolio over the last year to help offset higher commodity costs. Volume decreased 0.4%, as increases in Ore Ida frozen potatoes, Heinz ketchup and new TGI Fridays Skillet Meals were more than offset by declines in Delimex frozen products and Smart Ones frozen meals and desserts. The Ore Ida growth was driven by new products such as Steam n Mashtm in addition to the timing of price increases. The Heinz ketchup improvement was largely due to increased consumption. The Smart Ones volume decline resulted from softness in the category, aggressive competitive promotions and the timing of price increases taken in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2008, partially offset by new breakfast product offerings in the current year. Lower sales of Delimex frozen meals and snacks was due to a supply interruption in the first half of Fiscal 2009. Unfavorable Canadian exchange translation rates decreased sales 2.3%. Gross profit increased $38 million, or 3.1%, to $1.26 billion, due primarily to increased pricing partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange translation rates. The gross profit margin decreased to 40.1% from 40.5%, as increased pricing and productivity improvements only partially offset increased commodity costs. Operating income increased $46 million, or 6.8%, to $725 million, largely reflecting the increase in gross profit and decreased marketing expense. 17 Table of Contents Europe Heinz Europe sales decreased $122 million, or 3.4%, to $3.41 billion. Net pricing increased 7.1%, driven by Heinz ketchup, beans and soup, broad based increases in our Russian market, frozen products in the U.K. and Italian infant nutrition products. Volume decreased 1.0%, primarily due to declines on frozen products as a result of price increases, competitor promotions and the exit of lower margin products and customers. Volume was also unfavorably impacted by decreases in Heinz soup and pasta meals in the U.K, and reduced volume in Russia. These declines were partially offset by new product introductions in the U.K. and Continental Europe. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased sales 2.5%, primarily due to the acquisition of the Bndicta sauce business in France during the second quarter of this year and the Wyko sauce business in the Netherlands at the end of Fiscal 2008. Unfavorable foreign exchange translation rates decreased sales by 12.0%. Gross profit decreased $114 million, or 8.3%, to $1.26 billion, and the gross profit margin decreased to 36.9% from 38.8% as unfavorable foreign exchange translation rates, cross currency rate movements in the British Pound versus the Euro and U.S. dollar, increased commodity costs and higher manufacturing costs in the frozen food plants were only partially offset by improved pricing and the favorable impact from acquisitions. Operating income decreased $76 million, or 11.9%, to $561 million, as pricing gains were more than offset by unfavorable translation, increased commodity costs, a portion of which is due to the transaction foreign currency impacts discussed above, increased selling and distribution expenses (SD), a portion of which was from acquisitions, and higher general and administrative expenses (GA) reflecting investments in task forces and systems. Asia/Pacific Heinz Asia/Pacific sales increased $28 million, or 1.7%, to $1.63 billion. Pricing increased 6.1%, due to increases on sardines, sauces and syrup in Indonesia, nutritional beverages in India and pricing gains across the product portfolios in Australia and New Zealand. This pricing partially offset increased commodity costs. Volume decreased 1.4%, as significant improvements on nutritional beverage sales in India, frozen foods in Japan and ABC products in Indonesia were more than offset by declines in convenience meals in Australia and New Zealand and Long Fong frozen products in China. Acquisitions increased sales 6.8% due to the third quarter acquisitions of Golden Circle Limited, a health oriented fruit and juice business in Australia, and La Bonne Cuisine, a chilled dip business in New Zealand. Unfavorable foreign exchange translation rates decreased sales by 9.8%. Gross profit increased $3 million, or 0.6%, to $530 million, while the gross profit margin declined to 32.5% from 32.9%. The $3 million improvement in gross profit was due to increased pricing and acquisitions, which offset increased commodity costs, unfavorable foreign exchange translation rates and reduced volume, particularly in our Long Fong business as we revised our distribution system and streamlined our product offerings. Operating income decreased by $12 million, or 6.4%, to $182 million, as the increase in gross profit and decreased marketing expense was more than offset by increased SD and GA, a portion of which is due to acquisitions. U.S. Foodservice Sales of the U.S. Foodservice segment decreased $53 million, or 3.4%, to $1.51 billion. Pricing increased sales 3.5%, largely due to increases on Heinz ketchup, portion control condiments, frozen soups and tomato products. Volume decreased by 6.0%, reflecting reduced restaurant foot traffic, the exit of numerous lower margin products (stock keeping units) and customers, as well as increased competition on our non branded products. Divestitures reduced sales 0.9%. Gross profit decreased $54 million, or 12.8%, to $365 million, and the gross profit margin decreased to 24.2% from 26.8%, due to lower volume, higher commodity and manufacturing costs and prior year gains on commodity derivative contracts, partially offset by higher pricing. Operating income decreased $40 million, or 23.8%, to $129 million, which was primarily due to the decline in 18 Table of Contents gross profit, partially offset by reduced GA reflecting a gain in the current year on the sale of a small, non core portion control business. Rest of World Sales for Rest of World increased $100 million, or 27.3%, to $468 million. Volume increased 4.6% driven by increases in Latin America and the Middle East. Higher pricing increased sales by 27.6%, largely due to inflation in Latin America and commodity related price increases in South Africa and the Middle East. Acquisitions increased sales 0.2% due to the fourth quarter acquisition of Papillon, a small chilled products business in South Africa. Foreign exchange translation rates decreased sales 5.2%. Gross profit increased $28 million, or 21.4%, to $161 million, due mainly to increased pricing and higher volume, partially offset by increased commodity costs and unfavorable foreign currency movements. Operating income increased $7 million, or 15.2% to $52 million due to the increase in gross profit partially offset by wage inflation in Latin America. Fiscal Year Ended April 30, 2008 compared to Fiscal Year Ended May 2, 2007 Sales for Fiscal 2008 increased $1.07 billion, or 11.9%, to $10.07 billion, reflecting growth in all five business segments. Volume increased 3.6%, as solid growth in the North American Consumer Products segment, Australia, New Zealand and the emerging markets were combined with strong performance of beans, soup and pasta meals in the U.K. and Heinz ketchup across Europe. The emerging markets produced a 9.1% volume increase and accounted for over 24% of the Companys total sales growth for the year. These volume increases were partially offset by declines in U.S. Foodservice. Net pricing increased sales by 3.3%, mainly in the North American Consumer Products, European and U.S. Foodservice segments and our businesses in Latin America and Indonesia. Divestitures, net of acquisitions, decreased sales by 0.2%. Foreign exchange translation rates increased sales by 5.1%. Sales of the Companys top 15 brands grew 13.4% from Fiscal 2007, led by strong increases in Heinz, Smart Ones, Classico, Boston Market, Pudliszki, Weight Watchers and ABC. These increases are a result of the Companys strategy of focused innovation and marketing support behind these top brands. Gross profit increased $288 million, or 8.5%, to $3.68 billion, benefiting from favorable volume, pricing and foreign exchange translation rates. The gross profit margin decreased to 36.5% from 37.7%, as pricing and productivity improvements were more than offset by increased commodity costs. The most significant commodity cost increases were for dairy, oils and grains. SGA increased $166 million, or 8.5%, to $2.11 billion. As a percentage of sales, SGA decreased to 21.0% from 21.6%. The increase in SGA is due to a 14.9% increase in marketing expense, a 16.9% increase in research and development (RD) and higher SD resulting from increased volume, higher fuel costs and foreign exchange translation rates. Additional investments were also made in Fiscal 2008 for global task force initiatives, streamlining and system capability improvements. These increases were partially offset by the benefits of effective cost control and Fiscal 2007 workforce reductions and costs related to the proxy contest. Operating income increased $122 million, or 8.5%, to $1.57 billion, reflecting the strong sales growth, productivity improvements and favorable impacts from foreign exchange, partially offset by increased commodity costs. Net interest expense increased $32 million, to $323 million, largely as a result of higher debt in Fiscal 2008 related to share repurchase activity. Other expenses, net, decreased $3 million to $28 million, primarily due to an insignificant gain recognized on the sale of our business in Zimbabwe. 19 Table of Contents The Fiscal 2008 effective tax rate was 30.6% compared to 29.6% in Fiscal 2007. The Fiscal 2008 tax rate was higher than the Fiscal 2007 rate primarily due to benefits recognized in Fiscal 2007 for reversal of a foreign tax reserve, tax planning completed in a foreign jurisdiction, and RD tax credits. Those Fiscal 2007 benefits were partially offset by lower repatriation costs and increased benefits from tax audit settlements occurring during Fiscal 2008, along with changes in valuation allowances for foreign losses. Income from continuing operations was $845 million compared to $792 million in Fiscal 2007, an increase of 6.7%, due to the increase in operating income, which was partially offset by higher net interest expense and a higher effective tax rate. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.63 in Fiscal 2008 compared to $2.38 in Fiscal 2007, up 10.5%, which also benefited from a 3.2% reduction in fully diluted shares outstanding. FISCAL YEAR 2008 OPERATING RESULTS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT North American Consumer Products Sales of the North American Consumer Products segment increased $272 million, or 9.9%, to $3.01 billion. Volume increased 3.5%, due primarily to Smart Ones frozen entrees and desserts, Boston Market frozen entrees and Classico pasta sauces. The Smart Ones volume improvement was driven by successful new product introductions like Anytime Selectionstm, Fruit Inspirationstm and various dessert items, as well as the impact of the launch of Smart Ones products into Canada. The Boston Market improvements were mainly driven by new products and increased consumption, and the success of Classico was primarily due to new products as well as increased promotions in Canada. These volume improvements were partially offset by a decline in Ore Ida frozen potatoes reflecting the timing of price increases taken during both the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2007 and the third quarter of Fiscal 2008. The Ore Ida frozen potatoes price increases, along with other commodity cost related price increases, resulted in overall price gains of 3.5%. The Fiscal 2007 acquisition of Renees Gourmet Foods in Canada increased sales 0.7% and favorable Canadian exchange translation rates increased sales 2.2%. Gross profit increased $85 million, or 7.5%, to $1.22 billion, due primarily to the sales increase along with favorable foreign exchange translation rates. The gross profit margin decreased to 40.5% from 41.4%, as increased pricing, favorable mix and productivity improvements only partially offset increased commodity costs. Operating income increased $53 million, or 8.4%, to $678 million, due to the strong increase in sales, partially offset by higher commodity costs and increased SD due to higher volume and fuel costs. Europe Heinz Europe sales increased $456 million, or 14.8%, to $3.53 billion, driven by new product innovation and more focus on the key brands in the portfolio. Volume increased 4.5%, principally due to strong performance of Heinz ketchup across Europe, soup, beans and pasta meals in the U.K., Pudliszki branded products in Poland, and Heinz sauces and condiments in Russia. Volume also benefited from new product introductions across continental Europe, such as Weight Watchers Big Soups in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Net pricing increased sales 3.3%, resulting chiefly from commodity related price increases on Heinz ketchup and soup, the majority of the products in our Russian market and Italian infant nutrition products. Pricing was also favorable due to promotional timing on Heinz beans. Divestitures, net of acquisitions, reduced sales 1.4% and favorable foreign exchange translation rates increased sales by 8.5%. Gross profit increased $135 million, or 10.9%, to $1.37 billion, and the gross profit margin decreased to 38.8% from 40.2%. The 10.9% increase reflects improved pricing and volume and the favorable impact of foreign exchange translation rates, while the decline in gross profit margin is largely due to increased commodity costs and higher manufacturing costs in our U.K., European 20 Table of Contents frozen and Netherlands businesses. Operating income increased $71 million, or 12.4%, to $637 million, due to higher sales and reductions in GA, partially offset by higher commodity costs and increased marketing spending in support of our strong brands across Europe. Asia/Pacific Heinz Asia/Pacific sales increased $281 million, or 21.3%, to $1.60 billion. Volume increased 6.5%, reflecting significant improvements across the majority of the businesses within this segment, particularly Australia, India and China, related primarily to new product introductions supported by a 34.7% increase in marketing. Pricing increased 2.8%, due to increases on soy sauce and beverages in Indonesia, LongFong frozen products in China and nutritional products in India. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased sales 1.6%, and favorable foreign exchange translation rates increased sales by 10.4%. Gross profit increased $101 million, or 23.9%, to $526 million, and the gross profit margin increased to 32.9% from 32.2%. These increases were due to increased volume, pricing, favorable mix and foreign exchange translation rates, which more than offset increased commodity costs. Operating income increased by $45 million, or 29.8%, to $195 million, primarily reflecting the increase in sales and gross margin, partially offset by increased marketing spending and increased SD due to higher volume. U.S. Foodservice Sales of the U.S. Foodservice segment increased $3 million, or 0.2%, to $1.56 billion. Pricing increased sales 1.7%, largely due to commodity related price increases and reduced promotional spending on Heinz ketchup, frozen soup and tomato products, partially offset by declines in frozen desserts. Volume decreased by 1.1%, as higher volume from frozen desserts sold to casual dining customers was more than offset by declines in the portion control business, tomato products and frozen appetizers. The volume reflected softness in the U.S. restaurant business as well as increased competition on our non branded products. Divestitures reduced sales 0.4%. Gross profit decreased $47 million, or 10.0%, to $419 million, and the gross profit margin decreased to 26.8% from 29.9%, as commodity costs disproportionately impacted the foodservice business, despite gains on commodity derivative contracts. The declines also reflect costs incurred in Fiscal 2008 in anticipation of a plant closure in the first quarter of Fiscal 2009, partially offset by increased pricing and productivity. Operating income decreased $47 million, or 21.5%, to $170 million, all of which is due to the decline in gross profit. Rest of World Sales for Rest of World increased $58 million, or 18.7%, to $368 million. Volume increased 6.3% due primarily to increased demand for the Companys products in Latin America as well as strong performance across our Middle East business. Higher pricing increased sales by 13.6%, largely due to price increases and reduced promotions in Latin America as well as commodity related price increases in South Africa. Divestitures reduced growth 1.7% and favorable foreign exchange translation rates increased sales 0.6%. Gross profit increased $22 million, or 19.9%, to $133 million, due mainly to increased pricing, higher volume and improved business mix, partially offset by increased commodity costs. Operating income increased $6 million, or 15.1%, to $45 million. Discontinued Operations In the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006, the Company completed its sale of the European seafood and Tegel poultry businesses. The Company recorded a $3.3 million ($5.9 million after tax) loss from 21 Table of Contents discontinued operations related to these businesses for the year ended May 2, 2007, primarily resulting from purchase price adjustments pursuant to the transaction agreements. Liquidity and Financial Position For Fiscal 2009, cash provided by operating activities was $1.17 billion, a decrease of $21 million from the prior year. This decrease reflects incremental discretionary contributions of approximately $65 million made this year to fund the Companys pension plans, the current year payment of the long term incentive compensation accruals from Fiscal 2008 and unfavorable foreign exchange translation rates. These decreases were partially offset by a $106 million cash inflow from foreign currency forward contracts discussed previously as well as reduced tax payments. The Companys cash conversion cycle increased 7 days, to 56 days in Fiscal 2009, 5 days of which was due to payables and 2 days from receivables. The payables decline was impacted by 3 days for the settlement of hedge contract liabilities that were outstanding in the prior year. Strong inventory reductions in the last four months of the fiscal year resulted in days in inventory remaining flat versus prior year. Recent adverse conditions in the global equity and bond markets caused the actual rate of return on the pension plan assets during Fiscal 2009 to be a loss of approximately 16% versus the Companys assumed long term rate of return of +8.2% as of the end of Fiscal 2008. The impact of this lower rate of return on the funded status was partially offset by higher discount rates in Fiscal 2009 (6.54% in Fiscal 2009 versus 6.1% in Fiscal 2008). As a result of these two factors, the Company made incremental discretionary contributions of approximately $65 million to the plans in Fiscal 2009, thus resulting in total Fiscal 2009 contributions of $134 million which exceeded the original projection. Cash used for investing activities totaled $761 million compared to $554 million last year. In Fiscal 2009, cash paid for acquisitions, net of divestitures, required $281 million, primarily related to the acquisitions of Benedicta, a sauce business in France, Golden Circle Limited, a fruit and juice business in Australia, La Bonne Cuisine, a chilled dip business in New Zealand, and Papillon, a small chilled products business in South Africa. This amount was partially offset by proceeds from the sale of a small portion control foodservice business in the U.S. In Fiscal 2008, cash paid for acquisitions, net of divestitures, required $88 million, primarily related to the acquisition of the license to the Cottees and Roses premium branded jams, jellies and toppings business in Australia and New Zealand, the Wyko sauce business in the Netherlands and the buy out of the minority ownership on the Companys Long Fong business in China, partially offset by the divestiture of a tomato paste business in Portugal. Fiscal 2009 capital expenditures totaled $292 million (2.9% of sales) compared to $302 million (3.0% of sales) in the prior year. In response to recent changes in economic conditions across the globe, the Company is reevaluating all non critical capital projects and will target reduced capital spending as a percentage of sales in Fiscal 2010. Proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment were $5 million compared to $9 million in the prior year. During Fiscal 2008, the Company terminated the cross currency swaps that were previously designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations. The Company paid $93 million of cash in the prior year to the counterparties, which is presented in investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. In addition, the Company paid $74 million in the prior year as a result of cross currency swap contract maturities and such payments were presented within other investing items, net. The current year requirement of $193 million for restricted cash represents collateral that the Company is required to maintain in connection with a total rate of return swap entered into during the third quarter of Fiscal 2009. See Note 13 in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for further information. The early termination of the net investment hedges described above and interest rate swaps described below were completed in conjunction with the reorganizations of the Companys foreign operations and interest rate swap portfolio in Fiscal 2008. 22 Table of Contents Cash used for financing activities totaled $516 million compared to $758 million last year. Proceeds from long term debt were $853 million in the current year. The current year proceeds reflect the sale of $500 million 5.35% Notes due 2013 as well as the sale of $350 million or 3,500 shares of HFC (a subsidiary of Heinz) Series B Preferred Stock. The proceeds from both transactions were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper and other indebtedness incurred to redeem HFCs Series A Preferred Stock. As a result, payments on long term debt were $427 million this year compared to $368 million in the prior year. Fiscal 2008 payments reflect the maturity and payment of the $300 million 6% U.S. Dollar Notes as well as the repurchase of a portion of the 6% U.S. Dollar Notes due March 15, 2012. Net payments on commercial paper and short term debt were $484 million this year compared to net proceeds of $484 million in the prior year. Cash proceeds from option exercises, net of treasury stock purchases, provided $83 million of cash in the current year. Cash used for the purchases of treasury stock, net of proceeds from option exercises, was $502 million in the prior year. Dividend payments totaled $525 million, compared to $485 million in the prior year, reflecting a 9.2% increase in the dividend per share of common stock for Fiscal 2009. During Fiscal 2008, the Company terminated certain interest rate swaps that were previously designated as fair value hedges of fixed rate debt obligations. The notional amount of these contracts totaled $612 million. The Company received $104 million of cash from the termination of these contracts which is presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows within financing activities. The $104 million gain is being amortized to reduce interest expense over the remaining term of the corresponding debt obligations (average remaining life of 21 years). On December 1, 2008, the Company was contractually required to remarket $800 million in dealer securities. At the time of the contractually required remarketing and for the majority of the fourth calendar quarter of 2008, the global capital markets were characterized by extreme volatility and illiquidity. These market conditions resulted in the Company having to reset the coupon on the remarketable securities at higher than anticipated levels. The total coupon of 15.59% represented an 11.5% yield to investors and 4.09% for the cost of the three year remarketing option. The next remarketing is scheduled for December 1, 2011. If the securities are not remarketed, then the Company is required to repurchase all of the securities at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. If the Company purchases or otherwise acquires the securities from the holders, the Company is required to pay to the holder of the remarketing option the option settlement amount. As of December 1, 2008, the date of the most recent remarketing, the fair value of the dealers option to remarket the securities every three years through 2020 was estimated to be approximately $150 million. This value fluctuates based on market conditions. Also on December 1, 2008, the Company entered into a three year total rate of return swap with a notional amount of $175 million. The swap has not been designated as a hedge, but will have the economic impact of reducing a portion of the interest cost related to the remarketable securities. See Note No. 13 in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information. On May 28, 2009, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend on common stock from 41.5 cents to 42.0 cents, an annual indicative rate of $1.68 per share for Fiscal 2010, effective with the July 2009 dividend payment. Fiscal 2010 dividend payments are expected to be approximately $535 million. At April 29, 2009, the Company had total debt of $5.14 billion (including $251 million relating to the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133 hedge accounting adjustments), cash and cash equivalents of $373 million and $193 million of restricted cash. Total debt balances have decreased slightly since prior year, primarily reflecting lower share repurchase activity. Return on average shareholders equity (ROE) is calculated by taking net income divided by average shareholders equity. Average shareholders equity is a five point quarterly average. ROE was 58.2% in Fiscal 2009, 44.0% in Fiscal 2008 and 37.4% in Fiscal 2007. The increase in ROE over the three years is largely due to higher net income and decreased average equity reflecting foreign currency translation adjustments, the adoption of SFAS No. 158 and share repurchases. ROE in 23 Table of Contents Fiscal 2009 was favorably impacted by 3.7% due to the $107 million gain on foreign currency forward contracts discussed earlier. After tax return on invested capital (ROIC) is calculated by taking net income, plus net interest expense net of tax, divided by average invested capital. Average invested capital is a five point quarterly average of debt plus total equity less cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, restricted cash, and the SFAS No. 133 hedge accounting adjustments. ROIC was 18.4% in Fiscal 2009, 16.8% in Fiscal 2008 and 15.8% in Fiscal 2007. The increase in ROIC over the three years is largely due to higher net income and decreased average equity reflecting foreign currency translation adjustments, the adoption of SFAS No. 158, share repurchases and effective management of the asset base. ROIC in Fiscal 2009 was favorably impacted by 1.1% due to the $107 million gain on foreign currency forward contracts discussed earlier. In April 2009, the Company and HFC replaced their existing $2.0 billion credit agreement with $1.8 billion of credit agreements, consisting of a $1.2 billion Three Year Credit Agreement which expires in April 2012 and a $600 million 364 Day Credit Agreement. These agreements support the Companys commercial paper borrowings and $204.3 million of Australian denominated borrowings. As a result, the commercial paper and Australian denominated borrowings are classified as long term debt based upon the Companys intent and ability to refinance these borrowings on a long term basis. In connection with the credit agreements, the Company is required to pay commitment fees of approximately $8 million in Fiscal 2010 which will be reported as interest expense in the consolidated statements of income. The new credit agreements include a leverage ratio covenant in addition to customary covenants that are substantially similar to those in the former credit agreement. The Company was in compliance with all of its covenants as of April 29, 2009. In addition, the Company has $542.5 million of foreign lines of credit available at April 29, 2009. Subsequent to fiscal year end, the Company entered into a three year $175 million accounts receivable securitization program. Global capital and credit markets, including the domestic commercial paper markets, experienced increased volatility late in calendar year 2008. Despite this situation, the Company has continued to have access to the commercial paper market. The Company will continue to monitor the credit markets to determine the appropriate mix of long term debt and short term debt going forward. The Company believes that its strong operating cash flow, existing cash balances, together with the credit facilities and other available capital market financing, will be adequate to meet the Companys cash requirements for operations, including capital spending, debt maturities, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends to shareholders. While the Company is confident that its needs can be financed, there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair its ability to access these markets on commercially acceptable terms. As of April 29, 2009, the Companys long term debt ratings at Moodys, Standard Poors and Fitch Rating have remained consistent at Baa2, BBB and BBB, respectively. Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments Contractual Obligations The Company is obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. In addition, the Company has purchase obligations for materials, supplies, services and property, plant and equipment as part of the ordinary conduct of business. A few of these obligations are long term and are based on minimum purchase requirements. Certain purchase obligations contain variable pricing components, and, as a result, actual cash payments are expected to fluctuate based on changes in these variable components. Due to the proprietary nature of some of the Companys materials and processes, certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions for early terminations. The Company does not believe 24 Table of Contents that a material amount of penalties is reasonably likely to be incurred under these contracts based upon historical experience and current expectations. The following table represents the contractual obligations of the Company as of April 29, 2009. Fiscal Year 2015 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Forward Total (Amounts in thousands) Long Term Debt(1) $ 323,364 $ 2,844,553 $ 1,050,130 $ 2,650,236 $ 6,868,283 Capital Lease Obligations 13,488 62,079 8,938 22,353 106,858 Operating Leases 63,524 100,762 77,984 149,729 391,999 Purchase Obligations 1,358,311 597,115 39,710 22,724 2,017,860 Other Long Term Liabilities Recorded on the Balance Sheet 254,290 543,724 532,815 154,127 1,484,956 Total $ 2,012,977 $ 4,148,233 $ 1,709,577 $ 2,999,169 $ 10,869,956 (1) Amounts include expected cash payments for interest on fixed rate long term debt. Due to the uncertainty of forecasting expected variable rate interest payments, those amounts are not included in the table. Other long term liabilities primarily consist of certain specific incentive compensation arrangements and pension and postretirement benefit commitments. The following long term liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheet are excluded from the table above: income taxes, minority interest and insurance accruals. The Company is unable to estimate the timing of the payments for these items. At April 29, 2009, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions, including an accrual of related interest and penalties along with positions only impacting the timing of tax benefits, was approximately $106 million. The timing of payments will depend on the progress of examinations with tax authorities. The Company does not expect a significant tax payment related to these obligations within the next year. The Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlements with taxing authorities may occur. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other Commitments The Company does not have guarantees or other off balance sheet financing arrangements that we believe are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. In addition, the Company does not have any related party transactions that materially affect the results of operations, cash flow or financial condition. As of April 29, 2009, the Company was party to an operating lease for buildings and equipment in which the Company has guaranteed a supplemental payment obligation of approximately $52 million at the termination of the lease. The Company believes, based on current facts and circumstances, that any payment pursuant to this guarantee is remote. In May 2008, the construction of a new frozen food factory in South Carolina commenced. It is expected that this project will be completed in approximately 3 to 6 months at which time the Company plans to enter into an operating lease. Market Risk Factors The Company is exposed to market risks from adverse changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and production costs. As a policy, the Company does not engage in 25 Table of Contents speculative or leveraged transactions, nor does the Company hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitivity: The Companys cash flow and earnings are subject to fluctuations due to exchange rate variation. Foreign currency risk exists by nature of the Companys global operations. The Company manufactures and sells its products on six continents around the world, and hence foreign currency risk is diversified. The Company may attempt to limit its exposure to changing foreign exchange rates through both operational and financial market actions. These actions may include entering into forward contracts, option contracts, or cross currency swaps to hedge existing exposures, firm commitments and forecasted transactions. The instruments are used to reduce risk by essentially creating offsetting currency exposures. The following table presents information related to foreign currency contracts held by the Company: Aggregate Notional Amount Net Unrealized Gains April 29, 2009 April 30, 2008 April 29, 2009 April 30, 2008 (Dollars in millions) Purpose of Hedge: Intercompany cash flows $ 683 $ 1,110 $ 16 $ 25 Forecasted purchases of raw materials and finished goods and foreign currency denominated obligations 468 541 20 6 Forecasted sales and foreign currency denominated assets 96 57 $ 1,247 $ 1,708 $ 36 $ 31 As of April 29, 2009, the Companys foreign currency contracts mature within 5 years. Contracts that meet qualifying criteria are accounted for as either foreign currency cash flow hedges, fair value hedges or net investment hedges of foreign operations. Any gains and losses related to contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recorded in current period earnings in other income and expense. Substantially all of the Companys foreign business units financial instruments are denominated in their respective functional currencies. Accordingly, exposure to exchange risk on foreign currency financial instruments is not material. (See Note 13, Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities in
