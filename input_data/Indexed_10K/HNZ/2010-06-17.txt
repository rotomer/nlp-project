Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Executive Overview Fiscal 2010 The H.J. Heinz Company has been a pioneer in the food industry for over 140 years and possesses one of the worlds best and most recognizable brands Heinz. The Company has a global portfolio of leading brands focused in three core categories, Ketchup and Sauces, Meals and Snacks, and Infant/Nutrition. In Fiscal 2010, the Company reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.87, compared to $2.91 in the prior year. During Fiscal 2009, key foreign currencies declined precipitously versus the U.S. dollar. Given that over 60% of the Companys sales and the majority of its net income are generated outside of the U.S., foreign currency movements have a significant impact on the Companys financial results. However, in Fiscal 2009, forward contracts were put in place to largely mitigate the unfavorable translation impact on profit associated with movements in key foreign currencies. In the first half of Fiscal 2010, foreign currencies remained unfavorable but began to rebound in the second half of the fiscal year. Overall, currency movements had a $0.29 unfavorable impact on the change in EPS from continuing operations in Fiscal 2010 versus 2009, after taking into account the net effect of current and prior year currency translation contracts, as well as foreign currency movements on translation and transactions involving inventory sourcing in the U.K. EPS from continuing operations for the year reflects 4.8% growth in sales, a 50 basis point improvement in the gross profit margin and a 25.7% increase in marketing investments. Full year sales benefited from combined volume and pricing gains of 2.1%, led by the emerging markets and our top 15 brands, most notably the Heinz, Complan and ABC brands. Emerging markets generated 30% of the Companys reported sales growth and 15% of total Company sales. Also driving the sales growth was increased consumer marketing investments and new product development. Acquisitions and foreign exchange translation rates had a favorable impact on sales. The gross profit margin increased as a result of productivity improvements and higher net pricing, partially offset by higher commodity input costs including the impact of transaction related currency cross rates in the U.K. In Fiscal 2010, the Company incurred $28 million in after tax charges for targeted workforce reductions and non cash asset write offs that were part of a corporate wide initiative to improve productivity, partially offset by an $11 million after tax gain related to a property sale in the Netherlands. The Companys Fiscal 2010 EPS from continuing operations results also reflect reduced net interest expense. Prior year EPS from continuing operations benefited from $107 million in currency gains which had an insignificant impact to the current year. The Company generated record cash flow from operating activities of $1.26 billion, a $95 million increase from the prior year. Management believes these Fiscal 2010 results are indicative of the effectiveness of the Companys business plan, which is focused on the following four strategic pillars: Grow the Core Portfolio Accelerate Growth in Emerging Markets Strengthen and Leverage Global Scale Make Talent an Advantage The recent global recession has dramatically affected consumer confidence, behavior, spending and ultimately food consumption patterns. The Company has adapted its strategies to address the current global economic environment and believes these strategies have enabled Heinz to drive growth, deliver improved performance and sustain momentum. The Company has concentrated on the following: Investing behind core brands, proven ideas and growth through innovation; Focusing investments in marketing and research and development toward delivering value to consumers; 15 Continuing its focus on emerging markets where economic growth remains well above the global average; Increasing margins through productivity initiatives, reductions in discretionary spending and tight management of fixed costs; and Increasing cash flow through reductions in average inventory levels and management of capital spending. The Company remains confident in its underlying business fundamentals and plans to continue to apply these strategies in Fiscal 2011. Movements in foreign currency exchange rates are expected to impact Fiscal 2011 reported results. Discontinued Operations and Other Disposals During the third quarter of Fiscal 2010, the Company completed the sale of its Appetizers And, Inc. frozen hors doeuvres business which was previously reported within the U.S. Foodservice segment, resulting in a $14.5 million pre tax ($10.4 million after tax) loss. Also during the third quarter, the Company completed the sale of its private label frozen desserts business in the U.K., resulting in a $31.4 million pre tax ($23.6 million after tax) loss. During the second quarter of Fiscal 2010, the Company completed the sale of its Kabobs frozen hors doeuvres business which was previously reported within the U.S. Foodservice segment, resulting in a $15.0 million pre tax ($10.9 million after tax) loss. The losses on each of these transactions have been recorded in discontinued operations. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the operating results related to these businesses have been included in discontinued operations in the Companys consolidated statements of income for all periods presented. The following table presents summarized operating results for these discontinued operations: Fiscal Year Ended April 28, April 29, April 30, 2010 FY 2009 FY 2008 FY 2010 2009 2008 (Millions of Dollars) Sales $ 63.0 $ 136.8 $ 185.2 Net after tax losses $ (4.7 ) $ (6.4 ) $ (1.7 ) Tax benefit/(provision) on losses $ 2.0 $ 2.4 $ (0.3 ) On March 31, 2010, the Company received cash proceeds of $95 million from the government of the Netherlands for property the government acquired through eminent domain proceedings. The transaction includes the purchase by the government of the Companys factory located in Nijmegen, which produces soups, pasta and cereals. The cash proceeds are intended to compensate the Company for costs, both capital and expense, the Company will incur over the next three years to exit the current factory location and construct certain new facilities. Note, the Company will likely incur costs to rebuild an RD facility in the Netherlands, costs to transfer a cereal line to another factory location, employee costs for severance and other costs directly related to the closure and relocation of the existing facilities. The Company also entered into a three year leaseback on the Nijmegen factory. The Company will continue to operate in the leased factory over the next three years while commencing to execute its plans for closure and relocation of the operations. The Company has accounted for the proceeds on a cost recovery basis. In doing so, the Company has made its estimates of cost, both of a capital and expense nature, to be incurred and recovered and to which proceeds from the transaction will be applied. Of the proceeds received, $81 million has been deferred based on managements total estimated future costs to be recovered and incurred and has been recorded in other non current liabilities, other accrued liabilities and accumulated depreciation in the Companys consolidated balance sheet as of April 28, 2010. Proceeds of $15 million represent the excess of proceeds received over estimated costs to be recovered and incurred which has been recorded as a 16 reduction of cost of products sold in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended April 28, 2010. In the future, the deferred amounts will be recognized as the related costs are incurred and if estimated costs differ from amounts actually incurred there could be adjustments that will be reflected in earnings. Results of Continuing Operations The Companys revenues are generated via the sale of products in the following categories: Fiscal Year Ended April 28, April 29, April 30, 2010 2009 2008 (52 Weeks) (52 Weeks) (52 Weeks) (Dollars in thousands) Ketchup and sauces $ 4,446,911 $ 4,251,583 $ 4,081,864 Meals and snacks 4,289,977 4,225,127 4,336,475 Infant/Nutrition 1,157,982 1,105,313 1,089,544 Other 600,113 429,308 377,673 Total $ 10,494,983 $ 10,011,331 $ 9,885,556 Fiscal Year Ended April 28, 2010 compared to Fiscal Year Ended April 29, 2009 Sales for Fiscal 2010 increased $484 million, or 4.8%, to $10.49 billion. Net pricing increased sales by 3.4%, largely due to the carryover impact of broad based price increases taken in Fiscal 2009 to help offset increased commodity costs. Volume decreased 1.3%, as favorable volume in emerging markets was more than offset by declines in the U.S. and Australian businesses. Volume was impacted by aggressive competitor promotional activity and softness in some of the Companys product categories, as well as reduced foot traffic in U.S. restaurants this year. Emerging markets continued to be an important growth driver, with combined volume and pricing gains of 15.3%. In addition, the Companys top 15 brands performed well, with combined volume and pricing gains of 3.4%, led by the Heinz, Complan and ABC brands. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased sales by 2.2%. Foreign exchange translation rates increased sales by 0.5% compared to the prior year. Gross profit increased $225 million, or 6.3%, to $3.79 billion, and the gross profit margin increased to 36.2% from 35.7%. The improvement in gross margin reflects higher net pricing and productivity improvements, partially offset by higher commodity costs including transaction currency costs. Acquisitions had a favorable impact on gross profit dollars but reduced overall gross profit margin. In addition, gross profit was unfavorably impacted by lower volume and $24 million of charges for a corporation wide initiative to improve productivity, partially offset by a $15 million gain related to property sold in the Netherlands as discussed previously. Selling, general and administrative expenses (SGA) increased $168 million, or 8.1%, to $2.24 billion, and increased as a percentage of sales to 21.3% from 20.6%. The increase reflects the impact from additional marketing investments, acquisitions, inflation in Latin America, and higher pension and incentive compensation expenses. In addition, SGA was impacted by $14 million related to targeted workforce reductions in the current year and a gain in the prior year on the sale of a small portion control business in the U.S. These increases were partially offset by improvements in selling and distribution expenses (SD), reflecting productivity improvements and lower fuel costs. Operating income increased $57 million, or 3.8%, to $1.56 billion, reflecting the items above. Net interest expense decreased $25 million, to $251 million, reflecting a $44 million decrease in interest expense and a $19 million decrease in interest income. The decreases in interest income and interest expense are primarily due to lower average interest rates. Other expenses, net, increased $111 million primarily due to a $105 million decrease in currency gains, and $9 million of charges recognized in connection with the August 2009 dealer remarketable 17 securities (DRS) exchange transaction (see below in Liquidity and Financial Position for further explanation of this transaction). The decrease in currency gains reflects prior year gains of $107 million related to forward contracts that were put in place to help mitigate the unfavorable impact of translation associated with key foreign currencies for Fiscal 2009. The effective tax rate for Fiscal 2010 was 27.8% compared to 28.4% for the prior year. The current year effective tax rate was lower than the prior year primarily due to tax efficient financing of the Companys operations, partially offset by higher taxes on repatriation of earnings. Income from continuing operations attributable to H. J. Heinz Company was $914 million compared to $930 million in the prior year, a decrease of 1.6%. The decrease reflects the prior year currency gains discussed above, which were $66 million after tax ($0.21 per share), and $28 million in after tax charges ($0.09 per share) in Fiscal 2010 for targeted workforce reductions and non cash asset write offs, partially offset by higher operating income, reduced net interest expense, a lower effective tax rate and an $11 million after tax gain related to property sold in the Netherlands. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $2.87 in Fiscal 2010 compared to $2.91 in the prior year, down 1.4%. EPS movements were unfavorably impacted by $0.29, or $90 million of net income, from currency fluctuations, after taking into account the net effect of current and prior year currency translation contracts, as well as foreign currency movements on translation and U.K. transaction costs. The impact of fluctuating translation exchange rates in Fiscal 2010 has had a relatively consistent impact on all components of operating income on the consolidated statement of income. The impact of cross currency sourcing of inventory reduced gross profit and operating income but did not affect sales. FISCAL YEAR 2010 OPERATING RESULTS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT North American Consumer Products Sales of the North American Consumer Products segment increased $56 million, or 1.8%, to $3.19 billion. Net prices grew 1.9% reflecting the carryover impact of price increases taken across the majority of the product portfolio throughout Fiscal 2009, partially offset by increased promotional spending in the current year, particularly on Smart Ones frozen entrees and Heinz ketchup. Volume decreased 1.5%, reflecting declines in frozen meals and desserts due to category softness, competitor promotional activity and the impact of price increases. Volume declines were also noted in Ore Ida frozen potatoes, Classico pasta sauces and frozen snacks. These volume declines were partially offset by increases in TGI Fridays Skillet Meals due to new product introductions and increased trade promotions and marketing as well as growth in Heinz ketchup. The acquisition of Arthurs Fresh Company, a small chilled smoothies business in Canada, at the beginning of the third quarter of this year increased sales 0.2%. Favorable Canadian exchange translation rates increased sales 1.3%. Gross profit increased $80 million, or 6.3%, to $1.34 billion, and the gross profit margin increased to 41.9% from 40.1%. The higher gross margin reflects productivity improvements and the carryover impact of price increases, partially offset by increased commodity costs. The favorable impact of foreign exchange on gross profit was more than offset by unfavorable volume. Operating income increased $47 million, or 6.4%, to $771 million, reflecting the improvement in gross profit and reduced SD, partially offset by increased marketing investment, pension costs and incentive compensation expense. The improvement in SD was a result of productivity projects, tight cost control and lower fuel costs. 18 Europe Heinz Europe sales increased $4 million, or 0.1%, to $3.33 billion. Unfavorable foreign exchange translation rates decreased sales by 1.9%. Net pricing increased 2.4%, driven by the carryover impact of price increases taken in Fiscal 2009, partially offset by increased promotions, particularly in the U.K. and Continental Europe. Volume decreased 0.9%, principally due to decreases in France from the rationalization of low margin sauces, and increased competitor promotional activity on frozen products in the U.K. Volume for infant nutrition products in the U.K. and Italy also declined, along with decreases in Heinz pasta meals as a result of reduced promotional activities. Lower volume in Italy reflects the overall category decline in that country. Volume improvements were posted on soups in the U.K. and Germany as well as Heinz ketchup across Europe, particularly in Russia where both ketchup, sauces and infant feeding products are growing at double digit rates. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased sales 0.5%, largely due to the acquisition of the Bndicta sauce business in France in the second quarter of Fiscal 2009. Gross profit decreased $9 million, or 0.7%, to $1.25 billion, and the gross profit margin decreased to 37.4% from 37.7%. The decline in gross profit is largely due to unfavorable foreign exchange translation rates and increased commodity costs, including the cross currency rate movements in the British pound versus the euro and U.S. dollar. These declines were partially mitigated by higher pricing and productivity improvements. Operating income decreased $17 million, or 2.9%, to $554 million, due to unfavorable foreign currency translation and transaction impacts, as well as increased marketing and higher incentive compensation expense, partially offset by reduced SD. Asia/Pacific Heinz Asia/Pacific sales increased $380 million, or 23.3%, to $2.01 billion. Acquisitions increased sales 12.6% due to the prior year acquisitions of Golden Circle Limited, a health oriented fruit and juice business in Australia, and La Bonne Cuisine, a chilled dip business in New Zealand. Pricing increased 2.0%, reflecting current and prior year increases on ABC products in Indonesia as well as the carryover impact of prior year price increases and reduced promotions in New Zealand. These increases were partially offset by reduced net pricing on Long Fong frozen products in China due to increased promotional spending. Volume increased 1.0%, as significant growth in Complan and Glucon D nutritional beverages in India and ABC products in Indonesia was more than offset by general softness in both Australia and New Zealand, which have been impacted by competitive activity and reduced market demand associated with higher prices. Favorable exchange translation rates increased sales by 7.8%. Gross profit increased $83 million, or 15.6%, to $612 million, and the gross profit margin declined to 30.5% from 32.5%. The $83 million increase in gross profit was due to higher volume and pricing, productivity improvements and favorable foreign exchange translation rates. These increases were partially offset by increased commodity costs, which include the impact of cross currency rates on inventory costs. Acquisitions had a favorable impact on gross profit dollars but reduced overall gross profit margin. Operating income increased by $13 million, or 7.0%, to $195 million, as the increase in gross profit was partially offset by increased SGA related to acquisitions, the impact of foreign exchange translation rates and increased marketing investments. U.S. Foodservice Sales of the U.S. Foodservice segment decreased $21 million, or 1.5%, to $1.43 billion. Pricing increased sales 4.4%, largely due to prior year price increases taken across the portfolio. Volume decreased by 5.5%, due to industry wide declines in U.S. restaurant traffic and sales, targeted SKU reductions, the unfavorable impact from price increases and increased competitive activity. Prior year divestitures reduced sales 0.4%. Gross profit increased $49 million, or 13.8%, to $402 million, and the gross profit margin increased to 28.1% from 24.3%, as cumulative price increases helped return margins for this business 19 closer to their historical levels. In the current year, gross profit benefited from pricing and productivity improvements as well as commodity cost favorability which more than offset unfavorable volume. Operating income increased $21 million, or 16.4%, to $151 million, which is primarily due to gross profit improvements and reduced SD reflecting productivity projects, tight cost control and lower fuel costs. These improvements were partially offset by increased marketing expense and higher general and administrative expenses (GA) resulting from increased pension and incentive compensation costs and a prior year gain on the sale of a small, non core portion control business. Rest of World Sales for Rest of World increased $65 million, or 14.0%, to $533 million. Higher pricing increased sales by 23.1%, largely due to current and prior year price increases in Latin America taken to mitigate the impact of raw material and labor inflation. Volume increased 2.3% reflecting increases in Latin America and the Middle East. Acquisitions increased sales 0.8% due to the prior year acquisition of Papillon, a small chilled products business in South Africa. Foreign exchange translation rates decreased sales 12.2%, largely due to the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar fuerte (VEF) late in the third quarter of this fiscal year (See the Venezuela Foreign Currency and Inflation section below for further explanation). Gross profit increased $37 million, or 23.1%, to $199 million, due mainly to increased pricing, partially offset by increased commodity costs and the impact of the VEF devaluation. Operating income increased $17 million, or 32.2% to $69 million, as the increase in gross profit was partially offset by increased marketing and higher SD and GA expenses reflecting growth related investments and inflation in Latin America. Fiscal Year Ended April 29, 2009 compared to Fiscal Year Ended April 30, 2008 Sales for Fiscal 2009 increased $126 million, or 1.3%, to $10.01 billion. Net pricing increased sales by 7.1%, as price increases were taken across the Companys portfolio to help compensate for increases in commodity costs. Volume decreased 1.1%, as a net volume improvement in emerging markets was more than offset by declines in the U.S., Australian and New Zealand businesses, which were impacted by the recessionary economic environment. Volume also declined on frozen products in the U.K. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased sales by 1.9%. Foreign exchange translation rates reduced sales by 6.6%, reflecting the impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar on sales generated in international markets. Sales of the Companys top 15 brands grew 2.1% from Fiscal 2008, as combined volume and pricing gains exceeded the 6.3% unfavorable impact of foreign exchange translation rates on sales. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, the top 15 brands grew by 8.4%, led by strong growth in Heinz, Ore Ida, Classico, Pudliszki and ABC branded products. In addition, global ketchup sales increased 3.2% despite a 5.9% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, resulting in a 9.1% increase excluding the impact of currency translation. Emerging markets continued to be an important growth driver, with sales up 8.8%. Excluding a 7% impact from unfavorable foreign exchange, emerging markets sales grew 15.8%. Gross profit decreased $83 million, or 2.3%, to $3.57 billion, as higher net pricing and the favorable impact of acquisitions was more than offset by a $238 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange translation rates as well as higher commodity costs, including transaction currency costs in the U.K., and lower volume. The gross profit margin decreased to 35.7% from 36.9%, as pricing and productivity improvements were more than offset by increased commodity costs, which includes the impact of cross currency sourcing of ingredients, most notably in the U.K. SGA decreased $15 million, or 0.7%, to $2.07 billion, and improved as a percentage of sales to 20.6% from 21.1%. The $15 million decrease in SGA is due to a $115 million impact from foreign exchange translation rates, decreased marketing expense, a life insurance settlement benefit received in the Fiscal 2009 and a gain on the sale of a small portion control business in the U.S. These 20 decreases were partially offset by increased spending on global task force initiatives, including system capability improvements, the SGA from acquisitions and inflation in Latin America. Operating income decreased $68 million, or 4.3%, to $1.5 billion, reflecting the items above, particularly a $123 million (7.8%) unfavorable impact from foreign exchange translation rates, and higher commodity costs. Net interest expense decreased $48 million, to $275 million, reflecting a $25 million decrease in interest expense and a $23 million increase in interest income. Interest expense benefited from lower average interest rates in Fiscal 2009, which more than offset a higher coupon on the DRS which were remarketed on December 1, 2008. The improvement in interest income is due to a $20 million mark to market gain in Fiscal 2009 on a total rate of return swap which was entered into in conjunction with the Companys DRS on December 1, 2008. Other income/(expense), net, improved by $109 million, to $93 million of income compared to ($16) million of expense in Fiscal 2008, as a $113 million increase in currency gains was partially offset by an insignificant gain recognized on the sale of our business in Zimbabwe in Fiscal 2008. The currency gains resulted primarily from forward contracts that were put in place to help mitigate the unfavorable translation impact on profit associated with movements in key foreign currencies for Fiscal 2009. The effective tax rate for Fiscal 2009 was 28.4% compared to 30.3% for Fiscal 2008. The Fiscal 2009 tax rate was lower than Fiscal 2008 primarily due to reduced repatriation costs partially offset by decreased benefits from the revaluation of tax basis of foreign assets. Income from continuing operations attributable to H. J. Heinz Company was $930 million compared to $847 million in Fiscal 2008, an increase of 9.8%, due to increased currency gains, reduced net interest expense and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by lower operating income reflecting unfavorable foreign currency movements. Diluted earnings per share was $2.91 in the Fiscal 2009, an increase of 11.1%, compared to $2.62 in the Fiscal 2008. Earnings per share also benefited from a 1.1% reduction in fully diluted shares outstanding. The translation impact of fluctuating exchange rates in Fiscal 2009 has had a relatively consistent impact on all components of operating income on the consolidated statement of income. The impact of cross currency sourcing of ingredients, most notably in the U.K., reduced gross profit and operating income but did not affect sales. FISCAL YEAR 2009 OPERATING RESULTS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT North American Consumer Products Sales of the North American Consumer Products segment increased $124 million, or 4.1%, to $3.14 billion. Net prices grew 6.8% reflecting price increases taken across the majority of the product portfolio during Fiscal 2009 to help offset higher commodity costs. Volume decreased 0.4%, as increases in Ore Ida frozen potatoes, Heinz ketchup and new TGI Fridays Skillet Meals were more than offset by declines in Delimex frozen products and Smart Ones frozen meals and desserts. The Ore Ida growth was driven by new products such as Steam n Mashtm in addition to the timing of price increases. The Heinz ketchup improvement was largely due to increased consumption. The Smart Ones volume decline resulted from softness in the category, aggressive competitive promotions and the timing of price increases taken in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2008, partially offset by new breakfast product offerings in Fiscal 2009. Lower sales of Delimex frozen meals and snacks was due to a supply interruption in the first half of Fiscal 2009. Unfavorable Canadian exchange translation rates decreased sales 2.3%. Gross profit increased $38 million, or 3.1%, to $1.26 billion, due primarily to increased pricing partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange translation rates. The gross profit margin decreased 21 to 40.1% from 40.5%, as increased pricing and productivity improvements only partially offset increased commodity costs. Operating income increased $46 million, or 6.8%, to $725 million, largely reflecting the increase in gross profit and decreased marketing expense. Europe Heinz Europe sales decreased $89 million, or 2.6%, to $3.33 billion. Net pricing increased 7.1%, driven by Heinz ketchup, beans and soup, broad based increases in our Russian market, frozen products in the U.K. and Italian infant nutrition products. Volume decreased 0.5%, primarily due to declines on frozen products as a result of competitor promotions and the exit of lower margin products and customers. Volume was also unfavorably impacted by decreases in Heinz soup and pasta meals in the U.K, and reduced volume in Russia. These declines were partially offset by new product introductions in the U.K. and Continental Europe. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased sales 2.6%, primarily due to the acquisition of the Bndicta sauce business in France during the second quarter of Fiscal 2009 and the Wyko sauce business in the Netherlands at the end of Fiscal 2008. Unfavorable foreign exchange translation rates decreased sales by 11.8%. Gross profit decreased $110 million, or 8.0%, to $1.26 billion, and the gross profit margin decreased to 37.7% from 40.0% as unfavorable foreign exchange translation rates, cross currency rate movements in the British Pound versus the Euro and U.S. dollar, increased commodity costs and higher manufacturing costs in the frozen food plants were only partially offset by improved pricing and the favorable impact from acquisitions. Operating income decreased $75 million, or 11.6%, to $571 million, as pricing gains were more than offset by unfavorable translation, increased commodity costs, a portion of which was due to the transaction foreign currency impacts discussed above, increased SD, a portion of which was from acquisitions, and higher GA reflecting investments in task forces and systems. Asia/Pacific Heinz Asia/Pacific sales increased $28 million, or 1.7%, to $1.63 billion. Pricing increased 6.1%, due to increases on sardines, sauces and syrup in Indonesia, nutritional beverages in India and pricing gains across the product portfolios in Australia and New Zealand. This pricing partially offset increased commodity costs. Volume decreased 1.4%, as significant improvements on nutritional beverage sales in India, frozen foods in Japan and ABC products in Indonesia were more than offset by declines in convenience meals in Australia and New Zealand and Long Fong frozen products in China. Acquisitions increased sales 6.8% due to the third quarter Fiscal 2009 acquisitions of Golden Circle Limited and La Bonne Cuisine. Unfavorable foreign exchange translation rates decreased sales by 9.8%. Gross profit increased $3 million, or 0.6%, to $530 million, while the gross profit margin declined to 32.5% from 32.9%. The $3 million improvement in gross profit was due to increased pricing and acquisitions, which offset increased commodity costs, unfavorable foreign exchange translation rates and reduced volume, particularly in our Long Fong business as we revised our distribution system and streamlined our product offerings. Operating income decreased by $12 million, or 6.4%, to $182 million, as the increase in gross profit and decreased marketing expense was more than offset by increased SD and GA, a portion of which was due to acquisitions. U.S. Foodservice Sales of the U.S. Foodservice segment decreased $37 million, or 2.5%, to $1.45 billion. Pricing increased sales 3.7%, largely due to increases on Heinz ketchup, portion control condiments, frozen soups and tomato products. Volume decreased by 5.3%, reflecting reduced restaurant foot traffic, the exit of numerous lower margin products and customers, as well as increased competition on our non branded products. Divestitures reduced sales 0.9%. 22 Gross profit decreased $44 million, or 11.1%, to $353 million, and the gross profit margin decreased to 24.3% from 26.7%, due to lower volume, higher commodity and manufacturing costs and Fiscal 2008 gains on commodity derivative contracts, partially offset by higher pricing. Operating income decreased $34 million, or 20.7%, to $129 million, which was primarily due to the decline in gross profit, partially offset by reduced GA reflecting a gain in Fiscal 2009 on the sale of a small, non core portion control business. Rest of World Sales for Rest of World increased $100 million, or 27.3%, to $468 million. Volume increased 4.6% driven by increases in Latin America and the Middle East. Higher pricing increased sales by 27.6%, largely due to inflation in Latin America and commodity related price increases in South Africa and the Middle East. Acquisitions increased sales 0.2% due to the fourth quarter Fiscal 2009 acquisition of Papillon, a small chilled products business in South Africa. Foreign exchange translation rates decreased sales 5.2%. Gross profit increased $28 million, or 21.4%, to $161 million, due mainly to increased pricing and higher volume, partially offset by increased commodity costs and unfavorable foreign currency movements. Operating income increased $7 million, or 15.2% to $52 million due to the increase in gross profit partially offset by wage inflation in Latin America. Liquidity and Financial Position For Fiscal 2010, cash provided by operating activities was a record $1.26 billion compared to $1.17 billion in the prior year. The improvement in Fiscal 2010 versus Fiscal 2009 was generated despite significant contributions to our pension plans, and was primarily due to favorable movements in working capital and reduced tax payments. Additionally, $84 million of cash was received in the current year in connection with an accounts receivable securitization program (see additional explanations below), and the Company also received $48 million of cash from the termination of a total rate of return swap. In the prior year, the Company received $106 million of cash from the settlement and maturity of foreign currency contracts that were put in place to help mitigate the impact of translation associated with key foreign currencies (see Note 12, Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities in
