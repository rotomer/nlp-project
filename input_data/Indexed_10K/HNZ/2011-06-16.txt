Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Executive Overview Fiscal 2011 The H.J. Heinz Company has been a pioneer in the food industry for over 140 years and possesses one of the worlds best and most recognizable brands Heinz. The Company has a global portfolio of leading brands focused in three core categories, Ketchup and Sauces, Meals and Snacks, and Infant/Nutrition. In Fiscal 2011, the Company reported record diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $3.06, compared to $2.87 in the prior year, an increase of 6.6%, overcoming a $0.06 per share unfavorable impact from currency translation and translation hedges and a $0.02 per share unfavorable impact for acquisition costs from our recent acquisition in Brazil. Given that almost two thirds of the Companys sales and net income are generated outside of the U.S., foreign currency movements can have a significant impact on the Companys financial results. The Company generated record sales of $10.7 billion in Fiscal 2011, a 2.0% increase versus prior year. Full year sales benefited from combined volume and pricing gains of 1.9% reflecting effective consumer marketing investments and new product development. Foreign exchange unfavorably impacted sales by 0.5% while acquisitions increased sales 0.6%. In Fiscal 2011, the Company continued to execute its strategy to grow in emerging economies by completing two important acquisitions in these markets. On November 2, 2010, the Company acquired Foodstar Holding Pte (Foodstar), a manufacturer of soy sauces and fermented bean curd in China and on April 1, 2011, the Company acquired an 80% stake in Coniexpress S.A. Industrias Alimenticias (Coniexpress), a leading Brazilian manufacturer of the Quero brand of tomato based sauces, tomato paste, ketchup, condiments and vegetables. The Coniexpress acquisition will accelerate the Companys growth in Latin America and gives the Company its first major business in Brazil, the worlds fifth most populous nation. Overall, emerging markets continued to be an important growth driver in Fiscal 2011, with combined volume and pricing gains of 14.4% and representing 16.2% of total Company sales for the year. Our top 15 brands also performed well, with combined volume and pricing gains of 3.8% driven primarily by the Heinz, Complan, ABC, Smart Ones and Ore Ida brands. EPS from continuing operations for Fiscal 2011 also reflects a 70 basis point improvement in the gross profit margin. The increased gross profit margin reflected productivity improvements and higher net pricing, partially offset by higher commodity input costs. The improvement in gross margin was partially offset by investments in global process and system upgrades in Fiscal 2011. Operating income increased 5.7% in Fiscal 2011, despite the unfavorable impact of foreign currency, transaction costs related to the Coniexpress acquisition in Brazil and the investment in global systems capabilities. The Company reported record net income in Fiscal 2011 of $990 million compared to $914 million from continuing operations in Fiscal 2010. In Fiscal 2010, the Company incurred $28 million in after tax charges for targeted workforce reductions and non cash asset write offs that were part of a corporate wide initiative to improve productivity. These prior year charges were partially offset by after tax gains in the prior year of $11 million related to a property sale in the Netherlands and $15 million on a total rate of return swap. In Fiscal 2011, the Company generated record cash flow from operating activities of $1.58 billion, a $321 million increase from the prior year. Management believes these Fiscal 2011 results are indicative of the effectiveness of the Companys business plan, which is focused on the following four strategic pillars: Accelerate Growth in Emerging Markets Expand the Core Portfolio Strengthen and Leverage Global Scale Make Talent an Advantage 14 In order to continue to drive sustainable growth, the Company will invest in new productivity initiatives in Fiscal 2012 that are expected to make the Company stronger and even more competitive. The Company anticipates investing approximately $130 million in cash and $160 million of pre tax income ($0.35 cents per share) on initiatives that will increase manufacturing efficiency and accelerate productivity on a global scale. To enhance our manufacturing effectiveness and efficiency, we plan to exit five of our 81 factories, including two in Europe, two in the U.S. and one in the Pacific. We will also establish a European supply chain hub in the Netherlands in order to consolidate and centrally lead procurement, manufacturing, logistics and inventory control. We also intend to streamline our global workforce by approximately 800 to 1,000 positions. Certain projects included in the plan are subject to consultation and any necessary agreements being reached with appropriate employee representative bodies, trade unions and work councils as required by law. Separately during Fiscal 2012, we are also accelerating our investment in Project Keystone, which is a multi year program designed to drive productivity and make Heinz much more competitive by adding capabilities, harmonizing global processes and standardizing our systems through SAP. We expect an incremental cost of $40 million, or $0.08 cents per share, for Project Keystone during Fiscal 2012. The Company remains confident in its underlying business fundamentals and plans to continue to focus on our four strategic pillars in Fiscal 2012. We are expecting an unfavorable impact in the coming year from commodity cost inflation which we plan to offset with pricing and productivity initiatives. Discontinued Operations and Other Disposals During the third quarter of Fiscal 2010, the Company completed the sale of its Appetizers And, Inc. frozen hors doeuvres business which was previously reported within the U.S. Foodservice segment, resulting in a $14.5 million pre tax ($10.4 million after tax) loss. Also during the third quarter of Fiscal 2010, the Company completed the sale of its private label frozen desserts business in the U.K., resulting in a $31.4 million pre tax ($23.6 million after tax) loss. During the second quarter of Fiscal 2010, the Company completed the sale of its Kabobs frozen hors doeuvres business which was previously reported within the U.S. Foodservice segment, resulting in a $15.0 million pre tax ($10.9 million after tax) loss. The losses on each of these transactions have been recorded in discontinued operations. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the operating results related to these businesses have been included in discontinued operations in the Companys consolidated statements of income for Fiscal 2010 and 2009. The following table presents summarized operating results for these discontinued operations: Fiscal Year Ended April 28, April 29, 2010 2009 FY 2010 FY 2009 (Millions of Dollars) Sales $ 63.0 $ 136.8 Net after tax losses $ (4.7 ) $ (6.4 ) Tax benefit on losses $ 2.0 $ 2.4 During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010, the Company received cash proceeds of $95 million from the government of the Netherlands for property the government acquired through eminent domain proceedings. The transaction includes the purchase by the government of the Companys factory located in Nijmegen, which produces soups, pasta and cereals. The cash proceeds are intended to compensate the Company for costs, both capital and expense, the Company will incur three years from the date of the transaction, which is the length of time the Company has to exit the current 15 factory location and construct new facilities. Note, the Company will likely incur costs to rebuild an RD facility in the Netherlands, costs to transfer a cereal line to another factory location, employee costs for severance and other costs directly related to the closure and relocation of the existing facilities. The Company also entered into a three year leaseback on the Nijmegen factory. The Company will continue to operate in the leased factory while commencing to execute its plans for closure and relocation of the operations. The Company has accounted for the proceeds on a cost recovery basis. In doing so, the Company has made its estimates of cost, both of a capital and expense nature, to be incurred and recovered and to which proceeds from the transaction will be applied. Of the proceeds received, $81 million was deferred based on managements total estimated future costs to be recovered and incurred and recorded in other non current liabilities, other accrued liabilities and accumulated depreciation in the Companys consolidated balance sheet as of April 28, 2010. These deferred amounts are recognized as the related costs are incurred. If estimated costs differ from what is actually incurred, these adjustments are reflected in earnings. As of April 27, 2011, the remaining deferred amount on the consolidated balance sheet was $63 million and was recorded in other non current liabilities, other accrued liabilities and accumulated depreciation. No significant adjustments were reflected in earnings in Fiscal 2011. The excess of the $95 million of proceeds received over estimated costs to be recovered and incurred was $15 million which has been recorded as a reduction of cost of products sold in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended April 28, 2010. Results of Continuing Operations The Companys revenues are generated via the sale of products in the following categories: Fiscal Year Ended April 27, April 28, April 29, 2011 2010 2009 (52 Weeks) (52 Weeks) (52 Weeks) (Dollars in thousands) Ketchup and sauces $ 4,607,971 $ 4,446,911 $ 4,251,583 Meals and snacks 4,282,318 4,289,977 4,225,127 Infant/Nutrition 1,175,438 1,157,982 1,105,313 Other 640,861 600,113 429,308 Total $ 10,706,588 $ 10,494,983 $ 10,011,331 Fiscal Year Ended April 27, 2011 compared to Fiscal Year Ended April 28, 2010 Sales for Fiscal 2011 increased $212 million, or 2.0%, to $10.71 billion. Volume increased 0.7%, as favorable volume in emerging markets as well as improvements in North American Consumer Products were partially offset by declines in U.S. Foodservice, Australia and Germany. Emerging markets and our Top 15 brands continued to be important growth drivers, with combined volume and pricing gains of 14.4% in emerging markets and 3.8% in our Top 15 brands. Net pricing increased sales by 1.2%, as price increases in emerging markets, particularly Latin America, U.S. Foodservice and the U.K. were partially offset by increased trade promotions in the North American Consumer Products and Australian businesses. Acquisitions increased sales by 0.6%, while foreign exchange translation rates reduced sales by 0.5%. Gross profit increased $158 million, or 4.2%, to $3.95 billion, and the gross profit margin increased to 36.9% from 36.2%. Gross profit increased as higher volume, net pricing, productivity improvements and the favorable impact from the Foodstar acquisition were partially offset by a $33 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange translation rates as well as higher commodity costs. In addition, last years gross profit included $24 million in charges for a corporation wide initiative to improve productivity, partially offset by a $15 million gain related to property sold in the Netherlands as discussed previously. 16 Selling, general and administrative expenses (SGA) increased $69 million, or 3.1% to $2.30 billion, and increased slightly as a percentage of sales to 21.5% from 21.3%. SGA was unfavorably impacted by higher selling and distribution expenses (SD), largely resulting from the higher volume and fuel costs, and higher general and administrative expenses (GA), reflecting investments in global process and system upgrades, increased capabilities in emerging markets and acquisition costs related to the Coniexpress acquisition. These increases were partially offset by reduced marketing expense, a $17 million favorable impact from foreign exchange translation rates and a $14 million impact related to prior year targeted workforce reductions. Operating income increased $89 million, or 5.7%, to $1.65 billion, reflecting the items above. Net interest expense increased $2 million, to $253 million, reflecting a $23 million decrease in interest income and a $20 million decrease in interest expense. The decrease in interest income is mainly due to a $24 million gain in the prior year on a total rate of return swap, which was terminated in August 2009. Interest expense decreased due to lower average interest rates and debt balances. Other expenses, net, increased $3.0 million, to $21 million, primarily due to currency losses partially offset by $9 million of charges in the prior year recognized in connection with the dealer remarketable securities exchange transaction (see below in Liquidity and Financial Position for further explanation of this transaction). The effective tax rate for Fiscal 2011 was 26.8% compared to 27.8% for the prior year. The current year effective tax rate was lower than the prior year primarily due to increased benefits from foreign tax planning and increased tax exempt foreign income, partially offset by higher taxes on repatriation of earnings. Income from continuing operations attributable to H. J. Heinz Company was $990 million compared to $914 million in the prior year, an increase of 8.2%. The increase was due to higher operating income, reduced interest expense, a lower tax rate and $28 million in prior year after tax charges ($0.09 per share) for targeted workforce reductions and non cash asset write offs. These were partially offset by an $11 million after tax gain in the prior year related to property sold in the Netherlands and a $15 million after tax gain in the prior year on a total rate of return swap. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $3.06 in the current year compared to $2.87 in the prior year, up 6.6%. EPS movements were unfavorably impacted by 1.5% higher shares outstanding and by $0.06 from currency fluctuations, after taking into account the net effect of current and prior year currency translation contracts and foreign currency movements on translation. The impact of fluctuating translation exchange rates in Fiscal 2011 has had a relatively consistent impact on all components of operating income on the consolidated statement of income. FISCAL YEAR 2011 OPERATING RESULTS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT North American Consumer Products Sales of the North American Consumer Products segment increased $74 million, or 2.3%, to $3.27 billion. Volume increased 2.0% as new products and increased trade promotions drove improvements in Heinz ketchup and gravy, Smart Ones frozen entrees, Classico pasta sauces, Ore Ida frozen potatoes and TGI Fridays frozen meals and appetizers. These increases were partially offset by declines in Boston Market frozen products as we transition away from the Boston Market license which should be completed in the first quarter of Fiscal 2012. In addition, volume is up across most product categories in Canada. Net prices decreased 1.1% reflecting trade promotion increases in Canada, the Consumer Value Program launched in the U.S. in the second half of the prior year and trade spending in the current year to support the launch of TGI Fridays single serve frozen products. The acquisition of Arthurs Fresh Company, a small chilled smoothies business in Canada, in the third quarter of Fiscal 2010, increased sales 0.2%. Favorable Canadian exchange translation rates increased sales 1.1%. 17 Gross profit increased $38 million, or 2.8%, to $1.38 billion, and the gross profit margin increased to 42.1% from 41.9%. The increase in gross profit dollars was aided by favorable volume and foreign exchange translation rates. The gross profit margin improved as productivity improvements more than offset the shift in marketing funds to trade promotion investments and increased commodity costs. SGA decreased as a result of the shift of marketing funds to trade promotions. Operating income increased $61 million, or 7.9%, to $833 million, reflecting higher volume, gross margin improvements and tight control of SGA. Europe Heinz Europe sales decreased $96 million, or 2.9%, to $3.24 billion. The decrease was due to unfavorable foreign exchange translation rates, which decreased sales by 3.5%, or $117 million. Volume decreased 0.4%, as increases in Weight Watchers and Aunt Bessies frozen products in the U.K, improvements in ketchup, particularly in Russia and France, and increases in drinks in The Netherlands, were more than offset by declines in soups in the U.K. and Germany, Honig branded products in The Netherlands, and infant nutrition across Europe. Net pricing increased 1.0%, due to reduced promotions on Heinz soup in the U.K. and increased net pricing in our Russian and Italian infant nutrition businesses. Gross profit increased $19 million, or 1.5%, to $1.27 billion, and the gross profit margin increased to 39.1% from 37.4%. These increases resulted from productivity improvements and higher net pricing partially offset by increased commodity costs and unfavorable foreign exchange translation rates. Gross profit also benefited from a gain in the current year on the sale of distribution rights on Amoy products in certain ethnic channels in the U.K. Operating income increased $27 million, or 4.8%, to $581 million, reflecting the items above as well as reduced SGA. The decline in SGA was largely related to foreign exchange translation rates, partially offset by increased marketing and investments in global process and system upgrades. Asia/Pacific Heinz Asia/Pacific sales increased $314 million, or 15.6%, to $2.32 billion. Volume increased 4.8%, due to significant growth in Complan and Glucon D nutritional beverages in India, ABC products in Indonesia and infant feeding and frozen products in China and Japan. These increases were partially offset by softness in Australia, which has been impacted by a difficult trade environment and generally weak category trends. Pricing rose 0.2%, reflecting increases on ABC products in Indonesia and Complan and Glucon D products in India offset by higher promotions in Australia. The acquisition of Foodstar during the third quarter of Fiscal 2011 increased sales 2.9%. Favorable exchange translation rates increased sales by 7.7%. Gross profit increased $103 million, or 16.8%, to $715 million, and the gross profit margin increased to 30.8% from 30.5%. These increases reflect higher volume and pricing, favorable foreign exchange translation rates, the impact of the Foodstar acquisition, a gain in the current year on the sale of a factory in India, and productivity improvements, which include the favorable renegotiation of a long term supply contract in Australia. These increases were reduced by higher commodity costs, particularly in Indonesia and India, partially offset by transactional currency benefits. Operating income increased $26 million, or 13.5%, to $222 million, primarily reflecting higher volume, improved gross margins and favorable foreign exchange. These improvements were partially offset by increased marketing investments and higher GA. U.S. Foodservice Sales of the U.S. Foodservice segment decreased $16 million, or 1.1%, to $1.41 billion. Pricing increased sales 2.3%, largely due to Heinz ketchup and other tomato products, reflecting reduced trade promotions and price increases taken to help offset commodity cost increases. Volume decreased by 3.5%, due to declines in frozen desserts and soup as well as non branded sauces. 18 The volume reflects ongoing weakness in restaurant foot traffic, rationalization of less profitable products, and the timing of new product launches and promotions in the prior year. Gross profit increased $20 million, or 5.1%, to $422 million, and the gross profit margin increased to 29.9% from 28.1%, as pricing and productivity improvements more than offset increased commodity costs and lower volume. Operating income increased $25 million, or 16.8%, to $176 million, due to the gross margin improvements and lower SGA costs relating to reduced incentive compensation expense. Rest of World Sales for Rest of World decreased $64 million, or 11.9%, to $470 million. Foreign exchange translation rates decreased sales 24.6%, or $131 million, largely due to the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar fuerte (VEF) late in the third quarter of Fiscal 2010 (See the Venezuela Foreign Currency and Inflation section below for further explanation). Higher pricing increased sales by 17.2%, largely due to price increases in Latin America taken to mitigate inflation. Volume decreased 4.5% as increases in the Middle East resulting from new products, market expansion and increased marketing and promotions were more than offset by declines in Venezuela resulting from labor disruptions which occurred during Fiscal 2011. Gross profit decreased $29 million, or 14.8%, to $169 million, due mainly to the impact of VEF devaluation, increased commodity costs and lower volume, partially offset by increased pricing. Operating income decreased $16 million, or 22.9%, to $53 million, reflecting the VEF devaluation. In order to facilitate timely reporting in Fiscal 2011, the operating results of Coniexpress in Brazil, which was acquired on April 1, 2011, will first be reported in the Rest of World segment beginning in the first quarter of Fiscal 2012. Fiscal Year Ended April 28, 2010 compared to Fiscal Year Ended April 29, 2009 Sales for Fiscal 2010 increased $484 million, or 4.8%, to $10.49 billion. Net pricing increased sales by 3.4%, largely due to the carryover impact of broad based price increases taken in Fiscal 2009 to help offset increased commodity costs. Volume decreased 1.3%, as favorable volume in emerging markets was more than offset by declines in the U.S. and Australian businesses. Volume was impacted by aggressive competitor promotional activity and softness in some of the Companys product categories, as well as reduced foot traffic in U.S. restaurants in Fiscal 2010. Emerging markets continued to be an important growth driver, with combined volume and pricing gains of 15.3%. In addition, the Companys top 15 brands performed well, with combined volume and pricing gains of 3.4%, led by the Heinz, Complan and ABC brands. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased sales by 2.2%. Foreign exchange translation rates increased sales by 0.5% compared to Fiscal 2009. Gross profit increased $225 million, or 6.3%, to $3.79 billion, and the gross profit margin increased to 36.2% from 35.7%. The improvement in gross margin reflects higher net pricing and productivity improvements, partially offset by higher commodity costs including transaction currency costs. Acquisitions had a favorable impact on gross profit dollars but reduced overall gross profit margin. In addition, gross profit was unfavorably impacted by lower volume and $24 million of charges for a corporation wide initiative to improve productivity, partially offset by a $15 million gain related to property sold in the Netherlands as discussed previously. SGA increased $168 million, or 8.1%, to $2.24 billion, and increased as a percentage of sales to 21.3% from 20.6%. The increase reflects the impact from additional marketing investments, acquisitions, inflation in Latin America, and higher pension and incentive compensation expenses. In addition, SGA was impacted by $14 million related to targeted workforce reductions in Fiscal 2010 and a gain in Fiscal 2009 on the sale of a small portion control business in the U.S. These increases were partially offset by improvements in SD, reflecting productivity improvements and lower fuel costs. 19 Operating income increased $57 million, or 3.8%, to $1.56 billion, reflecting the items above. Net interest expense decreased $25 million, to $251 million, reflecting a $44 million decrease in interest expense and a $19 million decrease in interest income. The decreases in interest income and interest expense are primarily due to lower average interest rates. Other expenses, net, increased $111 million primarily due to a $105 million decrease in currency gains, and $9 million of charges recognized in connection with the August 2009 dealer remarketable securities (DRS) exchange transaction (see below in Liquidity and Financial Position for further explanation of this transaction). The decrease in currency gains reflects Fiscal 2009 gains of $107 million related to forward contracts that were put in place to help mitigate the unfavorable impact of translation associated with key foreign currencies for Fiscal 2009. The effective tax rate for Fiscal 2010 was 27.8% compared to 28.4% in Fiscal 2009. The Fiscal 2010 effective tax rate was lower than Fiscal 2009 primarily due to tax efficient financing of the Companys operations, partially offset by higher taxes on repatriation of earnings. Income from continuing operations attributable to H. J. Heinz Company was $914 million compared to $930 million in Fiscal 2009, a decrease of 1.6%. The decrease reflects the Fiscal 2009 currency gains discussed above, which were $66 million after tax ($0.21 per share), and $28 million in after tax charges ($0.09 per share) in Fiscal 2010 for targeted workforce reductions and non cash asset write offs, partially offset by higher operating income, reduced net interest expense, a lower effective tax rate and an $11 million after tax gain related to property sold in the Netherlands. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $2.87 in Fiscal 2010 compared to $2.91 in Fiscal 2009, down 1.4%. EPS movements were unfavorably impacted by $0.29, or $90 million of net income, from currency fluctuations, after taking into account the net effect Fiscal 2010 and 2009 currency translation contracts, as well as foreign currency movements on translation and U.K. transaction costs. The impact of fluctuating translation exchange rates in Fiscal 2010 has had a relatively consistent impact on all components of operating income on the consolidated statement of income. The impact of cross currency sourcing of inventory reduced gross profit and operating income but did not affect sales. FISCAL YEAR 2010 OPERATING RESULTS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT North American Consumer Products Sales of the North American Consumer Products segment increased $56 million, or 1.8%, to $3.19 billion. Net prices grew 1.9% reflecting the carryover impact of price increases taken across the majority of the product portfolio throughout Fiscal 2009, partially offset by increased promotional spending in Fiscal 2010, particularly on Smart Ones frozen entrees and Heinz ketchup. Volume decreased 1.5%, reflecting declines in frozen meals and desserts due to category softness, competitor promotional activity and the impact of price increases. Volume declines were also noted in Ore Ida frozen potatoes, Classico pasta sauces and frozen snacks. These volume declines were partially offset by increases in TGI Fridays Skillet Meals due to new product introductions and increased trade promotions and marketing as well as growth in Heinz ketchup. The acquisition of Arthurs Fresh Company, a small chilled smoothies business in Canada, at the beginning of the third quarter of Fiscal 2010 increased sales 0.2%. Favorable Canadian exchange translation rates increased sales 1.3%. Gross profit increased $80 million, or 6.3%, to $1.34 billion, and the gross profit margin increased to 41.9% from 40.1%. The higher gross margin reflects productivity improvements and the carryover impact of price increases, partially offset by increased commodity costs. The favorable impact of foreign exchange on gross profit was more than offset by unfavorable volume. Operating income increased $47 million, or 6.4%, to $771 million, reflecting the improvement in gross profit and 20 reduced SD, partially offset by increased marketing investment, pension costs and incentive compensation expense. The improvement in SD was a result of productivity projects, tight cost control and lower fuel costs. Europe Heinz Europe sales increased $4 million, or 0.1%, to $3.33 billion. Unfavorable foreign exchange translation rates decreased sales by 1.9%. Net pricing increased 2.4%, driven by the carryover impact of price increases taken in Fiscal 2009, partially offset by increased promotions, particularly in the U.K. and Continental Europe. Volume decreased 0.9%, principally due to decreases in France from the rationalization of low margin sauces, and increased competitor promotional activity on frozen products in the U.K. Volume for infant nutrition products in the U.K. and Italy also declined, along with decreases in Heinz pasta meals as a result of reduced promotional activities. Lower volume in Italy reflects the overall category decline in that country. Volume improvements were posted on soups in the U.K. and Germany as well as Heinz ketchup across Europe, particularly in Russia where both ketchup, sauces and infant feeding products are growing at double digit rates. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased sales 0.5%, largely due to the acquisition of the Bndicta sauce business in France in the second quarter of Fiscal 2009. Gross profit decreased $9 million, or 0.7%, to $1.25 billion, and the gross profit margin decreased to 37.4% from 37.7%. The decline in gross profit is largely due to unfavorable foreign exchange translation rates and increased commodity costs, including the cross currency rate movements in the British pound versus the euro and U.S. dollar. These declines were partially mitigated by higher pricing and productivity improvements. Operating income decreased $17 million, or 2.9%, to $554 million, due to unfavorable foreign currency translation and transaction impacts, as well as increased marketing and higher incentive compensation expense, partially offset by reduced SD. Asia/Pacific Heinz Asia/Pacific sales increased $380 million, or 23.3%, to $2.01 billion. Acquisitions increased sales 12.6% due to the Fiscal 2009 acquisitions of Golden Circle Limited, a health oriented fruit and juice business in Australia, and La Bonne Cuisine, a chilled dip business in New Zealand. Pricing increased 2.0%, reflecting Fiscal 2010 and 2009 increases on ABC products in Indonesia as well as the carryover impact of Fiscal 2009 price increases and reduced promotions in New Zealand. These increases were partially offset by reduced net pricing on Long Fong frozen products in China due to increased promotional spending. Volume increased 1.0%, as significant growth in Complan and Glucon D nutritional beverages in India and ABC products in Indonesia was more than offset by general softness in both Australia and New Zealand, which have been impacted by competitive activity and reduced market demand associated with higher prices. Favorable exchange translation rates increased sales by 7.8%. Gross profit increased $83 million, or 15.6%, to $612 million, and the gross profit margin declined to 30.5% from 32.5%. The $83 million increase in gross profit was due to higher volume and pricing, productivity improvements and favorable foreign exchange translation rates. These increases were partially offset by increased commodity costs, which include the impact of cross currency rates on inventory costs. Acquisitions had a favorable impact on gross profit dollars but reduced overall gross profit margin. Operating income increased by $13 million, or 7.0%, to $195 million, as the increase in gross profit was partially offset by increased SGA related to acquisitions, the impact of foreign exchange translation rates and increased marketing investments. U.S. Foodservice Sales of the U.S. Foodservice segment decreased $21 million, or 1.5%, to $1.43 billion. Pricing increased sales 4.4%, largely due to Fiscal 2009 price increases taken across the portfolio. Volume decreased by 5.5%, due to industry wide declines in U.S. restaurant traffic and sales, targeted SKU 21 reductions, the unfavorable impact from price increases and increased competitive activity. Fiscal 2009 divestitures reduced sales 0.4%. Gross profit increased $49 million, or 13.8%, to $402 million, and the gross profit margin increased to 28.1% from 24.3%, as cumulative price increases helped return margins for this business closer to their historical levels. In Fiscal 2010, gross profit benefited from pricing and productivity improvements as well as commodity cost favorability which more than offset unfavorable volume. Operating income increased $21 million, or 16.4%, to $151 million, which is primarily due to gross profit improvements and reduced SD reflecting productivity projects, tight cost control and lower fuel costs. These improvements were partially offset by increased marketing expense and higher GA resulting from increased pension and incentive compensation costs and a Fiscal 2009 gain on the sale of a small, non core portion control business. Rest of World Sales for Rest of World increased $65 million, or 14.0%, to $533 million. Higher pricing increased sales by 23.1%, largely due to Fiscal 2010 and 2009 price increases in Latin America taken to mitigate the impact of raw material and labor inflation. Volume increased 2.3% reflecting increases in Latin America and the Middle East. Acquisitions increased sales 0.8% due to the Fiscal 2009 acquisition of Papillon, a small chilled products business in South Africa. Foreign exchange translation rates decreased sales 12.2%, largely due to the devaluation of the VEF late in the third quarter of Fiscal 2010 (See the Venezuela Foreign Currency and Inflation section below for further explanation). Gross profit increased $37 million, or 23.1%, to $199 million, due mainly to increased pricing, partially offset by increased commodity costs and the impact of the VEF devaluation. Operating income increased $17 million, or 32.2% to $69 million, as the increase in gross profit was partially offset by increased marketing and higher SD and GA expenses reflecting growth related investments and inflation in Latin America. Liquidity and Financial Position For Fiscal 2011, cash provided by operating activities was a record $1.58 billion compared to $1.26 billion in the prior year. The improvement in Fiscal 2011 versus Fiscal 2010 reflects higher earnings, reduced pension contributions and favorable movements in payables. These improvements were partially offset by declines in cash flows from receivables, largely due to the timing of cash received under an accounts receivable securitization program (see additional explanation below), and from inventories, accrued expenses and income taxes. The Company received $12 million of cash in Fiscal 2011 for the termination of foreign currency hedge contracts (see Note 12, Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities in
