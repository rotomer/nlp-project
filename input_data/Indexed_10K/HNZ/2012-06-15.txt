Item 7.Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.Executive Overview Fiscal 2012 The H.J. Heinz Company has been a pioneer in the food industry for over 140 years and possesses one of the worlds best and most recognizable brandsHeinz. The Company has a global portfolio of leading brands focused in three core categories, Ketchup and Sauces, Meals and Snacks, and Infant/Nutrition.The Companys Fiscal 2012 results reflect strong sales growth of 8.8%, led by a trio of growth engines emerging markets, our top 15 brands and global ketchup. The emerging markets posted organic sales growth(1) of 16.4% for the fiscal year (40.9% reported). Emerging markets represented 21.0% of total Company sales reflecting this strong organic growth and our Fiscal 2011 acquisitions of Quero in Brazil and Master in China. The Companys top 15 brands performed well with organic sales growth of 5.0% (12.3% reported) driven by the Heinz, Master, Complan and ABC brands. The Quero and Master brands acquired in Fiscal 2011 are now part of the Companys top 15 brands and drove an additional 4.0% increase in total Company sales. Global ketchup grew organically 8.0% (9.7% reported). Favorable foreign exchange increased sales by 1.8% while the Companys strategic decision to exit the Boston Market license in the U.S. reduced sales by 0.5%. Overall, the Companys Fiscal 2012 organic sales growth of 3.5% reflects a 3.8% increase in net pricing and a 0.3% decline in volume. This quarter marks the 28th consecutive quarter of organic sales growth for the Company. On May 26, 2011, the Company announced that in order to accelerate growth and drive global productivity, it would invest in productivity initiatives in Fiscal 2012 that are expected to make the Company stronger and even more competitive (see Productivity Initiatives section below for further detail). During Fiscal 2012, the Company incurred charges of $224 million pre tax or $0.50 per share related to these productivity initiatives. On a reported basis, gross margin for Fiscal 2012 declined 260 basis points to 34.3% compared to prior year. Excluding charges for productivity initiatives(2), gross margin for the year declined 140 basis points to 35.5% reflecting industry wide commodity cost inflation, unfavorable sales mix and lower gross margin on recent acquisitions, partially offset by higher pricing and productivity improvements. Operating income for the fiscal year decreased 12.0% to $1.45 billion. Excluding charges for productivity initiatives, operating income increased 1.7% versus prior year to $1.68 billion reflecting higher sales, effective cost management and lower incentive compensation expenses. The Company continued to invest for the future, despite the tough economic environment, increasing marketing spending by 9.4% and spending approximately $80 million on Project Keystone, a multi year program designed to drive productivity and make Heinz much more competitive by adding capabilities, harmonizing global processes and standardizing our systems through SAP. Diluted earnings per share were $2.85 for Fiscal 2012, compared to $3.06 in the prior year. Excluding charges for productivity initiatives, earnings per share were $3.35 in the current year, up 9.5%. Earnings per share benefited from the increase in operating income excluding charges for productivity initiatives and a lower effective tax rate. The Company also generated $1.08 billion of operating free cash flow(3) this year or $1.21 billion excluding the $122 million of cash paid in Fiscal 2012 for productivity initiatives. The remaining cash required for these initiatives of approximately $80 million is expected to be paid in the first quarter of Fiscal 2013. The Company believes these Fiscal 2012 results are indicative of the effectiveness of its business plan, which is focused on the following four strategic pillars: Accelerate growth in emerging markets; Expand the core portfolio; Strengthen and leverage global scale; and Make talent an advantage. The Company remains confident in its underlying business fundamentals and plans to continue to focus on these four strategic pillars in Fiscal 2013. (1)Organic sales growth is defined as volume plus price or total sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures. See Non GAAP Measures section below for the reconciliation of all of these organic sales growth measures to the reported GAAP measure. (2)All results excluding charges for productivity initiatives are non GAAP measures used for management reporting and incentive compensation purposes. See Non GAAP Measures section below and the following reconciliation of all non GAAP measures to the reported GAAP measures. (3)Operating Free Cash Flow is defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures net of proceeds from disposals of Property, Plant and Equipment. See Non GAAP Measures section below for the reconciliation of this measure to the reported GAAP measure. 11 Fiscal Year Ended April 29, 2012 SalesGross ProfitSG&AOperating IncomeEffective Tax RateNet Income attributable to H.J.

The Company originally anticipated investing at least $130 million of cash and $160 million of pre tax income ($0.35 per share) on these initiatives during Fiscal 2012. During Fiscal 2012, the Companys Board of Directors gave its approval for the Company to invest an incremental $40 million cash and $75 million of pre tax income ($0.21 per share) on additional productivity initiatives. The Company was able to execute these projects under budget and is on track to deliver the expected benefits. All of these costs in Fiscal 2012 were reported in the Non Operating segment. See Note 3, "Productivity Initiatives" in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" and the "Liquidity and Financial Position" section below for additional information on these productivity initiatives. Discontinued Operations During the third quarter of Fiscal 2010, the Company completed the sale of its Appetizers And, Inc. frozen hors doeuvres business which was previously reported within the U.S. Foodservice segment, resulting in a $14.5 million pre tax ($10.4 million after tax) loss. Also during the third quarter of Fiscal 2010, the Company completed the sale of its private label frozen desserts business in the U.K., resulting in a $31.4 million pre tax ($23.6 million after tax) loss. During the second quarter of Fiscal 2010, the Company completed the sale of its Kabobs frozen hors doeuvres business which was previously reported within the U.S. Foodservice segment, resulting in a $15.0 million pre tax ($10.9 million after tax) loss. The losses on each of these transactions have been recorded in discontinued operations.In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the operating results related to these businesses have been included in discontinued operations in the Companys consolidated statements of income for Fiscal 2010. The following table presents summarized operating results for these discontinued operations: Fiscal Year Ended April 28,2010FY 2010 (In millions)Sales$63.0Net after tax losses$(4.7)Tax benefit on losses$2.0During the first quarter of Fiscal 2013, the Companys Board of Directors approved the sale of its U.S. Foodservice frozen desserts business. This business had annual sales of approximately $75 million in Fiscal 2012. The disposal transaction included the sale of two factories. As a result of this transaction, the Company will recognize a pre tax loss of approximately $33 million ($21 million after tax), which will be recorded in discontinued operations in the first quarter of Fiscal 2013. The sale will not significantly affect the Companys profit on a continuing operations basis going forward.12Other DisposalsDuring the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010, the Company received cash proceeds of $95 million from the government of the Netherlands for property the government acquired through eminent domain proceedings. The transaction included the purchase by the government of the Companys factory located in Nijmegen, which produces soups, pasta and cereals. The cash proceeds are intended to compensate the Company for costs, both capital and expense, which are being incurred over a three year period from the date of the transaction, which is the length of time the Company has to exit the current factory location and construct new facilities. Note, the Company has and will incur costs to build an R&D facility in the Netherlands, costs to transfer a cereal line to another factory location, employee costs for severance and other costs directly related to the closure and relocation of the existing facilities. The Company also entered into a three year leaseback on the Nijmegen factory. The Company will continue to operate in the leased factory while executing its plans for closure and relocation of the operations. The Company has accounted for the proceeds on a cost recovery basis. In doing so, the Company has made its estimates of cost, both of a capital and expense nature, to be incurred and recovered and to which proceeds from the transaction will be applied. Of the initial proceeds received, $81 million was deferred based on managements total estimated future costs to be recovered and these deferred amounts are recognized as the related costs are incurred. If estimated costs differ from what is actually incurred, these adjustments will be reflected in earnings. As of April 29, 2012 and April 27, 2011, the remaining deferred amounts on the consolidated balance sheets were $21 million and $63 million, respectively, and were recorded in other non current liabilities and other accrued liabilities. No significant adjustments were reflected in earnings in Fiscal 2012 and 2011. The excess of the $95 million of proceeds received over estimated costs to be recovered and incurred was $15 million and was recorded as a reduction of cost of products sold in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended April 28, 2010.Results of Continuing OperationsOn March 14, 2012 the Companys Board of Directors of H. J. Heinz Company authorized a change in the Companys fiscal year end from the Wednesday nearest April 30 to the Sunday nearest April 30. The change in the fiscal year end resulted in Fiscal 2012 changing from a 53 week year to a 52 1/2 week year and was intended to better align the Companys financial reporting period with its business partners and production schedules. This change did not have a material impact on the Companys financial statements. The Companys revenues are generated via the sale of products in the following categories: Fiscal Year Ended April 29, 2012 April 27, 2011 April 28, 2010 (52 1/2 Weeks) (52 Weeks) (52 Weeks) (In thousands)Ketchup and Sauces$5,232,607 $4,607,971 $4,446,911Meals and Snacks4,479,502 4,282,318 4,289,977Infant/Nutrition1,232,248 1,175,438 1,157,982Other704,722 640,861 600,113Total$11,649,079 $10,706,588 $10,494,983Fiscal 2012 Company Results Fiscal Year Ended April 29, 2012 compared to Fiscal Year Ended April 27, 2011 Sales for Fiscal 2012 increased $942 million, or 8.8%, to $11.65 billion. Net pricing increased sales by 3.8%, driven by price increases across the Company, particularly in the U.S., Latin America, U.K. and China. Volume decreased 0.3%, as favorable volume in emerging markets, Japan and Germany were more than offset by declines in the U.S., Australia and Italy. Emerging markets, global ketchup and the Companys top 15 brands continued to be the most significant growth drivers, with organic sales growth of 16.4%, 8.0%, and 5.0%, respectively (40.9%, 9.7% and 12.3%, respectively, reported). Acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased sales by 3.5%. Foreign exchange translation rates increased sales by 1.8%.Gross profit increased $47 million, or 1.2%, to $4.0 billion however, the gross profit margin decreased 260 basis points to 34.3%. Excluding charges for productivity initiatives, gross profit increased $187 million, or 4.7%, to $4.14 billion, largely due to higher pricing, acquisitions and a $59 million favorable impact from foreign exchange, partially offset by lower volume and commodity cost inflation. Gross profit margin excluding charges for productivity initiatives reflected industry wide price and cost pressure and decreased 140 basis points to 35.5%, resulting from higher commodity and other costs, the impact of recent 13acquisitions and unfavorable sales mix, partially offset by higher pricing and productivity improvements. Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A") increased $244 million, or 10.6% to $2.55 billion. Excluding charges for productivity initiatives, SG&A increased $160 million, or 6.9% to $2.46 billion, and decreased as a percentage of sales to 21.2% versus 21.5% last year. This increase in SG&A reflects a $38 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange translation rates, as well as increases from acquisitions, higher marketing spending and incremental investments in Project Keystone. In addition, selling and distribution expense ("S&D") was unfavorably impacted by higher fuel prices, particularly in the U.S., and general and administrative expenses ("G&A") were higher as a result of strategic investments to drive growth in emerging markets, partially offset by effective cost management in developed markets and lower incentive compensation expense. SG&A, excluding marketing and charges for productivity initiatives, decreased as percentage of sales by 40 basis points, to 17.1%. Operating income decreased $197 million, or 12.0%, to $1.45 billion. Excluding charges for productivity initiatives, operating income was up $27 million, or 1.7%, to $1.68 billion.Net interest expense increased $7 million, to $259 million, reflecting a $19 million increase in interest expense, partially offset by a $12 million increase in interest income. The increase in interest income is mainly due to earnings on short term investments and the increase in interest expense is largely due to interest rate mix in the Companys debt portfolio and acquisitions made last fiscal year. Other expenses, net, decreased $13 million, to $8 million, primarily due to currency gains this year compared to currency losses in the prior year.The effective tax rate for Fiscal 2012 was 20.6%. Excluding charges for productivity initiatives, the effective tax rate was 21.7% in the current year compared to 26.8% last year. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of the increased benefits from the revaluation of the tax basis of foreign assets, the reversal of an uncertain tax position liability due to the expiration of the statute of limitations in a foreign tax jurisdiction, the beneficial resolution of a foreign tax case, and lower tax on the income of foreign subsidiaries primarily resulting from a statutory tax rate reduction in the U.K. These benefits were partially offset by the current year expense for changes in valuation allowances.Net income attributable to H. J. Heinz Company was $923 million, a decrease of 6.7%. Excluding charges for productivity initiatives, net income attributable to H. J. Heinz Company was $1.09 billion compared to $990 million in the prior year, an increase of 9.8%. This increase was largely due to higher sales and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by a lower gross margin and investments in marketing, emerging markets capabilities and Project Keystone. Diluted earnings per share were $2.85 in the current year, down 6.9%. Excluding charges for productivity initiatives, diluted earnings per share were $3.35 in the current year compared to $3.06 in the prior year, up 9.5%. EPS movements were favorably impacted by $0.06 from currency translation and translation hedges. The impact of fluctuating translation exchange rates in Fiscal 2012 has had a relatively consistent impact on all components of operating income on the consolidated statement of income.FISCAL YEAR 2012 OPERATING RESULTS BY BUSINESS SEGMENTNorth American Consumer ProductsSales of the North American Consumer Products segment decreased $24 million, or 0.7%, to $3.24 billion. Higher net price of 2.8% reflects price increases across the leading brands and reduced trade promotions. Despite volume gains from new product launches, overall volume declined 2.3% across most of our key brands reflecting reduced promotional activity and the impact of price increases. Sales were also unfavorably impacted by 1.6% from the Companys strategic decision to exit the Boston Market license effective July 2011. Favorable Canadian exchange translation rates increased sales 0.3%. Gross profit decreased $51 million, or 3.7%, to $1.32 billion, and the gross profit margin decreased to 40.9% from 42.1%. Gross profit declined as higher pricing and productivity improvements were more than offset by increased commodity and fuel costs, lower volume and the impact from the exit of the Boston Market license. The decline in gross margin is due to higher commodity costs and unfavorable sales mix. Operating income decreased $21 million, or 2.5% to $812 million, as the decline in gross profit was partially offset by a decrease in G&A reflecting effective cost management, lower incentive compensation expenses and decreased S&D largely due to lower volume. EuropeHeinz Europe sales increased $204 million, or 6.3%, to $3.44 billion. Net pricing increased 3.7%, driven by price increases across Europe and reduced promotions in the U.K. Volume increased by 0.6% as growth in ketchup across Europe, soup in the 14U.K., sauces in Germany and Heinz branded sauces in Russia were offset by declines in Italian infant nutrition and frozen products in the U.K. The Italian infant nutrition business was unfavorably impacted by weakness in the Italian economy and corresponding softness in the category. Favorable foreign exchange translation rates increased sales by 1.9%. Gross profit increased $52 million, or 4.1%, to $1.32 billion, while the gross profit margin decreased to 38.3% from 39.1%. The $52 million increase in gross profit is due to favorable net pricing, increased volume and foreign exchange translation rates. The decrease in the gross margin reflects the benefits from higher pricing and productivity improvements which were more than offset by higher commodity costs, unfavorable sales mix and a prior year gain on the sale of distribution rights on Amoy products to ethnic channels in the U.K. Operating income increased $28 million, or 4.8%, to $609 million, due to higher pricing, increased volume and favorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by increased marketing investments. Asia/PacificHeinz Asia/Pacific sales increased $248 million, or 10.7%, to $2.57 billion. Favorable exchange translation rates increased sales by 5.4%. The acquisition of Foodstar in China during the third quarter of Fiscal 2011 increased sales 3.1%. Pricing increased 2.5% and volume decreased 0.3%. Total segment volume was negatively impacted by poor operating results in Australia. The Australian business has been impacted by a challenging market environment, higher promotions and reduced market demand. Price increases were realized on ABC products in Indonesia, Complan products in India, and Long Fong frozen products and Heinz infant feeding products in China. Significant volume growth occurred in Complan nutritional beverages in India, frozen potatoes and sauces in Japan, ABC sauces in Indonesia, and Heinz and Master branded sauces and Heinz branded infant feeding products in China. Beyond Australia, volume declines were noted in Glucon D and Nycil branded products in India and Long Fong frozen products in China.Gross profit increased $50 million, or 6.9%, to $764 million, and the gross profit margin decreased to 29.8% from 30.8%. The $50 million increase in gross profit largely reflects favorable net pricing and foreign exchange translation rates and the Foodstar acquisition, partially offset by weakness in Australia, prior year gains from the favorable renegotiation of a long term supply contract in Australia and the sale of a factory in India. The decline in gross margin is a result of higher commodity costs and poor operating results in Australia which were only partially offset by higher pricing and productivity improvements. SG&A increased as a result of foreign exchange translation rates, the Foodstar acquisition, increased marketing and investments to improve capabilities in our emerging markets businesses. Operating income decreased by $15 million, or 6.9%, to $206 million, reflecting results in Australia. U.S. FoodserviceSales of the U.S. Foodservice segment increased $6 million, or 0.4%, to $1.42 billion. Pricing increased sales 2.6%, largely due to price increases across this segments product portfolio to offset commodity cost increases. Volume decreased by 2.2%, due largely to ongoing weakness in restaurant foot traffic at some key customers, which is beginning to improve, and the impact of price increases. Gross profit decreased $25 million, or 5.9%, to $397 million, and the gross profit margin decreased to 28.0% from 29.9%, as pricing and productivity improvements were more than offset by increased commodity and fuel costs and unfavorable volume and product mix. Operating income decreased $10 million, or 5.5%, to $166 million, which is primarily due to higher commodity costs, partially offset by a decrease in G&A expenses which reflects effective cost management, including reduced incentive compensation expense.Rest of WorldSales for Rest of World increased $509 million, or 108.3%, to $979 million. The Coniexpress acquisition in Brazil ("Quero"), which was completed at the end of Fiscal 2011, increased sales 76.6%. Higher pricing increased sales by 21.5%, largely due to price increases in Latin America taken to mitigate inflation. (See the Venezuela Foreign Currency and Inflation section below for further discussion on inflation in Venezuela.) Volume increased 11.9% mainly due to increases in Heinz ketchup and baby food in Latin America. Volume in Latin America was unfavorably impacted in the prior year by labor disruptions which occurred in Venezuela. Ketchup and sauces in South Africa and improvements across product categories in the Middle East also drove favorable volume. Foreign exchange translation rates decreased sales 1.7%. Gross profit increased $158 million, or 93.2%, to $327 million, due mainly to the Quero acquisition in Brazil and higher pricing and volume, partially offset by increased commodity costs. The gross profit margin declined to 33.4% from 36.0% primarily reflecting the impact of the Quero acquisition. Operating income increased $52 million, or 96.9%, to $105 million resulting from higher pricing and volume and the Quero acquisition.15Fiscal 2011 Company Results Fiscal Year Ended April 27, 2011 compared to Fiscal Year Ended April 28, 2010Sales for Fiscal 2011 increased $212 million, or 2.0%, to $10.71 billion. Volume increased 0.7%, as favorable volume in emerging markets as well as improvements in North American Consumer Products were partially offset by declines in U.S. Foodservice, Australia and Germany. Emerging markets and our Top 15 brands realized combined volume and pricing gains of 14.4% and 3.8%, respectively. Net pricing increased sales by 1.2%, as price increases in emerging markets, particularly Latin America, U.S. Foodservice and the U.K. were partially offset by increased trade promotions in the North American Consumer Products and Australian businesses. Acquisitions increased sales by 0.6%, while foreign exchange translation rates reduced sales by 0.5%.Gross profit increased $158 million, or 4.2%, to $3.95 billion, and the gross profit margin increased to 36.9% from 36.2%. Gross profit increased as higher volume, net pricing, productivity improvements and the favorable impact from the Foodstar acquisition were partially offset by a $33 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange translation rates as well as higher commodity costs. In addition, Fiscal 2010s gross profit included $24 million in charges for a corporation wide initiative to improve productivity, partially offset by a $15 million gain related to property sold in the Netherlands as discussed previously.SG&A increased $69 million, or 3.1% to $2.30 billion, and increased slightly as a percentage of sales to 21.5% from 21.3%. SG&A was unfavorably impacted by S&D, largely resulting from the higher volume and fuel costs, and higher G&A, reflecting investments in global process and system upgrades, increased capabilities in emerging markets and acquisition costs related to the Coniexpress acquisition. These increases were partially offset by reduced marketing expense, a $17 million favorable impact from foreign exchange translation rates and a $14 million impact related to Fiscal 2010 targeted workforce reductions. Operating income increased $89 million, or 5.7%, to $1.65 billion, reflecting the items above.Net interest expense increased $2 million, to $253 million, reflecting a $23 million decrease in interest income and a $20 million decrease in interest expense. The decrease in interest income is mainly due to a $24 million gain in Fiscal 2010 on a total rate of return swap, which was terminated in August 2009. Interest expense decreased due to lower average interest rates and debt balances. Other expenses, net, increased $3.0 million, to $21 million, primarily due to currency losses partially offset by $9 million of charges in Fiscal 2010 recognized in connection with the dealer remarketable securities exchange transaction (see below in Liquidity and Financial Position for further explanation of this transaction).The effective tax rate for Fiscal 2011 was 26.8% compared to 27.8% for Fiscal 2010. The Fiscal 2011 effective tax rate was lower than Fiscal 2010 primarily due to increased benefits from foreign tax planning and increased tax exempt foreign income, partially offset by higher taxes on repatriation of earnings.Income from continuing operations attributable to H. J. Heinz Company was $990 million compared to $914 million in Fiscal 2010, an increase of 8.2%. The increase was due to higher operating income, reduced interest expense, a lower tax rate and $28 million in Fiscal 2010 after tax charges ($0.09 per share) for targeted workforce reductions and non cash asset write offs. These were partially offset by an $11 million after tax gain in Fiscal 2010 related to property sold in the Netherlands and a $15 million after tax gain in Fiscal 2010 on a total rate of return swap. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $3.06 in Fiscal 2011 compared to $2.87 in Fiscal 2010, up 6.6%. EPS movements were unfavorably impacted by 1.5% higher shares outstanding and by $0.06 from currency fluctuations, after taking into account the net effect of Fiscal 2011 and 2010 currency translation contracts and foreign currency movements on translation.The impact of fluctuating translation exchange rates in Fiscal 2011 has had a relatively consistent impact on all components of operating income on the consolidated statement of income.FISCAL YEAR 2011 OPERATING RESULTS BY BUSINESS SEGMENTNorth American Consumer ProductsSales of the North American Consumer Products segment increased $74 million, or 2.3%, to $3.27 billion. Volume increased 2.0% as new products and increased trade promotions drove improvements in Heinz ketchup and gravy, Smart Ones frozen entrees, Classico pasta sauces, Ore Ida frozen potatoes and TGI Fridays frozen meals and appetizers (TGI Fridays frozen meals were discontinued at the end of Fiscal 2012). These increases were partially offset by declines in Boston Market frozen products as we transitioned away from the Boston Market license which was completed in the first quarter of Fiscal 2012. In addition, volume was up across most product categories in Canada. Net prices decreased 1.1% reflecting trade promotion increases in Canada, the Consumer Value Program launched in the U.S. in the second half of Fiscal 2010 and trade spending in Fiscal 2011 to support the launch of TGI Fridays single serve frozen products. The acquisition of Arthurs Fresh Company, a small chilled smoothies business in Canada, in the third quarter of Fiscal 2010, increased sales 0.2%. Favorable Canadian exchange translation rates increased sales 1.1%.16Gross profit increased $38 million, or 2.8%, to $1.38 billion, and the gross profit margin increased to 42.1% from 41.9%. The increase in gross profit dollars was aided by favorable volume and foreign exchange translation rates. The gross profit margin improved as productivity improvements more than offset the shift in marketing funds to trade promotion investments and increased commodity costs. SG&A decreased as a result of the shift of marketing funds to trade promotions. Operating income increased $61 million, or 7.9%, to $833 million, reflecting higher volume, gross margin improvements and tight control of SG&A.EuropeHeinz Europe sales decreased $96 million, or 2.9%, to $3.24 billion. The decrease was due to unfavorable foreign exchange translation rates, which decreased sales by 3.5%, or $117 million. Volume decreased 0.4%, as increases in Weight Watchers and Aunt Bessies frozen products in the U.K, improvements in ketchup, particularly in Russia and France, and increases in drinks in The Netherlands, were more than offset by declines in soups in the U.K. and Germany, Honig branded products in The Netherlands, and infant nutrition across Europe. Net pricing increased 1.0%, due to reduced promotions on Heinz soup in the U.K. and increased net pricing in our Russian and Italian infant nutrition businesses.Gross profit increased $19 million, or 1.5%, to $1.27 billion, and the gross profit margin increased to 39.1% from 37.4%. These increases resulted from productivity improvements and higher net pricing partially offset by increased commodity costs and unfavorable foreign exchange translation rates. Gross profit also benefited from a gain in Fiscal 2011 on the sale of distribution rights on Amoy products in certain ethnic channels in the U.K. Operating income increased $27 million, or 4.8%, to $581 million, reflecting the items above as well as reduced SG&A. The decline in SG&A was largely related to foreign exchange translation rates, partially offset by increased marketing and investments in global process and system upgrades.Asia/PacificHeinz Asia/Pacific sales increased $314 million, or 15.6%, to $2.32 billion. Volume increased 4.8%, due to significant growth in Complan and Glucon D nutritional beverages in India, ABC products in Indonesia and infant feeding and frozen products in China and Japan. These increases were partially offset by softness in Australia, which has been impacted by a difficult trade environment and generally weak category trends. Pricing rose 0.2%, reflecting increases on ABC products in Indonesia and Complan and Glucon D products in India offset by higher promotions in Australia. The acquisition of Foodstar during the third quarter of Fiscal 2011 increased sales 2.9%. Favorable exchange translation rates increased sales by 7.7%.Gross profit increased $103 million, or 16.8%, to $715 million, and the gross profit margin increased to 30.8% from 30.5%. These increases reflect higher volume and pricing, favorable foreign exchange translation rates, the impact of the Foodstar acquisition, a gain in Fiscal 2011 on the sale of a factory in India, and productivity improvements, which include the favorable renegotiation of a long term supply contract in Australia. These increases were reduced by higher commodity costs, particularly in Indonesia and India, partially offset by transactional currency benefits. Operating income increased $26 million, or 13.5%, to $222 million, primarily reflecting higher volume, improved gross margins and favorable foreign exchange. These improvements were partially offset by increased marketing investments and higher G&A.U.S. FoodserviceSales of the U.S. Foodservice segment decreased $16 million, or 1.1%, to $1.41 billion. Pricing increased sales 2.3%, largely due to Heinz ketchup and other tomato products, reflecting reduced trade promotions and price increases taken to offset commodity cost increases. Volume decreased by 3.5%, due to declines in frozen desserts and soup as well as non branded sauces. The volume reflects ongoing weakness in restaurant foot traffic, rationalization of less profitable products, and the timing of new product launches and promotions in Fiscal 2010.Gross profit increased $20 million, or 5.1%, to $422 million, and the gross profit margin increased to 29.9% from 28.1%, as pricing and productivity improvements more than offset increased commodity costs and lower volume. Operating income increased $25 million, or 16.8%, to $176 million, due to the gross margin improvements and lower SG&A costs relating to reduced incentive compensation expense.Rest of WorldSales for Rest of World decreased $64 million, or 11.9%, to $470 million. Foreign exchange translation rates decreased sales 24.6%, or $131 million, largely due to the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar fuerte (VEF) late in the third quarter of Fiscal 2010. Higher pricing increased sales by 17.2%, largely due to price increases in Latin America taken to mitigate inflation. Volume decreased 4.5% as increases in the Middle East resulting from new products, market expansion and increased marketing and promotions were more than offset by declines in Venezuela resulting from labor disruptions which occurred during Fiscal 2011.Gross profit decreased $29 million, or 14.8%, to $169 million, due mainly to the impact of VEF devaluation, increased commodity costs and lower volume, partially offset by increased pricing. Operating income decreased $16 million, or 22.9%, to 17$53 million, reflecting the VEF devaluation. In order to facilitate timely reporting in Fiscal 2011, the operating results of Coniexpress in Brazil, which was acquired on April 1, 2011, was first reported in the Rest of World segment beginning in the first quarter of Fiscal 2012.Liquidity and Financial PositionFor Fiscal 2012, cash provided by operating activities was $1.49 billion compared to $1.58 billion in the prior year. The decline in Fiscal 2012 versus Fiscal 2011 reflects the cash impact of spending on productivity initiatives, as well as unfavorable movements in accounts payable and accrued income taxes, partially offset by favorable movements in receivables and inventories. The Companys cash conversion cycle, which is calculated using a 5 quarter average, was consistent with the prior year at 42 days in Fiscal 2012. In Fiscal 2012, cash required for productivity initiatives was $122 million. The remaining cash required for these initiatives of approximately $80 million is expected to be paid in the first quarter of Fiscal 2013. Ongoing pre tax savings relative to these initiatives was approximately $25 million in Fiscal 2012 and is expected to be approximately $95 million in Fiscal 2013, the majority of which will be realized as a reduction in cost of products sold. In Fiscal 2010, the Company entered into a three year $175 million accounts receivable securitization program. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company sells, on a revolving basis, U.S. trade receivables to a wholly owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiary. This subsidiary then sells all of the rights, title and interest in these receivables, all of which are short term, to an unaffiliated entity in return for cash consideration of up to $175 million and a receivable for the remainder of the purchase price (the "Deferred Purchase Price"). The cash consideration and the carrying amount of receivables removed from the consolidated balance sheets were $162 million and $29 million as of April 29, 2012 and April 27, 2011, respectively, resulting in an increase of $133 million in cash for sales under this program for Fiscal 2012 and a decrease in cash of $55 million for Fiscal 2011. The increase in cash proceeds related to the Deferred Purchase Price was $117 million in Fiscal 2012 and was a decrease in cash of $85 million in Fiscal 2011.
