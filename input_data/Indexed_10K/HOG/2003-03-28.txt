Net income and diluted earnings per share for 2002 were $580.2 million and $1.90, respectively, on 305.2 million weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to net income and diluted earnings per share for 2001 of $437.7 million and $1.43, respectively, on 306.2 million weighted average shares outstanding. This represents increases in 2002 net income and diluted earnings per share of 32.5% and 32.9%, respectively. The Company increased its quarterly dividend payment in June 2002 from $.03 per share to $.035 per share which resulted in an aggregate annual dividend of $.135 per share in 2002. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Motorcycle Unit Shipments 2002 2001 Increase (Decrease) %Change Harley Davidson touring motorcycles 70,713 65,403 5,310 8.1 % Harley Davidson custom motorcycles 141,769 118,244 23,525 19.9 Harley Davidson Sportster motorcycles 51,171 50,814 357 0.7 Total Harley Davidson motorcycle units 263,653 234,461 29,192 12.5 Buell motorcycle units 10,943 9,925 1,018 10.3 Total motorcycle units 274,596 244,386 30,210 12.4 % 22 Net Revenue (Dollars in millions) 2002 2001 Increase (Decrease) %Change Harley Davidson motorcycles $ 3,161.0 $ 2,671.3 $ 489.7 18.3 % Buell motorcycles 66.9 61.7 5.2 8.6 Total motorcycles 3,227.9 2,733.0 494.9 18.1 Motorcycle Parts and Accessories 629.2 509.6 119.6 23.5 General Merchandise 231.5 163.9 67.6 41.2 Other 2.4 .3 2.1 n/a Net revenue $ 4,091.0 $ 3,406.8 $ 684.2 20.1 % The Motorcycles segment recorded a 20.1% increase in net revenue driven by a 12.5% increase in Harley Davidson unit shipments. During 2002, the Company shipped 263,653 Harley Davidson motorcycle units, 29,192 more units than in 2001. This increase in units is primarily the result of continued demand for Harley Davidson motorcycles combined with the Companys ongoing success with its manufacturing strategy, which is designed to increase capacity, improve product quality, reduce costs and increase flexibility to respond to changes in the marketplace. Based on the results achieved in 2002, the Company has set a 2003 annual production target of 289,000 Harley Davidson units.(1) In 2002, Buell motorcycle net revenue was up $5.2 million from 2001 on 1,018 additional unit shipments. During 2002, the Company shipped 6,887 Buell Big Twin units compared to 6,436 units in 2001. During 2002 Buell completely revamped its Big Twin line up with the introduction of the XB series which currently includes the new Buell Firebolt XB9R and the new Buell Lightning XB9S. During 2002 the Company also shipped 4,056 units of the smaller and lower priced Buell Blast compared to 3,489 units in 2001. Blast motorcycle units represented 37% of total Buell units shipped in 2002 compared to 35% in 2001. The Company expects the mix of Blast units in 2003 to be slightly less than it was in 2002 and has set a total Buell 2003 production target of 12,500 units.(1) During 2002, worldwide retail registrations in the heavyweight (651+cc) motorcycle market grew 8.4%, while worldwide retail registrations for the Companys Harley Davidson motorcycles grew 16.5%, resulting in a worldwide market share (Harley Davidson models only) of 30.1% compared to 28.0% in 2001. The Company ended 2002 with a domestic (United States) market share (Harley Davidson models only) of 47.5% compared to 45.0% in 2001 (data provided by the Motorcycle Industry Council). Retail registrations of domestic heavyweight motorcycles for the industry were up 12.2% over 2001, while domestic retail registrations for the Companys Harley Davidson motorcycles increased 18.3%. International net revenue totaled $674.5 million during 2002, an increase of $77.5 million, or 13.0%, over 2001. The Company exported 19.3% of its Harley Davidson motorcycle shipments in 2002 compared to 20.3% during 2001. The Company expects to ship 18% to 20% of its Harley Davidson motorcycles to international markets in 2003.(1) 23 European market data (provided by Giral S.A.) includes retail registrations in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and United Kingdom. In these European countries, the Company ended 2002 with a 6.6 % share (Harley Davidson models only) of the heavyweight (651+cc) market, down from 6.7% in 2001. Total 2002 retail registrations in these European markets increased 2.7% while retail registrations for the Companys Harley Davidson motorcycles in these markets increased 3.9%. Company data for all European countries shows that retail registrations of Harley Davidson motorcycles were up 7.6% in 2002. The Companys performance in the European heavyweight market has been positively impacted in 2002 by sales of its new V Rod motorcycle. Asia/Pacific (Japan and Australia) data for 2002 (provided by ERG International, the Australian Bureau of Statistics and industry sources and Company data) showed the Company with a 21.3% share of the heavyweight (651+cc) market (Harley Davidson models only), up from 20.4% in 2001. In 2002, Asia/Pacific retail registrations for the Companys Harley Davidson motorcycles increased 7.4%, while registrations for the Asia/Pacific market in total increased 2.9%. During 2002, Parts and Accessories (P&A) net revenue totaled $629.2 million, up $119.6 million, or 23.5%, compared to 2001. The increase in P&A revenue was driven by continued demand for Harley Davidson motorcycles and sales of the Companys 100th Anniversary products. Total 2002 revenue from the sale of 100th Anniversary P&A products was approximately $34 million. The Company expects that the long term growth rate for P&A revenue will be slightly higher than the growth rate for Harley Davidson motorcycle units.(1) General Merchandise net revenue for 2002 of $231.5 million was up $67.6 million, or 41.2%, compared to 2001. The increase in General Merchandise revenue was driven primarily by sales of 100th Anniversary commemorative products which totaled approximately $49 million in 2002. As a result of the better than expected performance of 100th Anniversary sales in 2002, the Company expects that General Merchandise revenue in 2003 will be even with or slightly down from 2002 results.(1) For the longer term, however, the Company expects that the growth rate for General Merchandise revenue will return to a level that is lower than the growth rate for Harley Davidson motorcycle units.(1) Gross Profit Gross profit in 2002 of $1.4 billion was $264.9 million or 23.0% higher than gross profit in 2001. The increase in gross profit is primarily related to the increase in net revenue. The gross profit margin was 34.7% in 2002 compared to 33.8% in 2001. As discussed below, the increase in gross margin in 2002 was driven by favorable product mix, the model year wholesale price increase and the increase in P&A revenue. Motorcycle product mix was favorable in 2002 with a higher percentage of shipments consisting of custom motorcycles (Softail, Dyna, VRSC and CVO models) and a lower percentage of shipments consisting of Sportster models, when compared to 2001. In addition, wholesale price increases related to the new model year provided for higher average selling prices on units sold in 2002 when compared to 2001. Also during 2002, the increase in P&A revenue favorably impacted gross profit margins as P&A revenue generally has a higher gross margin than motorcycle revenue. 24 Financial Services (Dollars in Millions) 2002 2001 Increase (Decrease) %Change Interest income $ 76.1 76.2 $ (0.1 ) (0.2 )% Gain on current year securitizations 56.1 45.0 11.1 24.7 Servicing fee income 18.6 13.3 5.3 39.8 Insurance commissions 36.1 28.7 7.4 25.4 Other income 24.6 18.3 6.3 34.9 Financial services income 211.5 181.5 30.0 16.5 Interest expense 15.1 24.7 (9.6 ) (38.7 ) Provision for credit losses 6.2 22.2 (16.0 ) (72.2 ) Operating expenses 86.0 73.3 12.7 17.1 Financial services expense 107.3 120.2 (12.9 ) (10.8 ) Operating income from financial services $ 104.2 $ 61.3 $ 42.9 70.1 % Financial services income in 2002 was $211.5 million, an increase of $30.0 million, or 16.5%, over 2001. Operating income from financial services in 2002 was $104.2 million, an increase of $42.9 million, or 70.1%, over 2001. The increase in operating income was driven by strong overall performance in Harley Davidson Financial Services, Inc.s (HDFS) wholesale, retail, and insurance lines combined with a lower provision for credit losses, lower borrowing costs, and higher securitization gains. During 2001, the allowance for credit losses was increased in response to significant growth in the wholesale and retail loan portfolios, a decline in economic conditions, and HDFS uncertainty of consumer behavior after the September 11th tragedies. During 2002, the required provision for credit losses decreased as portfolio performance was better than expected. The Company believes that the allowance for credit losses is adequate at December 31, 2002. During 2002 and 2001, HDFS sold approximately $1.3 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, of retail motorcycle installment loans through securitization transactions. In connection with the securitization transactions, HDFS recorded gains of $56.1 million and $45.0 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. In both 2002 and 2001, gains on securitizations were favorably impacted by declining market interest rates. Gains on securitization transactions are recorded as a component of financial services income and are based on certain assumptions (credit loss, prepayment, and discount rate) which are outlined in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. 25 Operating Expenses (Dollars in Millions) 2002 2001 Increase %Change Motorcycles segment $ 626.7 $ 539.6 $ 87.1 16.1 % Corporate 12.6 12.1 .5 4.7 Total operating expenses $ 639.3 $ 551.7 $ 87.6 15.9 % Total operating expenses in 2002 increased $87.6 million or 15.9% compared to 2001. Operating expenses as a percent of net revenue were 15.6% and 16.2% for 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in operating expenses, which include selling, administrative and engineering expenses, was driven by the Companys ongoing investment in various initiatives designed to support its current and future growth objectives. During 2002, this included expenses associated with the Companys 14 month long 100th Anniversary celebration. Other increases in operating expenses related to higher employee benefit costs driven by the increasing cost of health care and pensions. Other, net Other, net expense was $13.4 million and $6.5 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The most significant components of other, net expense in 2002 were $7.1 million in losses on the disposal of fixed assets, $5.5 million in charitable contributions and $4.8 million in costs associated with environmental matters. Interest Income, net Interest income, net (excluding Financial Services interest income) in 2002 was $16.5 million compared to $17.5 million in 2001. Interest income, net was lower than prior year primarily due to lower interest rates in 2002 when compared to 2001. In connection with the Companys capacity expansion plans, approximately $2.7 million of interest was capitalized during 2002. No interest was capitalized in 2001. Consolidated Income Taxes The Companys effective income tax rate was 34.5% and 35.0% during 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Company expects that the effective tax rate in 2003 will continue to be 34.5%.(1) 26 2001 COMPARED TO 2000 OVERALL Net revenue for 2001 totaled $3.41 billion, a $463.5 million, or 15.7%, increase over 2000. Net income and diluted earnings per share for 2001 were $437.7 million and $1.43, respectively, on 306.2 million weighted average shares. This compares to net income and diluted earnings per share for 2000 of $347.7 million and $1.13, respectively, on 307.5 million weighted average shares. This represents increases in 2001 net income and diluted earnings per share of 25.9% and 26.4%, respectively. Net income in 2000 includes a one time after tax gain of $6.9 million, which resulted from the sale of the Harley Davidson Chrome Visa Card business. Excluding the one time gain from 2000 results, net income and diluted earnings per share for 2001 increased 28.4% and 28.9%, respectively, over 2000. The Company increased its quarterly dividend payment in June 2001 from $.025 per share to $.03 per share, which resulted in an aggregate annual dividend of $.115 per share in 2001. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Motorcycle Unit Shipments 2001 2000 Increase (Decrease) %Change Harley Davidson touring motorcycles 65,403 57,366 8,037 14.1 % Harley Davidson custom motorcycles 118,244 101,013 17,231 17.1 Harley Davidson Sportster motorcycles 50,814 46,213 4,601 10.0 Harley Davidson motorcycle units 234,461 204,592 29,869 14.6 % Buell motorcycle units 9,925 10,189 (264 ) (2.6 ) Total motorcycle units 244,386 214,781 29,605 13.8 % Net Revenue (Dollars in millions) 2001 2000 Increase (Decrease) %Change Harley Davidson motorcycles $ 2,671.3 $ 2,280.9 390.4 17.1 % Buell motorcycles 61.7 58.1 3.6 6.2 Total motorcycles 2,733.0 2,339.0 394.0 16.9 % Motorcycle Parts and Accessories 509.6 450.3 59.3 13.2 General Merchandise 163.9 151.4 12.5 8.2 Other .3 2.6 (2.3 ) n/a Net revenue $ 3,406.8 $ 2,943.3 $ 463.5 15.7 % 27 The Motorcycles segment recorded a 15.7% increase in net revenue driven by a 14.6% increase in Harley Davidson unit shipments. During 2001, the Company shipped 234,461 Harley Davidson motorcycle units, 29,869 more units than in 2000. This increase in units was primarily the result of continued demand for Harley Davidson motorcycles combined with the Companys ongoing success with its manufacturing strategy. In 2001, Buell motorcycle net revenue was up $3.6 million from 2000 on 264 fewer unit shipments. The average selling price per unit was higher in 2001 than in the prior year due to a change in the mix of units sold. In 2001 Buell unit shipments consisted of a lower percentage of the less expensive Buell Blast than in the prior year. The Blast was introduced during the first quarter of 2000 and made up approximately 51% of the total Buell units shipped in 2000 compared to 35% in 2001. During 2001, worldwide retail registrations in the heavyweight (651+cc) motorcycle market grew 7.7%, while worldwide retail registrations for the Companys Harley Davidson motorcycles grew 11.6%, resulting in a worldwide market share (Harley Davidson models only) of 28.0% compared to 27.1% in 2000. The Company ended 2001 with a domestic market share (Harley Davidson models only) of 45.0% compared to 45.6% in 2000 (data provided by the Motorcycle Industry Council). Retail registrations of domestic heavyweight motorcycles for the industry were up 16.0% over 2000, while domestic retail registrations for the Companys Harley Davidson motorcycles increased 14.4%. International net revenue totaled $597.0 million during 2001, an increase of $11.6 million, or 2.0%, over 2000. The Company exported 20.3% of its Harley Davidson motorcycle shipments in 2001 compared to 22.4% during 2000. In order to support the strong demand in the U.S. market, the Company allocated a higher percentage of production to the U.S. market. European market data (provided by Giral S.A.) includes retail registrations in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and United Kingdom. In these European countries, the Company ended 2001 with a 6.7 % share (Harley Davidson models only) of the heavyweight (651+cc) market, down from 6.8% in 2000. Total 2001 retail registrations in these European markets were approximately even with retail registrations in 2000, while European retail registrations for the Companys Harley Davidson motorcycles were down 1.3%. Asia/Pacific data for 2001 (provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics and industry sources) showed the Company with a 20.4% share of the heavyweight (651+cc) market (Harley Davidson models only), up from 19.5% in 2000. In 2001, Asia/Pacific retail registrations for the Companys Harley Davidson motorcycles increased 3.7%, while registrations for the Asia/Pacific market in total decreased 1.0%. During 2001, P&A net revenue totaled $509.6 million, up $59.3 million, or 13.2%, compared to 2000. The increase in P&A revenue was driven by higher motorcycle shipments and was led by strong performance in accessories sales. General Merchandise net revenue for 2001 of $163.9 million was up $12.5 million, or 8.2%, compared to 2000. 28 Gross Profit Gross profit in 2001 of $1.15 billion was $189.2 million or 19.6% higher than gross profit in 2000. The increase in gross profit was primarily related to the increase in net revenue. The gross profit margin was 33.8% in 2001 compared to 32.7% in 2000. The increase in gross profit margin resulted from several factors including a favorable motorcycle product mix, a higher percentage of U.S. shipments and wholesale price increases enacted in 2001. Motorcycle mix was favorable in 2001 with a higher percentage of shipments consisting of custom motorcycles and a slightly lower percentage of shipments consisting of Sportster models, when compared to 2000. In addition, approximately 79.7% of the 2001 Harley Davidson unit shipments were to U.S. dealers compared to 77.6% in 2000. Shipments in the U.S. generally have a higher average selling price per unit than international shipments. Finally, wholesale price increases related to the new model year as well as those enacted earlier in 2001 to offset the impact of weaker currencies in Europe, provided for higher average selling prices on units sold in the second half of 2001 as compared to the prior year. Financial Services (Dollars in Millions) 2001 2000 Increase (Decrease) %Change Interest income $ 76.2 $ 71.4 $ 4.8 6.7 % Gain on current year securitizations 45.0 21.5 23.5 109.2 Servicing fee income 13.3 10.8 2.5 22.6 Insurance commissions 28.7 21.2 7.5 35.6 Other income 18.3 15.2 3.1 20.6 Financial services income 181.5 140.1 41.4 29.6 Interest expense 24.7 30.3 (5.6 ) (18.6 ) Provision for credit losses 22.2 9.9 12.3 123.6 Operating expenses 73.3 62.7 10.6 17.1 Financial services expense 120.2 102.9 17.3 16.8 Operating income from financial services $ 61.3 $ 37.2 $ 24.1 64.8 % In 2001, financial services income was $181.5 million, an increase of $41.4 million, or 29.6%, over 2000. Operating income from financial services in 2001 was $61.3 million, an increase of $24.1 million, or 64.8%, over 2000. The increase in financial services income was driven by strong overall performance in HDFS wholesale, retail, and insurance lines and larger gains recorded in connection with current year securitization transactions. The increase in the retail business was led by the strong acceptance of HDFS consumer financing program which offers lower rates to borrowers with stronger credit ratings. During 2001, the provision for credit losses was higher as the allowance for credit losses was increased in response to significant growth in the wholesale and retail loan portfolios, a decline in economic conditions, and HDFS uncertainty of consumer behavior after the September 11th tragedies. 29 During 2001 and 2000, HDFS sold approximately $988 million and $724 million, respectively, of its retail motorcycle installment loans through securitization transactions. In connection with the securitization transactions, HDFS recorded gains of $45.0 million and $21.5 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The 2001 gain on securitizations was favorably impacted by steadily decreasing market interest rates. Gains on securitization transactions are recorded as a component of financial services income and are based on certain assumptions (credit loss, prepayment, and discount rate) which are outlined in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. Gain on Sale of Credit Card Business In the first quarter of 2000, HDFS sold its Harley Davidson Chrome Visa Card business, which consisted of approximately $142 million of revolving charge receivables. The sale resulted in a pre tax gain of $18.9 million after a $15.0 million write down of goodwill, which related to the portfolio sold. Net of taxes, the transaction resulted in a gain of $6.9 million. The proceeds from the sale were used to reduce finance debt. Operating Expenses (Dollars in Millions) 2001 2000 Increase %Change Motorcycles segment $ 539.6 $ 476.3 $ 63.3 13.3 % Corporate 12.1 9.7 2.4 24.7 Total operating expenses $ 551.7 $ 486.0 $ 65.7 13.6 % Total operating expenses for 2001 increased $65.7 million, or 13.6%, compared to a 15.7% increase in net revenue over 2000. Operating expenses were 16.2% of net revenue in 2001 compared to 16.5% in 2000. Operating expenses, which consist of selling, administrative and engineering expense, grew slower than net revenue. The dollar increase in operating expenses was due to the Companys ongoing investment in various initiatives designed to support the Companys future growth objectives combined with employee benefit costs. Other, net Other, net expense was $6.5 million and $2.9 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The most significant components of other, net expense in 2001 were $2.4 million in losses on the disposal of fixed assets and $6.7 million in charitable contributions. Charitable contributions in 2001 include a $1.0 million contribution to the American Red Cross in connection with the September 11th tragedies. Interest Income, net Interest income, net (excluding financial services interest income) was $17.5 million and $17.6 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Interest income, net was lower than in the prior year primarily due to lower interest rates in 2001, when compared to 2000. Consolidated Income Taxes The Companys effective income tax rate was 35.0% and 36.6% for 2001 and 2000, respectively. The higher tax rate in 2000 was due primarily to the $15 million non deductible write off of goodwill recorded in connection with the first quarter sale of the Harley Davidson Chrome Visa Card business. In addition, the Companys 2001 effective tax rate decreased as a result of various tax minimization programs. 30 Other Matters Critical Accounting Policies The Companys financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies, which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions. Management believes that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of accounting policies that currently affect the Companys financial condition and results of operations. Finance Receivable Securitizations The Company sells retail installment motorcycle loans through securitization transactions utilizing qualifying special purpose entities. Upon sale of retail installment loans in a securitization transaction, HDFS receives cash and retains interest only strip receivables, servicing rights, and cash reserve account deposits, all of which are collectively referred to as retained interests in the securitized receivables. Retained interests are carried at fair value and periodically reviewed for impairment. Market value quotes are generally not available for retained interests, therefore HDFS estimates fair value based on the present value of future expected cash flows using managements best estimates of the key assumptions for credit losses, prepayment speeds and discount rates. The impact of changes to key assumptions is shown in Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Gains on current year securitizations from the sale of retail installment loans are recorded as a component of financial services income and are based in part on certain assumptions including expected credit losses, prepayment speed, and discount rates. Gain on sale also depends in part on the original carrying amount of the retail installment loans, which is allocated between the assets sold and the retained interests based on their relative fair value at the date of transfer. Finance Receivable Credit Losses The allowance for uncollectible accounts is maintained at a level management believes is adequate to cover the losses of principal and accrued interest in the existing finance receivables portfolio. Managements periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is generally based on HDFS past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, current economic conditions, specific borrowers ability to repay, and the estimated value of any underlying collateral. Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits Pension projected benefit obligations and costs are developed from actuarial valuations. The projected benefit obligation represents the actuarial present value of benefits based on service rendered using an assumption as to future compensation levels. The valuation of projected benefit obligations and costs relies on key assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets and future compensation. The Company evaluates and updates these assumptions annually in conjunction with its September 30 actuarial measurement date. During 2002 the Company responded to market conditions by lowering its discount rate assumption from 8.0% to 7.25% and lowering its expected rate of return on plan assets assumption from 10.5% to 8.5%. Based on these assumptions and others, the projected benefit obligation for pension plans was $482.5 million as of September 30, 2002 and the fair value of plan assets was $309.5 million, as of September 30, 2002. During the fourth quarter of 2002 the Company contributed an additional $100.0 million to the plan assets, resulting in total contributions of $153.6 million during 2002. The fair value of plan assets was approximately $418 million as of December 31, 2002. 31 Postretirement obligations and costs are also developed from actuarial valuations and rely on key assumptions including discount rate and medical trend rate. Consistent with its decision to revise the discount rate for pension/SERPA plan obligations the Company also lowered its discount rate assumption for postretierment healthcare benefits from 8.0% to 7.25%. The postretirement obligation was $107.3 million as of September 30, 2002. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of its securitization program, HDFS transfers retail installment loans to a special purpose bankruptcy remote wholly owned subsidiary. The subsidiary sells the retail installment loans to a securitization trust in exchange for the proceeds from asset backed securities issued by the securitization trust. The asset backed securities, usually notes with various maturities and interest rates, are secured by future collections of the purchased retail installment loans. Activities of the securitization trust are limited to acquiring retail installment loans, issuing asset backed securities and making payments on securities to investors. Due to the nature of the assets held by the securitization trust and the limited nature of its activities, the securitization trusts are considered qualifying special purpose entities (QSPEs) in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. In accordance with SFAS No. 140, assets and liabilities of the QSPEs are not consolidated in the financial statements of HDFS. HDFS does not guarantee securities issued by the securitization trusts. Recourse against HDFS related to each securitization transaction is limited to the respective investment in retained securitization interests. Total investment in retained securitization interests at December 31, 2002 is $198.7 million. The securitization trusts have a limited life and generally terminate upon final distribution of amounts owed to the investors in the asset backed securities. See note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of HDFS securitization program. New Accounting Standards In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, (SFAS No. 142) which became effective for the Company January 1, 2002. Under the new standard, goodwill is no longer amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the Statement. During 2002 the Company reviewed its goodwill balances for impairment in accordance with the provisions of the standard. There were no adjustments recorded as a result of the Companys impairment review. The Companys other intangible assets, as defined by SFAS No. 142, are not material to the Companys financial statements. Prior to 2002 goodwill was amortized on a straight line basis over a 15 20 year period. Total goodwill amortization for 2001 and 2000 was $3.5 million and $3.3 million, respectively. In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, (SFAS No. 144), which became effective for the Company January 1, 2002. SFAS No. 144 addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets. The adoption of this standard had no impact on the Companys financial statements. 32 Commitments and Contingencies The Company is subject to lawsuits and other claims related to environmental, product and other matters. In determining required reserves related to these items, the Company carefully analyzes each individual case and considers the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes, as well as the potential range of probable loss. The required reserves are monitored on an on going basis and are updated based on new developments or new information in each matter. In January 2001, the Company, on its own initiative, notified each owner of 1999 and early 2000 model year Harley Davidson motorcycles equipped with Twin Cam 88 and Twin Cam 88B engines that the Company was extending the warranty for a rear cam bearing to 5 years or 50,000 miles. Subsequently, on June 28, 2001, a putative nationwide class action was filed against the Company in state court in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, which was amended by a complaint filed September 28, 2001. The legal proceedings are discussed in detail in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. Harley Davidson believes that the 5 year/50,000 mile warranty extension it announced in January 2001 adequately addresses the condition for affected owners. The Company intends to continue to vigorously defend this matter. The Companys policy is to comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations, and the Company has a compliance program in place to monitor and report on environmental issues. In 1995, the Company entered into an agreement with the U.S. Navy regarding soil and groundwater remediation at the Companys manufacturing facility in York, Pennsylvania and is conducting investigation and remediation activities at the York facility. The York facility was formerly used by the Navy. The agreement with the Navy provides for the Navy and the Company to contribute to a trust equal to 53% and 47%, respectively, of future costs associated with environmental investigation and remediation activities at the York facility(Response Costs). In February 2002, the Company was advised by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that it considers some of the Companys remediation activities at the York facility to be subject to the EPAs corrective action programs and offered the Company the option of addressing corrective action under a facility lead agreement. The Company currently estimates that its share of future Response Costs at the York facility will be $8.5 million related to all remediation efforts at the York facility.(1) The Company has established reserves for this amount. The Companys estimate of future Response Costs it will incur is based on reports of independent environmental consultants retained by the Company, the actual costs incurred to date and the estimated costs to complete the necessary investigation and remediation activities. Response Costs are expected to be incurred over a period of several years, ending in 2010. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Recurring costs associated with managing hazardous substances and pollution in on going operations have not been material. The Company regularly invests in equipment to support and improve its various manufacturing processes. While the Company considers environmental matters in capital expenditure decisions, and while some capital expenditures also act to improve environmental compliance, only a small portion of the Companys annual capital expenditures relate to equipment that has the sole purpose of meeting environmental compliance obligations. 33 Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companys main source of liquidity is cash from operating activities which consists of net income adjusted for non cash operating activities, pension plan contributions and changes in other current assets and liabilities including accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid expenses and accounts payable/accrued expenses. The Company generated $779.5 million of cash from operating activities during 2002 compared to $756.8 million in 2001. Operating cash flows during 2002 include the impact of a $153.6 million contribution to the Companys pension plans, compared to a $19.3 million contribution during 2001. Changes in other current assets and liabilities increased operating cash flows by approximately $53.8 million and $77.8 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Changes in working capital during 2002 and 2001 consisted of the following (in thousands): 2002 2001 Accounts receivable $ 10,149 $ (20,532 ) Inventories (37,041 ) 10,816 Prepaid expenses & other assets (13,268 ) (5,221 ) Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 93,987 92,698 $ 53,827 $ 77,761 The 2002 change in accounts receivable of $10.1 million includes the impact of lower accounts receivable balances related to dealers in Europe partially offset by higher accounts receivable balances related to the Companys other international markets. Prior to August 2002, HDFS offered wholesale financing to the Companys European motorcycle dealers through a joint venture with Transamerica Distribution Finance. In August 2002, HDFS terminated the joint venture relationship and began directly servicing the wholesale financing needs of many of the Companys European dealers. In connection with this change, HDFS purchased approximately $38.8 million of European accounts receivable from the Motorcycles segment in the third quarter of 2002 and continued to originate new European receivables during the remainder of 2002. The change in inventory during 2002 was driven by an increase in finished goods motorcycle inventory. Finished goods motorcycle inventory, at the end of 2002, included a higher level of goods in transit due to the timing of inventory transfers from the Companys U.S. manufacturing facilities to its international subsidiaries. Inventory was also impacted by an increase in General Merchandise inventory at the end of 2002. The increase in General Merchandise related primarily to the Companys inventory of commemorative 100th Anniversary products which were stocked to support anticipated demand for these products in 2003. To achieve a higher return on its cash balances the Company invested $318.2 million and $196.0 million in marketable securities during 2002 and 2001 respectively. The marketable securities consist primarily of investment grade debt instruments such as corporate bonds and government backed securities with maturities greater than three months. 34 Capital expenditures were $323.9 million and $290.4 million during 2002 and 2001, respectively. During 2002, the Company continued work on its capacity expansion efforts at several of the Companys existing facilities. These efforts include a 350,000 square foot expansion at the Companys York, Pennsylvania assembly facility; a 60,000 square foot expansion at the Companys Tomahawk, Wisconsin facility; and a 165,000 square foot addition to the Companys Product Development Center in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin. The Company completed the Tomahawk expansion in the second quarter of 2002, but will continue to invest capital related to the remaining projects during 2003. The Company estimates that total capital expenditures required in 2003 will be in the range of $270 to $300 million.(1) The Company anticipates it will have the ability to fund all capital expenditures in 2003 with internally generated funds.(1) The Company (excluding HDFS) currently has nominal levels of long term debt and has available lines of credit of approximately $51.9 million, of which approximately $31.9 million remained available at December 31, 2002. HDFS is financed by operating cash flow, asset backed securitizations, the issuance of commercial paper, borrowings under revolving credit facilities, senior subordinated debt and borrowings from the Company. During 2002 the Company sold $1.3 billion of retail motorcycle installment loans through securitization transactions. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, HDFS outstanding debt consisted of the following (in thousands): 2002 2001 Commercial paper $ 592,932 $ 499,998 Domestic revolving credit facilities 66,546 67,053 European revolving credit facility 73,101 Senior subordinated notes 30,000 30,000 Total finance debt $ 762,579 $ 597,051 Intercompany borrowings from the Company $ 100,000 $ Subject to limitations, HDFS may issue up to $750 million of short term commercial paper with maturities up to 270 days. Outstanding commercial paper may not exceed the unused portion of the Domestic Credit Facilities noted below. As a result, the combined total of commercial paper and borrowings under the Domestic Credit Facilities was limited to $750 million as of December 31, 2002. HDFS has agreements with financial institutions providing bank credit facilities totaling $750 million (Domestic Credit Facilities). The Domestic Credit Facilities consist of a $350 million revolving term facility due in 2005 and a $400 million 364 day revolving credit facility due September 2003. The Company expects the $400 million credit facility expiring in September 2003 will be renewed or that suitable alternatives exist.(1) The primary uses of the Domestic Credit Facilities are to provide liquidity to the unsecured commercial paper program and to fund HDFS business operations. During July 2002, HDFS entered into a $200 million European revolving credit facility due July 2005. The primary purpose of the facility is to fund HDFS European business operations. In addition HDFS has $30 million of ten year senior subordinated notes, expiring in 2007. 35 In connection with debt agreements, HDFS has various operating and financial covenants and remains in compliance at December 31, 2002. The Company has a support agreement with HDFS whereby, if required, the Company agrees to provide HDFS with certain financial support in order to maintain certain financial covenants. Support may be provided at the Companys option as capital contributions or loans. Accordingly, certain debt covenants may restrict the Companys ability to withdraw funds from HDFS outside the normal course of business. No amount was provided to HDFS under the support agreement as of December 31, 2002 or 2001. HDFS has a revolving credit line with the Company whereby HDFS may borrow up to $210 million at market rates of interest. As of December 31, 2002, HDFS had $100 million in outstanding borrowings to the Company under this agreement. The $100 million loan was eliminated upon consolidation and therefore is not included in finance debt on the consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2002, outstanding wholesale loans to customers were $707.9 million. Unused lines of credit extended to HDFS wholesale finance customers totaled $314 million. Approved but unfunded retail finance loans totaled $237 million at December 31, 2002. The Company expects future activities of HDFS will be financed from internally generated funds at HDFS, advances or loans from the Company, borrowings under revolving credit facilities, issuance of commercial paper, sales of loans through securitization programs, and subordinated debt.(1) The Company has remaining authorization from its Board of Directors to repurchase up to 9,400,000 shares of the Companys outstanding common stock. In addition, the Company has continuing authorization from its Board of Directors to repurchase shares of the Companys outstanding common stock under which the cumulative number of shares repurchased, at the time of any repurchase, shall not exceed the sum of (i) the number of shares issued in connection with the exercise of stock options occurring on or after January 1, 1998 plus (ii) one percent of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company on January 1 of the current year, adjusted for any stock split. The Company repurchased 1,089,000 and 2,438,500 shares of its common stock during 2002 and 2001, respectively, under this latter authorization. 36 Risk Factors The Companys ability to meet the targets and expectations noted in this Form 10 K depends upon, among other factors, the Companys ability to (i) continue to realize production efficiencies at its production facilities through the implementation of innovative manufacturing techniques and other means, (ii) successfully implement production capacity increases in its facilities, (iii) successfully introduce new products and services, (iv) avoid unexpected P&A/general merchandise supplier backorders, (v) sell all of the Harley Davidson motorcycles it plans to produce, (vi) continue to develop the capacity of its distributor and dealer network, (vii) avoid unexpected changes in the regulatory environment for its products, (viii) successfully adjust to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, (ix) successfully adjust to interest rate fluctuations, and (x) successfully manage changes in the credit quality of HDFSs loan portfolio. In addition, the Company could experience delays in the operation of manufacturing facilities as a result of work stoppages, difficulty with suppliers, natural causes, terrorism or other factors. These risks, potential delays and uncertainties regarding the costs could also adversely impact the Companys capital expenditure estimates (see Liquidity and Capital Resources section). 37 Item 7a. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. To reduce such risks, the Company selectively uses derivative financial instruments. All hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to regularly reviewed policies and procedures, which prohibit the use of financial instruments for trading purposes. Sensitivity analysis is used to manage and monitor foreign exchange and interest rate risk. A discussion of the Companys accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, and further disclosure relating to the fair value of derivative financial instruments is included in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. The Company sells its products internationally and in certain markets denominates those sales in the local currency of the foreign country. The Companys most significant foreign denominated sales are in the Euro. As a result, the Companys earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies. The Company utilizes foreign currency contracts to mitigate the effect of these fluctuations on earnings. At December 31, 2002 these contracts represented a combined U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately $147.3 million. A uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currency underlying these contracts would have resulted in a decrease in the fair market value of the contracts of approximately $16.2 million at December 31, 2002. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, the contracts are designated as cash flow hedges, and gains and losses that result from changes in the fair value are initially recorded in other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the original sales transaction affects income. The Companys exposure to the Japanese yen is substantially offset by the existence of a natural hedge, which is sustained through offsetting yen cash inflows from sales with yen cash outflows for motorcycle component purchases and other operating expenses. HDFS earnings are affected by changes in interest rates as a result of securitization transactions, borrowings under bank credit facilities and the issuance of commercial paper. HDFS utilizes interest rate swaps to reduce the impact of fluctuations in interest rates. As of December 31, 2002, HDFS had interest rate swaps outstanding with a notional value of $241.3 million. HDFS estimates that a 10% increase in interest rates would result in a $1.0 million increase in the fair value of the agreements. In accordance with SFAS 133, the agreements, which were highly effective as of December 31, 2002, are designated as cash flow hedges, and gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are initially recorded as other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affects income. 38 (1) Note regarding forward looking statements The Company intends that certain matters discussed are forward looking statements intended to qualify for the safe harbors from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
