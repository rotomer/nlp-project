Item 7. Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Harley Davidson, Inc. is the parent company for the group of companies doing business as Harley Davidson Motor Company, Buell Motorcycle Company and Harley Davidson Financial Services. Harley Davidson Motor Company produces heavyweight motorcycles and offers a complete line of motorcycle parts, accessories, apparel and general merchandise. Harley Davidson Motor Company manufactures five families of motorcycles: Touring, Dyna Glide, Softail, VRSC and Sportster. Buell Motorcycle Company produces sport motorcycles, including four big twin XB models and the single cylinder Buell Blast. Buell also offers a line of motorcycle parts, accessories, apparel and general merchandise. Harley Davidson Financial Services provides wholesale and retail financing and insurance programs primarily to Harley Davidson/Buell dealers and customers. Overview The Companys eighteen years of record revenues and earnings since its initial public stock offering in 1986 are the result of a combination of factors. These include the ability to deliver new products to market, attract new customers, retain existing ones and expand capacity in a responsible way. Unique marketplace events have also created special growth opportunities for Harley Davidson. Based on long term historical trend analysis, the Company believes that demand for Harley Davidson motorcycles grows at an average core rate of 7% to 9% per year. However, in most of the 18 years since 1986, the Companys growth has exceeded this core rate. The Company believes that its higher growth rate was driven by increasing market share, the stock market bubble and its associated wealth effect of the mid and late 1990s, and more recently, the excitement leading up to Harley Davidsons 100th Anniversary. The Companys growth since 1986 required several factory expansions, which provided the opportunity to thoroughly modernize and improve productivity, quality and manufacturing margins. In 2004 and beyond the Company believes its Harley Davidson motorcycle unit growth rate will return to a more normal 7% to 9%.(1) As such, the Company has set a wholesale shipment target for Harley Davidson motorcycles of 317,000 units in 2004 and has established a longer term goal to ship 400,000 Harley Davidson units in 2007.(1) These shipping goals represent annual increases in Harley Davidson motorcycle units that range from 7% to 9%. The Company believes that by continuing to offer innovative products and services, and by driving productivity gains in all facets of the business that it will achieve earnings growth rates in the mid teens for the foreseeable future.(1) 23 The % Change figures included in the Results of Operations section have been calculated using unrounded dollar amounts and may differ from calculations using the rounded dollar amounts presented. Results of Operations 2003 Compared to 2002 Overall The Companys net revenue for 2003 totaled $4.62 billion, a $533.3 million, or 13.0%, increase over 2002. Net income for 2003 was $760.9 million compared to $580.2 million in 2002, an increase of 31.1%. Diluted earnings per share for 2003 was $2.50 on 304.5 million weighted average shares outstanding compared to $1.90 on 305.2 million weighted average shares outstanding in 2002, an increase of 31.6% in earnings per share. The Company increased its quarterly dividend payment in June 2003 from $.035 per share to $.04 per share and again in December to $.08 per share which resulted in an aggregate annual dividend of $.195 per share in 2003. Worldwide Motorcycle Unit Shipments 2003 2002 Increase % Change Touring motorcycle units 82,577 70,713 11,864 16.8 Custom motorcycle units* 135,954 123,761 12,193 9.9 VRSC motorcycle units 15,451 18,008 (2,557 ) (14.2 ) Sportster motorcycle units 57,165 51,171 5,994 11.7 Harley Davidson motorcycle units 291,147 263,653 27,494 10.4 Buell motorcycle units 9,974 10,943 (969 ) (8.9 ) Total motorcycle units 301,121 274,596 26,525 9.7 % *Custom motorcycle units, as used in this table, includes Softail, Dyna Glide and other custom models. During 2003, the Company shipped 291,147 Harley Davidson motorcycle units, 27,494 more units than in 2002. This increase in units was driven by demand for the Companys 100th Anniversary models and its new 2004 model year motorcycles. Shipments during the first eight months of 2003 consisted of the Companys 100th Anniversary models as the Company completed its fourteen month 100th Anniversary model year. In September 2003, the Company introduced its new 2004 model year motorcycles, including the completely redesigned family of Sportster motorcycles. The Companys increase in motorcycle shipments was supported by a manufacturing strategy, which is designed to increase capacity, improve product quality, reduce costs and increase flexibility to respond to changes in the marketplace. During 2003, this included the successful launch of a new factory in York, Pennsylvania for the production of Softail motorcycles. 24 The Companys wholesale motorcycle unit shipments are distributed through an independent worldwide dealer network. During 2003, growth in retail sales of the Companys Harley Davidson motorcycles outpaced the heavyweight motorcycle (651+cc) industry in the U.S., Europe and Japan/Australia. Retail sales of the Companys Harley Davidson motorcycles were up 8.8% in the United States for 2003. In Europe and Japan/Australia, retail sales of the Companys Harley Davidson motorcycles were up 11.8% and 11.7%, respectively, during 2003. Retail sales information for the United States, Europe and Japan/Australia is as follows (units in thousands): 2003 2002 % Change United States (a) Harley Davidson models only 228.4 209.9 8.8 % Industry 461.2 442.3 4.3 % Europe (b) Harley Davidson models only 26.3 23.5 11.8 % Industry 323.1 331.8 (2.6 )% Japan/Australia (c) Harley Davidson models only 15.2 13.6 11.7 % Industry 58.9 63.9 (7.7 )% (a) U.S. data provided by the Motorcycle Industry Council.

Net Revenue (Dollars in Millions) 2003 2002 Increase (Decrease) % Change Harley Davidson motorcycles $ 3,621.5 $ 3,161.0 $ 460.5 14.6 % Buell motorcycles 76.1 66.9 9.2 13.6 Total motorcycles 3,697.6 3,227.9 469.7 14.6 Parts & Accessories 712.8 629.2 83.6 13.3 General Merchandise 211.4 231.5 (20.1 ) (8.7 ) Other 2.5 2.4 0.1 n.m. Net revenue $ 4,624.3 $ 4,091.0 $ 533.3 13.0 % The 13.0% increase in net revenue for the Motorcycles segment during 2003 was led by a $460.5 million, or 14.6%, increase in Harley Davidson motorcycle net revenue. Harley Davidson motorcycle revenue was driven by the 10.4% increase in Harley Davidson motorcycle unit shipments, but also benefited from wholesale price increases, a slightly favorable product mix and favorable foreign currency exchange rates during 2003. Wholesale price increases for the 100th Anniversary models provided for higher average selling prices on units sold during the first half of 2003 when compared to the same period in 2002. As a result of the extended 100th Anniversary model year, wholesale shipments of 100th Anniversary models, carrying the same pricing, occurred in the third quarters of both 2003 and 2002. Finally, revenue in the fourth quarter of 2003 was only slightly impacted by the lower wholesale prices associated with the 2004 model year motorcycles. Wholesale prices on the 2004 models reflect the elimination of 100th Anniversary special edition features and as a result are slightly lower than the wholesale prices for the 100th Anniversary models. 25 During 2003 the Company experienced product mix changes both within and between its motorcycle families. Changes in product mix within the Companys motorcycle families generally resulted in higher revenue during 2003 when compared to 2002. The net result of mix changes between motorcycle families did not have a significant net impact on Harley Davidson motorcycle revenue in 2003. Finally, foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable effect on revenue of approximately $60 million in 2003, primarily as a result of stronger foreign currencies in Europe and Japan, when compared to 2002. During 2003, Buell motorcycle net revenue was up $9.2 million, compared to 2002, on 969 fewer unit shipments. The average selling price per unit was higher in 2003 than in the prior year due to a change in the mix of units sold. Buell shipments in 2003 included a higher percentage of the more expensive XB models when compared to 2002. Buell shipments in 2003 consisted of 8,784 XB models and 1,190 Blast models compared to 6,887 XB models and 4,056 Blast models in 2002. During 2003, net revenue from Parts and Accessories (P&A) totaled $712.8 million, a 13.3% increase over 2002. The 2003 increase in P&A revenue was driven primarily by higher motorcycle shipments. P&A revenue was positively impacted in 2003 and 2002 by sales of 100th Anniversary P&A products. Total P&A revenue for 2003 included $32.1 million from sales of 100th Anniversary P&A products compared to $34.0 million last year. Excluding the impact of 100th Anniversary revenue from both 2003 and 2002 the P&A revenue growth rate for 2003 is 14.4%. On a longer term basis the Company expects that the growth rate for P&A revenue will be slightly higher than the growth rate for Harley Davidson motorcycle units.(1) General Merchandise revenue during 2003, was $211.4 million, down 8.7% from the same period last year. Sales from 100th Anniversary General Merchandise products accounted for $9.3 million of total General Merchandise revenue during 2003 compared to $52.2 million during 2002. Sales of 100th Anniversary General Merchandise were more heavily concentrated in 2002 in order to prepare the Companys independent dealers for the fourteen month long 100th Anniversary celebration. Excluding the revenue from the sale of 100th Anniversary products from both 2003 and 2002 the General Merchandise revenue growth rate for 2003 is 12.7%. The Company expects that the long term growth rate for General Merchandise will be lower than the growth rate for Harley Davidson motorcycle units. (1) Gross Profit Gross profit in 2003 of $1.7 billion was $247.7 million or 17.5% higher than gross profit in 2002. The increase in gross profit is primarily related to the increase in net revenue. The gross profit margin was 36.0% in 2003 compared to 34.7% in 2002. The increase in gross margin in 2003 was driven by wholesale price increases on 2003 models, favorable motorcycle product mix and foreign currency exchange rates. Gross profit was higher in 2003 when compared to 2002 by approximately $38 million from foreign currency exchange rate changes to both revenue and costs. 26 Financial Services (In Millions) 2003 2002 Increase (Decrease) % Change Interest income $ 87.1 $ 76.1 $ 11.0 14.4 % Gain on current year securitizations 82.2 56.1 26.1 46.5 Servicing fee income 24.3 18.6 5.7 30.9 Insurance commissions 44.9 36.1 8.8 24.4 Income on investment in retained securitization interests 32.2 18.8 13.4 71.4 Other income 8.8 5.8 3.0 50.4 Financial services income 279.5 211.5 68.0 32.1 Interest expense 17.6 15.1 2.5 16.4 Provision for credit losses 4.1 6.2 (2.1 ) (33.9 ) Operating expenses 89.9 86.0 3.9 4.6 Financial services expense 111.6 107.3 4.3 4.0 Operating income from financial services $ 167.9 $ 104.2 $ 63.7 61.1 % Financial services income in 2003 was $279.5 million, an increase of $68.0 million over 2002. Operating income from financial services in 2003 was $167.9 million, an increase of $63.7 million over 2002. The increase in operating income in 2003 was driven by continued strong marketplace acceptance of HDFS finance and insurance products as well as increased securitization related income. During 2003, HDFS sold $1.7 billion of retail motorcycle loans through securitization transactions resulting in gains of $82.2 million. During 2002, HDFS sold approximately $1.3 billion of retail motorcycle loans resulting in gains of $56.1 million. The net gain as a percentage of the amount of loans securitized increased from 4.39% in 2002 to 4.70% in 2003 as HDFS continued to benefit from a favorable interest rate environment. Gains on securitization transactions are based on certain assumptions (credit loss, prepayment, and discount rate) which are outlined in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. During 2003, income on investment in retained securitization interests increased $13.4 million over 2002 as the portfolios continued to perform better than anticipated. Changes in HDFS allowance for credit losses during 2003 and 2002 were as follows (in millions): 2003 2002 Balance, beginning of period $ 31.0 $ 28.7 Provision for credit losses 4.1 6.2 Charge offs (3.8 ) (3.9 ) Balance, end of period $ 31.3 $ 31.0 HDFS periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is generally based on HDFS past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, and current economic conditions. HDFS believes the allowance is adequate to cover the losses of principal and accrued interest in the existing portfolio. 27 Operating Expenses (Dollars in Millions) 2003 2002 Increase % Change Motorcycles and Related Products $ 668.7 $ 626.7 $ 42.0 6.7 % Corporate 15.5 12.6 2.9 22.6 Total operating expenses $ 684.2 $ 639.3 $ 44.9 7.0 % Total operating expenses during 2003 increased $44.9 million or 7.0% compared to last year. Operating expenses as a percent of net revenue were 14.8% and 15.6% for 2003 and 2002, respectively. Operating expenses, which include selling, administrative and engineering expenses, increased in connection with the Companys ongoing investment in initiatives designed to support its current and future growth objectives. However, the increase in 2003 was partially offset by lower net expenditures related to the Companys 100th Anniversary celebration as compared to 2002. The Company began its fourteen month long 100th Anniversary celebration during the third quarter of 2002 and net expenses associated with the celebration were most heavily concentrated in 2002. Comparatively, costs incurred during 2003 for the 100th Anniversary celebration were mostly offset by event proceeds and sponsorships. Other, net Other net expense was $6.3 million and $13.4 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The most significant component of other, net expense in 2003 was $4.5 million in charitable contributions. During 2002, the most significant components of other net expense were $7.1 million in losses on the disposal of fixed assets, $5.5 million in charitable contributions and $4.8 million in costs associated with environmental matters. Interest Income, net Net interest income (excluding Financial Services interest income) in 2003 was $23.1 million compared to $16.5 million in 2002. The increase in net interest income resulted from higher average balances of cash and marketable securities during 2003 when compared to 2002. In connection with the Companys capacity expansion efforts, $3.9 million of interest cost was capitalized during 2003 compared to $2.7 million during 2002. Consolidated Income Taxes The Companys effective income tax rate was 34.7% and 34.5% during 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Companys effective income tax rate increased during 2003 as pre tax income grew faster than certain permanent tax differences. The Company expects that the income tax rate will be 35.5% during 2004.(1) 28 Results of Operations 2002 Compared to 2001 Overall The Companys net revenue for 2002 totaled $4.09 billion, a $684.2 million, or 20.1%, increase over 2001. Net income for 2002 was $580.2 million compared to $437.7 million in 2001, an increase of 32.5%. Diluted earnings per share for 2002 was $1.90 on 305.2 million weighted average shares outstanding compared to $1.43 on 306.2 million weighted average shares outstanding in 2001, an increase of 32.9% in earnings per share. The Company increased its quarterly dividend payment in June 2002 from $.03 per share to $.035 per share which resulted in an aggregate annual dividend of $.135 per share in 2002.

This increase in units is primarily the result of continued demand for Harley Davidson motorcycles combined with the Companys ongoing success with its manufacturing strategy. The VRSC V Rod motorcycle was first introduced in October 2001, making 2002 the first full year of shipments for that family of motorcycles. 29 Retail sales of the Companys Harley Davidson motorcycles were up 18.3% in the United States for 2002. In Europe and Japan/Australia, retail sales of the Companys Harley Davidson motorcycles were up 3.4% and 7.4%, respectively, during 2002.

Net revenue $ 4,091.0 $ 3,406.8 $ 684.2 20.1 % The Motorcycles segment recorded a 20.1% increase in net revenue driven by the 12.5% increase in Harley Davidson unit shipments. In addition to higher unit volumes, the increase in revenue in 2002 was also driven by favorable product mix and the model year wholesale price increase. Motorcycle product mix was favorable in 2002 with a higher percentage of shipments consisting of custom motorcycles and a smaller percentage of shipments consisting of lower priced Sportster models, when compared to 2001. In addition, wholesale price increases related to the new model year provided for higher average selling prices on units sold in 2002 when compared to 2001. 30 In 2002, Buell motorcycle net revenue was up $5.2 million from 2001 on 1,018 additional unit shipments. During 2002, the Company shipped 6,887 Buell Big Twin units compared to 6,436 units in 2001. During 2002 Buell completely revamped its Big Twin line up with the introduction of the XB series which currently includes the new Buell Firebolt XB9R and the new Buell Lightning XB9S. During 2002 the Company also shipped 4,056 units of the smaller and lower priced Buell Blast compared to 3,489 units in 2001. Blast motorcycle units represented 37% of total Buell units shipped in 2002 compared to 35% in 2001. During 2002, P&A net revenue totaled $629.2 million, up $119.6 million, or 23.5%, compared to 2001. The increase in P&A revenue was driven by continued demand for Harley Davidson motorcycles and sales of the Companys 100th Anniversary products. Total 2002 revenue from the sale of 100th Anniversary P&A products was $34.0 million. General Merchandise net revenue for 2002 of $231.5 million was up $67.6 million, or 41.2%, compared to 2001. The increase in General Merchandise revenue was driven primarily by sales of 100th Anniversary commemorative products which totaled approximately $52.2 million in 2002. Gross Profit Gross profit in 2002 of $1.4 billion was $264.9 million or 23.0% higher than gross profit in 2001. The increase in gross profit is primarily related to the increase in net revenue. The gross profit margin was 34.7% in 2002 compared to 33.8% in 2001. The increase in gross margin in 2002 was driven by favorable product mix and the model year wholesale price increase as discussed under Net Revenue earlier in this section. 31 Financial Services (In Millions) 2002 2001 Increase (Decrease) % Change Interest income $ 76.1 $ 76.2 $ (0.1 ) (0.2 )% Gain on current year securitizations 56.1 45.0 11.1 24.7 Servicing fee income 18.6 13.3 5.3 39.8 Insurance commissions 36.1 28.7 7.4 25.4 Income on investment in retained securitization interests 18.8 14.6 4.2 29.0 Other income 5.8 3.7 2.1 58.1 Financial services income 211.5 181.5 30.0 16.5 Interest expense 15.1 24.7 (9.6 ) (38.7 ) Provision for credit losses 6.2 22.2 (16.0 ) (72.2 ) Operating expenses 86.0 73.3 12.7 17.1 Financial services expense 107.3 120.2 (12.9 ) (10.8 ) Operating income from financial services $ 104.2 $ 61.3 $ 42.9 70.1 % Financial services income in 2002 was $211.5 million, an increase of $30.0 million, or 16.5%, over 2001. Operating income from financial services in 2002 was $104.2 million, an increase of $42.9 million, or 70.1%, over 2001. The increase in operating income was driven by strong overall performance in Harley Davidson Financial Services, Inc.s (HDFS) wholesale, retail, and insurance lines combined with a lower provision for credit losses, lower borrowing costs, and higher securitization gains. During 2001, the allowance for credit losses was increased in response to significant growth in the wholesale and retail loan portfolios, a decline in economic conditions, and HDFS uncertainty of consumer behavior after the September 11th tragedies. During 2002, the required provision for credit losses decreased as portfolio performance was better than expected. The Company believes that the allowance for credit losses is adequate at December 31, 2002. During 2002 and 2001, HDFS sold approximately $1.3 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, of retail motorcycle loans through securitization transactions. In connection with the securitization transactions, HDFS recorded gains of $56.1 million and $45.0 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. In both 2002 and 2001, gains on securitizations were favorably impacted by declining market interest rates. 32 Operating Expenses (Dollars in Millions) 2002 2001 Increase % Change Motorcycles and Related Products $ 626.7 $ 539.6 $ 87.1 16.1 % Corporate 12.6 12.1 .5 4.7 Total operating expenses $ 639.3 $ 551.7 $ 87.6 15.9 % Total operating expenses in 2002 increased $87.6 million or 15.9% compared to 2001. Operating expenses as a percent of net revenue were 15.6% and 16.2% for 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in operating expenses, which include selling, administrative and engineering expenses, was driven by the Companys ongoing investment in various initiatives designed to support its current and future growth objectives. During 2002, this included expenses associated with the Companys fourteen month long 100th Anniversary celebration. Other increases in operating expenses related to higher employee benefit costs driven by the increasing cost of health care and pensions. Other, net Other net expense was $13.4 million and $6.5 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The most significant components of other net expense in 2002 were $7.1 million in losses on the disposal of fixed assets, $5.5 million in charitable contributions and $4.8 million in costs associated with environmental matters. Interest Income, net Net interest income (excluding Financial Services interest income) in 2002 was $16.5 million compared to $17.5 million in 2001. Net interest income was lower than prior year primarily due to lower interest rates in 2002 when compared to 2001. In connection with the Companys capacity expansion plans, approximately $2.7 million of interest was capitalized during 2002. No interest was capitalized in 2001. Consolidated Income Taxes The Companys effective income tax rate was 34.5% and 35.0% during 2002 and 2001, respectively. 33 Other Matters Critical Accounting Policies The Companys financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies, which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions. Management believes that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of accounting policies that currently affect the Companys financial condition and results of operations. Finance Receivable Securitizations The Company sells retail motorcycle loans through securitization transactions utilizing qualifying special purpose entities. Upon sale of retail loans in a securitization transaction, HDFS receives cash and retains interest only strip receivables, servicing rights, and cash reserve account deposits, all of which are collectively referred to as retained interests in the securitized receivables. Retained interests are carried at fair value and periodically reviewed for impairment. Market value quotes are generally not available for retained interests, therefore HDFS estimates fair value based on the present value of future expected cash flows using managements best estimates of the key assumptions for credit losses, prepayment speeds and discount rates. The impact of changes to key assumptions is shown in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Gains on current year securitizations from the sale of retail loans are recorded as a component of financial services income and are based in part on certain assumptions including expected credit losses, prepayment speed, and discount rates. Gain on sale also depends on the original carrying amount of the retail loans, which is allocated between the assets sold and the retained interests based on their relative fair value at the date of transfer. Finance Receivable Credit Losses The allowance for uncollectible accounts is maintained at a level management believes is adequate to cover the losses of principal and accrued interest in the existing finance receivables portfolio. Managements periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is generally based on HDFS past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, current economic conditions, specific borrowers ability to repay, and the estimated value of any underlying collateral. 34 Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits Retirement Plan (Pension, SERPA and Post retirement health care) obligations and costs are developed from actuarial valuations. The valuation of projected benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs relies on key assumptions including discount rates, long term expected return on plan assets, future compensation and medical trend rates. The Company evaluates and updates all of its assumptions annually in conjunction with its September 30 actuarial measurement date. Although the Companys process results in assumptions that are valid as of the measurement date, certain assumptions are driven by short term external economic factors, and as result, these assumptions are more volatile. Based on recent economic conditions the Company has changed its assumptions for discount rates and medical trend rates. Although the Companys 2004 Retirement Plan costs have already been determined in connection with the September 30, 2003 measurement process a change in either of these two assumptions could have a material impact on the valuation of costs as of the Companys next measurement date. The following information is provided to illustrate the sensitivity of these obligations and costs to changes in these major assumptions (in thousands). Amounts based on Current Assumptions Impact of a 1% decrease in the Discount Rate Impact of a 1% increase in the Medical Trend Rate 2003 Net periodic benefit costs Pension and SERPA $ 54,468 $ 14,214 n/a Postretirement healthcare $ 30,449 $ 3,675 $ 3,719 2003 Projected benefit obligations Pension and SERPA $ 711,357 $ 119,165 n/a Postretirement healthcare $ 250,863 $ 35,685 $ 27,271 This information is provided only to illustrate the sensitivity of these amounts to certain assumptions and not as a means to predict future amounts. The calculation of Retirement plan obligations and costs is based on many factors in addition to those discussed here. This information should be considered in combination with the information provided in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. Contractual Obligations A summary of the Companys expected payments for significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2003 is as follows (in thousands): 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Total Finance Debt $ 324,305 $ 241,114 $ 428,886 $ $ 994,305 Operating Leases 6,155 7,892 5,841 17,283 37,171 $ 330,460 $ 249,006 $ 434,727 $ 17,283 $ 1,031,476 As of December 31, 2003, the Company had no material purchase obligations other than those created in the ordinary course of business related to inventory and property, plant and equipment which generally have terms of less than 90 days. The Company also has long term obligations related to its pension and postretirement plans which are discussed in detail in Note 6 to the financial statements. As of its most recent actuarial measurement date, no pension plan contributions are required in 2004 and postretirement medical claims are paid as they are submitted. 35 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of its securitization program, HDFS transfers retail motorcycle loans to a special purpose bankruptcy remote wholly owned subsidiary. The subsidiary sells the retail loans to a securitization trust in exchange for the proceeds from asset backed securities issued by the securitization trust. The asset backed securities, usually notes with various maturities and interest rates, are secured by future collections of the purchased retail installment loans. Activities of the securitization trust are limited to acquiring retail loans, issuing asset backed securities and making payments on securities to investors. Due to the nature of the assets held by the securitization trust and the limited nature of its activities, the securitization trusts are considered qualifying special purpose entities (QSPEs) as defined by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. In accordance with SFAS No. 140, assets and liabilities of the QSPEs are not consolidated in the financial statements of HDFS. HDFS does not guarantee securities issued by the securitization trusts or projected cash flows from the related loans purchased from HDFS. Recourse against HDFS related to each securitization transaction is limited to the respective investment in retained securitization interests, excluding servicing rights. Total investment in retained securitization interests at December 31, 2003 is $254.4 million. The securitization trusts have a limited life and generally terminate upon final distribution of amounts owed to the investors in the asset backed securities. See note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of HDFS securitization program. Commitments and Contingencies The Company is subject to lawsuits and other claims related to environmental, product and other matters. In determining required reserves related to these items, the Company carefully analyzes cases and considers the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes, as well as the potential range of probable loss. The required reserves are monitored on an on going basis and are updated based on new developments or new information in each matter. In January 2001, the Company, on its own initiative, notified each owner of 1999 and early 2000 model year Harley Davidson motorcycles equipped with Twin Cam 88 and Twin Cam 88B engines that the Company was extending the warranty for a rear cam bearing to 5 years or 50,000 miles. Subsequently, on June 28, 2001, a putative nationwide class action was filed against the Company in state court in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, which was amended by a complaint filed September 28, 2001. The complaint alleged that this cam bearing is defective and asserted various legal theories. The complaint sought unspecified compensatory and punitive damages for affected owners, an order compelling the Company to repair the engines, and other relief. On February 27, 2002, the Companys motion to dismiss the amended complaint was granted by the Court and the amended complaint was dismissed in its entirety. An appeal was filed with the Wisconsin Court of Appeals. On April 12, 2002, the same attorneys filed a second putative nationwide class action against the Company in state court in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin relating to this cam bearing issue and asserting different legal theories than in the first action. The complaint sought unspecified compensatory damages, an order compelling the Company to repair the engines and other relief. On September 23, 2002, the Companys motion to dismiss was granted by the Court, the complaint was dismissed in its entirety, and no appeal was taken. On January 14, 2003, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals reversed the trial courts February 27, 2002 dismissal of the complaint in the first action, and the Company petitioned the Wisconsin Supreme Court for review. The Companys petition was granted and oral argument before the Wisconsin Supreme Court was held on November 5, 2003. A decision is expected sometime in 2004, and the Company intends to continue to vigorously defend this matter. The Company believes that the 5 year/50,000 mile warranty extension it announced in January 2001 adequately addresses the condition for affected owners. 36 The Company is involved with government agencies and groups of potentially responsible parties in various environmental matters, including a matter involving the clean up of soil and groundwater contamination at its York, Pennsylvania facility. The York facility was formerly used by the U.S. Navy and AMF prior to the purchase of the York facility by the Company from AMF in 1981. Although the Company is not certain as to the full extent of the environmental contamination at the York facility, it has been working with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection since 1986 in undertaking environmental investigation and remediation activities, including an on going site wide remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS). In January 1995, the Company entered into a settlement agreement (the Agreement) with the Navy. The Agreement calls for the Navy and the Company to contribute amounts into a trust equal to 53% and 47%, respectively, of future costs associated with environmental investigation and remediation activities at the York facility (Response Costs). The trust administers the payment of the Response Costs incurred at the York facility as covered by the Agreement. In February 2002, the Company was advised by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that it considers some of the Companys remediation activities at the York facility to be subject to the EPAs corrective action program under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and offered the Company the option of addressing corrective action under a RCRA facility lead agreement. The objectives and procedures for facility lead corrective action under RCRA are consistent with the investigation and remediation already being conducted under the Agreement with the Navy, and the Company agreed to participate in EPAs corrective action program under a RCRA facility lead agreement. Although the RI/FS is still underway and substantial uncertainty exists concerning the nature and scope of the environmental investigation and remediation that will ultimately be required at the York facility, the Company estimates that its share of the future Response Costs at the York facility will be approximately $7.9 million. The Company has established reserves for this amount, which are included in Accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The estimate of the Companys future Response Costs that will be incurred at the York facility is based on reports of independent environmental consultants retained by the Company, the actual costs incurred to date, and the estimated costs to complete the necessary investigation and remediation activities. Response Costs are expected to be incurred over a period of several years ending in 2010. 37 Liquidity and Capital Resources as of December 31, 2003 Operating Activities The Companys main source of liquidity is cash from operating activities which consists of net income adjusted for non cash operating activities, collections of retained securitization interests, pension plan contributions, the tax benefit of stock option exercises and changes in current assets and liabilities. The Company generated $935.6 million of cash from operating activities during 2003 compared to $775.6 million in 2002. The largest component of cash from operating activities is net income adjusted for depreciation, which was approximately $957.8 million in 2003 compared to $756.0 million in 2002. During 2003 and 2002, the Company contributed $192.0 million and $153.6 million, respectively, to its defined benefit pension plans. These contributions were made from cash on hand for the direct purpose of improving the funded status of the Companys pension plans and were in excess of the minimum required amounts for the plans. Cash provided by operating activities is also impacted by changes in current assets and liabilities. Changes in these balances decreased operating cash flows by approximately $18.6 million in 2003 and increased operating cash flows by $16.1 million during 2002. Changes in current assets and liabilities during 2003 and 2002 consisted of the following (in millions): 2003 2002 Accounts receivable, net $ (3.7 ) $ 10.1 Inventories 10.4 (37.0 ) Prepaid expenses & other current assets 13.9 (13.1 ) Finance receivables accrued interest and other (54.8 ) (36.4 ) Accounts payable/Accrued expenses 15.6 92.5 $ (18.6 ) $ 16.1 The $18.6 million decrease in operating cash flow which resulted from changes in current assets and liabilities, during 2003, was driven by the negative cash flow impact related to an increase in finance receivables accrued interest and other, during 2003. The current asset balance for finance receivables accrued interest and other grew in connection with the increase in the finance receivable loan balances during 2003. Investing Activities The Companys investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures, finance receivables activity and net changes in marketable securities. Net cash used in investing activities was $484.7 million and $1.01 billion during 2003 and 2002, respectively. Capital expenditures were $227.2 million and $323.9 million during 2003 and 2002, respectively. During 2003, the Company completed capacity expansion efforts at two of the Companys existing locations. These efforts included a 350,000 square foot factory in York, Pennsylvania and a 165,000 square foot addition to the Companys Product Development Center in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin. The Company estimates that total capital expenditures required in 2004 will be in the range from $250 to $300 million. (1) The Company anticipates it will have the ability to fund all capital expenditures in 2004 with internally generated funds.(1) 38 During 2003 and 2002, Financial Services received proceeds from securitizations of $1.72 billion and $1.25 billion, respectively. Finance receivables acquired or originated net of collections resulted in a $1.99 billion use of cash during 2003 compared to a $1.64 billion use of cash during 2002. Financing Activities The Companys financing activities consist primarily of finance debt activity, stock transactions and dividend payments. Net cash provided by financing activities during 2003 and 2002 was $80.6 million and $79.9 million, respectively. In addition to operating cash flow and asset backed securitizations, HDFS is financed by the issuance of commercial paper, borrowings under revolving credit facilities, medium term notes, senior subordinated debt and borrowings from the Company. HDFS outstanding debt consisted of the following as of December 31 (in thousands): 2003 2002 Commercial paper $ 406,907 $ 592,932 Domestic credit facilities 95,913 66,546 European credit facility 62,599 73,101 Medium term notes 398,886 Senior subordinated notes 30,000 30,000 $ 994,305 $ 762,579 HDFS has agreements with financial institutions providing bank credit facilities totaling $750 million (Domestic Credit Facilities). The Domestic Credit Facilities consist of a $350 million revolving term facility due in 2005 and a $400 million 364 day revolving credit facility due September 2004. HDFS expects that the $400 million credit facility expiring in September 2004 will be renewed or that suitable alternatives exist.(1) The primary uses of the Domestic Credit Facilities are to provide liquidity to the unsecured commercial paper program and to fund HDFS business operations. Subject to limitations, HDFS may issue up to $750 million of short term commercial paper with maturities up to 270 days. Outstanding commercial paper may not exceed the unused portion of the Domestic Credit Facilities. As a result, the combined total of commercial paper and borrowings under the Domestic Credit Facilities was limited to $750 million as of December 31, 2003. HDFS has a $200 million European revolving credit facility due July 2005. The primary purpose of the facility is to fund HDFS European business operations. During November 2003, HDFS issued $400 million in medium term notes (Notes) due in December 2008. The Notes provide for semi annual interest payments and principal due at maturity. At December 31, 2003, the Notes include a fair value adjustment of $1.1 million due to interest rate swap agreements. The effect of the interest rate swap agreements is to convert the interest rate on the Notes from a fixed to a floating rate. HDFS has $30 million of ten year senior subordinated notes, expiring in 2007. HDFS has a revolving credit line with the Company whereby HDFS may borrow up to $210 million from the Company at a market interest rate. As of December 31, 2003, HDFS had no outstanding borrowings owed to the Company under this agreement. As of December 31, 2002, HDFS had $100 million in outstanding borrowings to the Company under this agreement. The $100 million loan was eliminated upon consolidation and therefore is not included in finance debt on the consolidated balance sheets. In connection with debt agreements, HDFS has various operating and financial covenants and remains in compliance at December 31, 2003. The Company has a support agreement with HDFS whereby, if required, the 39 Company agrees to provide HDFS certain with financial support in order to maintain certain financial covenants. Support may be provided at the Companys option as capital contributions or loans. Accordingly, certain debt covenants may restrict the Companys ability to withdraw funds from HDFS outside the normal course of business. No amount has ever been provided to HDFS under the support agreement. The Company expects future activities of HDFS will be financed from funds internally generated by HDFS, sale of loans through securitization programs, issuance of commercial paper and medium term notes, borrowings under revolving credit facilities, advances or loans from the Company and subordinated debt. (1) During 2003 and 2002 the Company repurchased a total of 2,346,000 and 1,089,000 shares of it common stock, at weighed average prices of $44.28 and $52.17, respectively. The Company has continuing authorization from its Board of Directors to repurchase shares of the Companys outstanding common stock under which the cumulative number of shares repurchased, at the time of any repurchase, shall not exceed the sum of (1) the number of shares issued in connection with the exercise of stock options occurring on or after January 1, 1998 plus (2) one percent of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company on January 1 of the current year, adjusted for any stock split. The Company repurchased 750,000 and 1,089,000 shares of its common stock during 2003 and 2002, respectively, under this authorization. In addition, the Board of Directors has also separately authorized the Company to repurchase shares of the Companys outstanding common stock. During 2003, the Company repurchased 1,596,000 shares of its common stock under this authorization. As of December 31, 2003 the Company may repurchase an additional 7,804,000 shares of common stock under this authorization. During the fourth quarter of 2003 the Company increased its quarterly dividend payment by 100% over the previous quarter resulting in a dividend of $.08 per share. During 2003 the Company made four quarterly dividend payments totaling $59.0 million or $.195 per share. 40 Risk Factors The Companys ability to meet the targets and expectations noted in this Form 10 K depends upon, among other factors, the Companys ability to (i) continue to realize production efficiencies at its production facilities through the implementation of innovative manufacturing techniques and other means, (ii) successfully implement production capacity increases in its facilities, (iii) successfully introduce new products and services, (iv) avoid unexpected P&A/general merchandise supplier backorders, (v) sell all of the Harley Davidson motorcycles it plans to produce, (vi) continue to develop the capacity of its distributor and dealer network, (vii) avoid unexpected changes in the regulatory environment for its products, (viii) successfully adjust to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, (ix) successfully adjust to interest rate fluctuations, and (x) successfully manage changes in the credit quality of HDFSs loan portfolio. In addition, the Company could experience delays in the operation of manufacturing facilities as a result of work stoppages, difficulty with suppliers, natural causes, terrorism or other factors. These risks, potential delays and uncertainties regarding the costs could also adversely impact the Companys capital expenditure estimates (see Liquidity and Capital Resources section). 41 Item 7a. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. To reduce such risks, the Company selectively uses derivative financial instruments. All hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to regularly reviewed policies and procedures, which prohibit the use of financial instruments for trading purposes. Sensitivity analysis is used to manage and monitor foreign exchange and interest rate risk. A discussion of the Companys accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, and further disclosure relating to the fair value of derivative financial instruments is included in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. The Company sells its products internationally and in most markets those sales are made in the foreign countrys local currency. As a result, the Companys earnings can be affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currency. The Company utilizes foreign currency contracts to mitigate the effect of these fluctuations on earnings. The foreign currency contracts are entered into with banks and allow the Company to exchange a specified amount of foreign currency for U.S. dollars at a future date, based on a fixed exchange rate. At December 31, 2003 these contracts represented a combined U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately $268.9 million. The Company estimates that a uniform 10% weakening in the value of the dollar relative to the currency underlying these contracts would result in a decrease in the fair value of the contracts of approximately $26.8 million. The Companys exposure to the Japanese yen is substantially offset by the existence of a natural hedge, which is sustained through offsetting yen cash inflows from sales with yen cash outflows for motorcycle component purchases and other operating expenses. HDFS earnings are affected by changes in interest rates. HDFS utilizes interest rate swaps to reduce the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on its securitization transactions and debt. As of December 31, 2003, HDFS had interest rate swaps outstanding with a notional value of $801.8 million. HDFS estimates that a 10% increase in interest rates would result in a $2.4 million decrease in the fair value of the agreements. 42 (1) Note regarding forward looking statements The Company intends that certain matters discussed are forward looking statements intended to qualify for the safe harbors from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
