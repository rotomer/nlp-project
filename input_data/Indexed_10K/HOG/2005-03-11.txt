Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Position and Results of Operations Harley Davidson, Inc. is the parent company for the group of companies doing business as Harley Davidson Motor Company (HDMC), Buell Motorcycle Company and Harley Davidson Financial Services (HDFS). HDMC produces heavyweight motorcycles and offers a complete line of motorcycle parts, accessories, apparel and general merchandise. HDMC manufactures five families of motorcycles: Touring, Dyna Glide, Softail, VRSC and Sportster. Buell Motorcycle Company produces sport motorcycles, including five v twin XB models and the single cylinder Buell Blast. Buell also offers a line of motorcycle parts, accessories, apparel and general merchandise. HDFS provides wholesale and retail financing and insurance programs primarily to Harley Davidson/Buell dealers and customers. The Company operates in two principal business segments: Motorcycles and Related Products (Motorcycles) and Financial Services (Financial Services). Overview(1) The Companys 19 years of record revenues and earnings since its initial public stock offering in 1986 are the result of a combination of factors. These include the ability to deliver new products to market, attract new customers, retain existing customers and expand capacity in a responsible way. Unique marketplace events have also created special growth opportunities for Harley Davidson. The Company believes that demand for Harley Davidson motorcycles grows at an average core rate of 7% to 9% per year. However, in many of the 19 years since 1986, the Companys growth has exceeded this core rate driven by a rapidly growing heavyweight motorcycle market, the stock market bubble of the mid and late 1990s including its associated wealth effect, and more recently, the Companys 100th Anniversary. The Companys growth since 1986 required several factory expansions, which provided it with the opportunity to thoroughly modernize its facilities, resulting in improved productivity, quality and manufacturing margins. In 2004, the Company shipped 317,289 Harley Davidson motorcycle units or 9% more than in 2003. The Company expects unit shipments to grow approximately 7% in 2005 with an annual shipment target of 339,000 Harley Davidson units. The Company believes that these growth rates are consistent with the core growth rate for Harley Davidson motorcycles and support its longer term goal to satisfy demand for 400,000 Harley Davidson units in 2007. The Company also expects that by continuing to offer innovative products and services and by driving productivity gains in all facets of its business, it will achieve earnings growth rates in the mid teens for the foreseeable future. The % Change figures included in the Results of Operations section have been calculated using unrounded dollar amounts and may differ from calculations using the rounded dollar amounts presented. Results of Operations 2004 Compared to 2003 Overall Net revenue for 2004 totaled $5.02 billion, a $390.9 million or 8.5% increase over 2003. Net income for 2004 was $889.8 million compared to $760.9 million in 2003, an increase of 16.9%. Diluted earnings per share for 2004 was $3.00 on 296.9 million weighted average shares outstanding, compared to $2.50 on 304.5 million weighted average shares outstanding in 2003, an increase in earnings per share of 20.0%. The Company paid dividends in 2004 of $.08 per share in March, $.10 per share in June and September and $.125 per share in December. The aggregate annual dividend paid in 2004 was $.405 per share, representing a 108% increase over the aggregate annual dividend of $.195 per share in 2003. 21 Motorcycle Unit Shipments & Net Revenue The following table includes wholesale motorcycle unit shipments and net revenue for the Motorcycles segment for 2004 and 2003 (dollars in millions): Increase % 2004 2003 (Decrease) Change Motorcycle Unit Shipments Touring motorcycle units 93,305 82,577 10,728 13.0 % Custom motorcycle units* 154,163 151,405 2,758 1.8 Sportster motorcycle units 69,821 57,165 12,656 22.1 Harley Davidson motorcycle units 317,289 291,147 26,142 9.0 Buell motorcycle units 9,857 9,974 (117 ) (1.2 ) Total motorcycle units 327,146 301,121 26,025 8.6 % Net Revenue Harley Davidson motorcycles $ 3,928.2 $ 3,621.5 $ 306.7 8.5 % Buell motorcycles 79.0 76.1 2.9 3.9 Total motorcycles 4,007.2 3,697.6 309.6 8.4 Parts & Accessories 781.6 712.8 68.8 9.7 General Merchandise 223.7 211.4 12.3 5.8 Other 2.7 2.5 0.2 8.0 Net revenue $ 5,015.2 $ 4,624.3 $ 390.9 8.5 % *Custom motorcycle units, as used in this table, includes Softail, Dyna Glide, VRSC and other custom models. The increase in net revenue for the Motorcycles segment during 2004 was driven by the $306.7 million or 8.5% increase in Harley Davidson motorcycle net revenue. Harley Davidson motorcycle revenue was higher primarily as a result of the 9.0% increase in units shipped. Harley Davidson motorcycle revenue also benefited from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which resulted in $46.4 million of higher revenue during 2004. However, the benefit from exchange rates was offset by lower revenue due to changes in product mix and lower average wholesale prices, as discussed below. During 2004, Harley Davidson motorcycle revenue was impacted by changes in product mix related primarily to an increase in the percentage of shipments consisting of lower priced Sportster motorcycles and a decrease in the percentage of shipments consisting of more expensive Custom motorcycles. Sportsters are an important part of the Companys strategy to attract new customers to the Harley Davidson family. The Company introduced a completely redesigned family of Sportster models in September 2003, and demand for the redesigned models has continued to drive increases in Sportster shipments throughout 2004. The percentage of shipments consisting of Sportster motorcycles was 22.0% in 2004, up from 19.6% in 2003. As a result, the percentage of shipments consisting of Custom motorcycles has also been impacted during 2004. The Company expects that the mix of Sportster motorcycles will continue to be in the range of 20% to 25% of total units shipped over the longer term.(1) Harley Davidson motorcycle revenue was also impacted by changes in average wholesale prices. Wholesale prices on the 2004 models reflected the elimination of 100th Anniversary special edition features and, as a result, were slightly lower than the wholesale prices for the 100th Anniversary models sold during 2003. Wholesale prices on 2005 model year motorcycles were approximately 0.5% higher than model year 2004 prices. However, the positive revenue impact from the 2005 model year price increase only partially offset the impact of the lower 2004 model year pricing. 22 During 2004, net revenue from Parts and Accessories (P&A) totaled $781.6 million, a 9.7% increase over 2003. P&A revenue growth in 2004 was driven by the increase in Harley Davidson motorcycle shipments and also benefited from favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. On a long term basis, the Company expects the growth rate for P&A revenue to be slightly higher than the growth rate for Harley Davidson motorcycle units.(1) General Merchandise revenue during 2004 was $223.7 million, up 5.8% over 2003. The Company expects that the long term growth rate for General Merchandise revenue will be lower than the growth rate for Harley Davidson motorcycle units. (1) Harley Davidson Retail Motorcycle Sales The Companys wholesale motorcycle unit shipments are retailed through an independent worldwide dealer network. Retail sales of the Companys Harley Davidson motorcycles in 2004 were up 7.1% in the United States. Retail sales of Harley Davidson motorcycles also grew in most of the Companys major international markets. However, overall retail sales in Europe during 2004 decreased 1.7% when compared to 2003. In response to current market conditions and the strength of European currencies, the Company reduced its wholesale and suggested retail prices on select motorcycle families across Europe in early 2005. Retail sales data for the heavyweight motorcycle industry in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Japan are provided in the following table (units in thousands): Heavyweight (651+cc) Motorcycle Retail Registrations 2004 2003 % Change United States (a) Harley Davidson models only 244.5 228.4 7.1 % Industry 494.0 461.2 7.1 % Canada (b) Harley Davidson models only 11.3 9.9 14.3 % Industry 36.7 34.3 7.1 % Europe (c) Harley Davidson models only 25.9 26.3 (1.7 )% Industry 336.2 323.1 4.1 % Japan (d) Harley Davidson models only 11.9 11.8 1.0 % Industry 44.0 44.3 (0.6 )% (a) U.S. data provided by the Motorcycle Industry Council.

(d) Japan data provided by Japan Automobile Importers Association. 23 Gross Profit Gross profit for 2004 totaled $1.90 billion, an increase of $234.0 million or 14.0% over 2003. Gross margin was 37.9% in 2004, up from 36.0% for 2003. During 2004, gross margin was positively impacted by lower production costs and changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which more than offset the impact of product mix changes discussed under Net Revenue. In 2004, production costs were lower due to manufacturing efficiencies, but also benefited from a new and fully integrated Softail factory in York, Pennsylvania. During the second half of 2003, the Company experienced higher costs and inefficiencies associated with the rampup of the new Softail factory. Finally, during 2004, changes in foreign currency exchange rates resulted in $38.5 million of higher gross profit when compared to 2003. Price increases in the metal markets during 2004 did not have a significant impact on the Companys gross profit. The majority of the metal market price increases were managed by the Companys suppliers. During 2004, the Company incurred metal surcharges from some of its suppliers of approximately $9 million. . The majority of the surcharge in 2004 was incurred during the fourth quarter and if similar surcharges continue in 2005 the Companys gross profit in 2005 could be impacted.(1) The Company will continue to closely monitor metal market prices in 2005. Financial Services The following table includes the condensed statements of operations for the Financial Services segment (which consists of HDFS) for 2004 and 2003 (in millions): % 2004 2003 Increase Change Interest income $ 102.2 $ 87.1 $ 15.1 17.4 % Income from securitizations 115.1 114.4 0.7 0.6 Other income 88.0 78.0 10.0 12.8 Financial services income 305.3 279.5 25.8 9.2 Interest expense 22.7 17.6 5.1 28.9 Operating expenses 94.0 94.0 0.0 Financial services expense 116.7 111.6 5.1 4.5 Operating income from financial services $ 188.6 $ 167.9 $ 20.7 12.3 % The increase in operating income from Financial Services in 2004 was driven by continued strong marketplace acceptance of HDFS finance and insurance products. During 2004, income from securitizations was up only slightly over 2003 as the increase in income on investment in retained securitization interests was mostly offset by lower gains on current year securitization transactions. During 2004, income on investment in retained securitization interests was $56.8 million, an increase of $24.6 million over 2003, due primarily to better than anticipated performance on prior years securitization transactions. During 2004, HDFS sold $1.9 billion of retail motorcycle loans through securitization transactions resulting in gains of $58.3 million. During 2003, HDFS sold approximately $1.7 billion of retail motorcycle loans resulting in gains of $82.2 million. The gain as a percentage of the amount of loans securitized was lower when compared with the prior years gain due to rising market interest rates during 2004 and the cost of an enhanced dealer participation program that was introduced during the second quarter of 2004. Under HDFS dealer participation program, HDFS pays Harley Davidson dealers cash incentives for originating retail motorcycle loans. Over the long term, the Company expects the HDFS operating income growth rate to be slightly higher than the Companys motorcycle unit growth rate.(1) 24 Changes in HDFS allowance for credit losses during 2004 and 2003 were as follows (in millions): 2004 2003 Balance, beginning of period $ 31.3 $ 31.0 Provision for credit losses 3.1 4.1 Charge offs, net of recoveries (4.1 ) (3.8 ) Balance, end of period $ 30.3 $ 31.3 HDFS periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is generally based on HDFS past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, and current economic conditions. HDFS believes the allowance is adequate to cover the losses of principal and accrued interest in the existing portfolio. Included in charge offs, net of recoveries are $3.7 million and $1.3 million of recoveries in 2004 and 2003, respectively, received by HDFS from HDMC. These recoveries relate to guarantees provided by HDMC on wholesale loans to independent European Harley Davidson dealers. Operating Expenses The following table includes operating expenses for the Motorcycles segment and Corporate for 2004 and 2003 (in millions): % 2004 2003 Increase Change Motorcycles $ 710.0 $ 668.7 $ 41.3 6.2 % Corporate 16.6 15.5 1.1 7.3 Total operating expenses $ 726.6 $ 684.2 $ 42.4 6.2 % The increase in operating expenses in 2004 was driven by overall growth in the Motorcycles business combined with the Companys ongoing investment in specific initiatives designed to support its growth objectives. Operating expenses, which include selling, administrative and engineering expenses, were 14.5% and 14.8% of net revenue for 2004 and 2003, respectively. Other, net Other net expense was $5.1 million and $6.3 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Other, net expense consists primarily of charitable contributions in 2004 and 2003. Investment Income, net Net investment income (excluding Financial Services interest income) in 2004 was $23.1 million, even with $23.1 million in 2003. In connection with the Companys capacity expansion efforts, $3.9 million of interest cost was capitalized during 2003; no amounts were capitalized during 2004. Consolidated Income Taxes The Companys effective income tax rate was 35.5% and 34.7.% during 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Companys effective income tax rate increased as pretax income grew faster than certain permanent tax differences. The Company expects that the income tax rate will be 35.5% during 2005.(1) 25 Results of Operations 2003 Compared to 2002 Overall The Companys net revenue for 2003 totaled $4.62 billion, a $533.3 million, or 13.0%, increase over 2002. Net income for 2003 was $760.9 million compared to $580.2 million in 2002, an increase of 31.1%. Diluted earnings per share for 2003 was $2.50 on 304.5 million weighted average shares outstanding compared to $1.90 on 305.2 million weighted average shares outstanding in 2002, an increase of 31.6% in earnings per share. The Company paid dividends in 2003 of $.035 per share in March, $.04 per share in June and September and $.08 per share in December. The aggregate annual dividend paid in 2003 was $.195 per share, representing a 44% increase over the aggregate annual dividend of $.135 per share in 2002. Motorcycle Unit Shipments & Net Revenue The following table includes wholesale motorcycle unit shipments and net revenue for the Motorcycles segment for 2003 and 2002 (dollars in millions): Increase % 2003 2002 (Decrease) Change Motorcycle Unit Shipments Touring motorcycle units 82,577 70,713 11,864 16.8 % Custom motorcycle units* 151,405 141,769 9,636 8.5 Sportster motorcycle units 57,165 51,171 5,994 11.7 Harley Davidson motorcycle units 291,147 263,653 27,494 10.4 Buell motorcycle units 9,974 10,943 (969 ) (8.9 ) Total motorcycle units 301,121 274,596 26,525 9.7 % Net Revenue Harley Davidson motorcycles $ 3,621.5 $ 3,161.0 $ 460.5 14.6 % Buell motorcycles 76.1 66.9 9.2 13.6 Total motorcycles 3,697.6 3,227.9 469.7 14.6 Parts & Accessories 712.8 629.2 83.6 13.3 General Merchandise 211.4 231.5 (20.1 ) (8.7 ) Other 2.5 2.4 0.1 n.m. Net revenue $ 4,624.3 $ 4,091.0 $ 533.3 13.0 % *Custom motorcycle units, as used in this table, includes Softail, Dyna Glide, VRSC and other custom models. The 13.0% increase in net revenue for the Motorcycles segment during 2003 was led by a $460.5 million, or 14.6%, increase in Harley Davidson motorcycle net revenue. Harley Davidson motorcycle revenue was driven by the 10.4% increase in Harley Davidson motorcycle unit shipments, but also benefited from wholesale price increases, a slightly favorable product mix and favorable foreign currency exchange rates during 2003. Wholesale motorcycle shipments during the first eight months of 2003 consisted of the Companys 100th Anniversary models as the Company completed its 14 month 100th Anniversary model year. Wholesale price increases for the 100th Anniversary models provided for higher average selling prices on units sold during the first half of 2003 when compared to the 2002 model year units sold in the first half of 2002. However, as a result of the extended 100th Anniversary model year, wholesale shipments of 100th Anniversary models, carrying the same pricing, occurred in the third quarters of both 2003 and 2002. Revenue in the fourth quarter of 2003 was only slightly impacted by the lower wholesale prices associated with the 2004 model year motorcycles. 26 During 2003, the Company experienced product mix changes both within and between its motorcycle families. Changes in product mix within the Companys motorcycle families generally resulted in higher revenue during 2003 when compared to 2002. The net result of mix changes between motorcycle families did not have a significant net impact on Harley Davidson motorcycle revenue in 2003. Foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable effect on Harley Davidson motorcycle revenue of approximately $60 million in 2003, primarily as a result of stronger foreign currencies in Europe and Japan, when compared to 2002. During 2003, net revenue from Parts and Accessories (P&A) totaled $712.8 million, a 13.3% increase over 2002. The 2003 increase in P&A revenue was driven primarily by higher motorcycle shipments. P&A revenue was positively impacted in 2003 and 2002 by sales of 100th Anniversary P&A products. Total P&A revenue for 2003 included $32.1 million from sales of 100th Anniversary P&A products compared to $34.0 million in 2002. Excluding the impact of 100th Anniversary revenue from both 2003 and 2002 the P&A revenue growth rate for 2003 is 14.4%. General Merchandise revenue during 2003 was $211.4 million, down 8.7% from 2003. Sales from 100th Anniversary General Merchandise products accounted for $9.3 million of total General Merchandise revenue during 2003 compared to $52.2 million during 2002. Sales of 100th Anniversary General Merchandise were more heavily concentrated in 2002 in order to prepare the Companys independent dealers for the 14 month long 100th Anniversary celebration. Excluding the revenue from the sale of 100th Anniversary products from both 2003 and 2002, the General Merchandise revenue growth rate for 2003 is 12.7%. Harley Davidson Retail Motorcycle Sales The Companys wholesale motorcycle unit shipments are distributed through an independent worldwide dealer network. During 2003, growth in retail sales of the Companys Harley Davidson motorcycles outpaced the heavyweight motorcycle (651+cc) industry in the U.S., Europe and Japan. Retail sales of the Companys Harley Davidson motorcycles were up 8.8% in the United States for 2003. In Europe and Japan, retail sales of the Companys Harley Davidson motorcycles were up 11.8% and 8.3%, respectively, during 2003. Retail sales information for the United States, Canada, Europe and Japan is as follows (units in thousands): Heavyweight (651+ cc) Motorcycle Retail Registrations 2003 2002 % Change United States (a) Harley Davidson models only 228.4 209.9 8.8 % Industry 461.2 442.3 4.3 % Canada (b) Harley Davidson models only 9.9 10.2 (3.4 )% Industry 34.3 32.6 2.5 % Europe (c) Harley Davidson models only 26.3 23.5 11.8 % Industry 323.1 331.8 (2.6 )% Japan (d) Harley Davidson models only 11.8 10.9 8.3 % Industry 44.3 47.9 (7.4 )% (a) U.S. data provided by the Motorcycle Industry Council.

(d) Japan data provided by industry sources. 27 Gross Profit Gross profit in 2003 of $1.7 billion was $247.7 million or 17.5% higher than gross profit in 2002. The increase in gross profit is primarily related to the increase in net revenue. The gross profit margin was 36.0% in 2003 compared to 34.7% in 2002. The increase in gross margin in 2003 was driven by wholesale price increases on 2003 models, favorable motorcycle product mix and foreign currency exchange rates. Gross profit was higher in 2003 when compared to 2002 by approximately $38 million from foreign currency exchange rate changes to both revenue and costs. Financial Services The following table includes the condensed statements of operations for the Financial Services segment for 2003 and 2002 (in millions): % 2003 2002 Increase Change Interest income $ 87.1 $ 76.1 $ 11.0 14.4 % Income from securitizations 114.4 74.9 39.5 52.7 Other income 78.0 60.5 17.5 28.9 Financial services income 279.5 211.5 68.0 32.1 Interest expense 17.6 15.1 2.5 16.4 Operating expenses 94.0 92.2 1.8 2.0 Financial services expense 111.6 107.3 4.3 4.0 Operating income from financial services $ 167.9 $ 104.2 $ 63.7 61.1 % The increase in Financial Services operating income in 2003 was driven by continued strong marketplace acceptance of HDFS finance and insurance products and higher income from securitizations. The increase in income from securitizations was driven by increases in income on investment in retained securitization interests and higher gains on current year securitization transactions. During 2003, income on investment in retained securitization interests was $32.2 million, an increase of $13.4 million over 2002, due primarily to better than anticipated performance on prior years securtization transactions. During 2003, HDFS sold $1.7 billion of retail motorcycle loans through securitization transactions, resulting in gains of $82.2 million. During 2002, HDFS sold approximately $1.3 billion of retail motorcycle loans, resulting in gains of $56.1 million. The net gain as a percentage of the amount of loans securitized increased from 4.39% in 2002 to 4.70% in 2003 as HDFS continued to benefit from a favorable interest rate environment. Changes in HDFS allowance for credit losses during 2003 and 2002 were as follows (in millions): 2003 2002 Balance, beginning of period $ 31.0 $ 28.7 Provision for credit losses 4.1 6.2 Charge offs, net of recoveries (3.8 ) (3.9 ) Balance, end of period $ 31.3 $ 31.0 HDFS periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is generally based on HDFS past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, and current economic conditions. In 2003, charge offs, net of recoveries included $1.3 million of recoveries received by HDFS from HDMC. These recoveries relate to guarantees provided by HDMC on wholesale loans to independent European Harley Davidson dealers. 28 Operating Expenses The following table includes operating expenses for the Motorcycles segment and Corporate for 2003 and 2002 (in millions): % 2003 2002 Increase Change Motorcycles $ 668.7 $ 626.7 $ 42.0 6.7 % Corporate 15.5 12.6 2.9 22.6 Total operating expenses $ 684.2 $ 639.3 $ 44.9 7.0 % Operating expenses, which include selling, administrative and engineering expenses, increased in connection with the Companys ongoing investment in initiatives designed to support its current and future growth objectives. However, the increase in 2003 was partially offset by lower net expenditures related to the Companys 100th Anniversary celebration as compared to 2002. The Company began its 14 month long 100th Anniversary celebration during the third quarter of 2002 and net expenses associated with the celebration were most heavily concentrated in 2002. Comparatively, costs incurred during 2003 for the 100th Anniversary celebration were mostly offset by event proceeds and sponsorships. Operating expenses as a percent of net revenue were 14.8% and 15.6% for 2003 and 2002, respectively. Other, net Other net expense was $6.3 million and $13.4 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The most significant component of other, net expense in 2003 was $4.5 million in charitable contributions. During 2002, the most significant components of other net expense were $7.1 million in losses on the disposal of fixed assets, $5.5 million in charitable contributions and $4.8 million in costs associated with environmental matters. Investment Income, net Net investment income (excluding Financial Services interest income) in 2003 was $23.1 million compared to $16.5 million in 2002. The increase in net investment income resulted from higher average balances of cash and marketable securities during 2003 when compared to 2002. In connection with the Companys capacity expansion efforts, $3.9 million of interest cost was capitalized during 2003 compared to $2.7 million during 2002. Consolidated Income Taxes The Companys effective income tax rate was 34.7% and 34.5% during 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Companys effective income tax rate increased during 2003 as pre tax income grew faster than certain tax deductions. The Companys effective income tax rate increased as pre tax income grew faster than certain permanent tax differences. 29 Other Matters Accounting Changes As discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company began expensing the cost of stock options on January 1, 2005, when it adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004) Share Based Payment. The Company expects that total stock compensation expense, including all types of share based payments, will be similar to the 2004 pro forma stock compensation expense of $22.5 million, or $13.9 million, after taxes, included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical Accounting Policies The Companys financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies, which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions. Management believes that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of accounting policies that currently affect the Companys financial condition and results of operations. Finance Receivable Securitizations The Company sells retail motorcycle loans through securitization transactions utilizing qualifying special purpose entities (QSPEs). Upon sale of retail loans in a securitization transaction, HDFS receives cash and retains an interest in excess cash flows, servicing rights and cash reserve account deposits, all of which are collectively referred to as retained interests in the securitized receivables. Retained interests are carried at fair value and periodically reviewed for impairment. Market value quotes are generally not available for retained interests; therefore HDFS estimates fair value based on the present value of future expected cash flows using managements best estimates of the key assumptions for credit losses, prepayment speeds and discount rates. The impact of changes to key assumptions is shown in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Gains on current year securitizations from the sale of retail loans are recorded as a component of financial services income and are based in part on certain assumptions including expected credit losses, prepayment speed, and discount rates. Gains on sales of retail loans also depend on the original carrying amount of the retail loans, which is allocated between the assets sold and the retained interests based on their relative fair value at the date of transfer. Finance Receivable Credit Losses The allowance for uncollectible accounts is maintained at a level management believes is adequate to cover the losses of principal and accrued interest in the existing finance receivables portfolio. Managements periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is generally based on HDFS past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, current economic conditions, specific borrowers ability to repay and the estimated value of any underlying collateral. Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits Retirement Plan (Pension, SERPA and Postretirement health care) obligations and costs are developed from actuarial valuations. The valuation of projected benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs relies on key assumptions including discount rates, long term expected return on plan assets, future compensation and medical trend rates. The Company evaluates and updates all of its assumptions annually in conjunction with its September 30 actuarial measurement date. As of its most recent measurement date the Company lowered its discount rate assumption from 6.50% to 6.25%, while the assumption for medical trend rates was not changed from prior year. The lower discount rate resulted in an immediate increase to the projected benefit obligation and will be amortized into net periodic benefits costs over future periods, resulting in an increase in future service and interest costs. The discount rate and medical trend rate assumptions are impacted by short term changes in external economic factors and as result, can be volatile. The Companys 2005 Retirement Plan costs have already been determined in connection with the September 30, 2004 measurement process. However, a change in either of these two assumptions could have an impact on the valuation of costs as of the Companys next measurement date, September 30, 2005. The following information is provided to illustrate the sensitivity of these obligations and costs to changes in these major assumptions (in thousands). 30 Amounts based on Current Assumptions Impact of a 1% decrease in the Discount Rate Impact of a 1% increase in the Medical Trend Rate 2004 Net periodic benefit costs Pension and SERPA $ 40,748 $ 17,554 n/a Postretirement healthcare $ 31,027 $ 2,766 $ 1,518 2004 Projected benefit obligations Pension and SERPA $ 816,998 $ 133,805 n/a Postretirement healthcare $ 241,345 $ 27,248 $ 11,418 This information is provided to illustrate the sensitivity of these amounts to certain assumptions and not as a means to predict future amounts. The calculation of Retirement Plan obligations and costs is based on many factors in addition to those discussed here. This information should be considered in combination with the information provided in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual Obligations A summary of the Companys expected payments for significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004 is as follows (in thousands): 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Total Finance Debt $ 495,441 $ 405,015 $ 394,985 $ $ 1,295,441 Operating Leases 5,971 5,524 4,373 7,669 23,537 $ 501,412 $ 410,539 $ 399,358 $ 7,669 $ 1,318,978 As of December 31, 2004, the Company had no material purchase obligations other than those created in the ordinary course of business related to inventory and property, plant and equipment which generally have terms of less than 90 days. The Company also has long term obligations related to its pension and postretirement plans which are discussed in detail in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of its securitization program, HDFS transfers retail motorcycle loans to a special purpose bankruptcy remote wholly owned subsidiary. The subsidiary sells the retail loans to a securitization trust in exchange for the proceeds from asset backed securities issued by the securitization trust. The asset backed securities, usually notes with various maturities and interest rates, are secured by future collections of the purchased retail installment loans. Activities of the securitization trust are limited to acquiring retail loans, issuing asset backed securities and making payments on securities to investors. Due to the nature of the assets held by the securitization trust and the limited nature of its activities, the securitization trusts are considered QSPEs as defined by SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. In accordance with SFAS No. 140, assets and liabilities of the QSPEs are not consolidated in the financial statements of the Company. HDFS does not guarantee securities issued by the securitization trusts or projected cash flows from the related loans purchased from HDFS. Recourse against HDFS related to each securitization transaction is limited to the respective investment in retained securitization interests, excluding servicing rights. Total investment in retained securitization interests at December 31, 2004 is $282.2 million. The securitization trusts have a limited life and generally terminate upon final distribution of amounts owed to the investors in the asset backed securities. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of HDFS securitization program. 31 Commitments and Contingencies The Company is subject to lawsuits and other claims related to environmental, product and other matters. In determining required reserves related to these items, the Company carefully analyzes cases and considers the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes, as well as the potential range of possible loss. The required reserves are monitored on an ongoing basis and are updated based on new developments or new information in each matter. In January 2001, the Company, on its own initiative, notified each owner of 1999 and early 2000 model year Harley Davidson motorcycles equipped with Twin Cam 88 and Twin Cam 88B engines that the Company was extending the warranty for a rear cam bearing to 5 years or 50,000 miles. Subsequently, on June 28, 2001, a putative nationwide class action was filed against the Company in state court in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, which was amended by a complaint filed September 28, 2001. The complaint alleged that this cam bearing is defective and asserted various legal theories. This complaint and a second lawsuit filed on April 12, 2002 in state court in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin were dismissed as reported in more detail in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report (Note 6). On April 12, 2004, the same attorneys filed a third action in state court in Milwaukee County on behalf of the same plaintiffs from the action dismissed by the Wisconsin Supreme Court. This third action was dismissed by the court on July 26, 2004. In addition, the plaintiffs in the original case moved to reopen that matter and amend the complaint to add new causes of action, which was denied on August 23, 2004. A notice of appeal to the Wisconsin Court of Appeals from the latter dismissal was filed by the plaintiffs and the appeal is currently pending. The Company intends to continue to vigorously defend this matter. The Company believes that the 5 year/50,000 mile warranty extension it announced in January 2001 adequately addresses the condition for affected owners. The Company is involved with government agencies and groups of potentially responsible parties in various environmental matters, including a matter involving the cleanup of soil and groundwater contamination at its York, Pennsylvania, facility. The York facility was formerly used by the U.S. Navy and AMF prior to the purchase of the York facility by the Company from AMF in 1981. Although the Company is not certain as to the full extent of the environmental contamination at the York facility, it has been working with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection since 1986 in undertaking environmental investigation and remediation activities, including an ongoing site wide remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS). Note 6 includes a discussion of the history of this matter in more detail. Although the RI/FS is still under way and substantial uncertainty exists concerning the nature and scope of the additional environmental investigation and remediation that will ultimately be required at the York facility, the Company estimates that its share of the future costs associated with environmental investigation and remediation activities at the York facility (Response Costs) will be approximately $6.7 million. The Company has established reserves for this amount, which are included in Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The estimate of the Companys future Response Costs that will be incurred at the York facility is based on reports of independent environmental consultants retained by the Company, the actual costs incurred to date, and the estimated costs to complete the necessary investigation and remediation activities. Response Costs related to the remediation of soil are expected to be incurred over a period of several years ending in 2010. Response Costs related to ground water remediation may continue for some time beyond 2010. However, these Response Costs are expected to be much lower than those related to the remediation of soil. Additionally, the Company is involved in product liability suits related to the operation of its business. The Company accrues for claim exposures which are probable of occurrence and can be reasonably estimated. The Company also maintains insurance coverage for product liability exposures. The Company believes that its accruals and insurance coverage are adequate and that product liability will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. 32 Liquidity and Capital Resources as of December 31, 2004 Operating Activities The Companys main source of liquidity is cash from operating activities which consists of net income adjusted for noncash items and other operating cash flows. The Company has concluded that certain prior year balances in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows should be reclassified to appropriately present net cash provided by operating activities and net cash used in investing activities. The Companys previous policy was to classify all the cash flow effects of providing wholesale loans to its independent motorcycle dealers by its Financial Services segment as an investing activity in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. This policy, when applied to the financing of inventory sales, had the effect of presenting an investing cash outflow and an operating cash inflow even though there was no cash inflow or outflow on a consolidated basis. The Company has changed its policy to eliminate this intersegment activity from its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and, as a result of this change, all cash flow effects related to wholesale loans are reflected in the operating activities section of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for 2004. All prior years amounts have been reclassified to conform to this presentation. In addition, the Company previously classified collections of retained securitization interests as operating cash flows. Since these retained securitization interests have many of the characteristics of, and are accounted for like, investments available for sale, the Company has concluded that the cash inflow from these collections should be classified as investing cash flows and has reflected this reclassification in its 2004 Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. All prior years amounts have been reclassified to conform to this presentation. The effect of the reclassification of both of these changes on prior year net cash provided by operating activities and net cash used in investing activities is summarized in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company generated $969.7 million of cash from operating activities during 2004 compared to $662.7 million in 2003. The increase in cash from operations in 2004 was driven by higher net income. In addition, cash from operations in 2003 included a $192 million cash outflow for pension plan contributions; no amounts were contributed to the pension plans in 2004. As discussed in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements the Company expects to begin pre funding its postretirement healthcare plans in 2005 and is currently planning to contribute approximately $100 million to the plans during the first half of 2005.(1) The Company is also currently planning to contribute a minimum of $20 million to its pension plans during 2005. (1) Net changes in current assets and liabilities included in net cash provided by operating activities during 2004 and 2003 consisted of the following (in millions): 2004 2003 Accounts receivable, net $ (8.9 ) $ (3.7 ) Inventories (19.2 ) 10.4 Finance receivables accrued interest and other (27.4 ) (54.8 ) Accounts payable/Accrued expenses 39.5 15.6 Other (8.9 ) 13.9 $ (24.9 ) $ (18.6 ) A net increase in accounts receivable during 2004 resulted in an $8.9 million negative adjustment to operating cash flow. The change in accounts receivable relates primarily to an increase in the Companys international accounts receivable balances in Europe and Japan. The increase in Company inventory resulted in a negative adjustment of $19.2 million to operating cash flow during 2004. Net increases in inventory were due primarily to higher finished goods inventory, partially offset by lower raw materials and work in process inventory. Finished goods increases were driven by an increase in motorcycle units on hand. 33 During 2004, the increase in finance receivables accrued interest and other resulted in a $27.4 million reduction to operating cash flow. The change in this balance was due primarily to the increase in total finance receivables. Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased $39.5 million during 2004, resulting in a positive adjustment to operating cash flow. The net increase was driven by higher accounts payable in connection with higher motorcycle production volumes. Investing Activities The Companys investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures, finance receivables activity and net changes in marketable securities. Net cash used in investing activities was $707.8 million and $606.4 million during 2004 and 2003, respectively. Capital expenditures were $213.6 million and $227.2 million during 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company estimates that total capital expenditures required in 2005 will be in the range of $225 to $275 million.(1) The Company anticipates it will have the ability to fund all capital expenditures in 2005 with internally generated funds.(1) Investing activity related to finance receivables resulted in a cash outflow of $272.1 million during 2004 compared to a cash outflow of $113.4 million during 2003. The change in net investing cash flow related to finance receivables was due primarily to the fact that HDFS did not complete a securitization transaction during the fourth quarter of 2004. During the fourth quarter of 2003 HDFS completed a $300 million securitization transaction. The Company plans to complete a $730 million securitization transaction in the first quarter of 2005. This compares to a $625 million transaction completed in the first quarter of 2004. The Company increased its investment in marketable securities by $349.0 million in 2004 and $393.5 million in 2003. Financing Activities The Companys financing activities consist primarily of stock transactions, dividend payments and finance debt activity. Net cash (used in)/provided by financing activities during 2004 and 2003 was $(316.1) million and $80.6 million, respectively. During 2004 the Company repurchased 10.6 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of $564.1 million. The Company repurchased 7.8 million shares under a general authorization from the Companys Board of Directors. The remaining 2.8 million shares were repurchased under an authorization from the Companys Board of Directors that is designed to provide the Company with continuing authority to repurchase shares to offset dilution caused by the exercise of stock options. During 2004, the Companys Board of Directors declared four cash dividends totaling $.405 per share or $119.2 million, compared to a total of $.195 per share or $59.0 million, during 2003. In addition to operating cash flow and asset backed securitizations, HDFS is financed by the issuance of commercial paper, borrowings under the revolving credit facility, medium term notes, senior subordinated debt and borrowings from the Company. HDFS outstanding debt consisted of the following as of December 31 (in millions): 2004 2003 Commercial paper $ 702.1 $ 406.9 Borrowings under credit facilities 168.3 158.5 Medium term notes 395.0 398.9 Senior subordinated debt 30.0 30.0 Total finance debt $ 1,295.4 $ 994.3 34 Credit Facilities During September 2004, HDFS entered into a $1.1 billion revolving credit facility (Global Credit Facility) due September 2009. This facility replaced $750 million in domestic credit facilities and a $200 million European credit facility. The primary use of the Global Credit Facility is to provide liquidity to the unsecured commercial paper program and to fund domestic and foreign operations. Subject to certain limitations, HDFS has the option to borrow in various currencies. Interest is based on London interbank offered rates (LIBOR), European interbank offered rates or other short term indices, depending on the type of advance. The Global Credit Facility is a committed facility and HDFS pays a fee for its availability. Commercial Paper Subject to limitations, HDFS may issue up to $1.1 billion of short term commercial paper with maturities up to 270 days. Outstanding commercial paper may not exceed the unused portion of the Global Credit Facility. As a result, the combined total of commercial paper and borrowings under the Global Credit Facility was limited to $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2004. Medium Term Notes During November 2003, HDFS issued $400 million of 3.63% medium term notes (Notes) due in December 2008. The Notes provide for semi annual interest payments and principal due at maturity. At December 31, 2004, the Notes included a fair value adjustment reducing the balance by $5.0 million due to interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges. The effect of the interest rate swap agreements is to convert the interest rate on the Notes from a fixed to a floating rate, which is based on 3 month LIBOR. Senior Subordinated Debt HDFS has $30 million of 10 year senior subordinated notes, due in 2007. Intercompany Borrowing HDFS has a revolving credit line with the Company whereby HDFS may borrow up to $210 million from the Company at a market interest rate. As of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, HDFS had no outstanding borrowings owed to the Company under this agreement. The Company has a support agreement with HDFS whereby, if required, the Company agrees to provide HDFS with financial support in order to maintain certain financial covenants. Support may be provided at the Companys option as capital contributions or loans. Accordingly, certain debt covenants may restrict the Companys ability to withdraw funds from HDFS outside the normal course of business. No amount has ever been provided to HDFS under the support agreement. In connection with its debt agreements, HDFS has various operating and financial covenants and remains in compliance at December 31, 2004. The Company expects that future activities of HDFS will be financed from funds internally generated by HDFS, the sale of loans through securitization programs, issuance of commercial paper and medium term notes, borrowings under revolving credit facilities, advances or loans from the Company and subordinated debt. (1) Risk Factors The Companys ability to meet the targets and expectations noted in this Form 10 K depends upon, among other factors, the Companys ability to (1) continue to realize production efficiencies at its production facilities through the implementation of innovative manufacturing techniques and other means, (2) successfully implement production capacity increases in its facilities, (3) successfully introduce new products and services, (4) avoid unexpected supply chain issues, (5) sell all of the Harley Davidson motorcycles it plans to produce, (6) continue to develop the capacity of its distributor and dealer network, (7) avoid unexpected changes in the regulatory environment for its products, (8) successfully adjust to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, interest rate fluctuations, and commodity prices, (9) adjust to worldwide economic and political conditions, and (10) successfully manage changes in the credit quality of HDFSs loan portfolio. In addition, the Company could experience delays in the operation of manufacturing facilities as a result of work stoppages, difficulty with suppliers, natural causes, terrorism or other factors. These risks, potential delays and uncertainties regarding the costs could also adversely impact the Companys capital expenditure estimates (see Liquidity and Capital Resources section). 35 Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. To reduce such risks, the Company selectively uses derivative financial instruments. All hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to regularly reviewed policies and procedures, which prohibit the use of financial instruments for trading purposes. Sensitivity analysis is used to manage and monitor foreign exchange and interest rate risk. A discussion of the Companys accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and further disclosure relating to the fair value of derivative financial instruments is included in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company sells its products internationally and in most markets those sales are made in the foreign countrys local currency. As a result, the Companys earnings can be affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currency. The Company utilizes foreign currency contracts to mitigate the effect of these fluctuations on earnings. The foreign currency contracts are entered into with banks and allow the Company to exchange a specified amount of foreign currency for U.S. dollars at a future date, based on a fixed exchange rate. At December 31, 2004 these contracts represented a combined U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately $284.7 million. The Company estimates that a uniform 10% weakening in the value of the dollar relative to the currency underlying these contracts would result in a decrease in the fair value of the contracts of approximately $31.9 million. The Companys exposure to the Japanese yen is substantially offset by the existence of a natural hedge, which is sustained through offsetting yen cash inflows from sales with yen cash outflows for motorcycle component purchases and other operating expenses. HDFS earnings are affected by changes in interest rates. HDFS utilizes interest rate swaps to reduce the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on its securitization transactions and debt. As of December 31, 2004, HDFS had interest rate swaps outstanding with a notional value of $923.0 million. HDFS estimates that a 10% increase in interest rates would result in a $1.5 million decrease in the fair value of the agreements.
