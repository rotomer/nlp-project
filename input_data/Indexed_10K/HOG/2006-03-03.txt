Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Position and Results of Operations Harley Davidson, Inc. is the parent company for the groups of companies doing business as Harley Davidson Motor Company (HDMC), Buell Motorcycle Company and Harley Davidson Financial Services (HDFS). Harley Davidson Motor Company produces heavyweight motorcycles and offers a complete line of motorcycle parts, accessories, apparel and general merchandise. Harley Davidson Motor Company manufactures five families of motorcycles: Touring, Dyna, Softail, VRSC and Sportster. Buell Motorcycle Company produces sport motorcycles, including seven twin cylinder XB models and the single cylinder Buell Blast. Buell also offers a line of motorcycle parts, accessories, apparel and general merchandise. Harley Davidson Financial Services provides wholesale and retail financing and insurance programs primarily to Harley Davidson/Buell dealers and customers. The Company operates in two principal business segments: Motorcycles and Related Products (Motorcycles) and Financial Services (Financial Services). Overview(1) The Companys net revenue for 2005 was $5.34 billion, up 6.5% over last year, on 329,017 wholesale shipments of Harley Davidson motorcycles. Revenue growth during 2005 was due primarily to a 3.7% increase in shipments of Harley Davidson motorcycles combined with a favorable change in the mix of motorcycles shipped when compared to 2004. Net income and diluted earnings per share also grew during 2005 with increases over prior year of 7.8% and 13.7%, respectively. The increase in diluted earnings per share includes the benefit of fewer weighted average shares outstanding when compared to the prior year. The Companys outstanding shares have decreased as a result of common stock repurchases totaling 21.4 million shares during 2005. The Companys independent dealer network also reported increases in retail motorcycle unit sales during 2005 with worldwide retail sales of Harley Davidson motorcycles increasing 6.2% over the prior year. Management believes the Companys lineup of 2006 model year motorcycles, introduced in July 2005, helped drive worldwide retail sales growth during 2005. In the United States, 2005 retail sales of Harley Davidson motorcycles grew 4.2% over 2004. Outside of the United States, retail sales of Harley Davidson motorcycles grew 15.0% during 2005 when compared with 2004. During 2005, retail sales increased in all of the Companys major international markets. The retail sales data reported above is compiled by the Company from sales and warranty registrations provided by the Companys independent dealers. Management believes the prospects for growth in retail sales of Harley Davidson motorcycles remain strong and support a wholesale unit growth rate in the range of 5% to 9% annually and an annual EPS growth rate of 11% to 17%. The Harley Davidson motorcycle shipment target for 2006 is in the range of 348,000 to 352,000 units, with planned wholesale shipments of 79,000 motorcycles during the first quarter of 2006. Over the last several years the Company has been working to increase the availability of its motorcycles at dealers to improve the customer experience. The Company believes that increased availability will lead to independent dealers providing wider selections of motorcycles at manufacturers suggested retail prices and, as a result, the Company will be better positioned to attract retail buyers that are new to the brand or new to the sport of motorcycling. The Company understands that improving the availability of its motorcycles to customers may result in retail purchases that will track more closely with the riding season, requiring the Company and its independent dealers to balance the economies of level production with a more seasonal retail sales pattern.

Results of Operations 2005 Compared to 2004 Overall Net revenue for 2005 totaled $5.34 billion, a $327.0 million or 6.5% increase over the prior year. Net income for 2005 was $959.6 million compared to $889.8 million in 2004, an increase of 7.8%. Diluted earnings per share for 2005 were $3.41 representing a 13.7% increase over 2004 earnings per share of $3.00. Diluted earnings per share were positively impacted during 2005 by a decrease in the weighted average shares outstanding, which were 281.0 million in 2005 compared to 296.9 million in 2004. The decrease in weighted average shares outstanding was due primarily to the Companys repurchase of 21.4 million shares of common stock that occurred during 2005. The Companys share repurchases are discussed in further detail under Liquidity and Capital Resources. The Company paid dividends in 2005 of $.125 per share in March, $.16 per share in June and September and $.18 per share in December. The aggregate annual dividend paid in 2005 was $.625 per share, representing a 54.3% increase over the aggregate annual dividend of $.405 per share in 2004. Motorcycle Unit Shipments and Net Revenue The following table includes wholesale motorcycle unit shipments and net revenue for the Motorcycles segment for 2005 and 2004 (dollars in millions): 2005 2004 Increase (Decrease) % Change Motorcycle Unit Shipments Touring motorcycle units 110,193 93,305 16,888 18.1 % Custom motorcycle units* 148,609 154,163 (5,554 ) (3.6 ) Sportster motorcycle units 70,215 69,821 394 0.5 Harley Davidson motorcycle units 329,017 317,289 11,728 3.7 Buell motorcycle units 11,166 9,857 1,309 13.3 Total motorcycle units 340,183 327,146 13,037 4.0 % Net Revenue Harley Davidson motorcycles $ 4,183.5 $ 3,928.2 $ 255.3 6.5 % Buell motorcycles 93.1 79.0 14.1 17.8 Total motorcycles 4,276.6 4,007.2 269.4 6.7 Parts & Accessories 815.7 781.6 34.1 4.4 General Merchandise 247.9 223.7 24.2 10.8 Other 2.0 2.7 (0.7 ) (19.5 ) Net revenue $ 5,342.2 $ 5,015.2 $ 327.0 6.5 % *Custom motorcycle units, as used in this table, include Softail, Dyna, VRSC and other custom models. During 2005, Harley Davidson motorcycle revenue was up 6.5% over 2004 due primarily to an increase in Harley Davidson motorcycle shipments of 11,728 units. Harley Davidson motorcycle revenue also benefited during 2005 from a favorable change in product mix which related primarily to an increase in the percentage of shipments consisting of higher priced touring motorcycles. Touring motorcycles made up 33.5% of shipments in 2005 compared to 29.4% in 2004. 31 Harley Davidson motorcycle revenue was also impacted during 2005 by changes in average wholesale prices and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Wholesale price increases on 2006 model year motorcycles averaged approximately 1% and resulted in approximately $17.0 million of higher revenue during 2005 when compared to 2004. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates, related primarily to European currencies, resulted in approximately $7.0 million of higher revenue during 2005 when compared to 2004. During 2005, net revenue from Parts and Accessories (P&A) was up 4.4% over 2004. P&A revenue growth in 2005 was driven by the increase in Harley Davidson motorcycle shipments. On a long term basis, the Company expects the growth rate for P&A revenue to be slightly higher than the growth rate for Harley Davidson motorcycle units.(1) General Merchandise revenue during 2005 was 10.8% higher than the prior year. The Company expects that the long term growth rate for General Merchandise revenue will be lower than the growth rate for Harley Davidson motorcycle units.(1) Harley Davidson Motorcycle Retail Sales The Companys wholesale motorcycle unit shipments are retailed through an independent worldwide dealer network. Worldwide retail sales of Harley Davidson motorcycles grew 6.2% during 2005 over the prior year. Retail sales of Harley Davidson motorcycles increased 4.2% in the United States and 15.0% internationally, when compared to 2004. On an industry wide basis the heavyweight (651+cc) portion of the market was up 4.8% in the United States and down 1.0% in Europe, when compared to 2004. The following table includes retail unit sales of Harley Davidson motorcycles for 2005 and 2004 (units in thousands): Harley Davidson Motorcycle Retail Sales (a) Heavyweight (651+cc) 2005 2004 % Change United States 253.4 243.2 4.2 % Europe (b) 29.5 24.6 19.9 Japan 11.4 10.3 11.1 Canada 11.7 11.2 4.1 All other markets 11.2 9.3 19.4 Total Harley Davidson retail sales 317.2 298.6 6.2 % (a) Data source for all 2005 retail sales figures shown above is sales and warranty registrations provided by Harley Davidson dealers and compiled by the Company. The Company must rely on information that its dealers supply concerning retail sales and this information is subject to revision. 2004 retail sales figures shown above conform to sales and warranty registration information as of December 31, 2004 and vary from previously published Motorcycle Industry Council, Giral S.A. and Japan Industry source data. (b) Europe retail sales includes sales in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.

Gross Profit Gross profit was $2.04 billion for the Motorcycles segment during 2005, an increase of $141.0 million or 7.4% over gross profit in 2004. Gross profit margin for 2005 was 38.2% compared to 37.9% during 2004. During 2005, the increase in gross margin was due in large part to the favorable motorcycle product mix shipped during the year. Gross margin also benefited during 2005 from 2006 model year wholesale price increases, lower costs which resulted from manufacturing efficiencies and a decrease in cost related to the Companys short term incentive compensation plan. However, the positive impact of these changes was partially offset by an increase in raw material costs which were $34.0 million higher in 2005 than in 2004. The Company will continue to closely monitor raw material prices in 2006. Financial Services The following table includes the condensed statements of operations for the Financial Services segment (which consists of HDFS) for 2005 and 2004 (in millions): 2005 2004 Increase (Decrease) % Change Interest income $ 129.9 $ 102.2 $ 27.7 27.1 % Income from securitizations 123.1 115.1 8.0 7.0 Other income 78.6 88.0 (9.4 ) (10.6 ) Financial services income 331.6 305.3 26.3 8.6 Interest expense 36.2 22.7 13.5 59.1 Operating expenses 103.8 94.0 9.8 10.5 Financial services expense 140.0 116.7 23.3 20.0 Operating income from financial services $ 191.6 $ 188.6 $ 3.0 1.6 % Operating income from financial services in 2005 increased slightly over 2004 driven by higher interest and securitization income, partially offset by lower other income and higher interest and operating expenses. During 2005, interest income benefited from increased retail and wholesale average outstanding receivables and higher wholesale lending rates as compared to 2004. The reduction in other income was primarily due to lower revenues from insurance commissions and related products. Interest expense was higher in 2005 due to increased borrowings, in support of higher average outstanding receivables, and higher borrowing costs as compared to 2004. Income from securitizations in 2005 was higher due to an increase in income on the investment in retained securitization interests, partially offset by lower gains on 2005 securitization transactions. During 2005, income on the investment in retained securitization interests was $76.6 million, an increase of $19.8 million over 2004, due primarily to higher income on prior years securitization transactions. During 2005, HDFS sold $2.48 billion in retail motorcycle loans through securitization transactions resulting in gains of $46.6 million. This compares with gains of $58.3 million on $1.88 billion of loans securitized during 2004. The 2005 gain as a percentage of loans sold was 1.9% as compared to 3.1% for 2004. The 2005 gain as a percentage of the amount of loans securitized was lower than the prior year due to rising market interest rates, the competitive environment for motorcycle lending and the full year cost of an enhanced dealer participation program introduced in May 2004. Under HDFS dealer participation program, HDFS pays Harley Davidson dealers for originating retail motorcycle loans. HDFS expects that the gain on the first quarter 2006 securitization transaction, as a percentage of loans sold, will be in the range of 1.0% to 1.4%.(1) Over the long term, the Company expects that the Financial Services operating income growth rate will be slightly higher than the Companys wholesale unit shipment growth rate.(1) 33 Changes in the allowance for credit losses during 2005 and 2004 were as follows (in millions): 2005 2004 Balance, beginning of period $ 30.3 $ 31.3 Provision for credit losses 3.3 3.1 Charge offs, net of recoveries (7.4 ) (4.1 ) Balance, end of period $ 26.2 $ 30.3 HDFS periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is generally based on HDFS past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, and current economic conditions. HDFS believes the allowance is adequate to cover the losses of principal and accrued interest in the existing portfolio. Included in charge offs, net of recoveries are $1.8 million and $3.7 million of recoveries in 2005 and 2004, respectively, received by HDFS from HDMC. These recoveries relate to guarantees provided by HDMC on wholesale loans to independent European Harley Davidson dealers. Operating Expenses The following table includes operating expenses for the Motorcycles segment and Corporate for 2005 and 2004 (in millions): 2005 2004 Increase % Change Motorcycles $ 740.6 $ 710.0 $ 30.6 4.3 % Corporate 21.5 16.6 4.9 29.1 Total operating expenses $ 762.1 $ 726.6 $ 35.5 4.9 % The increase in operating expenses during 2005 was driven primarily by higher costs related to marketing and advertising activities and stock compensation expense, partially offset by a decrease in expense related to the Companys short term incentive compensation plan. As discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company began expensing the cost of its employee stock option awards on January 1, 2005. As a result, the Company recorded $23.0 million of stock compensation expense in 2005 of which $18.9 million was included in operating expenses. Operating expenses, which includes selling, administrative and engineering expenses, were 14.3% and 14.5% of net revenue for 2005 and 2004, respectively. Investment Income, net Investment income, net in 2005 was $22.8 million, compared to $23.1 million in 2004. Net investment income was lower in 2005 due to a decrease in the average balance of cash and marketable securities on hand; however, this impact was mostly offset by the effect of a higher average return in 2005 when compared to 2004. Other, net Other, net expense was $5.0 million and $5.1 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Other net expense consists of charitable contributions. Consolidated Income Taxes The Companys effective income tax rate was 35.5% during both 2005 and 2004. The Company expects that the income tax rate will be 35.5% during 2006.(1) 34 Results of Operations 2004 Compared to 2003 Overall Net revenue for 2004 totaled $5.02 billion, a $390.9 million or 8.5% increase over 2003. Net income for 2004 was $889.8 million compared to $760.9 million in 2003, an increase of 16.9%. Diluted earnings per share for 2004 were $3.00 on 296.9 million weighted average shares outstanding, compared to $2.50 on 304.5 million weighted average shares outstanding in 2003, an increase in earnings per share of 20.0%. The Company paid dividends in 2004 of $.08 per share in March, $.10 per share in June and September and $.125 per share in December. The aggregate annual dividend paid in 2004 was $.405 per share, representing a 108% increase over the aggregate annual dividend of $.195 per share in 2003. Motorcycle Unit Shipments and Net Revenue The following table includes wholesale motorcycle unit shipments and net revenue for the Motorcycles segment for 2004 and 2003 (dollars in millions): 2004 2003 Increase (Decrease) % Change Motorcycle Unit Shipments Touring motorcycle units 93,305 82,577 10,728 13.0 % Custom motorcycle units* 154,163 151,405 2,758 1.8 Sportster motorcycle units 69,821 57,165 12,656 22.1 Harley Davidson motorcycle units 317,289 291,147 26,142 9.0 Buell motorcycle units 9,857 9,974 (117 ) (1.2 ) Total motorcycle units 327,146 301,121 26,025 8.6 % Net Revenue Harley Davidson motorcycles $ 3,928.2 $ 3,621.5 $ 306.7 8.5 % Buell motorcycles 79.0 76.1 2.9 3.9 Total motorcycles 4,007.2 3,697.6 309.6 8.4 Parts & Accessories 781.6 712.8 68.8 9.7 General Merchandise 223.7 211.4 12.3 5.8 Other 2.7 2.5 0.2 8.0 Net revenue $ 5,015.2 $ 4,624.3 $ 390.9 8.5 % *Custom motorcycle units, as used in this table, include Softail, Dyna, VRSC and other custom models. The increase in net revenue for the Motorcycles segment during 2004 was driven by the $306.7 million or 8.5% increase in Harley Davidson motorcycle net revenue. Harley Davidson motorcycle revenue was higher primarily as a result of the 9.0% increase in units shipped. Harley Davidson motorcycle revenue also benefited from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which resulted in $46.4 million of higher revenue during 2004. However, the benefit from exchange rates was offset by lower revenue due to changes in product mix and lower average wholesale prices, as discussed below. During 2004, Harley Davidson motorcycle revenue was impacted by changes in product mix related primarily to an increase in the percentage of shipments consisting of lower priced Sportster motorcycles and a decrease in the percentage of shipments consisting of more expensive Custom motorcycles. Sportsters are an important part of the Companys strategy to attract new customers to the Harley Davidson family. The Company introduced a completely redesigned family of Sportster models in September 2003, and demand for the redesigned models has continued to drive increases in Sportster shipments throughout 2004. The percentage of shipments consisting of Sportster motorcycles was 22.0% in 2004, up from 19.6% in 2003. As a result, the percentage of shipments consisting of Custom motorcycles was also impacted during 2004. 35 Harley Davidson motorcycle revenue was also impacted by changes in average wholesale prices. Wholesale prices on the 2004 models reflected the elimination of 100th Anniversary special edition features and, as a result, were slightly lower than the wholesale prices for the 100th Anniversary models sold during 2003. Wholesale prices on 2005 model year motorcycles were higher than model year 2004 prices; however, the positive revenue impact from the 2005 model year price increase only partially offset the impact of the lower 2004 model year pricing. During 2004, net revenue from Parts and Accessories totaled $781.6 million, a 9.7% increase over 2003. P&A revenue growth in 2004 was driven by the increase in Harley Davidson motorcycle shipments and also benefited from favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. General Merchandise revenue during 2004 was $223.7 million, up 5.8% over 2003. Harley Davidson Motorcycle Retail Sales The Companys wholesale motorcycle unit shipments are retailed through an independent worldwide dealer network. Worldwide retail sales of Harley Davidson motorcycles grew 6.0% during 2004 over the prior year. Retail sales of Harley Davidson motorcycles increased 7.1% in the United States and 1.6% internationally, when compared to 2003. On an industry wide basis the heavyweight (651+cc) portion of the market was up 7.1% in the United States and 4.1% in Europe, when compared to 2003. The following table includes retail unit sales of Harley Davidson motorcycles for 2004 and 2003 (units in thousands): Harley Davidson Motorcycle Retail Sales (a) Heavyweight (651+cc) 2004 2003 % Change United States 243.2 227.1 7.1 % Europe (b) 24.6 26.0 (5.3 ) Japan 10.3 10.4 (0.9 ) Canada 11.2 9.8 14.6 All other markets 9.3 8.3 11.0 Total Harley Davidson retail sales 298.6 281.6 6.0 % (a) The Company must rely on information that its dealers supply concerning retail sales and this information is subject to revision. Data source for all 2004 and 2003 retail sales figures shown above is sales and warranty registrations provided by Harley Davidson dealers and compiled by the Company as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The retail sales figures shown above vary from previously published Motorcycle Industry Council, Giral S.A. and Japan Automobile Importers Association data. (b) Europe retail sales includes sales in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.

(b) Europe data provided by Giral S.A., includes retail sales in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. 36 Gross Profit Gross profit for 2004 totaled $1.90 billion, an increase of $234.0 million or 14.0% over 2003. Gross margin was 37.9% in 2004, up from 36.0% for 2003. During 2004, gross margin was positively impacted by lower production costs and changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which more than offset the impact of product mix changes discussed under Net Revenue. In 2004, production costs were lower due to manufacturing efficiencies, but also benefited from a new and fully integrated Softail factory in York, Pennsylvania. During the second half of 2003, the Company experienced higher costs and inefficiencies associated with the rampup of the new Softail factory. Finally, during 2004, changes in foreign currency exchange rates resulted in $38.5 million of higher gross profit when compared to 2003. Price increases in the metal markets during 2004 did not have a significant impact on the Companys gross profit. The majority of the metal market price increases were managed by the Companys suppliers. During 2004, the Company incurred metal surcharges from some of its suppliers of approximately $9 million. Financial Services The following table includes the condensed statements of operations for the Financial Services segment for 2004 and 2003 (in millions): 2004 2003 Increase % Change Interest income $ 102.2 $ 87.1 $ 15.1 17.4 % Income from securitizations 115.1 114.4 0.7 0.6 Other income 88.0 78.0 10.0 12.8 Financial services income 305.3 279.5 25.8 9.2 Interest expense 22.7 17.6 5.1 28.9 Operating expenses 94.0 94.0 0.0 Financial services expense 116.7 111.6 5.1 4.5 Operating income from financial services $ 188.6 $ 167.9 $ 20.7 12.3 % The increase in operating income from financial services in 2004 was driven by continued strong marketplace acceptance of HDFS finance and insurance products. During 2004, income from securitizations was up slightly over 2003 as the increase in income on investment in retained securitization interests was mostly offset by lower gains on current year securitization transactions. During 2004, income on investment in retained securitization interests was $56.8 million, an increase of $24.6 million over 2003, due primarily to higher income on prior years securitization transactions. During 2004, HDFS sold $1.88 billion of retail motorcycle loans through securitization transactions resulting in gains of $58.3 million. During 2003, HDFS sold approximately $1.75 billion of retail motorcycle loans resulting in gains of $82.2 million. The gain as a percentage of the amount of loans securitized was lower when compared with the prior years gain due to rising market interest rates during 2004 and the cost of an enhanced dealer participation program that was introduced in May 2004. Changes in the allowance for credit losses during 2004 and 2003 were as follows (in millions): 2004 2003 Balance, beginning of period $ 31.3 $ 31.0 Provision for credit losses 3.1 4.1 Charge offs, net of recoveries (4.1 ) (3.8 ) Balance, end of period $ 30.3 $ 31.3 37 HDFS periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is generally based on HDFS past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, and current economic conditions. HDFS believes the allowance is adequate to cover the losses of principal and accrued interest in the existing portfolio. Included in charge offs, net of recoveries are $3.7 million and $1.3 million of recoveries in 2004 and 2003, respectively, received by HDFS from HDMC. These recoveries relate to guarantees provided by HDMC on wholesale loans to independent European Harley Davidson dealers. Operating Expenses The following table includes operating expenses for the Motorcycles segment and Corporate for 2004 and 2003 (in millions): 2004 2003 Increase % Change Motorcycles $ 710.0 $ 668.7 $ 41.3 6.2 % Corporate 16.6 15.5 1.1 7.3 Total operating expenses $ 726.6 $ 684.2 $ 42.4 6.2 % The increase in operating expenses in 2004 was driven by overall growth in the Motorcycles business combined with the Companys ongoing investment in specific initiatives designed to support its growth objectives. Operating expenses, which include selling, administrative and engineering expenses, were 14.5% and 14.8% of net revenue for 2004 and 2003, respectively. Investment Income, net Investment income, net in 2004 was $23.1 million, even with $23.1 million in 2003. In connection with the Companys capacity expansion efforts, $3.9 million of interest cost was capitalized during 2003; no amounts were capitalized during 2004. Other, net Other, net expense was $5.1 million and $6.3 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Other, net expense consists primarily of charitable contributions in 2004 and 2003. Consolidated Income Taxes The Companys effective income tax rate was 35.5% and 34.7.% during 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Companys effective income tax rate increased as pretax income grew faster than certain permanent tax differences. 38 Other Matters Accounting Changes As discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company began expensing the cost of stock options on January 1, 2005, when it adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004) Share Based Payment. The Companys total 2005 stock compensation expense, including stock option and nonvested stock awards, was $23.0 million, or $14.5 million net of taxes. Critical Accounting Policies The Companys financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies, which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions. Management believes that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of accounting policies that currently affect the Companys financial condition and results of operations. Finance Receivable Securitizations The Company sells retail motorcycle loans through securitization transactions utilizing qualifying special purpose entities (QSPEs) as defined by SFAS No. 140 Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. Upon sale of retail loans in a securitization transaction, HDFS receives cash and retains an interest in excess cash flows, servicing rights and cash reserve account deposits, all of which are collectively referred to as retained interests in the securitized receivables. Retained interests are carried at fair value and periodically reviewed for impairment. Market value quotes are generally not available for retained interests; therefore, HDFS estimates fair value based on the present value of future expected cash flows using managements best estimates of the key assumptions for credit losses, prepayment speeds and discount rates. The impact of changes to key assumptions is shown in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Gains on current year securitizations from the sale of retail loans are recorded as a component of financial services income and are based in part on certain assumptions including expected credit losses, prepayment speed, and discount rates. Gains on sales of retail loans also depend on the original carrying amount of the retail loans, which is allocated between the assets sold and the retained interests based on their relative fair value at the date of transfer. Finance Receivable Credit Losses The allowance for uncollectible accounts is maintained at a level management believes is adequate to cover the losses of principal and accrued interest in the existing finance receivables portfolio. Managements periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is generally based on HDFS past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, current economic conditions, specific borrowers ability to repay and the estimated value of any underlying collateral. Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits Retirement Plan (Pension, SERPA and Postretirement health care) obligations and costs are developed from actuarial valuations. The valuation of benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs relies on key assumptions including discount rates, long term expected return on plan assets, future compensation and healthcare cost trend rates. The Company evaluates and updates all of its assumptions annually on September 30, the actuarial measurement date. As of its most recent measurement date the Company lowered its discount rate assumption from 6.25% to 5.5%, and reset its assumption for healthcare cost trend rates. These changes were reflected immediately in the benefit obligation and will be amortized into net periodic benefit costs over future periods, resulting in an increase in future service and interest costs. 39 Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits (continued) The discount rate and healthcare cost trend rate assumptions are impacted by short term changes in external economic factors and as result they can be volatile. The Companys 2006 Retirement Plan costs have already been determined in connection with the September 30, 2005 measurement process. However, a change in either of these two assumptions could have an impact on the valuation of costs as of the Companys next measurement date, September 30, 2006. The following information is provided to illustrate the sensitivity of these obligations and costs to changes in these major assumptions (in thousands). Amounts based on current assumptions Impact of a 1% decrease in the discount rate Impact of a 1% increase in the healthcare cost trend rate 2005 Net periodic benefit costs Pension and SERPA $ 47,845 $ 19,004 n/a Postretirement healthcare $ 24,521 $ 3,626 $ 1,606 2005 Benefit obligations Pension and SERPA $ 963,824 $ 166,366 n/a Postretirement healthcare $ 298,340 $ 38,820 $ 15,639 This information should not be viewed as predictive of future amounts. The calculation of Retirement Plan obligations and costs is based on many factors in addition to those discussed here. This information should be considered in combination with the information provided in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual Obligations A summary of the Companys expected payments for significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2005 is as follows (in thousands): 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total Principal payments on finance debt $ 204,973 $ 415,288 $ 584,712 $ $ 1,204,973 Interest payments on finance debt 49,999 86,337 30,415 166,751 Operating lease payments 7,449 8,055 6,669 12,852 35,025 $ 262,421 $ 509,680 $ 621,796 $ 12,852 $ 1,406,749 As described in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2005, long term finance debt issued by HDFS included outstanding commercial paper and advances under the Global Credit Facility totaling $385 million. The amount classified as long term is supported by the Global Credit Facility, due September 2009; accordingly, the Company has assumed that this amount will be repaid in 2009. Interest obligations include the impact of interest rate hedges outstanding as of December 31, 2005. Interest for floating rate instruments, as calculated above, assumes December 31, 2005 rates remain constant. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had no material purchase obligations other than those created in the ordinary course of business related to inventory and property, plant and equipment which generally have terms of less than 90 days. The Company has long term obligations related to its pension and postretirement plans at December 31, 2005. Due to the current funded status of the pension plans, the Company has no minimum funding requirements for 2006. The Companys expected future contributions to these plans are provided in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 40 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of its securitization program, HDFS transfers retail motorcycle loans to a special purpose bankruptcy remote wholly owned subsidiary. The subsidiary sells the retail loans to a securitization trust in exchange for the proceeds from asset backed securities issued by the securitization trust. The asset backed securities, usually notes with various maturities and interest rates, are secured by future collections of the purchased retail installment loans. Activities of the securitization trust are limited to acquiring retail loans, issuing asset backed securities and making payments on securities to investors. Due to the nature of the assets held by the securitization trust and the limited nature of its activities, the securitization trusts are considered QSPEs as defined by SFAS No. 140. In accordance with SFAS No. 140, assets and liabilities of the QSPEs are not consolidated in the financial statements of the Company. HDFS does not guarantee payments on the securities issued by the securitization trusts or the projected cash flows from the related loans purchased from HDFS. The Companys retained securitization interests, excluding servicing rights, are subordinate to the interests of securitization trust investors. Such investors have priority interests in the cash collections on the retail loans sold to the securitization trust (after payment of servicing fees) and in the cash reserve account deposits. These priority interests ultimately could impact the value of the Companys investment in retained securitization interests. Investors also do not have recourse to assets of HDFS for failure of the obligors on the retail loans to pay when due. Total investment in retained securitization interests at December 31, 2005 was $349.7 million. The securitization trusts have a limited life and generally terminate upon final distribution of amounts owed to the investors in the asset backed securities. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of HDFS securitization program. Commitments and Contingencies The Company is subject to lawsuits and other claims related to environmental, product and other matters. In determining required reserves related to these items, the Company carefully analyzes cases and considers the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes, as well as the potential range of possible loss. The required reserves are monitored on an ongoing basis and are updated based on new developments or new information in each matter. Shareholder Lawsuits: A number of shareholder class action lawsuits were filed between May 18, 2005 and July 1, 2005 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin against the Company and some or all of the following Company officers: Jeffrey L. Bleustein, James M. Brostowitz, Jon R. Flickinger, John A. Hevey, Ronald M. Hutchinson, Gail A. Lione, James A. McCaslin, W. Kenneth Sutton, Jr., Donna F. Zarcone and James L. Ziemer. The complaints allege securities law violations and seek unspecified damages relating generally to the Companys April 13, 2005 announcement that it was reducing short term production growth and planned increases of motorcycle shipments from 317,000 units in 2004 to a new 2005 target of 329,000 units (compared to its original target of 339,000 units). Three shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin on June 3, 2005, October 25, 2005 (this lawsuit was later voluntarily dismissed) and December 2, 2005 and two shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed in Milwaukee County Circuit Court on July 22, 2005 and November 16, 2005 against some or all of the following directors and officers of the Company: Jeffrey L. Bleustein, James L. Ziemer, James M. Brostowitz, Barry K. Allen, Richard I. Beattie, George H. Conrades, Judson C. Green, Donald A. James, Sara L. Levinson, George L. Miles, Jr., James A. Norling, James A. McCaslin, Donna F. Zarcone, Jon R. Flickinger, Gail A. Lione, Ronald M. Hutchinson, W. Kenneth Sutton, Jr., and John A. Hevey. The lawsuits also name the Company as a nominal defendant. In general, the shareholder derivative complaints include factual allegations similar to those in the class action complaints and allegations that officers and directors breached their fiduciary duties to the Company. On July 11, 2005, the staff of the Enforcement Division of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) advised the Company that it is inquiring into matters relating generally to the Companys April 13, 2005 announcement and certain allegations contained in the shareholder complaints. The Company is cooperating with the SEC. 41 Shareholder Lawsuits (continued): On August 25, 2005, a class action lawsuit alleging violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin against the Company, the Administrative Committee of Harley Davidson, Inc., and the following Company employees, officers, and directors: Harold A. Scott, James M. Brostowitz, James L. Ziemer, Gail A. Lione, Barry K. Allen, Richard I. Beattie, Jeffrey L. Bleustein, George H. Conrades, Judson C. Green, Donald A. James, Sara L. Levinson, George L. Miles, Jr., and James A. Norling. In general, the ERISA complaint includes factual allegations similar to those in the shareholder class action lawsuits and alleges on behalf of participants in certain Harley Davidson retirement savings plans that the plan fiduciaries breached their ERISA fiduciary duties. The Company believes the allegations against all of the defendants in the lawsuits against the Company are without merit and it intends to vigorously defend against them. Since all of these matters are in the preliminary stages, the Company is unable to predict the scope or outcome or quantify their eventual impact, if any, on the Company. At this time the Company is also unable to estimate associated expenses or possible losses. The Company maintains insurance that may limit its financial exposure for defense costs and liability for an unfavorable outcome, should it not prevail, for claims covered by the insurance coverage. Cam Bearing Lawsuits: In January 2001, the Company, on its own initiative, notified each owner of 1999 and early 2000 model year Harley Davidson motorcycles equipped with Twin Cam 88 and Twin Cam 88B engines that the Company was extending the warranty for a rear cam bearing to 5 years or 50,000 miles. Subsequently, on June 28, 2001, a putative nationwide class action was filed against the Company in state court in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, which was amended by a complaint filed September 28, 2001. The complaint alleged that this cam bearing is defective and asserted various legal theories. The complaint sought unspecified compensatory and punitive damages for affected owners, an order compelling the Company to repair the engines, and other relief. On February 27, 2002, the Companys motion to dismiss the amended complaint was granted by the Court and the amended complaint was dismissed in its entirety. An appeal was filed with the Wisconsin Court of Appeals. On April 12, 2002, the same attorneys filed a second putative nationwide class action against the Company in state court in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin relating to this cam bearing issue and asserting different legal theories than in the first action. The complaint sought unspecified compensatory damages, an order compelling the Company to repair the engines and other relief. On September 23, 2002, the Companys motion to dismiss was granted by the Court, the complaint was dismissed in its entirety, and no appeal was taken. On January 14, 2003, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals reversed the trial courts February 27, 2002 dismissal of the complaint in the first action, and the Company petitioned the Wisconsin Supreme Court for review. On March 26, 2004, the Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals and dismissed the remaining claims in the action. On April 12, 2004, the same attorneys filed a third action in the state court in Milwaukee County, on behalf of the same plaintiffs from the action dismissed by the Wisconsin Supreme Court. This third action was dismissed by the court on July 26, 2004. In addition, the plaintiffs in the original case moved to reopen that matter and amend the complaint to add new causes of action. On September 9, 2004, Milwaukee County Circuit Court refused to allow the reopening or amendment. Plaintiffs again appealed to the Wisconsin Court of Appeals, and on December 13, 2005, the Court of Appeals again reversed the trial court. The Company has filed a petition for review with the Wisconsin Supreme Court, asking it to reinstate the trial courts decision. The Company believes that the 5 year/50,000 mile warranty extension it announced in January 2001 adequately addressed the condition for affected owners, and the Company intends to continue to vigorously defend this matter. Environmental Matters: The Company is involved with government agencies and groups of potentially responsible parties in various environmental matters, including a matter involving the cleanup of soil and groundwater contamination at its York, Pennsylvania, facility. The York facility was formerly used by the U.S. Navy and AMF prior to the purchase of the York facility by the Company from AMF in 1981. Although the Company is not certain as to the full extent of the environmental contamination at the York facility, it has been working with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) since 1986 in undertaking environmental investigation and remediation activities, including an ongoing site wide remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS). 42 In January 1995, the Company entered into a settlement agreement (the Agreement) with the Navy. The Agreement calls for the Navy and the Company to contribute amounts into a trust equal to 53% and 47%, respectively, of future costs associated with environmental investigation and remediation activities at the York facility (Response Costs). The trust administers the payment of the Response Costs incurred at the York facility as covered by the Agreement. In February 2002, the Company was advised by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that it considers some of the Companys remediation activities at the York facility to be subject to the EPAs corrective action program under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and offered the Company the option of addressing corrective action under a RCRA facility lead agreement. In July 2005, the York facility was designated as the first site in Pennsylvania to be addressed under the One Cleanup Program. The program provides a more streamlined and efficient oversight of voluntary remediation by both PADEP and EPA and will be carried out consistent with the Agreement with the Navy. As a result, the RCRA facility lead agreement has been superseded. Although the RI/FS is still under way and substantial uncertainty exists concerning the nature and scope of the additional environmental investigation and remediation that will ultimately be required at the York facility, the Company estimates that its share of the future Response Costs at the York facility will be approximately $7.0 million. The Company has established reserves for this amount, which are included in Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The estimate of the Companys future Response Costs that will be incurred at the York facility is based on reports of independent environmental consultants retained by the Company, the actual costs incurred to date, and the estimated costs to complete the necessary investigation and remediation activities. Response Costs related to the remediation of soil are expected to be incurred over a period of several years ending in 2010. Response Costs related to ground water remediation may continue for some time beyond 2010. However, these Response Costs are expected to be much lower than those related to the remediation of soil. Under the terms of the sale of the Commercial Vehicles Division in 1996, the Company has agreed to indemnify Utilimaster Corporation, until 2008, for certain claims related to environmental contamination present at the date of sale, up to $20.0 million. Based on the environmental studies performed the Company does not expect to incur any material expenditures under this indemnification. Product Liability Matters: Additionally, the Company is involved in product liability suits related to the operation of its business. The Company accrues for claim exposures that are probable of occurrence and can be reasonably estimated. The Company also maintains insurance coverage for product liability exposures. The Company believes that its accruals and insurance coverage are adequate and that product liability will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. 43 Liquidity and Capital Resources as of December 31, 2005 The Companys financial condition and cash generating capability are fundamental strengths and provide substantial flexibility in meeting the operating, investing and financing needs of the Company. This flexibility allows the Company to pursue its growth strategies and to enhance shareholder value through repurchasing common stock and paying dividends. The Company also has a commercial paper program, credit facilities and debt instruments in place to support the on going cash requirements of its Financial Services business. Cash and Marketable Securities Cash and marketable securities totaled $1.05 billion as of December 31, 2005 compared to $1.61 billion as of December 31, 2004. The decline is primarily attributable to common stock repurchases, higher dividend payments and benefit plan funding, all of which are discussed in more detail below. The Companys cash and cash equivalents are invested in short term securities to provide for immediate operating cash needs. The Company also invests in marketable securities consisting primarily of investment grade debt instruments such as corporate bonds and government backed securities with contractual maturities of approximately 1 year. Marketable securities also include auction rate securities which have contractual maturities of up to 30 years, but have interest re set dates that occur every 90 days or less and can be actively marketed at ongoing auctions that occur every 90 days or less. Operating Activities The Companys primary source of on going liquidity is cash flow from operations. The Company generated $960.5 million of cash from operating activities during 2005 compared to $832.2 million in 2004. In 2005, cash flows from operating activities included the impact of Company payments totaling $296.9 million to fund pension and postretirement healthcare benefits. The Companys cash flow from operating activities includes cash flows related to finance receivables held for sale. Prior to December 2005, the Company classified the cash flow effects of finance receivables held for sale as an investing activity in its Statements of Cash Flows. All prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. The effect of the reclassification on prior year net cash provided by operating activities and net cash used in investing activities is summarized in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2005 and 2004, HDFS originated $2.45 billion and $2.07 billion, respectively, of finance receivables that were classified as held for sale. Collections on finance receivables held for sale and proceeds from the sale of finance receivables resulted in cash inflows of $2.6 billion and $1.9 billion during 2005 and 2004, respectively. Investing Activities The Companys investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures, finance receivables activity and net changes in marketable securities. Net cash provided by investing activities was $177.1 million in 2005, compared to a use of $570.2 million during 2004. Sales and redemptions of marketable securities net of purchases provided $431.1 million during 2005. Marketable securities balances were reduced during 2005 primarily for the purpose of funding a portion of the Companys repurchase of common stock during the year. During 2004, the Company increased its investment in marketable securities resulting in a reduction to cash of $349.0 million. Capital expenditures were $198.4 million and $213.6 million during 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company estimates that total capital expenditures required in 2006 will be in the range of $250.0 to $275.0 million.(1) The Company anticipates it will have the ability to fund all capital expenditures in 2006 with internally generated funds.(1) 44 Financing Activities The Companys financing activities consist primarily of stock transactions, dividend payments and finance debt activity. Net cash used in financing activities during 2005 and 2004 was $1.27 billion and $316.1 million, respectively. During 2005, the Company repurchased 21.4 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of $1.05 billion. The Company repurchased 20.0 million shares under a general authorization received from the Companys Board of Directors in 2004. The remaining 1.4 million shares were repurchased under an authorization from the Companys Board of Directors that is designed to provide the Company with continuing authority to repurchase shares to offset dilution caused by the exercise of stock options. On April 30, 2005, the Companys Board of Directors separately authorized the Company to buy back up to 20.0 million shares of its common stock with no dollar limit or expiration date. No repurchases had been made under this authorization as of the end of 2005. Please see Part II, Item 5. Market for Harley Davidson, Inc. Common Stock and Related Shareholder Matters for additional detail regarding the Companys share repurchase activity and authorizations. During 2004, the Company repurchased 10.6 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of $564.1 million. The Company paid four dividends of $.125 per share, $.16 per share, $.16 per share and $.18 per share during 2005, at a total cost of $173.8 million, compared to dividends of $.08 per share, $.10 per share, $.10 per share and $.125 per share totaling $119.2 million during 2004. In addition to operating cash flow and asset backed securitizations, HDFS is financed by the issuance of commercial paper, borrowings under the revolving credit facility, medium term notes, senior subordinated debt and borrowings from the Company. HDFS outstanding debt consisted of the following as of December 31 (in thousands): 2005 2004 Commercial paper $ 416,797 $ 702,147 Credit facilities 172,965 168,309 589,762 870,456 Medium term notes 585,211 394,985 Senior subordinated notes 30,000 30,000 $ 1,204,973 $ 1,295,441 Credit Facilities HDFS has a $1.10 billion revolving credit facility (Global Credit Facility) due September 2009. Subject to certain limitations, HDFS has the option to borrow in various currencies. Interest is based on London interbank offered rates (LIBOR), European interbank offered rates or other short term indices, depending on the type of advance. The Global Credit Facility is a committed facility and HDFS pays a fee for its availability. Commercial Paper Subject to limitations, HDFS may issue commercial paper of up to $1.10 billion. Maturities may range up to 365 days from the issuance date. Outstanding commercial paper may not exceed the unused portion of the Global Credit Facility. As a result, the combined total of commercial paper and borrowings under the Global Credit Facility was limited to $1.10 billion as of December 31, 2005. Medium Term Notes HDFS has $400.0 million of 3.63% medium term notes outstanding which are due in December 2008, and during December 2005, issued $200.0 million of 5% medium term notes due in December 2010 (collectively referred to as Notes). The Notes provide for semi annual interest payments and principal due at maturity. At December 31, 2005, the Notes included a fair value adjustment reducing the balance by $14.7 million due to interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges. The effect of the interest rate swap agreements is to convert the interest rate on the Notes from a fixed to a floating rate, which is based on 3 month LIBOR. Senior Subordinated Debt HDFS has $30.0 million of 10 year senior subordinated notes outstanding which are due in 2007. 45 Intercompany Borrowing HDFS has a revolving credit line with the Company whereby HDFS may borrow up to $210.0 million from the Company at a market interest rate. As of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, HDFS had no outstanding borrowings owed to the Company under this agreement. The Company has a support agreement with HDFS whereby, if required, the Company agrees to provide HDFS with financial support in order to maintain certain financial covenants. Support may be provided at the Companys option as capital contributions or loans. Accordingly, certain debt covenants may restrict the Companys ability to withdraw funds from HDFS outside the normal course of business. No amount has ever been provided to HDFS under the support agreement. HDFS is subject to various operating and financial covenants related to the Global Credit Facility and the Notes and remains in compliance at December 31, 2005. The Company expects that future activities of HDFS will be financed from funds internally generated by HDFS, the sale of loans through securitization programs, issuance of commercial paper and medium term notes, borrowings under revolving credit facilities, advances or loans from the Company and subordinated debt. (1) Cautionary Statements The Companys ability to meet the targets and expectations noted in this Form 10 K depends upon, among other factors, the Companys ability to (i) continue to realize production efficiencies at its production facilities and effectively manage operating costs including materials, labor and overhead; (ii) successfully manage production capacity and production changes; (iii) avoid unexpected supply chain issues; (iv) provide products, services and experiences that are successful in the marketplace; (v) develop and implement sales and marketing plans that retain existing customers and attract new customers in an increasingly competitive marketplace; (vi) sell all of its motorcycles and related products and services to its independent dealers and distributors; (vii) continue to develop the capacity of its distributor and dealer network; (viii) avoid unexpected changes and prepare for known requirements in legislative and regulatory environments for its products and operations; (ix) successfully adjust to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices; (x) adjust to worldwide economic and political conditions, including changes in fuel prices and interest rates; (xi) successfully manage the credit quality and recovery rates of HDFSs loan portfolio; (xii) retain and attract talented employees and (xiii) detect any defects in our motorcycles to minimize delays in new model launches, recall campaigns, increased warranty costs or litigation. In addition, the Company could experience delays in the operation of manufacturing facilities as a result of work stoppages, natural causes, terrorism or other factors. These risks, potential delays and uncertainties regarding the costs could also adversely impact the Companys capital expenditure estimates (see Liquidity and Capital Resources section). In addition, see Risk Factors under Item 1A. which includes a discussion of additional risk factors and a more complete discussion of some of the cautionary statements noted above. 46 Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. To reduce such risks, the Company selectively uses derivative financial instruments. All hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to regularly reviewed policies and procedures, which prohibit the use of financial instruments for trading purposes. Sensitivity analysis is used to manage and monitor foreign exchange and interest rate risk. A discussion of the Companys accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and further disclosure relating to the fair value of derivative financial instruments is included in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company sells its products internationally and in most markets those sales are made in the foreign countrys local currency. As a result, the Companys earnings can be affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currency. The Company utilizes foreign currency contracts to mitigate the effect of these fluctuations on earnings. The foreign currency contracts are entered into with banks and allow the Company to exchange a specified amount of foreign currency for U.S. dollars at a future date, based on a fixed exchange rate. At December 31, 2005, these contracts represented a combined U.S. dollar equivalent of $150.0 million. The Company estimates that a uniform 10% weakening in the value of the dollar relative to the currency underlying these contracts would result in a decrease in the fair value of the contracts of approximately $17.9 million as of December 31, 2005. The Companys exposure to the Japanese yen is substantially offset by the existence of a natural hedge, which is sustained through offsetting yen cash inflows from sales with yen cash outflows for motorcycle component purchases and other operating expenses. HDFS earnings are affected by changes in interest rates. HDFS utilizes interest rate swaps to reduce the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on its securitization transactions and debt. As of December 31, 2005, HDFS had interest rate swaps outstanding with a notional value of $976.2 million. HDFS estimates that a 10% increase in interest rates would result in a $4.8 million decrease in the fair value of the agreements. 47
