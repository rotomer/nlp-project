The % Change figures included in the Results of Operations section have been calculated using unrounded dollar amounts and may differ from calculations using the rounded dollar amounts presented. Overview(1) The Companys net revenue for 2006 was $5.80 billion, up 8.6% over 2005 driven by a 6.1% increase in shipments of Harley Davidson motorcycles over 2005. Net income and diluted earnings per share for 2006 were up 8.7% and 15.2%, respectively, over 2005. The increase in diluted earnings per share includes the benefit of fewer weighted average shares outstanding when compared to the prior year. Weighted average shares outstanding were lower in 2006 than in 2005 as a result of the Companys repurchases of common stock occurring over the last two years. The Companys independent dealer network also reported growth over prior year with increases in retail motorcycle unit sales during 2006. Worldwide dealer retail sales of Harley Davidson motorcycles were up 8.5% in 2006 over 2005. In the United States, retail sales of Harley Davidson motorcycles grew 5.9% during 2006 when compared to the prior year. Internationally, retail sales were up 18.6% over 2005 with increases of 14.6% in Europe, 16.3% in Japan and 15.9% in Canada. Retail sales growth during 2006 was due in part to a positive worldwide response to the Companys new 2007 models. In July 2006, independent dealers began offering the Companys new 2007 model year motorcycles. The Companys 2007 model offering includes the new larger Twin Cam 96TM engine and a new six speed transmission for all Touring and Softail motorcycles, the addition of electronic fuel injection on all Sportster models and a number of new models and features. In addition, the Company believes that the continued momentum in international dealer retail sales is also due in part to the strategies that it has been implementing over the last couple of years. These strategies include improvements within the international dealer base, enhanced marketing programs and a more effective and efficient distribution of motorcycles worldwide.

Prior to the expiration of that contract the union voted to reject a proposed new collective bargaining agreement for employees and authorized a strike which began immediately following the expiration of the contract. On February 22, 2007, the Company reached a new agreement with the Union, ending the strike. The new contract with the York Union employees is a three year agreement expiring in February 2010. The Company is pleased with the agreement it has reached with its York Union employees. However, the disruption caused by the strike had a significant impact on the Companys business. As a result of the strike, the Company lost approximately four weeks of production at its York, Pennsylvania assembly facility and interrupted production at some of the Companys other manufacturing locations. The strike also adversely impacted its suppliers and employees and may adversely impact its independent dealers and retail customers. As a result of the strike and its related impact, the Company will not meet previously annuounced guidance for 2007. First quarter 2007 shipments of Harley Davidson motorcycles had been expected to be between 82,000 and 84,000 units. The Company has lowered its target range by 18,000 units, and now expects first quarter shipments of Harley Davidson motorcycles to be between 64,000 and 66,000 units. Over the remainder of 2007, the Company expects to make up approximately 4,000 to 5,000 of these motorcycle shipments, resulting in full year shipment plans for approximately 14,000 fewer motorcycles than originally planned. The Company arrived at this decision after carefully evaluating its production constraints, supply chain issues, cost implications, timing of shipments to dealers and the delayed start of 2008 model year production caused by the strike. The Companys revised plan for 2007 does not affect its previously stated plan to continue to grow revenue, although revenue growth in 2007 as a result of the strike is expected to be moderate. The Company continues to believe that shipments in its international markets will grow at a faster rate than in the U.S. market. The Companys growth will be driven by a focus on providing customers around the world with a continuous stream of exciting new motorcycles, surrounded by the unique Harley Davidson experience. Harley Davidson customers enjoy a unique lifestyle experience through organized rides and rallies, through membership in the Harley Owners Group (H.O.G.) organization, and through the use of MotorClothes merchandise and Harley Davidson Genuine Motor Accessories to personalize their experience. In 2007, the Company will experience inefficiencies and costs associated with the strike and the related make up plan which will have a negative impact on margins. Therefore, for 2007 the Company has revised its previous guidance of increasing margins and believes 2007 margins will be lower than margins experienced in 2006. The Company believes its manufacturing expertise and focus on operational excellence, and other factors, position it to continue to drive a net income growth rate in 2008 and 2009 that will be in excess of its revenue growth rate. Operational excellence involves employees and suppliers continuously pursuing process improvements and innovation. Over the last several years, the Company has made considerable strides in manufacturing efficiency and automation and believes there continue to be opportunities for improvement in these areas and across other parts of the organization. The Company also expects that other factors such as increased production, quality, product mix and pricing for features will continue to have a positive impact on margins. As the Company executes its plans, the Company believes its business model will continue to generate cash permitting it to invest in the business, fund future growth opportunities and return value to shareholders. The Companys expected annual capital expenditures are provided under Liquidity and Capital Resources. Prior to the strike, the Company had expected to deliver earnings per share growth of 11% to 17% annually through 2009 driven by solid revenue growth, margin improvement and the benefits of strong free cash flow. However, as a result of the strike and its related impact to the business in 2007, the Company has revised its expected earnings per share growth rate for 2007 to be in the range of 4% to 6%. The Company expects its earnings per share growth rate to return to 11% to 17% in 2008 and 2009. Results of Operations 2006 Compared to 2005 Overall Net revenue for 2006 totaled $5.80 billion, a $458.5 million or 8.6% increase over the prior year. Net income for 2006 was $1.04 billion compared to $959.6 million in 2005, an increase of 8.7%. Diluted earnings per share for 2006 were $3.93 representing a 15.2% increase over 2005 earnings per share of $3.41. Diluted earnings per share were positively impacted during 2006 by a decrease in the weighted average shares outstanding, which were 265.3 million in 2006 compared to 281.0 million in 2005. The decrease in weighted average shares outstanding was due primarily to the Companys share repurchases. The Company repurchased 19.3 million shares of common stock during 2006. The Companys share repurchases are discussed in further detail under Liquidity and Capital Resources. The Company paid dividends in 2006 of $.18 per share in March and $.21 per share in June, September and December. The aggregate annual dividend paid in 2006 was $.81 per share, representing a 29.6% increase over the aggregate annual dividend of $.625 per share in 2005. 31 Motorcycle Unit Shipments and Net Revenue The following table includes wholesale motorcycle unit shipments and net revenue for the Motorcycles segment for 2006 and 2005 (dollars in millions): Increase % 2006 2005 (Decrease) Change Motorcycle Unit Shipments Touring motorcycle units 123,444 110,193 13,251 12.0 % Custom motorcycle units* 161,195 148,609 12,586 8.5 % Sportster motorcycle units 64,557 70,215 (5,658 ) 8.1 % Harley Davidson motorcycle units 349,196 329,017 20,179 6.1 % Buell motorcycle units 12,460 11,166 1,294 11.6 % Total motorcycle units 361,656 340,183 21,473 6.3 % Net Revenue Harley Davidson motorcycles $ 4,553.6 $ 4,183.5 $ 370.1 8.8 % Buell motorcycles 102.2 93.1 9.1 9.8 % Total motorcycles 4,655.8 4,276.6 379.2 8.9 % Parts & Accessories 862.3 815.7 46.6 5.7 % General Merchandise 277.5 247.9 29.6 12.0 % Other 5.1 2.0 3.1 N/M Net revenue $ 5,800.7 $ 5,342.2 $ 458.5 8.6 % * Custom motorcycle units, as used in this table, include Softail, Dyna, VRSC and CVO models. During 2006, the Company shipped 349,196 Harley Davidson motorcycles, an increase of 20,179 or 6.1%, over 2005 shipments. International shipments grew faster than U.S. shipments with an increase of 21.6% in 2006, compared to a 2006 U.S. shipment increase of 2.5%. As a result, international shipments represented 21.8% of total Harley Davidson wholesale shipments in 2006, compared to 19.0% in 2005. The increase in international shipments as a percentage of total shipments is consistent with the Companys expectation that international growth will outpace domestic shipment growth.(1) During 2006, net revenue for the Motorcycles segment grew 8.6% or $458.5 million over 2005. Approximately $350 million of the increase in net revenue from 2005 to 2006 resulted from the higher shipment volumes of motorcycles and related products. Net revenue also benefited during 2006 from a favorable change in product mix and wholesale price increases. The changes to product mix occurring in 2006 resulted in approximately $70 million of higher revenue and related primarily to an increase in the percentage of shipments consisting of higher priced touring motorcycles. Touring motorcycles made up 35.4% of shipments in 2006 compared to 33.5% in 2005. During 2006, wholesale price increases on Harley Davidson motorcycles resulted in approximately $45 million of higher revenue when compared to 2005. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates resulted in approximately $10 million of lower net revenue during 2006 when compared to 2005. Harley Davidson Motorcycle Retail Sales The Companys wholesale motorcycle unit shipments are retailed through an independent worldwide dealer network. Worldwide retail sales of Harley Davidson motorcycles grew 8.5% during 2006 over the prior year. Retail sales of Harley Davidson motorcycles increased 5.9% in the United States and 18.6% internationally, when compared to 2005. On an industry wide basis, the heavyweight (651+cc) portion of the market was up 4.9% in the United States and up 7.5% in Europe, when compared to 2005. The following table includes retail unit sales of Harley Davidson motorcycles for 2006 and 2005 (units in thousands): 32 Harley Davidson Motorcycle Retail Sales(a) Heavyweight (651+cc) 2006 2005 Change United States 268.4 253.4 5.9 % Europe(b) 33.8 29.5 14.6 % Japan 13.3 11.4 16.3 % Canada 13.5 11.7 15.9 % All other markets 15.0 11.2 34.3 % Total Retail Sales 344.0 317.2 8.5 % (a) Data source for retail sales figures shown above is sales warranty and registration information provided by Harley Davidson dealers and compiled by the Company. The Company must rely on information that its dealers supply concerning retail sales and this information is subject to revision. (b) Data for Europe includes Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.

Industry retail motorcycle registration data is derived from information provided by Giral S.A., an independent agency. Data for 2005 has been adjusted to include competitor motorcycles that had previously not been included by the Company. The previously reported amount for 2005 was 332.8. Industry retail registration data for the remaining international markets has not been presented because the Company does not believe definitive and reliable registration data is available to the Company at this time. 33 Cost of Goods Sold During 2006, cost of goods sold for the Motorcycles segment increased $266.1 million over 2005, due primarily to the increase in shipment volumes for motorcycles and related products. During 2006, higher volumes resulted in an increase in cost of goods sold of approximately $225 million. Cost of goods sold was also higher in 2006 due to changes in product mix and increases in material costs, partially offset by lower foreign currency losses. Changes in Harley Davidson motorcycle product mix occurring in 2006 resulted in approximately $35 million of higher costs in 2006 compared to 2005, and increases in raw material costs primarily for metals were approximately $15 million in 2006 over 2005. Finally, net foreign currency transaction and hedging gains in 2006 compared to 2005 resulted in approximately $35 million of lower cost during 2006. Gross Profit Gross profit was $2.23 billion for the Motorcycles segment during 2006, an increase of $192.3 million or 9.4% over gross profit in 2005. Gross profit margin for 2006 was 38.5% compared to 38.3% during 2005. During 2006, the increase in gross margin was due primarily to wholesale price increases on Harley Davidson motorcycles, favorable Harley Davidson motorcycle product mix and favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as detailed under Revenue and Cost of Goods Sold above. Financial Services The following table includes the condensed statements of operations for the Financial Services segment (which consists of HDFS) for 2006 and 2005 (in millions): Increase % 2006 2005 (Decrease) Change Interest income $ 167.5 $ 129.9 $ 37.6 29.0 % Income from securitizations 111.2 123.1 (11.9 ) 9.7 % Other income 106.2 78.6 27.6 35.1 % Financial services income 384.9 331.6 53.3 16.1 % Interest expense 59.8 36.2 23.6 65.3 % Operating expenses 114.4 103.8 10.6 10.2 % Financial services expense 174.2 140.0 34.2 24.4 % Operating income from financial services $ 210.7 $ 191.6 $ 19.1 10.0 % During 2006, interest income benefited from increased retail and wholesale average outstanding receivables and higher retail and wholesale lending rates as compared to 2005. The increase in other income was primarily due to higher revenues from insurance commissions and related products and an increase in securitization servicing fee income. Interest expense was higher in 2006 due to increased borrowings, in support of higher average outstanding receivables, and higher borrowing costs as compared to 2005. Income from securitizations in 2006 was lower due to lower gains on 2006 securitization transactions, partially offset by an increase in income on the investment in retained securitization interests. During 2006, income on the investment in retained securitization interests was $78.9 million, an increase of $2.3 million over 2005. During 2006, HDFS sold $2.33 billion in retail motorcycle loans through securitization transactions resulting in gains of $32.3 million. This compares with gains of $46.6 million on $2.48 billion of loans securitized during 2005. The 2006 gain as a percentage of loans sold was 1.4% as compared to 1.9% for 2005. The 2006 gain as a percentage of the amount of loans securitized was lower than the prior year due to rising market interest rates and the competitive environment for motorcycle lending. In addition, during 2006, other comprehensive income includes unrealized losses of $20.9 million (pre tax) related to a decrease in the unrealized gain on the investment in retained securitization interests due primarily to higher expected losses on prior year securitization transactions. 34 Annualized losses on HDFS managed retail motorcycle loans totaled 1.41% in 2006 compared to 1.29% for the same period in 2005. This increase in losses reflects continued pressure on values for repossessed motorcycles. Managed retail loans include loans held by HDFS which are retained on the balance sheet as well as those sold through securitization. The 30 day delinquency rate for managed retail motorcycle loans at December 31, 2006 increased to 5.18% from 4.83% at December 31, 2005, and as a result it is expected that HDFS will experience higher credit losses as a percentage of managed retail motorcycle loans in 2007 as compared to 2006.(1) Changes in the allowance for credit losses during 2006 and 2005 were as follows (in millions): 2006 2005 Balance, beginning of period $ 26.2 $ 30.3 Provision for finance credit losses 5.9 3.3 Charge offs, net of recoveries (4.8 ) (7.4 ) Balance, end of period $ 27.3 $ 26.2 HDFS periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is generally based on HDFS past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio and current economic conditions. HDFS believes the allowance is adequate to cover the losses of principal and accrued interest in the existing portfolio. Included in charge offs, net of recoveries are $0.6 million and $1.8 million of recoveries in 2006 and 2005, respectively, received by HDFS from HDMC. These recoveries relate to guarantees provided by HDMC on wholesale loans to independent European Harley Davidson dealers. Operating Expenses The following table includes operating expenses for the Motorcycles segment and Corporate for 2006 and 2005 (in millions): % 2006 2005 Increase Change Motorcycles and Related Products Selling $ 302.1 $ 269.5 $ 32.6 12.1 % Administrative 330.1 284.9 45.2 15.9 % Engineering 186.2 186.2 0.0 % Corporate 22.7 21.5 1.2 5.6 % Total operating expenses $ 841.1 $ 762.1 $ 79.0 10.4 % Total operating expenses were 14.5% and 14.3% of net revenue for 2006 and 2005, respectively. During 2006, selling expenses were higher than the prior year due primarily to higher marketing and advertising expenses combined with increased international operating costs in connection with the Companys growth in those markets. The increase in administrative expenses during 2006 was driven primarily by a higher provision for future warranty costs which was approximately $44 million higher in 2006 compared to 2005. The increase in warranty costs was due primarily to higher costs associated with the Companys second year warranty program and higher product program costs. Beginning with shipments of 2004 model year motorcycles, the Company extended its warranty coverage from one to two years. During 2006, additional claims data became available which indicated that the cost of the second year warranty was higher than originally estimated. Based on the higher actual claims, the Company adjusted warranty reserves for the motorcycles affected, which were primarily 2004, 2005 and 2006 35 models. In addition, the Company announced a number of product programs during 2006 to address customer concerns and promote customer satisfaction. Under a product program, the Company contacts retail customers directly and pays for non safety related improvements that are covered by the Companys standard warranty. Investment Income, net Investment income, net in 2006 was $27.1 million, compared to $22.8 million in 2005. Net investment income was higher in 2006 primarily due to a higher average return in 2006 when compared to 2005. Other, net Other, net expense was $5.4 million and $5.0 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Other, net expense consists of charitable contributions. Provision for Income Taxes The Companys effective income tax rate was 35.8% during 2006 compared to 35.5% in 2005. This increase is due primarily to a relatively smaller benefit from the federal research and development tax credit and slightly higher state income taxes. 36 Results of Operations 2005 Compared to 2004 Overall Net revenue for 2005 totaled $5.34 billion, a $327.0 million or 6.5% increase over the prior year. Net income for 2005 was $959.6 million compared to $889.8 million in 2004, an increase of 7.8%. Diluted earnings per share for 2005 were $3.41 representing a 13.7% increase over 2004 earnings per share of $3.00. Diluted earnings per share were positively impacted during 2005 by a decrease in the weighted average shares outstanding, which were 281.0 million in 2005 compared to 296.9 million in 2004. The decrease in weighted average shares outstanding was due primarily to the Companys share repurchases. The Company repurchased of 21.4 million shares of common stock during 2005. The Companys share repurchases are discussed in further detail under Liquidity and Capital Resources. The Company paid dividends in 2005 of $.125 per share in March, $.16 per share in June and September and $.18 per share in December. The aggregate annual dividend paid in 2005 was $.625 per share, representing a 54.3% increase over the aggregate annual dividend of $.405 per share in 2004.

During 2005, the Company shipped 329,017 Harley Davidson motorcycle units, an increase of 11,728, or 3.7%, over 2004 shipments and net revenue grew 6.5% or $327.0 million over 2004. Approximately $229 million of the increase in net revenue from 2004 to 2005 resulted from the higher shipment volumes of motorcycles and related products. Net revenue also benefited during 2005 from a favorable change in product mix which resulted in higher revenue of approximately $58 million and related primarily to an increase in the percentage of shipments consisting of higher priced touring motorcycles. Net revenue was also impacted during 2005 by changes in average wholesale prices and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Wholesale price increases on 2006 model year motorcycles averaged approximately 1% and resulted in approximately $17 million of higher 37 revenue during 2005 when compared to 2004. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates, related primarily to European currencies, resulted in approximately $7 million of higher revenue during 2005 when compared to 2004. Harley Davidson Motorcycle Retail Sales The Companys wholesale motorcycle unit shipments are retailed through an independent worldwide dealer network. Worldwide retail sales of Harley Davidson motorcycles grew 6.2% during 2005 over the prior year. Retail sales of Harley Davidson motorcycles increased 4.2% in the United States and 15.0% internationally, when compared to 2004. On an industry wide basis the heavyweight (651+cc) portion of the market was up 4.8% in the United States and down 1.0% in Europe, when compared to 2004.

Industry retail motorcycle registration data is derived from information provided by Giral S.A., an independent agency. Data for 2005 and 2004 has been adjusted to include competitor motorcycles that were incorrectly excluded by the Company. The previously reported amounts for 2005 and 2004 were 332.8 and 336.2, respectively. Industry retail registration data for the remaining international markets has not been presented because the Company does not believe definitive and reliable registration data is available to the Company at this time. Cost of Goods Sold During 2005, cost of goods sold for the Motorcycles segment increased $186.1 million over 2004, due primarily to the increase in sales volumes for motorcycles and related products. During 2005, higher sales volumes resulted in an increase in cost of goods sold of approximately $119 million. Cost of goods sold for motorcycles and related products were also higher in 2005 due to changes in product mix, increases in material costs and foreign currency losses. Changes in Harley Davidson motorcycle product mix occurring in 2005 resulted in approximately $40 million of higher costs in 2005 compared to 2004 and increases in raw material costs primarily for metals were approximately $34 million in 2005 over 2004. Finally, net foreign currency transaction and hedging losses in 2005 compared to 2004 resulted in approximately $9 million of higher cost during 2005. These cost increases were partially offset by lower costs related to manufacturing efficiencies and lower short term incentive compensation. Gross Profit Gross profit was $2.04 billion for the Motorcycles segment during 2005, an increase of $141.0 million or 7.4% over gross profit in 2004. Gross profit margin for 2005 was 38.2% compared to 37.9% during 2004. During 2005, the increase in gross margin was due to favorable motorcycle product mix, model year wholesale price increases and lower costs due to manufacturing efficiencies and a decrease in cost related to the Companys short term incentive compensation plan. Financial Services The following table includes the condensed statements of operations for the Financial Services segment (which consists of HDFS) for 2005 and 2004 (in millions): Increase % 2005 2004 (Decrease) Change Interest income $129.9 $102.2 $27.7 27.1 % Income from securitizations 123.1 115.1 8.0 7.0 % Other income 78.6 88.0 (9.4 ) 10.6 % Financial services income 331.6 305.3 26.3 8.6 % Interest expense 36.2 22.7 13.5 59.1 % Operating expenses 103.8 94.0 9.8 10.5 % Financial services expense 140.0 116.7 23.3 20.0 % Operating income from financial services $191.6 $188.6 $3.0 1.6 % During 2005, interest income benefited from increased retail and wholesale average outstanding receivables and higher wholesale lending rates as compared to 2004. The reduction in other income was primarily due to lower 39 revenues from insurance commissions and related products. Interest expense was higher in 2005 due to increased borrowings, in support of higher average outstanding receivables, and higher borrowing costs as compared to 2004. Income from securitizations in 2005 was higher due to an increase in income on the investment in retained securitization interests, partially offset by lower gains on 2005 securitization transactions. During 2005, income on the investment in retained securitization interests was $76.6 million, an increase of $19.8 million over 2004, due primarily to higher income on prior years securitization transactions. During 2005, HDFS sold $2.48 billion in retail motorcycle loans through securitization transactions resulting in gains of $46.6 million. This compares with gains of $58.3 million on $1.88 billion of loans securitized during 2004. The 2005 gain as a percentage of loans sold was 1.9% as compared to 3.1% for 2004. The 2005 gain as a percentage of the amount of loans securitized was lower than the prior year due to rising market interest rates, the competitive environment for motorcycle lending and the full year cost of an enhanced dealer participation program introduced in May 2004. Under HDFS dealer participation program, HDFS pays Harley Davidson dealers for originating retail motorcycle loans. Changes in the allowance for credit losses during 2005 and 2004 were as follows (in millions): 2005 2004 Balance, beginning of period $ 30.3 $ 31.3 Provision for finance credit losses 3.3 3.1 Charge offs, net of recoveries (7.4 ) (4.1 ) Balance, end of period $ 26.2 $ 30.3 Included in charge offs, net of recoveries are $1.8 million and $3.7 million of recoveries in 2005 and 2004, respectively, received by HDFS from HDMC. These recoveries relate to guarantees provided by HDMC on wholesale loans to independent European Harley Davidson dealers. Operating Expenses The following table includes operating expenses for the Motorcycles segment and Corporate for 2005 and 2004 (in millions): Increase % 2005 2004 (Decrease) Change Motorcycles and Related Products Selling $ 269.5 $ 238.5 $ 31.0 13.0 % Administrative 284.9 291.6 (6.7 ) 2.3 % Engineering 186.2 179.9 6.3 3.5 % Corporate 21.5 16.6 4.9 29.5 % Total operating expenses $ 762.1 $ 726.6 $ 35.5 4.9 % Operating expenses were 14.3% and 14.5% of net revenue for 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in selling expenses during 2005 was driven primarily by higher costs related to marketing and advertising activities. Administrative and Corporate expenses include the impact of the Companys initial recognition of stock compensation expense. As discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company began expensing the cost of its employee stock option awards on January 1, 2005. As a result, the Company recorded $23.0 million of stock compensation expense in 2005 of which $16.9 million and $3.0 million 40 was included in administrative and corporate expenses, respectively. During 2005 administrative expenses were also impacted by a decrease in cost related to the Companys short term incentive plan, which more than offset the additional cost of stock compensation. Investment Income, net Investment income, net in 2005 was $22.8 million, compared to $23.1 million in 2004. Net investment income was lower in 2005 due to a decrease in the average balance of cash and marketable securities on hand; however, this impact was mostly offset by the effect of a higher average return in 2005 when compared to 2004. Other, net Other, net expense was $5.0 million and $5.1 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Other, net expense consists of charitable contributions. Provision for Income Taxes The Companys effective income tax rate was 35.5% during both 2005 and 2004. 41 Other Matters Accounting Changes In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Financial Interpretation No. (FIN) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company is required to adopt FIN 48 beginning in fiscal year 2007 and the impact that the adoption of FIN 48 will have on its consolidated financial statements and notes thereto is expected to be immaterial. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R). SFAS No. 158 requires employers that sponsor defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans to recognize previously unrecognized actuarial losses and prior service costs in the statement of financial position and to recognize future changes in these amounts in the year in which changes occur through comprehensive income. As a result, the statement of financial position will reflect the funded status of those plans as an asset or liability. Additionally, employers are required to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end statement of financial position. The Company was required to adopt SFAS No. 158, as it relates to recognizing the funded status of its defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans, and the related disclosure requirements, as of December 31, 2006. The requirement to measure the funded status as of the date of the year end statement of financial position is required by December 31, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the change in the measurement date will have on its consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. See Note 6 for further discussion of the effect of adopting SFAS No. 158 on the Companys consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. Critical Accounting Policies The Companys financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies, which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions. Management believes that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of accounting policies that currently affect the Companys financial condition and results of operations. Finance Receivable Securitizations The Company sells retail motorcycle loans through securitization transactions utilizing qualifying special purpose entities (QSPEs) as defined by SFAS No. 140 Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. Upon sale of retail loans in a securitization transaction, HDFS receives cash and retains an interest in excess cash flows, servicing rights and cash reserve account deposits, all of which are collectively referred to as retained interests in the securitized receivables. Retained interests are carried at fair value and are periodically reviewed for impairment. Market value quotes are generally not available for retained interests; therefore, HDFS estimates fair value based on the present value of future expected cash flows using managements best estimates of the key assumptions for credit losses, prepayment speeds and discount rates. The impact of changes to key assumptions is shown in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Gains on current year securitizations from the sale of retail loans are recorded as a component of financial services income and are based in part on certain assumptions including expected credit losses, prepayment speed, and discount rates. Gains on sales of retail loans also depend on the original carrying amount of the retail loans, which is allocated between the assets sold and the retained interests based on their relative fair value at the date of transfer. Finance Receivable Credit Losses The allowance for uncollectible accounts is maintained at a level management believes is adequate to cover the losses of principal and accrued interest in the existing finance receivables portfolio. Managements periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is generally based on HDFS past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, current economic conditions, specific borrowers ability to repay and the estimated value of any underlying collateral. 42 Product Warranty Estimated warranty costs are reserved for each motorcycle at the time of sale. The warranty reserve is an estimated cost per unit sold based upon historical Company claim data used in combination with other known factors that may affect future warranty claims. The Company updates its warranty estimates quarterly to ensure that the warranty reserves are based on the most current information available. The Company believes that past claim experience is indicative of future claims, however, the factors affecting actual claims can be volatile. As a result, actual claims experience may differ from estimated which could lead to material changes in the Companys warranty provision and related reserves. The Companys warranty liability is discussed further in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits Retirement Plan (Pension, SERPA and Postretirement health care) obligations and costs are developed from actuarial valuations. The valuation of benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs relies on key assumptions including discount rates, long term expected return on plan assets, future compensation and healthcare cost trend rates. The Company evaluates and updates all of its assumptions annually on September 30, the actuarial measurement date. The Company determines its discount rate assumptions by referencing high quality long term bond rates that are matched to the duration of its own benefit obligations. Based on this analysis, the discount rate was increased from 5.50% as of September 30, 2005 to 5.90% as of September 30, 2006. The Company determines its healthcare trend assumption by considering factors such as estimated health care inflation, the utilization of healthcare benefits and changes in the health of plan participants. Based on the Companys assessment of this data as of September 30, 2006, the Company reset its initial healthcare cost trend rate to 10% and extended the date it expects to reach its ultimate rate of 5% from 2010 to 2011. These assumption changes were reflected immediately in the benefit obligation and will be amortized into net periodic benefit costs over future periods. The following information is provided to illustrate the sensitivity of pension and postretirement healthcare obligations and costs to changes in these major assumptions (in thousands): Impact Amounts based Impact of a 1% of a 1% increase on current decrease in the in the healthcare assumptions discount rate cost trend rate 2006 Net periodic benefit costs Pension and SERPA $ 49,676 $ 18,189 n/a Postretirement healthcare $ 25,298 $ 2,567 $ 1,219 2006 Benefit obligations Pension and SERPA $ 976,712 $ 146,859 n/a Postretirement healthcare $ 324,985 $ 36,165 $ 13,532 This information should not be viewed as predictive of future amounts. The calculation of Retirement Plan obligations and costs is based on many factors in addition to those discussed here. This information should be considered in combination with the information provided in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Stock Compensation Costs The total cost of the Companys share based awards is equal to the grant date fair value per award multiplied by the number of awards granted (adjusted for forfeitures). This cost is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the service periods of the awards. Forfeitures are initially estimated based on historical Company information and subsequently updated over the life of the awards to ultimately reflect actual forfeitures. As a result, changes in forfeiture activity can influence the amount of stock compensation cost recognized from period to period. 43 The Company determines the number of share based awards granted by first determining the total cost of the award, which is a function of employee salary, level and performance. On the date of grant, the number of awards granted is then computed by dividing the total cost of the award by the grant date fair value of the individual award. The Company estimates the fair value of individual option awards as of the grant date using a lattice based option valuation model which utilizes ranges of assumptions over the expected term of the options, including stock price volatility, dividend yield and risk free interest rate. The valuation model uses historical data to estimate option exercise behavior and employee terminations. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. Expected volatilities were based on the historical volatility of the Companys stock. The Company determined that historical volatility provided a reasonable estimate for future volatility. Dividend yield was based on the Companys expected dividend policy and the risk free rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Changes in the valuation assumptions could result in a significant change to the individual cost of an award. However, the total cost of an award is also affected by the number of awards granted, and as result, may not reflect changes to the cost of individual awards. The Companys grants of share based awards are based on a consideration of the total cost of the grant. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and other loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. In calculating the provision for income taxes on an interim basis, the Company uses an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon the facts and circumstances known at each interim period. On a quarterly basis, the actual effective tax rate is adjusted as appropriate based upon the actual results as compared to those forecasted at the beginning of the fiscal year. The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the Companys worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related deferred tax assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of the Companys business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Accruals for tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 5 Accounting for Contingencies. A tax contingency reserve represents the difference between the recognition of benefits related to exposure items for income tax reporting purposes and financial reporting purposes. The tax contingency reserve is classified as a component of the current income taxes payable account, which is included within Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company adds interest and penalties, if applicable, each period to the reserve which is recorded as component of the overall income tax provision. The Company is regularly under audit by tax authorities. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, management believes that it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns and that its annual tax provision includes amounts sufficient to pay any assessments. Nonetheless, the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year. 44 Contractual Obligations A summary of the Companys expected payments for significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006 is as follows (in thousands): 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total Principal payments on finance debt $ 832,491 $ 671,231 $ 198,769 $ 1,702,491 Interest payments on finance debt 65,528 65,558 10,256 141,342 Operating lease payments 8,385 10,687 9,366 $ 18,195 46,633 $ 906,404 $ 747,476 $ 218,391 $ 18,195 $ 1,890,466 As described in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2006, long term finance debt issued by HDFS included outstanding commercial paper and advances under the Global Credit Facility totaling $283.6 million. The amount classified as long term is supported by the Global Credit Facility, due September 2009; accordingly, the Company has assumed that this amount will be repaid in 2009. Interest obligations include the impact of interest rate hedges outstanding as of December 31, 2006. Interest for floating rate instruments, as calculated above, assumes December 31, 2006 rates remain constant. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had no material purchase obligations other than those created in the ordinary course of business related to inventory and property, plant and equipment which generally have terms of less than 90 days. The Company has long term obligations related to its pension and postretirement plans at December 31, 2006. Due to the current funded status of the pension plans, the Company has no minimum funding requirements for 2007. The Companys expected future contributions to these plans are provided in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 45 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of its securitization program, HDFS transfers retail motorcycle loans to a special purpose bankruptcy remote wholly owned subsidiary. The subsidiary sells the retail loans to a securitization trust in exchange for the proceeds from asset backed securities issued by the securitization trust. The asset backed securities, usually notes with various maturities and interest rates, are secured by future collections of the purchased retail installment loans. Activities of the securitization trust are limited to acquiring retail loans, issuing asset backed securities and making payments on securities to investors. Due to the nature of the assets held by the securitization trust and the limited nature of its activities, the securitization trusts are considered QSPEs as defined by SFAS No. 140. In accordance with SFAS No. 140, assets and liabilities of the QSPEs are not consolidated in the financial statements of the Company. HDFS does not guarantee payments on the securities issued by the securitization trusts or the projected cash flows from the related loans purchased from HDFS. The Companys retained securitization interests, excluding servicing rights, are subordinate to the interests of securitization trust investors. Such investors have priority interests in the cash collections on the retail loans sold to the securitization trust (after payment of servicing fees) and in the cash reserve account deposits. These priority interests ultimately could impact the value of the Companys investment in retained securitization interests. Investors also do not have recourse to assets of HDFS for failure of the obligors on the retail loans to pay when due. Total investment in retained securitization interests at December 31, 2006 was $384.1 million. The securitization trusts have a limited life and generally terminate upon final distribution of amounts owed to the investors in the asset backed securities. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of HDFS securitization program. Commitments and Contingencies The Company is subject to lawsuits and other claims related to environmental, product and other matters. In determining required reserves related to these items, the Company carefully analyzes cases and considers the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes, as well as the potential range of possible loss. The required reserves are monitored on an ongoing basis and are updated based on new developments or new information in each matter. Shareholder Lawsuits: A number of shareholder class action lawsuits were filed between May 18, 2005 and July 1, 2005 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. On February 14, 2006, the court consolidated all of the actions into a single case, captioned In re Harley Davidson, Inc. Securities Litigation, and appointed Lead Plaintiffs and Co Lead Plaintiffs Counsel. Pursuant to the schedule set by the court, on October 2, 2006, the Lead Plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Class Action Complaint, which names the Company and Jeffrey L. Bleustein, James L. Ziemer, and James M. Brostowitz, who are Company officers, as defendants. The Consolidated Complaint alleges securities law violations and seeks unspecified damages relating generally to the Companys April 13, 2005 announcement that it was reducing short term production growth and planned increases of motorcycle shipments from 317,000 units in 2004 to a new 2005 target of 329,000 units (compared to its original target of 339,000 units). On December 18, 2006, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Consolidated Complaint in its entirety. Briefing of the motion to dismiss is anticipated to be completed in April 2007. Three shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin on June 3, 2005, October 25, 2005 (this lawsuit was later voluntarily dismissed) and December 2, 2005 and two shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed in Milwaukee County Circuit Court on July 22, 2005 and November 16, 2005 against some or all of the following current or former directors and officers of the Company: Jeffrey L. Bleustein, James L. Ziemer, James M. Brostowitz, Barry K. Allen, Richard I. Beattie, George H. Conrades, Judson C. Green, Donald A. James, Sara L. Levinson, George L. Miles, Jr., James A. Norling, James A. McCaslin, Donna F. Zarcone, Jon R. Flickinger, Gail A. Lione, Ronald M. Hutchinson, W. Kenneth Sutton, Jr. and John A. Hevey. The lawsuits also name the Company as a nominal defendant. In general, the shareholder derivative complaints include factual allegations similar to those in the class action complaints and allegations that officers and directors breached their fiduciary duties to the Company. On February 14, 2006, the state court consolidated the two state court derivative actions and appointed Lead Plaintiffs and Lead Plaintiffs counsel, and on April 24, 2006, the state court ordered that the consolidated state court derivative action be stayed until after motions to dismiss the federal securities class action are decided. On February 15, 2006, the federal court 46 consolidated the federal derivative lawsuits with the securities and ERISA (see below) actions for administrative purposes. On July 11, 2005, the staff of the Enforcement Division of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) advised the Company that it is inquiring into matters relating generally to the Companys April 13, 2005 announcement and certain allegations contained in the shareholder complaints. The Company is cooperating with the SEC. On August 25, 2005, a class action lawsuit alleging violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. As noted above, on February 15, 2006, the court ordered the ERISA action consolidated with the federal derivative and securities actions for administrative purposes. Pursuant to the schedule set by the court, on October 2, 2006, the ERISA plaintiff filed an Amended Class Action Complaint, which named the Company, the Harley Davidson Motor Company Retirement Plans Committee, the Companys Leadership and Strategy Council, Harold A. Scott, James L. Ziemer, James M. Brostowitz, Gail A. Lione, Joanne M. Bischmann, Karl M. Eberle, Jon R. Flickinger, Ronald M. Hutchinson, James A. McCaslin, W. Kenneth Sutton, Jr., and Donna F. Zarcone, who are current or former Company officers or employees, as defendants (the Company Defendants). In general, the ERISA complaint includes factual allegations similar to those in the shareholder class action lawsuits and alleges on behalf of participants in certain Harley Davidson retirement savings plans that the plan fiduciaries breached their ERISA fiduciary duties. On December 18, 2006, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the ERISA complaint in its entirety. Briefing of the motion to dismiss is anticipated to be completed in April 2007. The Company believes the allegations against all of the defendants in the lawsuits against the Company are without merit and it intends to vigorously defend against them. Since all of these matters are in the preliminary stages, the Company is unable to predict the scope or outcome or quantify their eventual impact, if any, on the Company. At this time, the Company is also unable to estimate associated expenses or possible losses. The Company maintains insurance that may limit its financial exposure for defense costs and liability for an unfavorable outcome, should it not prevail, for claims covered by the insurance coverage. Security Breach Lawsuit: On January 22, 2007, a purported class action lawsuit was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York against Harley Davidson, Inc. and the Harley Owners Group. The complaint alleges that the Company was negligent in failing to properly safeguard, protect and keep confidential the personal Customer Identifiable Information that was stored on a Company laptop computer that was lost on or about August 14, 2006. The complaint also alleges that Harley Davidson breached fiduciary duties and made false and fraudulent representations and warranties to its customers that it would keep confidential and safeguard and protect the personal customer information in its possession. The complaint seeks unspecified damages. The Company believes the allegations in the lawsuit are without merit and it intends to vigorously defend against them. Cam Bearing Lawsuit: In January 2001, the Company, on its own initiative, notified each owner of 1999 and early 2000 model year Harley Davidson motorcycles equipped with Twin Cam 88 and Twin Cam 88B engines that the Company was extending the warranty for a rear cam bearing to 5 years or 50,000 miles. Subsequently, on June 28, 2001, a putative nationwide class action was filed against the Company in state court in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, which was amended by a complaint filed September 28, 2001. The complaint alleged that this cam bearing is defective and asserted various legal theories. The complaint sought unspecified compensatory and punitive damages for affected owners, an order compelling the Company to repair the engines and other relief. On February 27, 2002, the Companys motion to dismiss the amended complaint was granted by the Court and the amended complaint was dismissed in its entirety. An appeal was filed with the Wisconsin Court of Appeals. On April 12, 2002, the same attorneys filed a second putative nationwide class action against the Company in state court in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin relating to this cam bearing issue and asserting different legal theories than in the first action. The complaint sought unspecified compensatory damages, an order compelling the Company to repair the engines and other relief. On September 23, 2002, the Companys motion to dismiss was granted by the Court, the complaint was dismissed in its entirety, and no appeal was taken. On January 14, 2003, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals reversed the trial courts February 27, 2002 dismissal of the complaint in the first 47 action, and the Company petitioned the Wisconsin Supreme Court for review. On March 26, 2004, the Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals and dismissed the remaining claims in the action. On April 12, 2004, the same attorneys filed a third action in the state court in Milwaukee County, on behalf of the same plaintiffs from the action dismissed by the Wisconsin Supreme Court. This third action was dismissed by the court on July 26, 2004. In addition, the plaintiffs in the original case moved to reopen that matter and amend the complaint to add new causes of action. On September 9, 2004, Milwaukee County Circuit Court refused to allow the reopening or amendment. Plaintiffs again appealed to the Wisconsin Court of Appeals, and on December 13, 2005, the Court of Appeals again reversed the trial court. On January 12, 2006, the Company filed a petition for review with the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Oral arguments were heard on September 7, 2006 and the Company is awaiting a decision from the court. The Company believes that the 5 year/50,000 mile warranty extension it announced in January 2001 adequately addressed the condition for affected owners, and the Company intends to continue to vigorously defend this matter. Environmental Matters: The Company is involved with government agencies and groups of potentially responsible parties in various environmental matters, including a matter involving the cleanup of soil and groundwater contamination at its York, Pennsylvania facility. The York facility was formerly used by the U.S. Navy and AMF prior to the purchase of the York facility by the Company from AMF in 1981. Although the Company is not certain as to the full extent of the environmental contamination at the York facility, it has been working with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) since 1986 in undertaking environmental investigation and remediation activities, including an ongoing site wide remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS). In January 1995, the Company entered into a settlement agreement (the Agreement) with the Navy. The Agreement calls for the Navy and the Company to contribute amounts into a trust equal to 53% and 47%, respectively, of future costs associated with environmental investigation and remediation activities at the York facility (Response Costs). The trust administers the payment of the Response Costs incurred at the York facility as covered by the Agreement. In February 2002, the Company was advised by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that it considers some of the Companys remediation activities at the York facility to be subject to the EPAs corrective action program under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and offered the Company the option of addressing corrective action under a RCRA facility lead agreement. In July 2005, the York facility was designated as the first site in Pennsylvania to be addressed under the One Cleanup Program. The program provides a more streamlined and efficient oversight of voluntary remediation by both PADEP and EPA and will be carried out consistent with the Agreement with the Navy. As a result, the RCRA facility lead agreement has been superseded. Although the RI/FS is still under way and substantial uncertainty exists concerning the nature and scope of the additional environmental investigation and remediation that will ultimately be required at the York facility, the Company estimates that its share of the future Response Costs at the York facility will be approximately $7.7 million. The Company has established reserves for this amount, which are included in Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The estimate of the Companys future Response Costs that will be incurred at the York facility is based on reports of independent environmental consultants retained by the Company, the actual costs incurred to date and the estimated costs to complete the necessary investigation and remediation activities. Response Costs related to the remediation of soil are expected to be incurred over a period of several years ending in 2012. Response Costs related to ground water remediation may continue for some time beyond 2012. However, these Response Costs are expected to be much lower than those related to the remediation of soil. Under the terms of the sale of the Commercial Vehicles Division in 1996, the Company has agreed to indemnify Utilimaster Corporation, until 2008, for certain claims related to environmental contamination present at the date of sale, up to $20.0 million. Based on the environmental studies performed, the Company does not expect to incur any material expenditures under this indemnification. 48 Product Liability Matters: Additionally, the Company is involved in product liability suits related to the operation of its business. The Company accrues for claim exposures that are probable of occurrence and can be reasonably estimated. The Company also maintains insurance coverage for product liability exposures. The Company believes that its accruals and insurance coverage are adequate and that product liability will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. 49 Liquidity and Capital Resources as of December 31, 2006 The Company expects that its business model will continue to generate cash that will allow it to invest in the business, fund future growth opportunities and return value to shareholders. (1) The Company also has a commercial paper program, credit facilities and debt instruments in place to support the ongoing cash requirements of its Financial Services business. Cash and Marketable Securities Cash and marketable securities totaled $896.5 million as of December 31, 2006 compared to $1.05 billion and $1.61 billion as of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively. The decline is primarily attributable to common stock repurchases and higher dividend payments, which are discussed in more detail below. The Companys cash and cash equivalents are invested in short term securities to provide for immediate operating cash needs. The Company also invests in marketable securities consisting primarily of investment grade debt instruments such as corporate bonds and government backed securities with contractual maturities of approximately one year. Marketable securities also include auction rate securities which have contractual maturities of up to 30 years, but have interest re set dates that occur every 90 days or less and can be actively marketed at ongoing auctions that occur every 90 days or less. Operating Activities The Companys primary source of ongoing liquidity is cash flow from operations. The Company generated $761.8 million of cash from operating activities during 2006 compared to $962.6 million and $835.8 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in operating cash flow from 2005 to 2006 is primarily attributable to HDFS completing only three securitization transactions in 2006 compared to four in 2005. Offsetting the reduction in operating cash flow were increased financing cash flows related to finance debt to support the increase in finance receivables held for sale at the end of 2006 as compared to 2005. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, HDFS originated $2.77 billion, $2.45 billion and $2.07 billion, respectively, of finance receivables that were classified as held for sale. Collections on finance receivables held for sale and proceeds from the sale of finance receivables resulted in cash inflows of $2.42 billion, $2.58 billion and $1.93 billion during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Investing Activities The Companys investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures, net changes in finance receivables and net changes in marketable securities. Net cash used by investing activities was $35.3 million in 2006, compared to a cash provide of $193.8 million in 2005 and a cash use of $578.0 million during 2004. Sales and redemptions of marketable securities net of purchases provided $253.5 million and $431.1 million during 2006 and 2005, respectively. During 2004, the net result was cash used of $349.0 million. Marketable securities balances were reduced during 2006 and 2005 primarily for the purpose of funding a portion of the Companys repurchase of common stock during the year. During 2004, the Company increased its investment in marketable securities. Capital expenditures were $219.6 million, $198.4 million and $213.6 million during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company estimates that total capital expenditures required in 2007 will be in the range of $300.0 to $325.0 million.(1) The anticipated increase compared to 2006 is primarily a result of expenditures related to the Companys powertrain facility expansion plans and the construction of the Harley Davidson museum. The Company anticipates it will have the ability to fund all capital expenditures in 2007 with internally generated funds. (1) 50 Financing Activities The Companys financing activities consist primarily of share repurchases, stock issuances, dividend payments and finance debt activity. Net cash used in financing activities during 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $637.0 million, $1.27 billion and $316.1 million, respectively. During 2006, the Company repurchased 19.3 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of $1.06 billion. The Company repurchased 17.2 million shares under a general authorization received from the Companys Board of Directors in 2005. The remaining 2.1 million shares were repurchased under an authorization from the Companys Board of Directors that is designed to provide the Company with continuing authority to repurchase shares to offset dilution caused by the exercise of stock options. In October 2006, the Companys Board of Directors separately authorized the Company to buy back up to 20.0 million shares of its common stock with no dollar limit or expiration date. No repurchases had been made under this authorization as of the end of 2006. Please see Part II, Item 5. Market for Harley Davidson, Inc. Common Stock and Related Shareholder Matters for additional detail regarding the Companys share repurchase activity and authorizations. During 2005 and 2004, the Company repurchased 21.4 million and 10.6 million shares, respectively, of its common stock at a total cost of $1.05 billion and $564.1 million, respectively. The Company paid total dividends of $0.81, $0.625 and $0.405 per share during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, at a total cost of $212.9 million, $173.8 million and $119.2 million, respectively. In addition to operating cash flow and asset backed securitizations, HDFS is financed by the issuance of commercial paper, borrowings under the revolving credit facility, medium term notes, senior subordinated debt and borrowings from the Company. HDFS outstanding debt consisted of the following as of December 31 (in thousands): 2006 2005 2004 Commercial paper $ 894,250 $ 416,797 $ 702,147 Credit facilities 191,866 172,965 168,309 $ 1,086,116 $ 589,762 $ 870,456 Medium term notes 586,375 585,211 394,985 Senior subordinated notes 30,000 30,000 30,000 $ 1,702,491 $ 1,204,973 $ 1,295,441 Credit Facilities In December 2006, HDFS increased its revolving credit facility (Global Credit Facility) to $1.40 billion from $1.10 billion. Subject to certain limitations, HDFS has the option to borrow in various currencies. Interest is based on London interbank offered rates (LIBOR), European interbank offered rates or other short term indices, depending on the type of advance. The Global Credit Facility is a committed facility due in 2009 and HDFS pays a fee for its availability. Commercial Paper Subject to limitations, HDFS may issue commercial paper of up to $1.40 billion. Maturities may range up to 365 days from the issuance date. Outstanding commercial paper may not exceed the unused portion of the Global Credit Facility. As a result, the combined total of commercial paper and borrowings under the Global Credit Facility was limited to $1.40 billion as of December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, the combined total of commercial paper and borrowings under the Global Credit Facility was limited to $1.10 billion. Medium Term Notes HDFS has $400.0 million of 3.63% medium term notes outstanding which are due in December 2008, and during December 2005 issued $200.0 million of 5% medium term notes due in December 2010 (collectively referred to as Notes). The Notes provide for semi annual interest payments and principal due at maturity. At December 31, 2006, December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, the Notes included a fair value adjustment reducing the balance by $13.6 million, $14.7 million and $5.0 million, respectively, due to interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges. The effect of the interest rate swap agreements is to convert the interest rate on the Notes from a fixed to a floating rate, which is based on 3 month LIBOR. 51 Senior Subordinated Debt HDFS has $30.0 million of 10 year senior subordinated notes outstanding which are due in December 2007. Intercompany Borrowing HDFS has a revolving credit line with the Company whereby HDFS may borrow up to $210.0 million from the Company at a market interest rate. As of December 31, 2006, December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, HDFS had no outstanding borrowings owed to the Company under this agreement. The Company has a support agreement with HDFS whereby, if required, the Company agrees to provide HDFS with financial support in order to maintain certain financial covenants. Support may be provided at the Companys option as capital contributions or loans. Accordingly, certain debt covenants may restrict the Companys ability to withdraw funds from HDFS outside the normal course of business. No amount has ever been provided to HDFS under the support agreement. Operating and Financial Covenants HDFS is subject to various operating and financial covenants related to the Global Credit Facilities, Medium Term Notes and Senior Subordinated Debt issued by HDFS. The more significant covenants are described below. The covenants limit HDFS ability to (i) incur certain additional indebtedness; (ii) assume or incur certain liens; (iii) participate in a merger, consolidation, liquidation or dissolution; and (iv) purchase or hold margin stock. Under the Global Credit Facility financial covenants, the debt to equity ratio of HDFS and its consolidated subsidiaries cannot exceed 9.0 to 1.0 and HDFS must maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth of $300.0 million. The financial covenants under the Senior Subordinated Debt require that HDFS maintain a tangible net worth of $40.0 million and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 125%. No financial covenants are required under the Medium Term Notes. At December 31, 2006, December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, HDFS remained in compliance with all of these covenants. The Company expects that future activities of HDFS will be financed from funds internally generated by HDFS, the sale of loans through securitization programs, issuance of commercial paper and medium term notes, borrowings under revolving credit facilities and advances or loans from the Company. (1) Cautionary Statements The Companys ability to meet the targets and expectations noted in this Form 10 K depends upon, among other factors, the Companys ability to (i) continue to realize production efficiencies at its production facilities and effectively manage operating costs including materials, labor and overhead; (ii) manage production capacity and production changes; (iii) manage supply chain issues; (iv) provide products, services and experiences that are successful in the marketplace; (v) develop and implement sales and marketing plans that retain existing customers and attract new customers in an increasingly competitive marketplace; (vi) sell all of its motorcycles and related products and services to its independent dealers and distributors; (vii) continue to develop the capacity of its distributor and dealer network; (viii) manage changes and prepare for requirements in legislative and regulatory environments for its products, services and operations; (ix) adjust to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices; (x) manage regional and worldwide demographic trends and economic and political conditions, including healthcare inflation, pension reform and tax changes; (xi) manage the credit quality and recovery rates of HDFS loan portfolio; (xii) retain and attract talented employees; and (xiii) detect any defects in our motorcycles to minimize delays in new model launches, recall campaigns, increased warranty costs or litigation. In addition, the Company could experience delays or disruptions in its operations as a result of work stoppages, strikes, natural causes, terrorism or other factors. These risks, potential delays and uncertainties regarding the costs could also adversely impact the Companys capital expenditure estimates (see Liquidity and Capital Resources section). In addition, see Risk Factors under Item 1A. which includes a discussion of additional risk factors and a more complete discussion of some of the cautionary statements noted above. 52 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. To reduce such risks, the Company selectively uses derivative financial instruments. All hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to regularly reviewed policies and procedures, which prohibit the use of financial instruments for trading purposes. Sensitivity analysis is used to manage and monitor foreign exchange and interest rate risk. A discussion of the Companys accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and further disclosure relating to the fair value of derivative financial instruments is included in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company sells its products internationally and in most markets those sales are made in the foreign countrys local currency. As a result, the Companys earnings can be affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currency. The Company utilizes foreign currency contracts to mitigate the effect of these fluctuations on earnings. The foreign currency contracts are entered into with banks and allow the Company to exchange a specified amount of foreign currency for U.S. dollars at a future date, based on a fixed exchange rate. At December 31, 2006, these contracts represented a combined U.S. dollar equivalent of $360.3 million. The Company estimates that a uniform 10% weakening in the value of the dollar relative to the currency underlying these contracts would result in a decrease in the fair value of the contracts of approximately $37.2 million as of December 31, 2006. The Companys exposure to the Japanese yen is substantially offset by the existence of a natural hedge, which is sustained through offsetting yen cash inflows from sales with yen cash outflows for motorcycle component purchases and other operating expenses. HDFS earnings are affected by changes in interest rates. HDFS utilizes interest rate swaps to reduce the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on its securitization transactions and debt. As of December 31, 2006, HDFS had interest rate swaps outstanding with a notional value of $1.25 billion. HDFS estimates that a 10% increase in interest rates would result in a $1.6 million decrease in the fair value of the agreements. 53
