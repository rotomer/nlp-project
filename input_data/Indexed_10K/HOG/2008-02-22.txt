Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Harley Davidson, Inc. is the parent company for the group of companies doing business as Harley Davidson Motor Company (HDMC), Buell Motorcycle Company (Buell) and Harley Davidson Financial Services (HDFS). Harley Davidson Motor Company produces heavyweight motorcycles and offers a line of motorcycle parts, accessories, general merchandise and related services. HDMC manufactures five families of motorcycles: Touring, Dyna, Softail, Sportster and VRSC. Buell produces premium sport performance motorcycles and offers a line of motorcycle parts, accessories, and apparel. HDFS provides wholesale and retail financing and insurance programs primarily to Harley Davidson/Buell dealers and customers. The % Change figures included in the Results of Operations section have been calculated using unrounded dollar amounts and may differ from calculations using the rounded dollar amounts presented. Overview and Outlook(1) The Companys net revenue for 2007 was $5.73 billion, a decrease of 1.3% compared to 2006 driven by a 5.3% decrease in wholesale shipments of Harley Davidson motorcycles from last year. Net income and diluted earnings per share for 2007 were down 10.5% and 4.8%, respectively, compared to 2006. The decrease in diluted earnings per share resulting from lower net income during 2007 was partially offset by the positive impact of fewer weighted average shares outstanding when compared to last year. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 15.4 million lower in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to the Companys repurchases of common stock occurring over 2007. During 2007, the Company repurchased 20.4 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $1.15 billion. The Companys 2007 financial results were negatively impacted by a decrease in Harley Davidson motorcycle shipments from 2006. During the first quarter of 2007, the Company lost four weeks of production as a result of a strike at its York, Pennsylvania assembly facility and related interruptions at its other manufacturing locations. Additionally, in early September 2007, the Company announced that it planned to reduce Harley Davidson motorcycle shipments for the balance of 2007 due to a sharp decrease in U.S. retail sales of Harley Davidson motorcycles during August and unfavorable economic conditions in the U.S. The Company believes that low consumer confidence and persistent housing and credit issues have resulted in a weak retail sales environment in the U.S. for major discretionary purchases, including Harley Davidson motorcycles. During the fourth quarter, worldwide retail sales of Harley Davidson motorcycles finished down 6.1% from the fourth quarter of 2006. During the fourth quarter, U.S. retail sales of Harley Davidson motorcycles continued to decrease, finishing the quarter down 14.2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2006. The decrease in U.S. retail sales was partially offset by increases in the Companys international markets where retail sales of Harley Davidson motorcycles increased 17.4% during the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to the fourth quarter of 2006. On an annual basis, 2007 worldwide retail sales of Harley Davidson motorcycles decreased 1.8% compared to 2006. The worldwide decrease in retail sales was driven primarily by a 6.2% decrease in Harley Davidson dealer retail sales in the U.S. International retail sales of Harley Davidson motorcycles finished 2007 up 13.7% over 2006.

The Company also expects moderate revenue growth, lower operating margin, and diluted earnings per share growth rate of 4% to 7% compared to 2007. For the first quarter of 2008, the Company expects wholesale shipments of Harley Davidson motorcycles to be between 68,000 and 72,000 units, which compares to 67,761 units in the first quarter of 2007. Going forward, the Company will continue to manage the business to generate long term sustainable shareholder value while protecting the brand. The Company expects the U.S. economy to continue to be very challenging in 2008. The Company will closely monitor the worldwide retail environment and regularly assess its wholesale shipment plans throughout the year. As the Company executes its plans, the Company believes its business model will continue to generate cash, permitting it to invest in the business, fund future growth opportunities and return value to shareholders. The Companys expected annual capital expenditures are provided under Liquidity and Capital Resources. 33 Results of Operations 2007 Compared to 2006 Overall Net revenue for 2007 totaled $5.73 billion, a $73.8 million or 1.3% decrease from the prior year. Net income was $933.8 million, a decrease of $109.3 million, or 10.5%. Diluted earnings per share were $3.74, a decrease of $0.19, or 4.8%. Diluted earnings per share during 2007 were positively impacted by a decrease in the weighted average shares outstanding, which were 249.9 million in 2007 compared to 265.3 million in 2006. The decrease in weighted average shares outstanding was driven by the Companys repurchases of 20.4 million shares of common stock during 2007. The Companys share repurchases are discussed in further detail under Liquidity and Capital Resources. The Company paid dividends in 2007 of $.21 per share in March, $.25 per share in June and $.30 in September and December. The aggregate annual dividend paid in 2007 was $1.06 per share, a 30.9% increase over the aggregate annual dividend of $0.81 per share in 2006. Motorcycle Unit Shipments and Net Revenue The following table includes wholesale motorcycle unit shipments and net revenue for the Motorcycles segment (dollars in millions): 2007 2006 (Decrease) Increase % Change Motorcycle Unit Shipments United States 241,539 273,212 (31,673 ) (11.6 )% International 89,080 75,984 13,096 17.2 Harley Davidson motorcycle units 330,619 349,196 (18,577 ) (5.3 ) Touring motorcycle units 114,076 123,444 (9,368 ) (7.6 ) Custom motorcycle units* 144,507 161,195 (16,688 ) (10.4 ) Sportster motorcycle units 72,036 64,557 7,479 11.6 Harley Davidson motorcycle units 330,619 349,196 (18,577 ) (5.3 ) Buell motorcycle units 11,513 12,460 (947 ) (7.6 )% Net Revenue Harley Davidson motorcycles $ 4,446.6 $ 4,553.6 $ (107.0 ) (2.3 )% Buell motorcycles 100.5 102.2 (1.7 ) (1.7 ) Total motorcycles 4,547.1 4,655.8 (108.7 ) (2.3 ) Parts & Accessories 868.3 862.3 6.0 0.7 General Merchandise 305.4 277.5 27.9 10.1 Other 6.0 5.1 0.9 N/M Net revenue $ 5,726.8 $ 5,800.7 $ (73.9 ) (1.3 )% * Custom motorcycle units, as used in this table, include Dyna, Softail, VRSC and CVO models. During 2007, the financial results of the Motorcycle segment were negatively impacted by a decline in wholesale shipments of Harley Davidson motorcycle units. This decrease was driven by a 31,673 unit reduction in shipments to U.S. dealers that were partially offset by a 13,096 unit increase in shipments outside the U.S. International shipments represented 26.9% of total Harley Davidson wholesale shipments for 2007, compared to 21.8% for 2006. The increase in international shipments is consistent with the Companys expectation that the 34 international shipment growth rate will outpace the domestic shipment growth rate.(1) Motorcycles segment net revenue declined $73.9 million, or 1.3%. Net revenue was approximately $221 million lower due to an overall decrease in sales volumes from the prior year. The lower volumes were primarily driven by the 5.3% decrease in Harley Davidson motorcycle unit shipments partially offset by higher sales volumes for General Merchandise. Net revenue was also negatively impacted during 2007 by higher sales incentive costs. These decreases were partially offset by higher revenue from wholesale price increases on Harley Davidson motorcycles of approximately $60 million, favorability resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $87 million (driven primarily by the strengthening of the Euro against the U.S. dollar during 2007) and changes to product mix which resulted in higher revenue of approximately $16 million. During 2007, the higher revenue resulting from changes in product mix was due primarily to mix changes that occurred within the motorcycle families and by the sale of higher priced 105th Anniversary models beginning in the second half of 2007. The positive revenue impact that resulted from mix changes within motorcycle families was partially offset by lower revenue resulting from changes in mix between motorcycle families. During 2007, shipments of Touring models made up 34.5% of total shipments compared to 35.4% for 2006. Additionally, 2007 shipments of Custom motorcycles made up 43.7% of total shipments compared to 46.2% for 2006, while Sportster model shipments increased to 21.8% of total shipments from 18.5% in 2006. Harley Davidson Motorcycle Retail Sales The Company sells its motorcycles at wholesale to an independent network of distributors and dealers who in turn sell the Companys products at retail. Worldwide retail sales of Harley Davidson motorcycles decreased 1.8% during 2007 relative to the same period last year. Retail sales of Harley Davidson motorcycles decreased 6.2% in the United States while growing 13.7% internationally including a 15.0% increase in Europe. On an industry wide basis in 2007, the heavyweight (651+cc) portion of the market was down 5.0% in the United States while growing 5.4% in Europe when compared to 2006. The following table includes retail unit sales of Harley Davidson motorcycles (units in thousands): Harley Davidson Motorcycle Retail Sales(a) Heavyweight (651+cc) 2007 2006 % Change United States 251.8 268.4 (6.2 )% Europe(b) 38.9 33.8 15.0 Japan 13.8 13.3 3.6 Canada 14.8 13.5 9.4 All other markets 18.5 15.0 23.7 Total Retail Sales 337.8 344.0 (1.8 )% (a) Data source for retail sales figures shown above is sales warranty and registration information provided by Harley Davidson dealers and compiled by the Company.

Industry retail motorcycle registration data includes 651+cc models derived from information provided by Giral S.A., an independent agency. Industry retail registration data for the remaining international markets has not been presented because the Company does not believe definitive and reliable registration data is available to the Company at this time. Cost of Goods Sold Cost of goods sold was $3.61 billion for the Motorcycles segment during 2007, an increase of $44.9 million, or 1.3% versus 2006. During 2007, cost of goods sold was higher due to an increased manufacturing cost per unit, foreign currency losses and changes in product mix. These increases in cost were partially offset by a decrease in cost resulting from the lower shipment volumes in 2007. Cost of goods sold increased by approximately $123 million due to a higher average manufacturing cost per unit driven by increases in both material and conversion costs. The higher average material cost per unit was driven by higher raw material surcharges of approximately $31 million and increased product content. The increase in conversion cost per unit was driven by higher fixed costs per unit resulting from the allocation of these costs to fewer units in 2007 and other manufacturing inefficiencies experienced during 2007 including those associated with the 2008 new model year launch and the York, Pennsylvania assembly plant strike during February 2007. During 2007, cost of goods sold was also higher by approximately $44 million resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and approximately $4 million related to changes in product mix. The decrease in cost of goods sold during 2007 resulting from lower shipments, partially offsetting the increased costs described above, was approximately $126 million. Gross Profit Gross profit was $2.11 billion for the Motorcycles segment during 2007, a decrease of $118.7 million or 5.3% compared to 2006. Gross profit margin for 2007 was 36.9% compared to 38.5% during 2006. The Companys gross margin was negatively impacted during 2007 by a higher manufacturing cost per unit and higher sales incentive costs partially offset by the favorable impact of higher wholesale prices, changes resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and changes to product mix. The factors impacting the change in gross margin are detailed under Motorcycle Unit Shipments and Net Revenue and Cost of Goods Sold above. 36 Financial Services The following table includes the condensed statements of operations for the Financial Services segment (in millions): 2007 2006 Increase (Decrease) % Change Interest income $ 196.8 $ 167.5 $ 29.3 17.5 % Income from securitizations 97.6 111.2 (13.6 ) (12.2 ) Other income 121.8 106.2 15.6 14.7 Financial services income 416.2 384.9 31.3 8.1 Interest expense 81.5 59.8 21.7 36.3 Operating expenses 122.5 114.4 8.1 7.1 Financial services expense 204.0 174.2 29.8 17.1 Operating income from financial services $ 212.2 $ 210.7 $ 1.5 0.7 % Interest income increased due to higher average retail and wholesale outstanding receivables. The increase in other income was primarily due to higher credit card licensing income, securitization servicing income and insurance commission revenue. Interest expense was higher due to increased borrowings to support growth in outstanding receivables and higher borrowing rates. Income from securitizations decreased as higher securitization gains were offset by a reduction in income from retained securitization interests. During 2007, HDFS sold $2.53 billion in retail motorcycle loans through securitization transactions resulting in gains of $36.0 million. This compares with gains of $32.3 million on $2.33 billion of loans securitized during 2006. The 2007 gain as a percentage of loans sold was 1.42% as compared to 1.39% for 2006. Income on the investment in retained securitization interests decreased to $61.6 million from $78.9 million. The reduction in income was due to higher than projected credit losses used in the valuation of retained securitization interests as well as $9.9 million in write downs of certain retained securitization interests. The write downs, which occurred in March and December of 2007 and are considered permanent impairments, result from a decline in the fair value of certain retained securitization interest due to higher actual and anticipated credit losses on those securitization portfolios, partially offset by a slowing in actual and expected prepayment speeds. The capital markets, which HDFS relies on to fund its portfolio growth, experienced significant volatility over the later half of 2007. Currently HDFS plans to securitize its retail motorcycle portfolio in 2008, but will continue to evaluate various funding alternatives, and will adjust as necessary, based on market conditions. Until the current capital market conditions normalize, gains on securitization transactions in 2008, if any, are expected to be lower than historical results.(1) During February 2008, HDFS completed the sale of $540.0 million in retail motorcycle loans through a securitization transaction resulting in an estimated loss of $4.1 million to $5.4 million.(1) As part of the transaction, HDFS retained $54.0 million of subordinated securities. Annualized losses on HDFS managed retail motorcycle loans totaled 1.91% in 2007 compared to 1.41% for 2006. Managed retail loans include loans held by HDFS as well as those sold through securitization transactions. The 30 day delinquency rate for managed retail motorcycle loans at December 31, 2007 increased to 6.15% from 5.18% at December 31, 2006. This increase in losses is primarily due to an increase in delinquent accounts resulting in a higher incidence of loss as well as continued pressure on values for repossessed motorcycles. As a result, it is expected that HDFS will experience higher credit losses as a percentage of managed retail motorcycle loans in 2008 as compared to 2007.(1) 37 Changes in the allowance for credit losses were as follows (in millions): 2007 2006 Balance, beginning of period $ 27.3 $ 26.2 Provision for finance credit losses 11.2 5.9 Charge offs, net of recoveries (8.2 ) (4.8 ) Balance, end of period $ 30.3 $ 27.3 HDFS periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is generally based on HDFS past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio and current economic conditions. HDFS believes the allowance is adequate to cover the losses of principal and accrued interest in the existing portfolio. Operating Expenses The following table includes operating expenses for the Motorcycles segment and Corporate (in millions): 2007 2006 Increase (Decrease) % Change Motorcycles and Related Products Selling & Administrative $ 692.8 $ 637.5 $ 55.3 8.7 % Engineering 190.6 186.2 4.4 2.4 Corporate 17.3 22.7 (5.4 ) (23.5 ) Total operating expenses $ 900.7 $ 846.4 $ 54.3 6.4 % Total operating expenses were 15.7% and 14.6% of net revenue for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Selling and administrative expenses were higher due primarily to increased marketing costs and higher international operating costs in connection with the Companys growth in those markets combined with unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These cost increases were partially offset by a decrease in expense associated with the Companys short term incentive compensation programs. Investment Income, Net Investment income, net in 2007 was $22.3 million, compared to $27.1 million in 2006. Net investment income decreased due primarily to lower average short term investment balances in 2007 when compared to 2006. Provision for Income Taxes The Companys effective income tax rate was 35.5% during 2007 compared to 35.8% in 2006. The decrease is due primarily to a higher benefit from the domestic manufacturing deduction and slightly lower state income taxes in 2007. 38 Results of Operations 2006 Compared to 2005 Overall Net revenue for 2006 totaled $5.80 billion, a $458.5 million or 8.6% increase over the prior year. Net income for 2006 was $1.04 billion, an increase of $83.5 million, or 8.7%. Diluted earnings per share were $3.93, representing an increase of $0.52, or 15.2%. Diluted earnings per share were positively impacted during 2006 by a decrease in the weighted average shares outstanding, which were 265.3 million in 2006 compared to 281.0 million in 2005. The decrease in weighted average shares outstanding was due primarily to the Companys share repurchases. The Company repurchased 19.3 million shares of common stock during 2006. The Company paid dividends in 2006 of $.18 per share in March and $.21 per share in June, September and December. The aggregate annual dividend paid in 2006 was $.81 per share, representing a 29.6% increase over the aggregate annual dividend of $.625 per share in 2005.

During 2006, the Company shipped 349,196 Harley Davidson motorcycles, an increase of 20,179 or 6.1%, over 2005 shipments. International shipments grew faster than U.S. shipments with an increase of 21.6% in 2006, compared to a 2006 U.S. shipment increase of 2.5%. As a result, international shipments represented 21.8% of total Harley Davidson wholesale shipments in 2006, compared to 19.0% in 2005. During 2006, net revenue for the Motorcycles segment grew 8.6% or $458.5 million over 2005. Approximately $350 million of the increase in net revenue resulted from the higher shipment volumes of motorcycles and related 39 products. Net revenue also benefited from a favorable change in product mix and wholesale price increases. The changes to product mix resulted in approximately $70 million of higher revenue and related primarily to an increase in the percentage of shipments consisting of higher priced touring motorcycles. Touring motorcycles made up 35.4% of shipments in 2006 compared to 33.5% in 2005. Wholesale price increases on Harley Davidson motorcycles resulted in approximately $45 million of higher revenue. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates resulted in approximately $10 million of lower net revenue. Harley Davidson Motorcycle Retail Sales Worldwide retail sales of Harley Davidson motorcycles grew 8.5% during 2006 over the prior year. Retail sales of Harley Davidson motorcycles increased 5.9% in the United States and 18.6% internationally. On an industry wide basis, the heavyweight (651+cc) portion of the market was up 4.9% in the United States and up 7.5% in Europe.

Industry retail registration data for the remaining international markets has not been presented because the Company does not believe definitive and reliable registration data is available to the Company at this time. Cost of Goods Sold Cost of goods sold for the Motorcycles segment increased $266.1 million over 2005, due primarily to the increase in shipment volumes for motorcycles and related products. Higher volumes resulted in an increase in cost of goods sold of approximately $225 million. Cost of goods sold was also higher due to changes in product mix and 40 increases in material costs, partially offset by lower foreign currency losses. Changes in Harley Davidson motorcycle product mix resulted in approximately $35 million of higher costs and increases in raw material costs, primarily for metals, were approximately $15 million. Finally, net foreign currency transaction and hedging gains resulted in approximately $35 million of lower cost during 2006. Gross Profit Gross profit was $2.23 billion for the Motorcycles segment during 2006, an increase of $192.3 million or 9.4% over gross profit in 2005. Gross profit margin for 2006 was 38.5% compared to 38.3% during 2005. The increase in gross margin was due primarily to wholesale price increases on Harley Davidson motorcycles, favorable Harley Davidson motorcycle product mix and favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as detailed under Revenue and Cost of Goods Sold above. Financial Services The following table includes the condensed statements of operations for the Financial Services segment (in millions): Increase % 2006 2005 (Decrease) Change Interest income $ 167.5 $ 129.9 $ 37.6 29.0 % Income from securitizations 111.2 123.1 (11.9 ) (9.7 ) Other income 106.2 78.6 27.6 35.1 Financial services income 384.9 331.6 53.3 16.1 Interest expense 59.8 36.2 23.6 65.3 Operating expenses 114.4 103.8 10.6 10.2 Financial services expense 174.2 140.0 34.2 24.4 Operating income from financial services $ 210.7 $ 191.6 $ 19.1 10.0 % During 2006, interest income benefited from increased retail and wholesale average outstanding receivables and higher retail and wholesale lending rates as compared to 2005. The increase in other income was primarily due to higher revenues from insurance commissions and related products and an increase in securitization servicing fee income. Interest expense was higher due to increased borrowings, in support of higher average outstanding receivables, and higher borrowing costs. Income from securitizations in 2006 was lower due to lower gains on 2006 securitization transactions, partially offset by an increase in income on the investment in retained securitization interests. During 2006, income on the investment in retained securitization interests was $78.9 million, an increase of $2.3 million over 2005. During 2006, HDFS sold $2.33 billion in retail motorcycle loans through securitization transactions resulting in gains of $32.3 million. This compares with gains of $46.6 million on $2.48 billion of loans securitized during 2005. The 2006 gain as a percentage of loans sold was 1.4% as compared to 1.9% for 2005. The 2006 gain as a percentage of the amount of loans securitized was lower than the prior year due to rising market interest rates and the competitive environment for motorcycle lending. In addition, during 2006, other comprehensive income includes unrealized losses of $20.9 million (pre tax) related to a decrease in the unrealized gain on the investment in retained securitization interests due primarily to higher expected losses on prior year securitization transactions. Annualized losses on HDFS managed retail motorcycle loans totaled 1.41% in 2006 compared to 1.29% for the same period in 2005. This increase in losses reflected continued pressure on values for repossessed motorcycles. Managed retail loans include loans held by HDFS which are retained on the balance sheet as well as those sold through securitization. The 30 day delinquency rate for managed retail motorcycle loans at December 31, 2006 41 increased to 5.18% from 4.83% at December 31, 2005. Changes in the allowance for credit losses were as follows (in millions): 2006 2005 Balance, beginning of period $ 26.2 $ 30.3 Provision for finance credit losses 5.9 3.3 Charge offs, net of recoveries (4.8 ) (7.4 ) Balance, end of period $ 27.3 $ 26.2 Operating Expenses The following table includes operating expenses for the Motorcycles segment and Corporate (in millions): % 2006 2005 Increase Change Motorcycles and Related Products Selling & Administrative $ 637.5 $ 559.5 $ 78.0 14.0 % Engineering 186.2 186.2 0.0 0.0 Corporate 22.7 21.5 1.2 5.6 Total operating expenses $ 846.4 $ 767.2 $ 79.2 10.3 % Total operating expenses were 14.6% and 14.4% of net revenue for 2006 and 2005, respectively. During 2006, selling expenses were higher than the prior year due primarily to higher marketing and advertising expenses combined with increased international operating costs in connection with the Companys growth in those markets. The increase in administrative expenses during 2006 was driven primarily by a higher provision for future warranty costs which was approximately $44 million higher. The increase in warranty costs was due primarily to higher costs associated with the Companys second year warranty program and higher product program costs. Beginning with shipments of 2004 model year motorcycles, the Company extended its warranty coverage from one to two years. During 2006, additional claims data became available which indicated that the cost of the second year warranty was higher than originally estimated. Based on the higher actual claims, the Company adjusted warranty reserves for the motorcycles affected, which were primarily 2004, 2005 and 2006 models. In addition, the Company announced a number of product programs during 2006 to address customer concerns and promote customer satisfaction. Under a product program, the Company contacts retail customers directly and pays for non safety related improvements that are covered by the Companys standard warranty. Investment Income, Net Investment income, net in 2006 was $27.1 million, compared to $22.8 million in 2005. Net investment income was higher primarily due to a higher average return. Provision for Income Taxes The Companys effective income tax rate was 35.8% during 2006 compared to 35.5% in 2005. This increase was due primarily to a relatively smaller benefit from the federal research and development tax credit and slightly higher state income taxes. 42 Other Matters Accounting Changes In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Financial Interpretation No. (FIN) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. See Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the effect of adopting FIN 48 on the Companys consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R). SFAS No. 158 requires employers that sponsor defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans to recognize previously unrecognized actuarial losses and prior service costs in the statement of financial position and to recognize future changes in these amounts in the year in which changes occur through comprehensive income. As a result, the statement of financial position will reflect the funded status (the difference between the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets) of those plans as an asset or liability. Additionally, employers are required to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end statement of financial position. The Company adopted SFAS No. 158, as it relates to recognizing the funded status of its defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans, and the related disclosure requirements, as of December 31, 2006. See Note 6 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the effect of adopting SFAS No. 158 on the Companys consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. The requirement to measure the funded status as of the date of the year end statement of financial position is required by December 31, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the change in the measurement date will have on its consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, clarifies the definition of fair value within that framework, and expands disclosures about the use of fair value measurements. SFAS 157 applies to fair value measurements required by existing accounting pronouncements and does not require any new fair value measurements. The Company is required to adopt SFAS 157 beginning in fiscal year 2008 and the impact that the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on its consolidated financial statements is expected to be immaterial. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115. SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be recognized in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. The Company is required to adopt SFAS 159 beginning in fiscal year 2008. The Company does not expect to elect the fair value option permitted under SFAS 159 so adoption will have no impact on its consolidated financial statements. Critical Accounting Estimates The Companys financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies, which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions. Management believes that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of accounting policies that currently affect the Companys financial condition and results of operations. Finance Receivable Securitizations The Company sells retail motorcycle loans through securitization transactions utilizing qualifying special purpose entities (QSPEs) as defined by SFAS No. 140 Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. Upon sale of retail loans in a securitization transaction, HDFS receives cash and retains an interest in excess cash flows, servicing rights and cash reserve account deposits, all of which are collectively referred to as retained interests in the securitized 43 receivables. Retained interests are carried at fair value and are periodically reviewed for impairment. Market value quotes are generally not available for retained interests; therefore, HDFS estimates fair value based on the present value of future expected cash flows using managements best estimates of the key assumptions for credit losses, prepayment speeds and discount rates. The impact of changes to key assumptions is shown in Note 3 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Gains or losses on current year securitizations from the sale of retail loans are recorded as a component of financial services income and are based in part on certain assumptions including expected credit losses, prepayment speed, and discount rates. Gains or losses on sales of retail loans also depend on the original carrying amount of the retail loans, which is allocated between the assets sold and the retained interests based on their relative fair value at the date of transfer. Finance Receivable Credit Losses The allowance for uncollectible accounts is maintained at a level management believes is adequate to cover the losses of principal in the existing finance receivables portfolio. Managements periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is generally based on HDFS past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, current economic conditions, specific borrowers ability to repay and the estimated value of any underlying collateral. Product Warranty Estimated warranty costs are reserved for each motorcycle at the time of sale. The warranty reserve is an estimated cost per unit sold based upon historical Company claim data used in combination with other known factors that may affect future warranty claims. The Company updates its warranty estimates quarterly to ensure that the warranty reserves are based on the most current information available. The Company believes that past claim experience is indicative of future claims, however, the factors affecting actual claims can be volatile. As a result, actual claims experience may differ from estimated which could lead to material changes in the Companys warranty provision and related reserves. The Companys warranty liability is discussed further in Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits Retirement Plan (Pension, SERPA and Postretirement healthcare) obligations and costs are developed from actuarial valuations. The valuation of benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs relies on key assumptions including discount rates, long term expected return on plan assets, future compensation and healthcare cost trend rates. The Company evaluates and updates all of its assumptions annually on September 30, the actuarial measurement date. The Company determines its discount rate assumptions by referencing high quality long term bond rates that are matched to the duration of its own benefit obligations. Based on this analysis, the discount rate was increased from 5.90% as of September 30, 2006 to 6.30% as of September 30, 2007. The Company determines its healthcare trend assumption by considering factors such as estimated healthcare inflation, the utilization of healthcare benefits and changes in the health of plan participants. Based on the Companys assessment of this data as of September 30, 2007, the Company lowered its healthcare cost trend rate to 9% from 10% as of September 30, 2006. The Company expects the healthcare cost trend rate to reach its ultimate rate of 5% beginning in 2011. These assumption changes were reflected immediately in the benefit obligation and will be amortized into net periodic benefit costs over future periods. 44 The following information is provided to illustrate the sensitivity of pension and postretirement healthcare obligations and costs to changes in these major assumptions (in thousands): Impact Amounts based Impact of a 1% of a 1% increase on current decrease in the in the healthcare assumptions discount rate cost trend rate 2007 Net periodic benefit costs Pension and SERPA $ 48,940 $ 20,612 n/a Postretirement healthcare $ 28,290 $ 2,722 $ 1,485 2007 Benefit obligations Pension and SERPA $ 1,033,635 $ 151,904 n/a Postretirement healthcare $ 332,139 $ 34,792 $ 12,375 This information should not be viewed as predictive of future amounts. The calculation of Retirement Plan obligations and costs is based on many factors in addition to those discussed here. This information should be considered in combination with the information provided in Note 6 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Stock Compensation Costs The total cost of the Companys share based awards is equal to the grant date fair value per award multiplied by the number of awards granted (adjusted for forfeitures). This cost is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the service periods of the awards. Forfeitures are initially estimated based on historical Company information and subsequently updated over the life of the awards to ultimately reflect actual forfeitures. As a result, changes in forfeiture activity can influence the amount of stock compensation cost recognized from period to period. The Company generally determines the number of share based awards granted by first determining the total cost of the award, which is a function of employee salary, level and performance. On the date of grant, the number of awards granted is then computed by dividing the total cost of the award by the grant date fair value of the award unit. The Company estimates the fair value of option awards as of the grant date using a lattice based option valuation model which utilizes ranges of assumptions over the expected term of the options, including stock price volatility, dividend yield and risk free interest rate. The valuation model uses historical data to estimate option exercise behavior and employee terminations. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The Company used implied volatility to determine the expected volatility of its stock in 2007. In 2006 and 2005, expected volatilities were based on the historical volatility of the Companys stock. The Company believes that implied volatilities provide a better estimate of expected volatilities because it takes into account both historical and future expectations of volatility. The implied volatility is derived from options that are actively traded and the market prices of both the traded options and underlying shares are measured at a similar point in time to each other and on a date reasonably close to the grant date of the employee share options. In addition, the traded options have exercise prices that are both (a) near the money and (b) close to the exercise price of the employee share options. Finally, the remaining maturities of the traded options on which the estimate is based are at least one year. Dividend yield was based on the Companys expected dividend policy and the risk free rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Changes in the valuation assumptions could result in a significant change to the cost of an individual option. 45 However, the total cost of an award is also a function of the number of awards granted, and as result, the Company has the ability to manage the cost and value of its equity awards by adjusting the number of awards granted. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and other loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. In calculating the provision for income taxes on an interim basis, the Company uses an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon the facts and circumstances known at each interim period. On a quarterly basis, the actual effective tax rate is adjusted as appropriate based upon the actual results as compared to those forecasted at the beginning of the fiscal year. The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the Companys worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related deferred tax assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of the Companys business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Accruals for unrecognized tax benefits are provided for in accordance with the requirements of FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. An unrecognized tax benefit represents the difference between the recognition of benefits related to exposure items for income tax reporting purposes and financial reporting purposes. The unrecognized tax benefit is classified as a component of the income taxes payable account, which is included within Other long term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company has a reserve for interest and penalties on exposure items, if applicable, which is recorded as component of the overall income tax provision. The Company is regularly under audit by tax authorities. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, management believes that it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns and that its annual tax provision includes amounts sufficient to pay any assessments. Nonetheless, the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year. 46 Contractual Obligations A summary of the Companys expected payments for significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2007 is as follows (in thousands): 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Principal payments on finance debt $ 1,119,955 $ 580,448 $ 399,552 $ 2,099,955 Interest payments on finance debt 73,844 74,781 41,923 190,548 Operating lease payments 10,026 12,728 9,229 $ 14,572 46,555 $ 1,203,825 $ 667,957 $ 450,704 $ 14,572 $ 2,337,058 As described in Note 3 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2007, long term finance debt issued by HDFS included outstanding commercial paper and advances under the Global Credit Facility totaling $376.7 million. The amount classified as long term is supported by the Global Credit Facility, due September 2009; accordingly, the Company has assumed that this amount will be repaid in 2009. Interest obligations include the impact of interest rate hedges outstanding as of December 31, 2007. Interest for floating rate instruments, as calculated above, assumes December 31, 2007 rates remain constant. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had no material purchase obligations other than those created in the ordinary course of business related to inventory and property, plant and equipment which generally have terms of less than 90 days. The Company has long term obligations related to its pension and postretirement plans at December 31, 2007. Due to the current funded status of the pension plans, the Company has no minimum funding requirements for 2008. The Companys expected future contributions to these plans are provided in Note 6 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As described in Note 4 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has unrecognized tax benefits of $72.5 million and accrued interest and penalties of $17.1 million as of December 31, 2007. However, the Company cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate for the period of cash settlement for either the $72.5 million of liability of unrecognized tax benefits or accrued interest and penalties of $17.1 million. 47 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of its securitization program, HDFS transfers retail motorcycle loans to a special purpose bankruptcy remote wholly owned subsidiary. The subsidiary sells the retail loans to a securitization trust in exchange for the proceeds from asset backed securities issued by the securitization trust. The asset backed securities, usually notes with various maturities and interest rates, are secured by future collections of the purchased retail installment loans. Activities of the securitization trust are limited to acquiring retail loans, issuing asset backed securities and making payments on securities to investors. Due to the nature of the assets held by the securitization trust and the limited nature of its activities, the securitization trusts are considered QSPEs as defined by SFAS No. 140. In accordance with SFAS No. 140, assets and liabilities of the QSPEs are not consolidated in the financial statements of the Company. HDFS does not guarantee payments on the securities issued by the securitization trusts or the projected cash flows from the related loans purchased from HDFS. The Companys retained securitization interests, excluding servicing rights, are subordinate to the interests of securitization trust investors. Such investors have priority interests in the cash collections on the retail loans sold to the securitization trust (after payment of servicing fees) and in the cash reserve account deposits. These priority interests ultimately could impact the value of the Companys investment in retained securitization interests. Investors also do not have recourse to assets of HDFS for failure of the obligors on the retail loans to pay when due. Total investment in retained securitization interests at December 31, 2007 was $407.7 million. The securitization trusts have a limited life and generally terminate upon final distribution of amounts owed to the investors in the asset backed securities. See Note 3 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of HDFS securitization program. Commitments and Contingencies The Company is subject to lawsuits and other claims related to environmental, product and other matters. In determining required reserves related to these items, the Company carefully analyzes cases and considers the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes, as well as the potential range of possible loss. The required reserves are monitored on an ongoing basis and are updated based on new developments or new information in each matter. Shareholder Lawsuits: A number of shareholder class action lawsuits were filed between May 18, 2005 and July 1, 2005 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. On February 14, 2006, the court consolidated all of the actions into a single case, captioned In re Harley Davidson, Inc. Securities Litigation, and appointed Lead Plaintiffs and Co Lead Plaintiffs Counsel. Pursuant to the schedule set by the court, on October 2, 2006, the Lead Plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Class Action Complaint, which names the Company and Jeffrey L. Bleustein, James L. Ziemer, and James M. Brostowitz, who are current or former Company officers, as defendants. The Consolidated Complaint alleges securities law violations and seeks unspecified damages relating generally to the Companys April 13, 2005 announcement that it was reducing short term production growth and planned increases of motorcycle shipments from 317,000 units in 2004 to a new 2005 target of 329,000 units (compared to its original target of 339,000 units). On December 18, 2006, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Consolidated Complaint in its entirety. Briefing of the motion to dismiss was completed in April 2007. Three shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin on June 3, 2005, October 25, 2005 (this lawsuit was later voluntarily dismissed) and December 2, 2005 and two shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed in Milwaukee County Circuit Court on July 22, 2005 and November 16, 2005 against some or all of the following current or former directors and officers of the Company: Jeffrey L. Bleustein, James L. Ziemer, James M. Brostowitz, Barry K. Allen, Richard I. Beattie, George H. Conrades, Judson C. Green, Donald A. James, Sara L. Levinson, George L. Miles, Jr., James A. Norling, James A. McCaslin, Donna F. Zarcone, Jon R. Flickinger, Gail A. Lione, Ronald M. Hutchinson, W. Kenneth Sutton, Jr. and John A. Hevey. The lawsuits also name the Company as a nominal defendant. In general, the shareholder derivative complaints include factual allegations similar to those in the class action complaints and allegations that officers and directors breached their fiduciary duties to the Company. On February 14, 2006, the state court consolidated the two state court derivative actions and appointed Lead Plaintiffs and Lead Plaintiffs counsel, and on April 24, 2006, the state court ordered that the consolidated state court derivative action be stayed until after motions to dismiss the federal securities class action are decided. On February 15, 2006, the federal court 48 consolidated the federal derivative lawsuits with the securities and ERISA (see below) actions for administrative purposes. On February 1, 2007, the federal court appointed Lead Plaintiff and Co Lead Plaintiffs Counsel in the consolidated federal derivative action. On August 25, 2005, a class action lawsuit alleging violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. As noted above, on February 15, 2006, the court ordered the ERISA action consolidated with the federal derivative and securities actions for administrative purposes. Pursuant to the schedule set by the court, on October 2, 2006, the ERISA plaintiff filed an Amended Class Action Complaint, which named the Company, the Harley Davidson Motor Company Retirement Plans Committee, the Companys Leadership and Strategy Council, Harold A. Scott, James L. Ziemer, James M. Brostowitz, Gail A. Lione, Joanne M. Bischmann, Karl M. Eberle, Jon R. Flickinger, Ronald M. Hutchinson, James A. McCaslin, W. Kenneth Sutton, Jr., and Donna F. Zarcone, who are current or former Company officers or employees, as defendants. In general, the ERISA complaint includes factual allegations similar to those in the shareholder class action lawsuits and alleges on behalf of participants in certain Harley Davidson retirement savings plans that the plan fiduciaries breached their ERISA fiduciary duties. On December 18, 2006, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the ERISA complaint in its entirety. Briefing of the motion to dismiss was completed in April 2007. The Company believes the allegations against all of the defendants in the lawsuits against the Company are without merit and it intends to vigorously defend against them. Since all of these matters are in the preliminary stages, the Company is unable to predict the scope or outcome or quantify their eventual impact, if any, on the Company. At this time, the Company is also unable to estimate associated expenses or possible losses. The Company maintains insurance that may limit its financial exposure for defense costs and liability for an unfavorable outcome, should it not prevail, for claims covered by the insurance coverage. Security Breach Lawsuit: On January 22, 2007, a purported class action lawsuit was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York against Harley Davidson, Inc. and the Harley Owners Group. The complaint alleges that the Company was negligent in failing to properly safeguard, protect and keep confidential the personal Customer Identifiable Information that was stored on a Company laptop computer that was lost on or about August 14, 2006. The complaint also alleges that Harley Davidson breached fiduciary duties and made false and fraudulent representations and warranties to its customers that it would keep confidential and safeguard and protect the personal customer information in its possession. The complaint seeks unspecified damages. On February 23, 2007, this matter was removed to the United States District Court Southern District of New York. On April 5, 2007, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. Briefing is completed on the motion to dismiss and the parties are awaiting a ruling. The Company believes the allegations in the lawsuit are without merit and it intends to vigorously defend against them. Cam Bearing Lawsuit: In January 2001, on its own initiative, the Company notified owners that it was extending the warranty on rear cam bearings to 5 years or 50,000 miles on certain 1999 and early 2000 Harley Davidson motorcycles equipped with Twin Cam 88 and Twin Cam 88BTM engines. Subsequently, on June 28, 2001, a putative nationwide class action was filed against the Company in state court in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, which was amended by a complaint filed September 28, 2001, alleging that this cam bearing was defective, asserting various legal theories, and seeking unspecified damages for affected owners. After the Wisconsin court granted the Companys motion to dismiss those claims, the same attorneys filed a second putative nationwide class action against the Company in state court in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin related to the same issues. Again, the Wisconsin court granted the Companys motion and dismissed all claims in their entirety. On April 12, 2004, the same attorneys filed a third action in the state court in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin on behalf of the same plaintiffs. This third action was likewise dismissed by the court on July 26, 2004. After subsequent appeals to the Wisconsin Court of Appeals and the Wisconsin Supreme Court, on July 12, 2007, the Wisconsin Supreme Court issued a final decision in the Companys favor upholding the dismissal of all claims against the Company. Then, on September 11, 2007, the Company received a claim letter from one of the same attorneys involved in the Wisconsin actions. This letter relates to the same issues as the previously dismissed Wisconsin actions, but alleges claims under California law on behalf of California owners exclusively. The Company believes that these California claims 49 lack merit as they are premised on the same legal theories that were presented in previously dismissed Wisconsin actions. Environmental Matters: The Company is involved with government agencies and groups of potentially responsible parties in various environmental matters, including a matter involving the cleanup of soil and groundwater contamination at its York, Pennsylvania facility. The York facility was formerly used by the U.S. Navy and AMF prior to the purchase of the York facility by the Company from AMF in 1981. Although the Company is not certain as to the full extent of the environmental contamination at the York facility, it has been working with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) since 1986 in undertaking environmental investigation and remediation activities, including an ongoing site wide remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS). In January 1995, the Company entered into a settlement agreement (the Agreement) with the Navy. The Agreement calls for the Navy and the Company to contribute amounts into a trust equal to 53% and 47%, respectively, of future costs associated with environmental investigation and remediation activities at the York facility (Response Costs). The trust administers the payment of the Response Costs incurred at the York facility as covered by the Agreement. In February 2002, the Company was advised by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that it considers some of the Companys remediation activities at the York facility to be subject to the EPAs corrective action program under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and offered the Company the option of addressing corrective action under a RCRA facility lead agreement. In July 2005, the York facility was designated as the first site in Pennsylvania to be addressed under the One Cleanup Program. The program provides a more streamlined and efficient oversight of voluntary remediation by both PADEP and EPA and will be carried out consistent with the Agreement with the Navy. As a result, the RCRA facility lead agreement has been superseded. Although the RI/FS is still under way and substantial uncertainty exists concerning the nature and scope of the additional environmental investigation and remediation that will ultimately be required at the York facility, the Company estimates that its share of the future Response Costs at the York facility will be approximately $7.2 million. The Company has established reserves for this amount, which are included in Accrued Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The estimate of the Companys future Response Costs that will be incurred at the York facility is based on reports of independent environmental consultants retained by the Company, the actual costs incurred to date and the estimated costs to complete the necessary investigation and remediation activities. Response Costs related to the remediation of soil are expected to be incurred over a period of several years ending in 2012. Response Costs related to ground water remediation may continue for some time beyond 2012. However, these Response Costs are expected to be much lower than those related to the remediation of soil. Under the terms of the sale of the Commercial Vehicles Division in 1996, the Company has agreed to indemnify Utilimaster Corporation, until December 2008, for certain claims related to environmental contamination present at the date of sale, up to $20.0 million. Based on the environmental studies performed, the Company does not expect to incur any material expenditures under this indemnification. Product Liability Matters: Additionally, the Company is involved in product liability suits related to the operation of its business. The Company accrues for claim exposures that are probable of occurrence and can be reasonably estimated. The Company also maintains insurance coverage for product liability exposures. The Company believes that its accruals and insurance coverage are adequate and that product liability will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. 50 Liquidity and Capital Resources as of December 31, 2007 The Company expects that its business model will continue to generate cash that will allow it to invest in the business, fund future growth opportunities and return value to shareholders.(1) The Company also has a securitization program, a commercial paper program, credit facilities and debt instruments in place to support the ongoing cash requirements of its Financial Services business. The Company regularly assesses its long term capital market strategy, which includes diversifying funding sources in the capital markets to provide the Company with the appropriate level of flexibility to fund the business and to adjust to market conditions as necessary. Cash and marketable securities totaled $405.3 million as of December 31, 2007 compared to $896.5 million as of December 31, 2006 and $1.05 billion as of December 31, 2005. The decline is primarily attributable to common stock repurchases and higher dividend payments, which are discussed in more detail below. Cash Flow Activity The following table summarizes the operating, investing and financing cash flow activity for the three years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 (in thousands): 2007 2006 2005 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 798,146 $ 761,780 $ 962,614 Net cash provided by (used by) investing activities 391,205 (35,259 ) 193,840 Net cash used by financing activities (1,037,803 ) (637,023 ) (1,271,791 ) Total $ 151,548 $ 89,498 $ (115,337 ) Operating Activities The increase in operating cash flow from 2006 to 2007 is primarily attributable to favorable changes in wholesale receivable balances in 2007 as compared to 2006. This favorability was partially offset by lower net income in 2007. Cash flow from operating activities is also impacted by the Companys retail lending and securitization activity. The Company completed four securitization transactions during 2005 compared to three securitization transactions in both 2006 and 2007, and as a result, cash from operating activities in 2005 was higher than in 2006 and 2007. Investing Activities The Companys investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures, net changes in finance receivables held for investment and short term investment activity. Sales and redemptions of marketable securities net of purchases provided $657.7 million, $253.5 million and $431.1 million of cash to investing activities during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Marketable securities balances were reduced during each of these three years primarily for the purpose of funding the Companys repurchase of common stock during the year. Capital expenditures were $242.1 million, $219.6 million and $198.4 million during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In 2008, capital expenditures are expected to be between $240.0 and $260.0 million. The increase will be primarily driven by higher investments in manufacturing capabilities and product program activities.(1) The Company anticipates it will have the ability to fund all capital expenditures in 2008 with internally generated funds.(1) Financing Activities The Companys financing activities consist primarily of share repurchases, stock issuances, dividend payments and finance debt activity. During 2007, the Company repurchased 20.4 million share of its common stock at a total cost of $1.15 billion. The Company repurchased 2.8 million shares under a general authorization received from the Companys Board of Directors in 2005, and 16.9 million shares under a general authorization received from the Companys Board of Directors in 2006. The remaining 0.7 million shares were repurchased under an authorization from the Companys Board of Directors that is designed to provide the Company with continuing authority to repurchase shares to offset dilution caused by the exercise of stock options. In December 2007, the Companys Board of Directors separately authorized the Company to buy back up to 20.0 million additional shares of its common stock with no dollar limit or expiration date. No repurchases had been made under this 51 authorization as of the end of 2007. Please see Part II, Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities for additional detail regarding the Companys share repurchase activity and authorizations. During 2006 and 2005, the Company repurchased 19.3 million and 21.4 million shares, respectively, of its common stock at a total cost of $1.06 billion and $1.05 billion, respectively. The Company paid total dividends of $1.06, $0.81 and $0.625 per share during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, at a total cost of $260.8 million, $212.9 million and $173.8 million, respectively. In addition to operating cash flow and asset backed securitizations, HDFS is financed by the issuance of commercial paper, borrowings under the revolving credit facility, medium term notes and borrowings from the Company. HDFS outstanding debt consisted of the following as of December 31 (in thousands): 2007 2006 2005 Commercial paper $ 842,618 $ 894,250 $ 416,797 Credit facilities 256,531 191,866 172,965 1,099,149 1,086,116 589,762 Medium term notes 1,000,806 586,375 585,211 Senior subordinated notes 30,000 30,000 Total finance debt $ 2,099,955 $ 1,702,491 $ 1,204,973 Credit Facilities The Company has a $1.40 billion revolving credit facility (Global Credit Facility), which increased from $1.10 billion in 2006. Subject to certain limitations, HDFS has the option to borrow in various currencies. Interest is based on London interbank offered rates (LIBOR), European interbank offered rates or other short term indices, depending on the type of advance. The Global Credit Facility is a committed facility due in 2009 and HDFS pays a fee for its availability. On February 20, 2008, HDFS entered into an additonal $300.0 million credit facility. The primary use of the new facility is to provide additional liquidity to HDFS unsecured commerical paper program and to fund operations. Interest is based on LIBOR or other short term indices, depending on the type of advance. The facility is a committed facility due on the earlier of December 15, 2008 or the date HDFS refinances its existing $1.40 billion Global Credit Facility, and the Company pays a fee for its availability. The operating covenants under the new facility are similar to those that apply under HDFS existing $1.40 billion Global Credit Facility. As a result of the new facilty, HDFS may issue commerical paper of up to $1.70 billion in the aggregate. Maturities may range up to 365 days from the issuance date. Commercial Paper Subject to limitations, HDFS could issue commercial paper of up to $1.40 billion as of December 31, 2007 and $1.70 billion beginning on February 20, 2008. Maturities may range up to 365 days from the issuance date. Outstanding commercial paper may not exceed the unused portion of the Global Credit Facility. As a result, the combined total of commercial paper and borrowings under the Global Credit Facility was limited to $1.70 billion subsequent to the issuance of the new $300.0 million credit facility in February 2008, and $1.40 billion as of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2005, the combined total of commercial paper and borrowings under the Global Credit Facility was limited to $1.10 billion. Medium Term Notes In December 2007, HDFS issued $400.0 million of 5.25% medium term notes due in December 2012. HDFS also has $400.0 million of 3.63% medium term notes outstanding which are due in December 2008 and $200.0 million of 5.00% medium term notes due in December 2010 (all three issuances are collectively referred to as Notes). The Notes provide for semi annual interest payments and principal due at maturity. At December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Notes included a fair value adjustment increasing the balance by $1.3 million, and reducing the balance by $13.6 million and $14.7 million, respectively, due to interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges. The effect of the interest rate swap agreements is to convert the interest rate on the Notes from a fixed to a floating rate, which is based on 3 month LIBOR. Senior Subordinated Debt At December 31, 2006 and 2005, HDFS had $30.0 million of 6.79% senior subordinated notes outstanding which were due in December 2007. In December 2007, the notes matured and the principal and accrued interest was paid in full. Intercompany Borrowing HDFS has a revolving credit line with the Company whereby HDFS may borrow up to $210.0 million from the Company at a market interest rate. As of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, HDFS had no outstanding borrowings owed to the Company under this agreement. The Company has a support agreement with HDFS whereby, if required, the Company agrees to provide HDFS with financial support in order to maintain certain financial covenants. Support may be provided at the 52 Companys option as capital contributions or loans. Accordingly, certain debt covenants may restrict the Companys ability to withdraw funds from HDFS outside the normal course of business. No amount has ever been provided to HDFS under the support agreement. Operating and Financial Covenants HDFS is subject to various operating and financial covenants related to the Global Credit Facilities and Notes. The more significant covenants are described below. The operating covenants limit HDFS ability to incur certain additional indebtedness; assume or incur certain liens participate in a merger, consolidation, liquidation or dissolution; and purchase or hold margin stock. Under the Global Credit Facility financial covenants, the debt to equity ratio of HDFS and its consolidated subsidiaries cannot exceed 9.0 to 1.0 and HDFS must maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth of $300.0 million. No financial covenants are required under the Notes. At December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, HDFS remained in compliance with all of these covenants. The Company expects that future activities of HDFS will be financed from funds internally generated by HDFS, the sale of loans through securitization programs, issuance of commercial paper and medium term notes, borrowings under revolving credit facilities and advances or loans from the Company.(1) The Company will continue to evaluate various funding alternatives, and will adjust as necessary, based on market conditions.(1) Cautionary Statements The Companys ability to meet the targets and expectations noted in this Form 10 K depends upon, among other factors, the Companys ability to (i) continue to realize production efficiencies at its production facilities and effectively manage operating costs including materials, labor and overhead; (ii) manage production capacity and production changes; (iii) manage supply chain issues; (iv) provide products, services and experiences that are successful in the marketplace; (v) develop and implement sales and marketing plans that retain existing retail customers in an increasingly competitive marketplace; (vi) sell all of its motorcycles and related products and services to its independent dealers; (vii) continue to develop the capabilities of its distributor and dealer network; (viii) manage changes and prepare for requirements in legislative and regulatory environments for its products, services and operations; (ix) adjust to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices; (x) manage access to reliable sources of capital and adjust to fluctuations in the cost of capital; (xi) manage regional and worldwide demographic trends and economic and political conditions, including healthcare inflation, pension reform and tax changes; (xii) anticipate consumer confidence in the economy; (xiii) manage the credit quality, the loan servicing and collection activities and the recovery rates of HDFS loan portfolio; (xiv) retain and attract talented employees; (xv) detect any issues with our motorcycles or manufacturing processes to avoid delays in new model launches, recall campaigns, increased warranty costs or litigation; and (xvi) implement and manage enterprise wide information technology solutions and secure data contained in those systems. In addition, the Company could experience delays or disruptions in its operations as a result of work stoppages, strikes, natural causes, terrorism or other factors. These risks, potential delays and uncertainties regarding the costs could also adversely impact the Companys capital expenditure estimates (see Liquidity and Capital Resources section). In addition, see Risk Factors under Item 1A. which includes a discussion of additional risk factors and a more complete discussion of some of the cautionary statements noted above. 53 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. To reduce such risks, the Company selectively uses derivative financial instruments. All hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to regularly reviewed policies and procedures, which prohibit the use of financial instruments for trading purposes. Sensitivity analysis is used to manage and monitor foreign exchange and interest rate risk. A discussion of the Companys accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and further disclosure relating to the fair value of derivative financial instruments is included in Note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company sells its products internationally and in most markets those sales are made in the foreign countrys local currency. As a result, the Companys earnings can be affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currency. The Company utilizes foreign currency contracts to mitigate the effect of these fluctuations on earnings. The foreign currency contracts are entered into with banks and allow the Company to exchange a specified amount of foreign currency for U.S. dollars at a future date, based on a fixed exchange rate. At December 31, 2007, these contracts represented a combined U.S. dollar equivalent of $227.8 million. The Company estimates that a uniform 10% weakening in the value of the dollar relative to the currency underlying these contracts would result in a decrease in the fair value of the contracts of approximately $24.8 million as of December 31, 2007. The Companys exposure to the Japanese yen is substantially offset by the existence of a natural hedge, which is sustained through offsetting yen cash inflows from sales with yen cash outflows for motorcycle component purchases and other operating expenses. HDFS earnings are affected by changes in interest rates. HDFS utilizes interest rate swaps to reduce the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on its securitization transactions and debt. HDFS also entered into derivative contracts to facilitate its third quarter securitization transaction. These derivatives, which hedge assets by an off balance sheet QSPE, do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in current period earnings within other operating expenses. As of December 31, 2007, HDFS had interest rate swaps outstanding with a notional value of $2.00 billion. HDFS estimates that a 10% decrease in interest rates would result in a $1.2 million decrease in the fair value of the agreements. 54
