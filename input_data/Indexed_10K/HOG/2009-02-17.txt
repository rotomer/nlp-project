Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Harley Davidson, Inc. is the parent company for the groups of companies doing business as Harley Davidson Motor Company (HDMC), Buell Motorcycle Company (Buell), MV Agusta (MV) and Harley Davidson Financial Services (HDFS). HDMC produces heavyweight custom and touring motorcycles. HDMC manufactures five families of motorcycles: Touring, Dyna&reg;, Softail&reg;, Sportster&reg; and VRSC. Buell produces American sport performance motorcycles. MV produces premium, high performance sport motorcycles sold under the MV Agusta&reg; brand and lightweight sport motorcycles sold under the Cagiva&reg; brand. HDFS provides wholesale and retail financing and insurance programs primarily to Harley Davidson and Buell dealers and customers. The Company operates in two business segments: Motorcycles & Related Products (Motorcycles) and Financial Services (Financial Services). The Companys reportable segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services. They are managed separately based on the fundamental differences in their operations. The % Change figures included in the Results of Operations section were calculated using unrounded dollar amounts and may differ from calculations using the rounded dollar amounts presented. Overview The Companys 2008 results were impacted by the difficult economic environment including lower consumer confidence and significant disruptions in global capital markets. The Companys 2008 net revenue and net income were down 2.3% and 29.9%, respectively, compared to 2007. Operating income for the Motorcycles segment was down 21.5% while operating income for the Financial Services segment decreased 61.0%. Diluted earnings per share were $2.79 in 2008, a 25.4% decrease compared to last years $3.74. The Companys independent dealer network was also impacted by the economy, with worldwide retail sales of Harley Davidson motorcycles down 7.1% in 2008 as compared to 2007. In the U.S., retail sales of Harley Davidson motorcycles in 2008 were down 13.0%, while international retail sales were up 10.3% as compared to 2007. However, international retail sales growth slowed to 0.7 % during the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of deteriorating economic conditions outside the U.S. Outlook(1) In response to the 2008 results and an economic environment that continues to be challenging, the Company announced on January 23, 2009 a three part strategy to deal with the impact of the recession and the worldwide slowdown in consumer demand. In addition, the Company provided 2009 guidance that includes a planned decrease in Harley Davidson motorcycle shipments and gross margin.

To execute the first part of this strategy, the Company is reinforcing its support of the Harley Davidson brand, through its ongoing marketing efforts to reach out to emerging rider groups, including younger and diverse riders. In addition, the Company will continue to focus on product innovations targeted at specific growth opportunities within its strong core customer base and new riders. The second aspect of the Companys strategy will be implemented through a combination of restructuring actions. The restructuring actions are designed to reduce excess capacity, exit ancillary business operations and lower the Companys cost structure. The Companys planned actions include: consolidating its two engine and transmission plants in the Milwaukee area into its facility in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin; consolidating paint and frame operations at its assembly facility in York, Pennsylvania into existing operations at that site; closing its distribution facility in Franklin, Wisconsin, consolidating Parts and Accessories and General Merchandise distribution through a third party; and discontinuing the domestic transportation fleet. In addition to these restructuring activities, the Company will also be reducing its hourly workforce due to lower production volumes and the salaried workforce to reduce operating expenses. In total, the Company expects to eliminate approximately 1,100 positions over 2009 and 2010. Of that total, approximately 800 will be hourly production positions and approximately 300 will be non production, primarily salaried positions. The Company expects that approximately 800 positions (500 hourly production and 300 non production) of the total will be eliminated in 2009 and all but approximately 100 of these reductions will occur in the first half of the year. The remaining 300 jobs will be eliminated during 2010 as the final stages of consolidating the engine and transmission operations are completed. The Company estimates that costs associated with the restructuring activities will be incurred over 2009 and 2010 and will total approximately $110 million to $140 million. The Company expects that approximately 75% of these costs will be paid in cash with the balance consisting of non cash charges. The Company expects to incur between $80 million and $100 million of these costs in 2009, with $30 million to $40 million in the first quarter. The remaining restructuring costs, between $30 million and $40 million, are expected to be incurred in 2010. Restructuring costs will be excluded from gross profit and disclosed separately in the Companys income statement. The Company expects the ongoing annual benefit of its restructuring activities to be between $60 million and $70 million beginning in 2011. During 2009 and 2010, the Company expects that the annual benefit of these activities will be $10 million to $20 million and $30 million to $50 million, respectively. The third aspect of the Companys strategy will focus on obtaining funding for HDFS. The Company is evaluating a range of options to provide the necessary liquidity for the wholesale and retail lending activities of HDFS. In order to meet HDFS funding needs for the remainder of 2009, the Company intends to pursue a combination of actions, including (a) accessing the unsecured debt capital markets, (b) increasing and extending its existing asset backed commercial paper conduit facility, (c) renewing its 364 day credit facility that expires in July 2009 and (d) gaining access to the asset backed securitization market through the U.S. Federal Reserves Term Asset backed securities Loan Facility (TALF) program. These options are discussed in greater detail under Liquidity and Capital Resources. 29 Table of Contents 2009 Guidance Given the uncertain and unpredictable global economy in 2009, the Company has decided not to provide 2009 earnings per share guidance at this time and has instead provided full year and quarterly shipment guidance, gross margin expectations and anticipated capital expenditures. On January 23, 2009, the Company announced that it plans to ship between 264,000 and 273,000 Harley Davidson motorcycles in 2009, a decrease of 10% to 13% compared to 2008. In the first quarter of 2009, the Company expects to ship between 74,000 to 78,000 Harley Davidson motorcycles, a 3.0% to 8.5% increase over the first quarter of 2008 as the Company and its independent dealers and distributors prepare for the spring and summer selling season. For the full year of 2009, the Company expects gross margin to be between 30.5% and 31.5%. The Companys gross margin expectations include anticipated benefits of the restructuring activities in 2009. However, these benefits are expected to be more than offset by three primary factors (as compared to 2008): higher anticipated fixed costs per unit resulting from the allocation of fixed costs over fewer units; lower anticipated gross margin resulting from a change in the motorcycle product mix; and lower anticipated gross margin resulting from the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes. Finally, the Company expects its capital expenditures in 2009 to be lower than in 2008, with planned expenditures of $180 million to $200 million in 2009. In addition, the Company expects to incur approximately $10 to $20 million of capital expenditures in connection with its restructuring activities in 2009. Results of Operations 2008 Compared to 2007 Consolidated Results (in millions, except earnings per share and effective income tax rate) 2008 2007 (Decrease)Increase %Change Operating income from motorcycles & related products $ 966.4 $ 1,230.6 $ (264.2 ) (21.5 )% Operating income from financial services $ 82.8 $ 212.2 $ (129.4 ) (61.0 )% Investment income $ 9.5 $ 22.3 $ (12.8 ) (57.3 )% Interest expense $ 4.5 $ 4.5 N/M Net income $ 654.7 $ 933.8 $ (279.1 ) (29.9 )% Diluted earnings per share $ 2.79 $ 3.74 $ (0.95 ) (25.4 )% Effective income tax rate 36.7 % 35.5 % As discussed in the Overview, operating income for both of the Companys segments was impacted by the difficult economic environment including lower consumer confidence and significant disruptions in global capital markets. Motorcycles operating income fell 21.5% during 2008, driven by a decrease in shipments of Harley Davidson motorcycles. In addition, lower operating income from Financial Services driven by lower securitization income and a write down of finance receivables and investment of retained securitization interests, contributed to the decrease in consolidated income from operations for 2008. Please refer to the detailed discussion of segment results following. 30 Table of Contents Investment income was lower during 2008 due to the decrease in average cash and marketable securities during the year. Interest expense during 2008 relates to debt incurred in connection with the acquisition of MV. The Companys effective income tax rate for 2008 was 36.7% compared to 35.5% in 2007. The increase was due primarily to tax implications associated with the acquisition and ongoing operations of MV. Diluted earnings per share during 2008 were down 25.4% from 2007 on lower net income which more than offset the positive impact of fewer weighted average shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share during 2008 were positively impacted by a decrease in the weighted average shares outstanding, which were 234.5 million in 2008 compared to 249.9 million in 2007. The decrease in weighted average shares outstanding was driven by the Companys repurchases of common stock over 2007 and 2008 through August. The Companys 2008 share repurchases are discussed in further detail under Liquidity and Capital Resources. Motorcycle Unit Shipments and Net Revenue The following table includes wholesale motorcycle unit shipments for the Motorcycles segment: 2008 2007 (Decrease)Increase %Change Motorcycle Unit Shipments United States 206,309 68.0 % 241,539 73.1 % (35,230 ) (14.6 )% International 97,170 32.0 % 89,080 26.9 % 8,090 9.1 Harley Davidson motorcycle units 303,479 100.0 % 330,619 100.0 % (27,140 ) (8.2 ) Touring motorcycle units 101,887 33.6 % 114,076 34.5 % (12,189 ) (10.7 ) Custom motorcycle units* 140,908 46.4 % 144,507 43.7 % (3,599 ) (2.5 ) Sportster motorcycle units 60,684 20.0 % 72,036 21.8 % (11,352 ) (15.8 ) Harley Davidson motorcycle units 303,479 100.0 % 330,619 100.0 % (27,140 ) (8.2 ) Buell motorcycle units 13,119 11,513 1,606 13.9 % * Custom motorcycle units, as used in this table, include Dyna, Softail, VRSC and CVO models. During 2008, the Company shipped 303,479 Harley Davidson motorcycles, a decrease of 27,140 motorcycles, or 8.2%, from last year. The Companys shipments in the U.S. in 2008 continued to be negatively impacted by the challenging economic environment, but were consistent with the Companys expectations to ship 23,000 to 27,000 fewer Harley Davidson motorcycles in 2008 than were shipped in 2007. The Companys shipments in international markets grew during 2008, and the percentage of units shipped to international customers increased, consistent with the Companys strategic focus on global markets. 31 Table of Contents The following table includes net revenue for the Motorcycles segment (in millions): 2008 2007 (Decrease)Increase %Change Net Revenue Harley Davidson motorcycles $ 4,278.2 $ 4,446.6 $ (168.4 ) (3.8 )% Buell motorcycles 123.1 100.5 22.6 22.4 4,401.3 4,547.1 (145.8 ) (3.2 ) Parts & Accessories 858.7 868.3 (9.6 ) (1.1 ) General Merchandise 313.8 305.4 8.4 2.8 Other 20.5 6.0 14.5 N/M Net revenue $ 5,594.3 $ 5,726.8 $ (132.5 ) (2.3 )% Motorcycles segment net revenue decreased $132.5 million, or 2.3%. Net revenue was lower by approximately $323 million primarily due to the 8.2% lower shipment volume of Harley Davidson motorcycles. Partially offsetting the unfavorability in volume was favorability resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $95 million and product mix changes of approximately $70 million. In addition, wholesale price increases on Harley Davidson motorcycles contributed approximately $21 million to revenue. 32 Table of Contents Harley Davidson Motorcycle Retail Sales The Company sells its motorcycles at wholesale to an independent network of dealers and distributors who in turn sell the Companys products at retail. Worldwide retail sales of Harley Davidson motorcycles decreased 7.1% during 2008 relative to 2007. Retail sales of Harley Davidson motorcycles decreased 13.0% in the United States while growing 10.3% internationally. On an industry wide basis, the heavyweight (651+cc) portion of the market was down 7.0% in the United States while growing 2.2% in Europe when compared to the same periods in 2007.

Industry retail motorcycle registration data includes 651+cc models derived from information provided by Giral S.A., an independent agency. Industry retail registration data for the remaining international markets has not been presented because the Company does not believe definitive and reliable registration data is available at this time. Cost of Goods Sold Cost of goods sold was $3.66 billion for the Motorcycles segment in 2008, an increase of $50.7 million or 1.4% versus last year. The increased cost was led by higher manufacturing and raw material costs of approximately $117 million. Manufacturing costs increased partially as the result of a higher fixed cost per unit due to allocating fixed costs to fewer units. Additionally, higher manufacturing costs were the result of increased product cost as the Company invests in new models and increased product content, such as new features and options on the Companys motorcycles. Raw material surcharges were approximately $23 million higher when compared to the prior year. Cost of goods sold also increased by approximately $29 million resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and approximately $42 million related to changes in product mix. Partially offsetting these cost increases were lower costs of approximately $137 million resulting from lower shipment volumes. Gross Profit Gross profit was $1.93 billion for the Motorcycles segment for 2008, a decrease of $183.3 million or 8.7% versus 2007. Gross margin for 2008 was 34.5% compared to 36.9% for 2007. The factors impacting the change in gross margin are detailed under Motorcycle Unit Shipments and Net Revenue and Cost of Goods Sold above. 34 Table of Contents Financial Services The following table includes the condensed statements of operations for the Financial Services segment (in millions): 2008 2007 Increase(Decrease) %Change Interest income $ 290.1 $ 196.8 $ 93.3 47.4 % Income from securitizations 13.4 97.6 (84.2 ) (86.2 ) Other income 73.5 121.8 (48.3 ) (39.7 ) Financial services income 377.0 416.2 (39.2 ) (9.4 ) Interest expense 136.8 81.5 55.3 67.9 Operating expenses 157.4 122.5 34.9 28.5 Financial services expense 294.2 204.0 90.2 44.2 Operating income from financial services $ 82.8 $ 212.2 $ (129.4 ) (61.0 )% Interest income benefited from higher average retail outstanding receivables, partially offset by lower wholesale lending rates and slightly lower average wholesale outstanding receivables. Interest expense was higher due to increased borrowings to support growth in outstanding retail receivables, partially offset by lower borrowing rates. The increase in retail receivables outstanding was driven by a reduction in term asset backed securitization activity during 2008 due to capital market volatility. The increase in operating expenses is primarily due to a $28.4 million increase in the provision for credit losses. Other income decreased during 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily due to a $37.8 million charge to earnings from the lower of cost or market value of its finance receivables held for sale. HDFS uses discounted cash flow methodologies to estimate the fair value of finance receivables held for sale that incorporate appropriate assumptions for discount rate, funding costs and credit enhancement, as well as estimates concerning credit losses and prepayments that, in managements judgment, reflect assumptions marketplace participants would use. Any amount by which cost exceeds fair value is accounted for as a valuation adjustment with an offset to other income. The decline in fair value below cost was due to higher projected credit losses, increased funding costs and an increased discount rate in the fourth quarter of 2008 from 12% to 18%. Income from securitizations during 2008 was lower as compared to 2007 due to a $41.4 million write down of certain retained interests during 2008, a loss on the first quarter 2008 securitization transaction and the absence of a securitization transaction in the last three quarters of 2008. This compares to a $9.9 million write down and three securitization transactions completed in 2007. During 2008, HDFS sold $540.0 million in retail motorcycle loans in a securitization transaction and recognized a loss of $5.4 million, or 0.99% as a percentage of loans sold. This compares to a gain as a percentage of loans sold of 1.42%, or $36.0 million, on $2.53 billion of loans securitized in 2007. The loss in 2008 was driven by increased securitization funding costs due to capital market volatility and higher projected credit losses. In the 2008 securitization transaction, HDFS retained $54.0 million of the subordinated securities issued by the securitization trust. The subordinated securities that were retained have been included in the investment in retained securitization interests (a component of finance receivables held for investment) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The cash proceeds from the 2008 securitization transaction are net of the cost of the retained subordinated securities. Income from securitizations was also negatively impacted in 2008 by a $41.4 million write down of certain retained securitization interests. The write downs, which occurred in June and December of 2008 and are considered permanent impairments, resulted from a decline in the fair value of certain retained securitization interests due to higher actual and anticipated credit losses on those securitization portfolios and an increase in the discount rate from 12% to 18% in the fourth quarter of 2008. This compares to an impairment charge of $9.9 million incurred in 2007. 35 Table of Contents HDFS reviews its assumptions for determining the fair value of the investment in retained securitization interests each quarter. Key assumptions include expected losses, prepayment speed and discount rate. HDFS determines these assumptions by reviewing historical trends and current economic conditions. Given the challenging U.S. economy, credit losses on HDFS retail installment loans have increased, and as a result, the fair value of retained securitization interests has declined and in some cases this decline is permanent. Depending on the behavior of future loss rates, prepayment speeds and the discount rate, HDFS could experience further write downs of its retained interests, which had a fair value of $330.7 million as of December 31, 2008. A write down in the retained securitization interest generally represents a non cash charge in the period in which it is recorded, but ultimately represents a reduction in the residual cash flow that HDFS expects to receive from its investment in retained securitization interests. Annualized losses on HDFS managed retail motorcycle loans were 2.30% in 2008 compared to 1.91% for 2007. The 30 day delinquency rate for managed retail motorcycle loans at December 31, 2008 increased to 6.29% from 6.15% at December 31, 2007. Managed retail loans include loans held by HDFS as well as those sold through securitization transactions. The increase in losses was primarily due to a higher incidence of loss resulting from an increase in delinquent accounts. The Company expects that HDFS will continue to experience higher delinquencies and credit losses as a percentage of managed retail motorcycle loans in 2009 as compared to 2008. Changes in the allowance for finance credit losses on finance receivables held for investment were as follows (in millions): 2008 2007 Balance, beginning of period $ 30.3 $ 27.3 Provision for finance credit losses 39.6 11.2 Charge offs, net of recoveries (29.8 ) (8.2 ) Balance, end of period $ 40.1 $ 30.3 HDFS periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for finance credit losses on finance receivables held for investment is generally based on HDFS past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio and current economic conditions. HDFS believes the allowance is adequate to cover the losses of principal in the existing portfolio. Operating Expenses The following table includes operating expenses for the Motorcycles segment and Corporate (in millions): 2008 2007 Increase(Decrease) %Change Motorcycles and Related Products Selling & Administrative $ 796.3 $ 692.8 $ 103.5 14.9 % Engineering 168.1 190.6 (22.5 ) (11.8 ) Corporate 20.2 17.3 2.9 16.7 Total operating expenses $ 984.6 $ 900.7 $ 83.9 9.3 % Total operating expenses were 17.6% and 15.7% of net revenue for 2008 and 2007, respectively. Selling and administrative expenses include the impact of the one time $20.1 million expense related to the value of in process research and development at MV (see Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion) and a $12.4 million restructuring charge incurred by the Company during 2008 (see Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion). In addition, selling and administrative expenses were higher due to higher international operating costs associated with the Companys international growth. 36 Table of Contents Results of Operations 2007 Compared to 2006 Consolidated Results (in millions, except earnings per share and effective income tax rate) 2007 2006 (Decrease)Increase %Change Operating income from motorcycles & related products $ 1,230.6 $ 1,409.0 $ (178.4 ) (12.7 )% Operating income from financial services $ 212.2 $ 210.7 $ 1.5 0.7 % Investment income $ 22.3 $ 27.1 $ (4.8 ) (17.8 )% Net income $ 933.8 $ 1,043.2 $ (109.4 ) (10.5 )% Diluted earnings per share $ 3.74 $ 3.93 $ (0.19 ) (4.8 )% Effective income tax rate 35.5 % 35.8 % The decrease in Motorcycles operating income was driven primarily by a decrease in shipments of Harley Davidson motorcycles. Please refer to the detailed discussion of segment results following. Investment income, net in 2007 was $22.3 million, compared to $27.1 million in 2006. Net investment income decreased due primarily to lower average short term investment balances in 2007 when compared to 2006. The Companys effective income tax rate was 35.5% during 2007 compared to 35.8% in 2006. The decrease is due primarily to a higher benefit from the domestic manufacturing deduction and slightly lower state income taxes in 2007. Diluted earnings per share during 2007 were positively impacted by a decrease in the weighted average shares outstanding, which were 249.9 million in 2007 compared to 265.3 million in 2006. The decrease in weighted average shares outstanding was driven by the Companys repurchases of 20.4 million shares of common stock during 2007. Share repurchases are discussed in further detail under Liquidity and Capital Resources.

This decrease was driven by a 31,673 unit reduction in shipments to U.S. dealers that were partially offset by a 13,096 unit increase in shipments outside the U.S. International shipments represented 26.9% of total Harley Davidson wholesale shipments for 2007, compared to 21.8% for 2006.

Net revenue was approximately $221 million lower due to an overall decrease in sales volumes from the prior year. The lower volumes were primarily driven by the 5.3% decrease in Harley Davidson motorcycle unit shipments partially offset by higher sales volumes for General Merchandise. Net revenue was also negatively impacted during 2007 by higher sales incentive costs. These decreases were partially offset by higher revenue from wholesale price increases on Harley Davidson motorcycles of approximately $60 million, favorability resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $87 million (driven primarily by the strengthening of the Euro against the U.S. dollar during 2007) and changes to product mix which resulted in higher revenue of approximately $16 million. During 2007, the higher revenue resulting from changes in product mix was due primarily to mix changes that occurred within the motorcycle families and by the sale of higher priced 105th Anniversary models beginning in the second half of 2007. The positive revenue impact that resulted from mix changes within motorcycle families was partially offset by lower revenue resulting from changes in mix between motorcycle families. 38 Table of Contents Harley Davidson Motorcycle Retail Sales The Company sells its motorcycles at wholesale to an independent network of distributors and dealers who in turn sell the Companys products at retail. Worldwide retail sales of Harley Davidson motorcycles decreased 1.8% during 2007 relative to 2006. Retail sales of Harley Davidson motorcycles decreased 6.2% in the United States while growing 13.7% internationally including a 15.0% increase in Europe. On an industry wide basis in 2007, the heavyweight (651+cc) portion of the market was down 5.0% in the United States while growing 5.4% in Europe when compared to 2006. The following table includes retail unit sales of Harley Davidson motorcycles: Harley Davidson Motorcycle Retail Sales(a) Heavyweight (651+cc) 2007 2006 (Decrease)Increase %Change North America Region United States 251,772 268,366 (16,594 ) (6.2 )% Canada 14,779 13,514 1,265 9.4 Total North America Region 266,551 281,880 (15,329 ) (5.4 ) Europe Region (Includes Middle East and Africa) Europe(b) 38,866 33,786 5,080 15.0 Other 3,436 2,746 690 25.1 Total Europe Region 42,302 36,532 5,770 15.8 Asia Pacific Region Japan 13,765 13,284 481 3.6 Other 9,689 7,744 1,945 25.1 Total Asia Pacific Region 23,454 21,028 2,426 11.5 Latin America Region 5,467 4,541 926 20.4 Total Worldwide Retail Sales 337,774 343,981 (6,207 ) (1.8 )% (a) Data source for retail sales figures shown above is sales warranty and registration information provided by Harley Davidson dealers and compiled by the Company.

Industry retail motorcycle registration data includes 651+cc models derived from information provided by Giral S.A., an independent agency. Industry retail registration data for the remaining international markets has not been presented because the Company does not believe definitive and reliable registration data is available at this time. Cost of Goods Sold Cost of goods sold was $3.61 billion for the Motorcycles segment during 2007, an increase of $44.9 million or 1.3% versus 2006. During 2007, cost of goods sold was higher due to increased manufacturing and raw material costs of approximately $154 million. The increase in manufacturing costs was driven by higher fixed costs per unit resulting from the allocation of these costs to fewer units in 2007 and other manufacturing inefficiencies experienced during 2007 including those associated with the 2008 new model year launch and the York, Pennsylvania assembly plant strike during February 2007. Raw material surcharges were approximately $31 million higher when compared to 2006. During 2007, cost of goods sold was also higher by approximately $44 million resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and approximately $4 million related to changes in product mix. The decrease in cost of goods sold during 2007 resulting from lower shipments, partially offsetting the increased costs described above, was approximately $126 million. Gross Profit Gross profit was $2.11 billion for the Motorcycles segment during 2007, a decrease of $118.7 million or 5.3% compared to 2006. Gross profit margin for 2007 was 36.9% compared to 38.5% during 2006. The factors impacting the change in gross margin are detailed under Motorcycle Unit Shipments and Net Revenue and Cost of Goods Sold above. 40 Table of Contents Financial Services The following table includes the condensed statements of operations for the Financial Services segment (in millions): 2007 2006 Increase(Decrease) %Change Interest income $ 196.8 $ 167.5 $ 29.3 17.5 % Income from securitizations 97.6 111.2 (13.6 ) (12.2 ) Other income 121.8 106.2 15.6 14.7 Financial services income 416.2 384.9 31.3 8.1 Interest expense 81.5 59.8 21.7 36.3 Operating expenses 122.5 114.4 8.1 7.1 Financial services expense 204.0 174.2 29.8 17.1 Operating income from financial services $ 212.2 $ 210.7 $ 1.5 0.7 % Interest income increased due to higher average retail and wholesale outstanding receivables. The increase in other income was primarily due to higher credit card licensing income, securitization servicing income and insurance commission revenue. Interest expense was higher due to increased borrowings to support growth in outstanding receivables and higher borrowing rates. Income from securitizations decreased as higher securitization gains were offset by a reduction in income from retained securitization interests. During 2007, HDFS sold $2.53 billion in retail motorcycle loans through securitization transactions resulting in gains of $36.0 million. This compares with gains of $32.3 million on $2.33 billion of loans securitized during 2006. The 2007 gain as a percentage of loans sold was 1.42% as compared to 1.39% for 2006. Income on the investment in retained securitization interests decreased to $61.6 million from $78.9 million. The reduction in income was due to higher than projected credit losses used in the valuation of retained securitization interests as well as $9.9 million in write downs of certain retained securitization interests. The write downs, which occurred in March and December of 2007 and are considered permanent impairments, result from a decline in the fair value of certain retained securitization interest due to higher actual and anticipated credit losses on those securitization portfolios, partially offset by a slowing in actual and expected prepayment speeds. Annualized losses on HDFS managed retail motorcycle loans totaled 1.91% in 2007 compared to 1.41% for 2006. Managed retail loans include loans held by HDFS as well as those sold through securitization transactions. The 30 day delinquency rate for managed retail motorcycle loans at December 31, 2007 increased to 6.15% from 5.18% at December 31, 2006. This increase in losses was primarily due to an increase in delinquent accounts resulting in a higher incidence of loss as well as pressure on values for repossessed motorcycles. Changes in the allowance for finance credit losses on finance receivables held for investment were as follows (in millions): 2007 2006 Balance, beginning of period $ 27.3 $ 26.2 Provision for finance credit losses 11.2 5.9 Charge offs, net of recoveries (8.2 ) (4.8 ) Balance, end of period $ 30.3 $ 27.3 HDFS periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for finance credit losses on finance receivables held for investment is generally based on HDFS past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio and current economic conditions. 41 Table of Contents Operating Expenses The following table includes operating expenses for the Motorcycles segment and Corporate (in millions): 2007 2006 Increase(Decrease) %Change Motorcycles and Related Products Selling & Administrative $ 692.8 $ 637.5 $ 55.3 8.7 % Engineering 190.6 186.2 4.4 2.4 Corporate 17.3 22.7 (5.4 ) (23.5 ) Total operating expenses $ 900.7 $ 846.4 $ 54.3 6.4 % Total operating expenses were 15.7% and 14.6% of net revenue for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Selling and administrative expenses were higher due primarily to increased marketing costs and higher international operating costs in connection with the Companys growth in those markets combined with unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These cost increases were partially offset by a decrease in expense associated with the Companys short term incentive compensation programs. Other Matters New Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations. SFAS No. 141(R) changes the accounting for business combinations in a number of areas including the treatment of contingent consideration, pre acquisition contingencies, transaction costs, in process research and development and restructuring costs. In addition, under SFAS No. 141(R), changes in an acquired entitys deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions after the measurement period will impact income tax expense. SFAS No. 141(R) will be effective for the Company beginning in fiscal year 2009. This standard will change the Companys accounting treatment for business combinations on a prospective basis, when adopted. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133. SFAS No. 161 requires enhanced disclosures about an entitys derivative and hedging activities. Entities will be required to provide enhanced disclosures about: (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments; (b) how derivative instruments and related hedge items are accounted for under SFAS No. 133 and its related interpretations; and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedge items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance and cash flows. The Company is required to adopt SFAS No. 161 beginning in fiscal year 2009. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the new disclosure requirements will have on its consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. In December 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. SFAS 132(R) 1, Employers Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets. FSP No. SFAS 132(R) 1 requires additional fair value disclosures about employers pension and postretirement benefit plan assets consistent with guidance contained in SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. Specifically, employers will be required to disclose information about how investment allocation decisions are made, the fair value of each major category of plan assets and information about the inputs and valuation techniques used to develop the fair value measurements of plan assets. FSP No. SFAS 132(R) 1 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the new disclosure requirements will have on its consolidated financial statements and notes. 42 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Estimates The Companys financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies, which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions. Management believes that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of accounting policies that currently affect the Companys financial condition and results of operations. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Finance Receivable Securitizations The Company has sold retail motorcycle loans through securitization transactions utilizing Qualifying Special Purpose Entities (QSPEs) as defined by SFAS No. 140 Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. Upon sale of retail loans in a securitization transaction, HDFS receives cash and retains an interest in excess cash flows, subordinated securities, and cash reserve account deposits, all of which are collectively referred to as retained interests in the securitized receivables. Retained interests are carried at fair value and are periodically reviewed for impairment. Market value quotes of fair value are generally not available for retained interests. Therefore, fair value is measured using discounted cash flow methodologies that incorporate managements best estimate of key assumptions that, in managements judgment, reflect the assumptions marketplace participants would use. The impact of changes to key assumptions is shown in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. HDFS retains servicing rights under retail loans that it has sold to the securitization trust and receives a servicing fee. The servicing fee paid to HDFS is considered adequate compensation for the services provided and is included in financial services income as earned. Gains or losses on current year securitizations from the sale of retail loans are recorded as a component of financial services income and are based in part on certain assumptions including expected credit losses, prepayment speed, and discount rates. Gains or losses on sales of retail loans also depend on the original carrying amount of the retail loans, which is allocated between the assets sold and the retained interests based on their relative fair value at the date of transfer. Valuation of Loans Held for Sale Finance receivables held for sale in the aggregate are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value. HDFS uses discounted cash flow methodologies to estimate the fair value of finance receivables held for sale that incorporate appropriate assumptions for discount rate, funding costs and credit enhancement, as well as estimates concerning credit losses and prepayments that, in managements judgment, reflect assumptions marketplace participants would use. Any amount by which cost exceeds fair value is accounted for as a valuation adjustment with an offset to other income. Allowance for Finance Credit Losses on Finance Receivables Held for Investment The allowance for uncollectible accounts is maintained at a level management believes is adequate to cover the losses of principal in the existing finance receivables held for investment portfolio. Managements periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is generally based on HDFS past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, current economic conditions, specific borrowers ability to repay and the estimated value of any underlying collateral. Product Warranty Estimated warranty costs are reserved for each motorcycle at the time of sale. The warranty reserve is an estimated cost per unit sold based upon historical Company claim data used in combination with other known factors that may affect future warranty claims. The Company updates its warranty estimates quarterly to ensure that the warranty reserves are based on the most current information available. The Company believes that past claim experience is indicative of future claims; however, the factors affecting actual claims can be volatile. As a result, actual claims experience may differ from estimated which could lead to material changes in the Companys warranty provision and related reserves. The Companys warranty liability is discussed further in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits The Company has several defined benefit pension plans and several postretirement healthcare benefit plans, which cover substantially all employees of the Motorcycles segment. The Company also has unfunded supplemental employee retirement plan agreements (SERPA) with certain employees which were instituted to replace benefits lost under the Tax Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993. Retirement Plan (pension, SERPA and postretirement healthcare) obligations and costs are calculated through actuarial valuations. The valuation of benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs relies on key assumptions including discount rates, long term expected return on plan assets, future compensation and healthcare cost trend rates. As discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company adopted the measurement date provisions of SFAS No. 158 as of January 1, 2008. Accordingly, the Companys actuarial measurement date (the date when the Company evaluates and updates all of its assumptions) changed from September 30 to December 31. 43 Table of Contents The Company determines its discount rate assumptions by referencing high quality long term bond rates that are matched to the duration of its own benefit obligations. Based on this analysis, the discount rate for Retirement Plan obligations was decreased from 6.30% as of September 30, 2007 to 6.10% as of December 31, 2008. The Company determines its healthcare trend assumption for the postretirement healthcare obligation by considering factors such as estimated healthcare inflation, the utilization of healthcare benefits and changes in the health of plan participants. Based on the Companys assessment of this data as of December 31, 2008, the Company lowered its healthcare cost trend rate to 8% from 9% as of September 30, 2007. The Company expects the healthcare cost trend rate to reach its ultimate rate of 5% beginning in 2014. These assumption changes were reflected immediately in the benefit obligation and will be amortized into net periodic benefit costs over future periods. The following information is provided to illustrate the sensitivity of pension and postretirement healthcare obligations and costs to changes in these major assumptions (in thousands): Amounts basedon currentassumptions Impact of a 1%decrease in thediscount rate Impact of a 1%increase in thehealthcare costtrend rate 2008 Net periodic benefit costs Pension and SERPA $ 44,466 $ 20,380 n/a Postretirement healthcare $ 32,745 $ 2,516 $ 1,367 2008 Benefit obligations Pension and SERPA $ 1,178,283 $ 169,810 n/a Postretirement healthcare $ 372,631 $ 42,097 $ 12,929 This information should not be viewed as predictive of future amounts. The calculation of Retirement Plan obligations and costs is based on many factors in addition to those discussed here. This information should be considered in combination with the information provided in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Stock Compensation Costs The total cost of the Companys share based awards is equal to the grant date fair value per award multiplied by the number of awards granted (adjusted for forfeitures). This cost is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the service periods of the awards. Forfeitures are initially estimated based on historical Company information and subsequently updated over the life of the awards to ultimately reflect actual forfeitures. As a result, changes in forfeiture activity can influence the amount of stock compensation cost recognized from period to period. The Company generally determines the number of share based awards granted by first determining the total cost of the award, which is a function of employee salary, level and performance. On the date of grant, the number of awards granted is then computed by dividing the total cost of the award by the grant date fair value of the award unit. The Company estimates the fair value of option awards as of the grant date using a lattice based option valuation model which utilizes ranges of assumptions over the expected term of the options, including stock price volatility, dividend yield and risk free interest rate. The valuation model uses historical data to estimate option exercise behavior and employee terminations. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. 44 Table of Contents The Company uses implied volatility to determine the expected volatility of its stock. Implied volatility take into account both historical and future expectations of volatility. The implied volatility is derived from options that are actively traded and the market prices of both the traded options and underlying shares are measured at a similar point in time to each other and on a date reasonably close to the grant date of the employee share options. In addition, the traded options have exercise prices that are both (a) near the money and (b) close to the exercise price of the employee share options. Finally, the remaining maturities of the traded options on which the estimate is based are at least one year. Dividend yield was based on the Companys expected dividend payments and the risk free rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Changes in the valuation assumptions could result in a significant change to the cost of an individual option. However, the total cost of an award is also a function of the number of awards granted, and as result, the Company has the ability to control the cost of its equity awards by adjusting the number of awards granted. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and other loss carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the Companys worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related deferred tax assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of the Companys business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Accruals for unrecognized tax benefits are provided for in accordance with the requirements of FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. An unrecognized tax benefit represents the difference between the recognition of benefits related to exposure items for income tax reporting purposes and financial reporting purposes. The unrecognized tax benefit is included within other long term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company has a reserve for interest and penalties on exposure items, if applicable, which is recorded as a component of the overall income tax provision. The Company is regularly under audit by tax authorities. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, management believes that it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns and that its annual tax provision includes amounts sufficient to pay any assessments. Nonetheless, the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year. Contractual Obligations A summary of the Companys expected payments for significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2008 is as follows (in thousands): 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Principal payments on debt $ 1,738,649 $ 596,819 $ 399,643 $ 998,179 $ 3,733,290 Interest payments on debt 149,224 226,570 157,318 298,822 831,934 Operating lease payments 12,225 15,503 8,685 18,020 54,433 $ 1,900,098 $ 838,892 $ 565,646 $ 1,315,021 $ 4,619,657 As described in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2008, the Company classified $568.7 million related to its unsecured commercial paper and its Global Credit Facilities (as defined in Liquidity and Capital Resources) as long term debt as of December 31, 2008. This amount is classified as long term because it is supported by the Global Credit Facilities and is expected to remain outstanding for an uninterrupted period extending beyond one year; accordingly, the Company has assumed that this amount will be repaid in 2011. Interest obligations include the impact of interest rate hedges outstanding as of December 31, 2008. Interest for floating rate instruments, as calculated above, assumes December 31, 2008 rates remain constant. 45 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2008, the Company had no material purchase obligations other than those created in the ordinary course of business related to inventory and property, plant and equipment which generally have terms of less than 90 days. The Company has long term obligations related to its pension and postretirement plans at December 31, 2008. Due to the current funded status of the pension and postretirement plans, the Company is anticipating future contributions, beyond the amounts of current benefit payments, will be necessary for 2009. The Companys expected future contributions to these plans are provided in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As described in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has unrecognized tax benefits of $79.0 million and accrued interest and penalties of $23.2 million as of December 31, 2008. However, the Company cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate for the period of cash settlement for either the $79.0 million of liability of unrecognized tax benefits or accrued interest and penalties of $23.2 million. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of its term asset backed securitization program, HDFS transfers retail motorcycle loans to a special purpose bankruptcy remote wholly owned subsidiary. The subsidiary sells the retail loans to a securitization trust in exchange for the proceeds from term asset backed securities issued by the securitization trust. The term asset backed securities, usually notes with various maturities and interest rates, are secured by future collections of the purchased retail installment loans. Activities of the securitization trust are limited to acquiring retail loans, issuing term asset backed securities and making payments on securities to investors. Due to the nature of the assets held by the securitization trust and the limited nature of its activities, the securitization trusts are considered Qualifying Special Purpose Entities (QSPEs) as defined by SFAS No. 140. In accordance with SFAS No. 140, assets and liabilities of the QSPEs are not consolidated in the financial statements of the Company. HDFS does not guarantee payments on the securities issued by the securitization trusts or the projected cash flows from the related loans purchased from HDFS. The Companys retained securitization interests, excluding servicing rights, are subordinate to the interests of securitization trust investors. Such investors have priority interests in the cash collections on the retail loans sold to the securitization trust (after payment of servicing fees) and in the cash reserve account deposits. These priority interests ultimately could impact the value of the Companys investment in retained securitization interests. Investors also do not have recourse to assets of HDFS for failure of the obligors on the retail loans to pay when due. Total investment in retained securitization interests at December 31, 2008 was $330.7 million. The securitization trusts have a limited life and generally terminate upon final distribution of amounts owed to the investors in the term asset backed securities. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of HDFS term asset backed securitization program. As discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company utilized an asset backed commercial paper conduit facility that did not satisfy the requirements for accounting sale treatment under SFAS No. 140. Commitments and Contingencies The Company is subject to lawsuits and other claims related to environmental, product and other matters. In determining required reserves related to these items, the Company carefully analyzes cases and considers the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes, as well as the potential range of possible loss. The required reserves are monitored on an ongoing basis and are updated based on new developments or new information in each matter. Shareholder Lawsuits: A number of shareholder class action lawsuits were filed between May 18, 2005 and July 1, 2005 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. On February 14, 2006, the court consolidated all of the actions into a single case, captioned In re Harley Davidson, Inc. Securities Litigation, and appointed Lead Plaintiffs and Co Lead Plaintiffs Counsel. Pursuant to the schedule set by the court, on October 2, 2006, the Lead Plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Class Action Complaint, which names the Company and Jeffrey L. Bleustein, James L. Ziemer, and James M. Brostowitz, who are current or former Company officers, as defendants. The Consolidated Complaint alleges securities law violations and seeks unspecified damages relating generally to the Companys April 13, 2005 announcement that it was reducing short term production growth and planned increases of motorcycle 46 Table of Contents shipments from 317,000 units in 2004 to a new 2005 target of 329,000 units (compared to its original target of 339,000 units). On December 18, 2006, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Consolidated Complaint in its entirety. Briefing of the motion to dismiss was completed in April 2007. Three shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin on June 3, 2005, October 25, 2005 (this lawsuit was later voluntarily dismissed) and December 2, 2005 and two shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed in Milwaukee County Circuit Court on July 22, 2005 and November 16, 2005 against some or all of the following current or former directors and officers of the Company: Jeffrey L. Bleustein, James L. Ziemer, James M. Brostowitz, Barry K. Allen, Richard I. Beattie, George H. Conrades, Judson C. Green, Donald A. James, Sara L. Levinson, George L. Miles, Jr., James A. Norling, James A. McCaslin, Donna F. Zarcone, Jon R. Flickinger, Gail A. Lione, Ronald M. Hutchinson, W. Kenneth Sutton, Jr. and John A. Hevey. The lawsuits also name the Company as a nominal defendant. In general, the shareholder derivative complaints include factual allegations similar to those in the class action complaints and allegations that officers and directors breached their fiduciary duties to the Company. On February 14, 2006, the state court consolidated the two state court derivative actions and appointed Lead Plaintiffs and Lead Plaintiffs counsel, and on April 24, 2006, the state court ordered that the consolidated state court derivative action be stayed until after motions to dismiss the federal securities class action are decided. On February 15, 2006, the federal court consolidated the federal derivative lawsuits with the securities and ERISA (see below) actions for administrative purposes. On February 1, 2007, the federal court appointed Lead Plaintiff and Co Lead Plaintiffs Counsel in the consolidated federal derivative action. On August 25, 2005, a class action lawsuit alleging violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. As noted above, on February 15, 2006, the court ordered the ERISA action consolidated with the federal derivative and securities actions for administrative purposes. Pursuant to the schedule set by the court, on October 2, 2006, the ERISA plaintiff filed an Amended Class Action Complaint, which named the Company, the Harley Davidson Motor Company Retirement Plans Committee, the Companys Leadership and Strategy Council, Harold A. Scott, James L. Ziemer, James M. Brostowitz, Gail A. Lione, Joanne M. Bischmann, Karl M. Eberle, Jon R. Flickinger, Ronald M. Hutchinson, James A. McCaslin, W. Kenneth Sutton, Jr., and Donna F. Zarcone, who are current or former Company officers or employees, as defendants. In general, the ERISA complaint includes factual allegations similar to those in the shareholder class action lawsuits and alleges on behalf of participants in certain Harley Davidson retirement savings plans that the plan fiduciaries breached their ERISA fiduciary duties. On December 18, 2006, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the ERISA complaint in its entirety. Briefing of the motion to dismiss was completed in April 2007. The Company believes the allegations against all of the defendants in the lawsuits against the Company are without merit and it intends to vigorously defend against them. Since all of these matters are in the preliminary stages, the Company is unable to predict the scope or outcome or quantify their eventual impact, if any, on the Company. At this time, the Company is also unable to estimate associated expenses or possible losses. The Company maintains insurance that may limit its financial exposure for defense costs and liability for an unfavorable outcome, should it not prevail, for claims covered by the insurance coverage. Environmental Matters: The Company is involved with government agencies and groups of potentially responsible parties in various environmental matters, including a matter involving the cleanup of soil and groundwater contamination at its York, Pennsylvania facility. The York facility was formerly used by the U.S. Navy and AMF prior to the purchase of the York facility by the Company from AMF in 1981. Although the Company is not certain as to the full extent of the environmental contamination at the York facility, it has been working with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) since 1986 in undertaking environmental investigation and remediation activities, including an ongoing site wide remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS). In January 1995, the Company entered into a settlement agreement (the Agreement) with the Navy. The Agreement calls for the Navy and the Company to contribute amounts into a trust equal to 53% and 47%, respectively, of future costs associated with environmental investigation and remediation activities at the York facility (Response Costs). The trust administers the payment of the Response Costs incurred at the York facility as covered by the Agreement. 47 Table of Contents In February 2002, the Company was advised by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that it considers some of the Companys remediation activities at the York facility to be subject to the EPAs corrective action program under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and offered the Company the option of addressing corrective action under a RCRA facility lead agreement. In July 2005, the York facility was designated as the first site in Pennsylvania to be addressed under the One Cleanup Program. The program provides a more streamlined and efficient oversight of voluntary remediation by both PADEP and EPA and will be carried out consistent with the Agreement with the Navy. As a result, the RCRA facility lead agreement has been superseded. Although the RI/FS is still underway and substantial uncertainty exists concerning the nature and scope of the additional environmental investigation and remediation that will ultimately be required at the York facility, the Company estimates that its share of the future Response Costs at the York facility will be approximately $6.2 million. The Company has established reserves for this amount, which are included in Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The estimate of the Companys future Response Costs that will be incurred at the York facility is based on reports of independent environmental consultants retained by the Company, the actual costs incurred to date and the estimated costs to complete the necessary investigation and remediation activities. Response Costs related to the remediation of soil are expected to be incurred over a period of several years ending in 2012. Response Costs related to ground water remediation may continue for some time beyond 2012. Under the terms of the sale of the Commercial Vehicles Division in 1996, the Company agreed to indemnify Utilimaster Corporation, until December 2008, for certain claims related to environmental contamination present at the date of sale, up to $20.0 million. The indemnification agreement expired on December 31, 2008. Product Liability Matters: Additionally, the Company is involved in product liability suits related to the operation of its business. The Company accrues for claim exposures that are probable of occurrence and can be reasonably estimated. The Company also maintains insurance coverage for product liability exposures. The Company believes that its accruals and insurance coverage are adequate and that product liability will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources as of December 31, 2008 Over the long term, the Company expects that its business model will continue to generate cash that will allow it to invest in the business, fund future growth opportunities and return value to shareholders.(1) At the same time, the Company recognizes that the recent disruption in the global capital markets has impacted its ability to access funding sources historically utilized to support the operation of its Financial Services business. During 2008, the Company funded its Financial Services operations with unsecured debt, unsecured commercial paper, an asset backed commercial paper conduit facility, a committed unsecured bank credit facility and a term asset backed securitization. The Company has estimated that HDFS funding requirements in 2009 will be approximately $1.00 billion in addition to amounts that may become due in July 2009 if the Company is unable to extend its 364 day credit facility that is part of its Global Credit Facilities (as defined below) or on March 31, 2009 under the $500.0 million asset backed commercial paper conduit facility that was entered into in December 2008. The Company intends to satisfy HDFS 2009 funding requirements through a combination of preferred actions. The first is for HDFS or the Company to attempt to access the unsecured debt capital markets; the Companys issuance of $600.0 million of senior unsecured five year notes completed in February 2009 is an example of this. The Company also intends to seek to renew its 364 day credit facility that expires in July 2009 and to increase and extend the existing $500.0 million asset backed commercial paper conduit facility. Expanding and extending the asset backed commercial paper conduit facility would supplement the existing unsecured commercial paper program. Finally, the Company is working to gain access to the asset backed securitization market through the U.S. Federal Reserves TALF program. The Company is in the process of researching the program and determining how it may benefit from it. Retail motorcycle loans have been included as eligible assets in the program; however exact details of the TALF program are not yet finalized. No assurance can be given that the Companys efforts to pursue these options will 48 Table of Contents be successful, and if such efforts are not successful, the Company will need to consider other alternatives. In addition, the shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in December 2008 may provide additional flexibility as needed. In addition to the funding alternatives discussed above, the Company will take steps to manage and preserve cash. On February 12, 2009, the Companys Board of Directors approved a first quarter 2009 dividend of $0.10 per share, a decrease of $0.20 per share from the dividend paid in the first quarter of 2008. Reducing the first quarter dividend preserves approximately $50 million of cash during the first quarter of 2009. Additionally, in early 2009 HDFS discontinued new loan originations for general aviation consumer aircraft allowing HDFS to focus its resources on the core business of retail and wholesale motorcycle lending. As discussed in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, due to significant declines in worldwide financial market conditions during 2008, the funded status of the Companys pension and postretirement healthcare plans was adversely affected. As a result, the Company is expecting it will have to make additional contributions of approximately $40 million to $80 million to further fund its pension plans during 2009 in addition to the on going contribution requirements related to current benefit payments for SERPA and postretirement healthcare plans. As discussed in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company completed the purchase of MV during the third quarter of 2008. The Company financed the transaction and MVs initial working capital requirements through $181.6 million of debt under the Global Credit Facilities. Going forward, the Company anticipates that short term working capital requirements for MV will be financed through additional debt. Cash Flow Activity The following table summarizes the operating, investing and financing cash flow activity for the three years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 (in thousands): 2008 2007 2006 Net cash (used by) provided by operating activities $ (684,649 ) $ 798,146 $ 761,780 Net cash (used by) provided by investing activities (393,247 ) 391,205 (35,259 ) Net cash provided by (used by) financing activities 1,293,390 (1,037,803 ) (637,023 ) Total $ 215,494 $ 151,548 $ 89,498 Operating Activities The decrease in operating cash flow from 2007 to 2008 was due primarily to lower securitization proceeds. Proceeds from the sale of retail finance receivables resulted in cash inflows of $467.7 million and $2.49 billion during 2008 and 2007, respectively. During 2008, HDFS funded a greater percentage of its business with proceeds from unsecured commercial paper, medium term notes and a newly created asset backed commercial paper conduit facility than it did in 2007. Investing Activities The Companys investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures, net changes in finance receivables held for investment and short term investment activity. Capital expenditures were $232.2 million and $242.1 million during 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company estimates that base capital expenditures for 2009 will be in the range of $180.0 million to $200.0 million.(1) In addition, the Company expects to incur capital expenditures of $10 million to $20 million in connection with the implementation of the recently announced restructuring plan in 2009.(1) The Company anticipates it will have the ability to fund all capital expenditures in 2009 with internally generated funds.(1) Sales and redemptions of marketable securities (net of purchases) in 2008 resulted in cash inflow of $2.5 million compared to $657.7 million in 2007. The year over year decline in cash inflow from marketable securities is a result of the Company reducing its investment in marketable securities over the previous twelve months, generally for the purpose of funding share repurchases. 49 Table of Contents The year over year increase in cash used in investing activities was also affected by the Companys acquisition of MV during the third quarter of 2008. Financing Activities The Companys financing activities consist primarily of share repurchases, dividend payments and debt activity. During 2008, the Company repurchased 6.3 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of $250.4 million. The Company repurchased 3.1 million of these shares under a general authorization provided by the Companys Board of Directors in October 2006 to buy back 20.0 million shares. As of December 31, 2008, no shares remained under this authorization. The remaining 3.2 million shares were repurchased under an authorization granted by the Companys Board of Directors in December 2007, which separately authorized the Company to buy back up to 20.0 million shares of its common stock. In addition, the Company has an authorization from the Companys Board of Directors that is designed to provide the Company with continuing authority to repurchase shares to offset dilution caused by the exercise of stock options and the issuance of nonvested stock. Please see Part II, Item 5 Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities for additional details regarding the Companys share repurchase activity and authorizations. The Company paid dividends of $1.29 per share at a total cost of $302.3 million during 2008, compared to dividends of $1.06 per share at a total cost of $260.8 million in 2007. During 2008, debt increased by $1.81 billion which was primarily driven by higher finance receivables outstanding as HDFS funded a greater percentage of its business through debt rather than through securitization transactions when compared to 2007. Additionally, the Company financed the acquisition and initial working capital requirements of MV through $181.6 million of debt under the Global Credit Facilities. The Companys total outstanding debt consisted of the following as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 (in thousands): 2008 2007 2006 Unsecured commercial paper $ 1,416,449 $ 842,618 $ 894,250 Asset backed commercial paper conduit facility 500,000 Credit facilities 390,932 256,531 191,866 2,307,381 1,099,149 1,086,116 Medium term notes 1,607,506 1,000,806 586,375 Senior subordinated notes 30,000 Total debt $ 3,914,887 $ 2,099,955 $ 1,702,491 Credit Facilities During 2008, the Company and HDFS entered into a $950.0 million 364 day facility and a $950.0 million three year facility (collectively, Global Credit Facilities) to replace existing credit facilities. The Global Credit Facilities, which total $1.90 billion and are due in July 2009 and 2011, respectively, are committed facilities and are primarily used to support HDFS unsecured commercial paper program and to fund HDFS lending activities and other operations. Borrowings under the Global Credit Facilities bear interest at various variable rates, which may be adjusted upward or downward depending on whether certain criteria are satisfied. As a result of the Global Credit Facilities, HDFS may issue unsecured commercial paper in the aggregate equal to the unused portion of the Global Credit Facilities. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, HDFS had a credit facility totaling $1.40 billion. Commercial Paper Subject to limitations, HDFS can issue unsecured commercial paper of up to $1.90 billion as of December 31, 2008. Outstanding unsecured commercial paper may not exceed the unused portion of the Global Credit Facilities. Maturities may range up to 365 days from the issuance date. In addition to issuing unsecured commercial paper in the open market, since October 2008 the Company has been issuing unsecured commercial paper under the Federal Reserve Banks Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF). The CPFF is scheduled to expire on October 30, 2009. Until February 12, 2009, the Company was eligible 50 Table of Contents to participate in the CPFF and had the ability to issue commercial paper with maturities of 90 days from the time of issuance up to a maximum of $1.35 billion outstanding at any time. As of February 12, 2009, the Company became ineligible to issue new commercial paper under the CPFF as HDFS short term debt ratings no longer satisfied the CPFFs minimum ratings requirements. On February 12, 2009, Fitch Ratings reduced the Companys long term debt rating to A and HDFS short term debt rating to F2. On January 16, 2009, Standard & Poors Rating Service reduced the Companys long term debt rating to BBB+ and HDFS short term debt rating to A2. As a result of these reductions to HDFS short term debt rating, the Company is no longer able to issue unsecured commercial paper under the CPFF. HDFS intends to finance the repayment of unsecured commercial paper as it matures by issuing traditional unsecured commercial paper or through other means, such as borrowing under the Global Credit Facilities. Asset backed commercial paper conduit facility In December 2008, HDFS entered into agreements with certain bank sponsored asset backed commercial paper conduits resulting in proceeds of $500.0 million. Unless earlier terminated or extended by the mutual agreement of HDFS and the lenders, the loan and servicing agreement will expire on March 31, 2009, at which time HDFS will be obligated to repay the $500.0 million advance in full. Medium Term Notes The Company has the following Medium Term Notes (collectively the Notes) issued and outstanding at December 31, 2008 (in thousands): Principal Amount Rate Issue Date Maturity Date $ 200,000 5.00 % December 2005 December 2010 $ 400,000 5.25 % December 2007 December 2012 $ 1,000,000 6.80 % May 2008 June 2018 At December 31, 2007, HDFS had $400.0 million of 3.63% medium term notes outstanding which were due in December 2008. In December 2008, the notes matured and the principal and accrued interest was paid in full. The Notes provide for semi annual interest payments and principal due at maturity. At December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Notes included a fair value adjustment increasing the balance by $9.7 million and $1.3 million and reducing the balance by $13.6 million, respectively, due to interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges. The effect of the interest rate swap agreements is to convert the interest rate on a portion of the Notes from a fixed to a floating rate, which is based on 3 month LIBOR. Unamortized discounts on the Notes reduced the balance by $2.2 million and $0.5 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Senior Subordinated Debt At December 31, 2006, HDFS had $30.0 million of 6.79% senior subordinated notes outstanding which were due in December 2007. In December 2007, the notes matured and the principal and accrued interest was paid in full. Intercompany Borrowing HDFS has a revolving credit line with the Company whereby HDFS may borrow up to $210.0 million from the Company at a market interest rate. As of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, HDFS had no outstanding borrowings owed to the Company under this agreement. The Company has a support agreement with HDFS whereby, if required, the Company agrees to provide HDFS with financial support in order to maintain HDFS fixed charge coverage at 1.25 and minimum net worth of $40.0 million. Support may be provided at the Companys option as capital contributions or loans. Accordingly, certain debt covenants may restrict the Companys ability to withdraw funds from HDFS outside the normal course of business. No amount has ever been provided to HDFS under the support agreement. Operating and Financial Covenants HDFS and the Company are subject to various operating and financial covenants related to the Global Credit Facilities, asset backed commercial paper conduit facility and Notes. The more significant covenants are described below. The covenants limit the Companys and HDFS ability to: incur certain additional indebtedness; assume or incur certain liens; participate in a merger, consolidation, liquidation or dissolution; and 51 Table of Contents purchase or hold margin stock. Under the financial covenants of the Global Credit Facilities and the asset backed commercial paper conduit facility, the debt to equity ratio of HDFS and its consolidated subsidiaries cannot exceed 10.0 to 1.0 and the Company must maintain an interest ratio coverage of 2.5 to 1.0. The minimum required HDFS consolidated tangible net worth is $300.0 million. No financial covenants are required under the Notes. At December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, HDFS and the Company remained in compliance with all of these covenants. Cautionary Statements The Companys ability to meet the targets and expectations noted in this Form 10 K depends upon, among other factors, the Companys ability to (i) effectively execute the Companys restructuring plans within expected costs; (ii) manage the risks that our independent dealers may have difficulty adjusting to the recession and slowdown in consumer demand; (iii) manage supply chain issues; (iv) anticipate the level of consumer confidence in the economy; (v) continue to have access to reliable sources of capital funding in sufficient amounts and adjust to fluctuations in the cost of capital; (vi) maintain credit ratings that allow the Company access to capital at effective rates; (vii) manage the credit quality, the loan servicing and collection activities, and the recovery rates of HDFS loan portfolio; (viii) continue to realize production efficiencies at its production facilities and manage operating costs including materials, labor and overhead; (ix) manage production capacity and production changes; (x) provide products, services and experiences that are successful in the marketplace; (xi) develop and implement sales and marketing plans that retain existing retail customers and attract new retail customers in an increasingly competitive marketplace; (xii) sell all of its motorcycles and related products and services to its independent dealers; (xiii) continue to develop the capabilities of its distributor and dealer network; (xiv) manage changes and prepare for requirements in legislative and regulatory environments for its products, services and operations; (xv) adjust to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices; (xvi) adjust to healthcare inflation, pension reform and tax changes; (xvii) retain and attract talented employees, including executive officers; (xviii) detect any issues with our motorcycles or manufacturing processes to avoid delays in new model launches, recall campaigns, increased warranty costs or litigation; (xix) implement and manage enterprise wide information technology solutions and secure data contained in those systems; and (xx) successfully integrate and profitably operate MV Agusta. In addition, the Company could experience delays or disruptions in its operations as a result of work stoppages, strikes, natural causes, terrorism or other factors. These risks, potential delays and uncertainties regarding the costs could also adversely impact the Companys capital expenditure estimates (see Liquidity and Capital Resources section). In addition, see Risk Factors under Item 1A. which includes a discussion of additional risk factors and a more complete discussion of some of the cautionary statements noted above. 52 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. To reduce such risks, the Company selectively uses derivative financial instruments. All hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to regularly reviewed policies and procedures, which prohibit the use of financial instruments for trading purposes. Sensitivity analysis is used to manage and monitor foreign exchange and interest rate risk. The Company sells its products internationally and in most markets those sales are made in the foreign countrys local currency. As a result, the Companys earnings can be affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currency. The Companys most significant foreign currency risk relates to the Euro, the Australian dollar and the Brazilian Real. The Company utilizes foreign currency contracts to mitigate the effect of the Euro and the Australian dollar fluctuations on earnings. The foreign currency contracts are entered into with banks and allow the Company to exchange a specified amount of foreign currency for U.S. dollars at a future date, based on a fixed exchange rate. At December 31, 2008, the notional U.S. dollar value of outstanding Euro and Australian dollar foreign currency contracts was $419.3 million. The Company estimates that a uniform 10% weakening in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies underlying these contracts would result in a decrease in the fair value of the contracts of approximately $36.5 million as of December 31, 2008. Further disclosure relating to the fair value of derivative financial instruments is included in Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, the Company financed its acquisition of MV Agusta and its initial working capital requirements through 130.0 million of Euro denominated debt. The carrying amount of debt is measured at each balance sheet date in the U.S. dollar and the corresponding gains or losses are recognized in the income statement. The Companys earnings are affected by changes in interest rates. HDFS utilizes interest rate swaps to reduce the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on its debt and securitization transactions. HDFS also entered into derivative contracts to facilitate its first quarter securitization transaction as well as its third quarter 2007 securitization transaction. These derivatives, which hedge assets by an off balance sheet Qualifying Special Purpose Entity, do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Additionally, to facilitate the December 2008 asset backed commercial paper conduit facility, HDFS entered into derivative contracts, certain of which do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in current period earnings within other operating expenses. As of December 31, 2008, HDFS had interest rate swaps outstanding with a notional value of $1.79 billion. HDFS estimates that a 10% decrease in interest rates would result in a $1.4 million decrease in the fair value of the agreements. 53 Table of Contents
