Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Harley Davidson, Inc. is the parent company for the groups of companies doing business as Harley Davidson Motor Company (HDMC), Harley Davidson Financial Services (HDFS), Buell Motorcycle Company (Buell) and MV Agusta (MV). HDMC produces heavyweight custom and touring motorcycles. HDMC manufactures five families of motorcycles: Touring, Dyna&reg;, Softail&reg;, Sportster&reg; and VRSC. HDFS provides wholesale and retail financing and insurance programs primarily to Harley Davidson and Buell dealers and customers. The Company operates in two business segments: Motorcycles & Related Products (Motorcycles) and Financial Services (Financial Services). The Companys reportable segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services. They are managed separately based on the fundamental differences in their operations. The % Change figures included in the Results of Operations section were calculated using unrounded dollar amounts and may differ from calculations using the rounded dollar amounts presented. Overview The Companys 2009 financial results were affected by the difficult economy, as well as costs associated with restructuring the business. During 2009, the Company initiated several significant restructuring activities to reduce its cost structure and also initiated a plan to exit the Buell product line and divest MV. In connection with the decision to sell the MV business, its financial results have been presented as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. Income and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2009 were $70.6 million and $0.30, respectively, each down 89.7% compared to 2008. The results of continuing operations reflect the effects of lower Harley Davidson motorcycle shipments, restructuring and Buell product line exit costs, and non cash charges related to Financial Services. The loss from discontinued operations, which includes MVs operating losses and a fair value adjustment, was $125.8 million net of tax, or $0.54 per diluted share. Including discontinued operations, the Company incurred a net loss of $55.1 million, or $0.24 per diluted share for 2009. Retail sales of Harley Davidson motorcycles by independent dealers were also impacted by the difficult economy. Worldwide retail sales of new Harley Davidson motorcycles declined 22.7% in 2009 compared to last year. In 2009, U.S. retail sales of Harley Davidson motorcycles were down 25.8% and international retail sales were down 15.4% as compared to 2008. On an industry wide basis, retail sales of heavyweight motorcycles in the United States declined 36.7% during 2009. Please refer to the Results of Operations 2009 Compared to 2008 for additional details concerning the results for 2009.

The actions were designed to reduce administrative costs, eliminate excess capacity and exit non core business operations. The Companys significant planned actions include: consolidating its two engine and transmission plants in the Milwaukee area into its facility in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin; closing its distribution facility in Franklin, Wisconsin and consolidating Parts and Accessories and General Merchandise distribution through a third party; discontinuing the domestic transportation fleet; consolidating its vehicle test facilities from three locations in Alabama, Arizona and Florida into one location in Arizona; restructuring its York, Pennsylvania motorcycle production facility to focus on the core operations of motorcycle assembly, metal fabrication and paint; and exiting the Buell product line. The 2009 restructuring plans include a reduction of approximately 2,700 to 2,900 hourly production positions and approximately 720 non production, primarily salaried positions within the Motorcycles segment and approximately 100 salaried positions in the Financial Services segment. These reductions began in 2009 and are expected to be completed during 2011. During 2009, the Company incurred $224.3 million in restructuring and impairment expense related to these activities and $44.8 million in lower gross margins associated with Buell sales incentives and inventory adjustments that are not included in restructuring charges/expense. The Company expects total costs related to these restructuring activities (excluding the $44.8 million of Buell exit costs affecting gross margins) to result in one time restructuring and impairment expenses of $430 million to $460 million from 2009 to 2012 of which approximately 30% are expected to be non cash. In 2010, the Company expects to incur restructuring expenses of $175 million to $195 million. The Company anticipates annual ongoing total savings from restructuring of approximately $240 million to $260 million upon completion of all announced restructuring activities. In the near term, the Company estimates savings from these restructuring activities, measured against 2008 spending, to be as follows: 2009 $91 million (91% operating expense and 9% cost of sales); 2010 $135 million to $155 million (70 80% operating expense and 20 30% cost of sales); 2011 $220 million to $240 million (45 55% operating expense and 45 55% cost of sales); 2012 $230 million to $250 (40 50% operating expense and 50 60% cost of sales); and Ongoing upon completion $240 million to $260 million (40 50% operating expense and 50 60% cost of sales). Discontinued Operations As noted above, the financial results of MV have been presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented. During 2009, the Company wrote down the carrying value of MVs assets resulting in a non cash charge of $115.4 million, or $73.4 million net of related tax benefits. This write down included a reduction in the carrying value of goodwill, intangible assets and fixed assets associated with MV and reduced MVs net assets to their fair value, less estimated selling costs. 29 Table of Contents Outlook(1) On January 22, 2010, the Company announced that it expects to ship 201,000 to 212,000 Harley Davidson motorcycles to dealers and distributors in 2010 which includes 52,000 to 57,000 during the first quarter of 2010. In addition, the Company announced its expectation for full year 2010 gross profit margin of between 32.0% and 33.5%. Regarding Financial Services, the Company believes that actions taken during 2009, including diversifying HDFS debt structure and improving underwriting standards, will assist HDFS in moving to profitability during 2010 as the economy improves. The Company continues to believe that HDFS provides a strategic advantage for Harley Davidson by providing a reliable source of financing for the Companys independent dealer network and dealers retail customers. Also on January 22, 2010 the Company announced its expected capital expenditures for 2010 to be approximately $235 million to $255 million including approximately $95 million to $110 million for capital expenditures made in connection with its restructuring activities in 2010. The Company anticipates it will have the ability to fund all capital expenditures in 2010 with internally generated funds. During 2009, the Company announced its long term business strategy, centered on the four key pillars of growth, continuous improvement, leadership development and sustainability. Under this strategy, the Company expects to drive growth through a focus of efforts and resources on the unique strengths of the Harley Davidson brand, and to enhance productivity and profitability through continuous improvement. The strategy focuses Company resources on Harley Davidson products and experiences, global expansion, demographic outreach and commitment to core customers. In addition, the Company will continue to expand its initiatives to enhance profitability through continuous improvement in manufacturing, product development and business operations. In connection with the announcement of this strategy, the Company has identified the following long term factors as measures of success against the plan: Outperform the S&P 500 over the Companys planning horizon and longer term; International retail motorcycle unit sales to grow at a faster rate than domestic retail motorcycle unit sales over the long term: The addition of 100 to 150 international independent dealer points through 2014; and International retail motorcycle unit sales to exceed 40% of total retail motorcycle unit sales by 2014. Retail motorcycle unit sales to core customer base to grow over the long term from 2009 levels, but retail motorcycle unit sales to outreach customers to grow at a faster rate; and Earnings to grow at a faster rate than revenue for 2010 through 2014 including: Productivity savings net of inflation of approximately $20 million to $50 million between now and 2014. This is in addition to estimated annual savings of announced restructuring activities discussed above; and Selling, administrative and engineering expense to decrease as a percentage of revenue. 30 Table of Contents The following sections include a detailed discussion of the results of operations for 2009 and 2008. Results of Operations 2009 Compared to 2008 Consolidated Results (in thousands, except earnings per share) 2009 2008 (Decrease)Increase %Change Operating income from motorcycles & related products $ 314,055 $ 976,402 $ (662,347 ) (67.8 )% Operating (loss) income from financial services (117,969 ) 82,765 (200,734 ) (242.5 ) Operating income 196,086 1,059,167 (863,081 ) (81.5 ) Investment income 4,254 11,296 (7,042 ) (62.3 ) Interest expense 21,680 4,542 17,138 377.3 Income before income taxes 178,660 1,065,921 (887,261 ) (83.2 ) Provision for income taxes 108,019 381,686 (273,667 ) (71.7 ) Income from continuing operations 70,641 684,235 (613,594 ) (89.7 ) Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes (125,757 ) (29,517 ) (96,240 ) 326.0 Net (loss) income $ (55,116 ) $ 654,718 $ (709,834 ) (108.4 )% Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations $ 0.30 $ 2.92 $ (2.62 ) (89.7 )% Diluted loss per share from discontinued operations $ (0.54 ) $ (0.13 ) $ (0.41 ) 315.4 % Diluted (loss) earnings per share $ (0.24 ) $ 2.79 $ (3.03 ) (108.6 )% Operating results for both of the Companys segments was impacted by the difficult economic environment. Motorcycles operating income fell 67.8% during 2009 driven by a decrease in shipments of Harley Davidson motorcycles and restructuring charges. Financial Services operating loss was driven primarily by increased provision for credit losses and a goodwill impairment. Please refer to the Motorcycles and Related Products Segment and Financial Services Segment discussions following for a more detailed discussion of the factors affecting operating income. Interest expense of $21.7 million includes a portion of interest expense related to the Companys $600.0 million senior unsecured notes issued in February 2009. Prior to the end of the first quarter, the Company transferred the full proceeds from the issuance to HDFS in order to fund HDFS operations. As HDFS diversified its debt structure through a combination of actions during 2009 (refer to Liquidity for additional discussion), its funding profile improved. During the fourth quarter of 2009, HDFS transferred the full proceeds back to the Company. As a result, interest expense for 2009 includes interest during the periods when the full proceeds where held outside of HDFS. Interest expense for the periods when the proceeds were held by HDFS is included in financial services interest expense. The effective income tax rate for 2009 continuing operations was 60.5% compared to 35.8% for 2008. The increase in the effective income tax rate was due to a one time charge for a change in Wisconsin tax law, the nondeductible goodwill impairment charge at HDFS and the impact of reduced earnings. For 2010, the Company expects it effective income tax rate to be approximately 36.5% for continuing operations.(1) Motorcycles and Related Products Segment Harley Davidson Motorcycle Retail Sales Worldwide independent dealer retail sales of Harley Davidson motorcycles decreased 22.7% during 2009 compared to 2008. Retail sales continue to be impacted on a global basis by difficult economic conditions. Retail sales of Harley Davidson motorcycles decreased by 25.8% in the United States and 15.4% internationally during 31 Table of Contents 2009 compared to 2008. On an industry wide basis, the heavyweight (651+cc) portion of the market was down 36.6% in the United States and down 19.5% in Europe when compared to 2008. The following table includes retail unit sales of Harley Davidson motorcycles: Harley Davidson Motorcycle Retail Sales(a) Heavyweight (651+cc) 2009 2008 Decrease %Change North America Region United States 162,385 218,939 (56,554 ) (25.8 )% Canada 11,406 16,502 (5,096 ) (30.9 ) Total North America Region 173,791 235,441 (61,650 ) (26.2 ) Europe Region (Includes Middle East and Africa) Europe(b) 36,444 40,725 (4,281 ) (10.5 ) Other 3,560 4,317 (757 ) (17.5 ) Total Europe Region 40,004 45,042 (5,038 ) (11.2 ) Asia Pacific Region Japan 13,105 14,654 (1,549 ) (10.6 ) Other 9,884 10,595 (711 ) (6.7 ) Total Asia Pacific Region 22,989 25,249 (2,260 ) (9.0 ) Latin America Region 5,850 8,037 (2,187 ) (27.2 ) Total Worldwide Retail Sales 242,634 313,769 (71,135 ) (22.7 )% (a) Data source for retail sales figures shown above is sales warranty and registration information provided by Harley Davidson dealers and compiled by the Company.

During 2009, the Company shipped 223,023 Harley Davidson motorcycles, a decrease of 80,456 motorcycles, or 26.5%, from last year. The Companys shipments in the U.S. in 2009 continued to be negatively impacted by the challenging economic environment. On January 22, 2010, the Company announced that it expects full year 2010 shipments of Harley Davidson motorcycle units to be between 201,000 to 212,000.(1) This represents a 5% to 10% reduction from 2009 shipments as a result of two key factors. First, the Company expects global economies to remain challenging, specifically in the U.S. with continued high unemployment and low consumer confidence. Second, the Company expects continued price competition from other manufacturers as they reduce excess inventories, in particular, old model year motorcycles. Additionally, the Company anticipates price competition at a local level as retailers discount excess inventory driven by contraction of the competitive dealer network. The Company remains committed to balancing supply in line with demand for its Harley Davidson motorcycles. The Company believes that its U.S. independent dealer network carried a 2009 year end inventory level that was appropriate for the current economic environment. Segment Results The following table includes the condensed statement of operations for the Motorcycles segment (in thousands): 2009 2008 (Decrease)Increase %Change Revenue: Harley Davidson motorcycles $ 3,174,810 $ 4,244,587 $ (1,069,777 ) (25.2 )% Buell motorcycles 46,514 123,085 (76,571 ) (62.2 ) 3,221,324 4,367,672 (1,146,348 ) (26.2 ) Parts & Accessories 767,275 858,748 (91,473 ) (10.7 ) General Merchandise 282,210 313,838 (31,628 ) (10.1 ) Other 16,321 38,156 (21,835 ) (57.2 ) Total revenue 4,287,130 5,578,414 (1,291,284 ) (23.1 ) Cost of goods sold 2,900,934 3,647,270 (746,336 ) (20.5 ) Gross profit 1,386,196 1,931,144 (544,948 ) (28.2 ) Selling & administrative expense 702,854 774,135 (71,281 ) (9.2 ) Engineering expense 148,311 168,132 (19,821 ) (11.8 ) Restructuring expense and other impairments 220,976 12,475 208,501 N/M Operating expense 1,072,141 954,742 117,399 12.3 Operating income from motorcycles $ 314,055 $ 976,402 $ (662,347 ) (67.8 )% The net increase in operating expense was primarily due the Companys previously announced restructuring activities and asset impairments partially offset by cost reduction initiatives. The Company estimates operating 33 Table of Contents expense savings related to restructuring activities were approximately $83 million during 2009. For further information regarding the Companys previously announced restructuring activities and asset impairments, refer to Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table includes the estimated impact of the significant factors affecting the comparability of gross profit from 2008 to 2009 (in millions): NetRevenue Cost ofGoods Sold GrossProfit 2008 $ 5,578 $ 3,647 $ 1,931 Volume (1,276 ) (773 ) (503 ) Price (2 ) (2 ) Foreign currency exchange rates and hedging (51 ) (25 ) (26 ) Product mix 67 54 13 Raw material prices (65 ) 65 Manufacturing costs 47 (47 ) Buell exit costs (29 ) 16 (45 ) Total (1,291 ) (746 ) (545 ) 2009 $ 4,287 $ 2,901 $ 1,386 Volume decreases were primarily the result of the 26.5% decrease in wholesale shipments of Harley Davidson motorcycle units. Foreign currency exchange rates and hedging were affected by a weakening Euro and Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar during 2009. Product mix benefited revenue and gross profit due to a shift towards the Companys higher margin touring motorcycles. Manufacturing costs increased partially as the result of a higher fixed cost per unit due to allocating fixed costs to fewer units. Additionally, higher manufacturing costs were the result of increasing product cost associated with new models and increased product content, such as new features and options on the Companys motorcycles. These increased costs were partially offset by productivity gains. Buell exit costs consist of sales incentives to independent dealers and inventory write downs. The sales incentives lowered revenue while the inventory write downs increased cost of sales. Financial Services Segment Segment Results The following table includes the condensed statements of operations for the Financial Services segment (in thousands): 2009 2008 Increase(Decrease) %Change Interest income $ 434,152 $ 290,083 $ 144,069 49.7 % (Loss) income from securitizations (13,676 ) 13,439 (27,115 ) (201.8 ) Other income 74,303 73,448 855 1.2 Financial services revenue 494,779 376,970 117,809 31.3 Interest expense 283,634 136,763 146,871 107.4 Provision for credit losses 169,206 39,555 129,651 327.8 Operating expenses 128,219 117,887 10,332 8.8 Restructuring expense 3,302 3,302 N/M Goodwill impairment 28,387 28,387 N/M Financial services expense 612,748 294,205 318,543 108.3 Operating (loss) income from financial services $ (117,969 ) $ 82,765 $ (200,734 ) (242.5 )% 34 Table of Contents Interest income benefited from higher average retail and wholesale receivables outstanding, partially offset by lower wholesale lending rates. The increase in retail receivables outstanding was driven by a reduction in off balance sheet term asset backed securitization activity throughout 2008 due to capital market volatility and the utilization of on balance sheet term asset backed securitization structures during 2009. The increase in wholesale outstanding receivables resulted from an increased use of floorplan financing combined with a higher number of average days financed. Interest expense was higher in 2009 due primarily to increased borrowings to support the higher average outstanding retail and wholesale receivables as well as an increased cost of borrowing as compared to 2008. During 2009, HDFS recorded a loss from securitizations compared to income from securitizations during 2008. The change from 2008 was due to reduced income earned from the investment in retained securitization interests and a larger other than temporary write down of certain retained securitization interests in 2009 compared to 2008. Income earned from the investment in retained securitization interests was $28.5 million lower due to a reduction in outstanding off balance sheet term asset backed securitization transactions. There were no off balance sheet term asset backed securitization transactions completed during 2009 while the Company completed one off balance sheet term asset backed securitization transaction during 2008. For the 2008 off balance sheet term asset backed securitization transaction, the Company recognized a $5.4 million loss. In addition, HDFS recognized a $45.4 million write down of certain retained securitization interests during 2009 due to higher actual and anticipated credit losses partially offset by a slowing in actual and expected prepayment speeds. This compares to an other than temporary impairment of $41.4 million in 2008. HDFS reviews its assumptions for determining the fair value of the investment in retained securitization interests each quarter. Key assumptions include expected losses, prepayment speed and discount rate. HDFS determines these assumptions by reviewing historical trends and current economic conditions. Given the challenging U.S. economy, credit losses on HDFS retail installment loans have increased, and as a result, the fair value of retained securitization interests has declined, and in some cases this decline is other than temporary. A write down in the retained securitization interest generally represents a non cash charge in the period in which it is recorded, but ultimately represents a reduction in the residual cash flow that HDFS expects to receive from its investment in retained securitization interests. The fair value of the investment in retained securitization interests was $245.4 million at December 31, 2009. Other income remained relatively flat in 2009 compared to 2008. During 2009, the Company recognized a $5.9 million charge to earnings for the lower of cost or market valuation adjustment of its finance receivables held for sale prior to the reclassification to finance receivables held for investment as discussed below. This compares to a lower of cost or market valuation charge of $37.8 million in 2008. This change was partially offset by a $16.3 million decrease in servicing fee income resulting from fewer outstanding off balance sheet term asset backed securitization transactions and lower insurance commissions in 2009 compared to 2008. The increase in the provision for credit losses during 2009 primarily resulted from the reclassification of $3.14 billion of finance receivables held for sale to finance receivables held for investment at the end of the second quarter of 2009. The reclassification was due to the structure of the Companys May 2009 term asset backed securitization transaction and managements intent to structure subsequent securitization transactions in a manner that would not meet the requirements of accounting sale treatment. The reclassification resulted in an additional provision for credit losses of $72.7 million. In addition, the provisions for credit losses related to retail receivables and wholesale receivables increased by $51.8 million and $2.1 million, respectively, over 2008. The increase was primarily the result of higher expected incidence of loss, lower expected recovery values on repossessed motorcycles, and an increase in the finance receivables held for investment. Annualized losses on HDFS managed retail motorcycle loans were 2.86% in 2009 compared to 2.30% for 2008. The 30 day delinquency rate for managed retail motorcycle loans at December 31, 2009 increased to 6.51% from 6.29% at December 31, 2008. Managed retail loans include loans held by HDFS as well as those sold through off balance sheet term asset backed securitization transactions. The year over year increase in credit losses was driven by a higher frequency of loss and higher average loss per motorcycle resulting from 35 Table of Contents pressure on values for repossessed motorcycles. The Company expects that HDFS will continue to experience higher delinquencies and credit losses as a percentage of managed retail motorcycle loans into 2010.(1) Changes in the allowance for finance credit losses on finance receivables held for investment were as follows (in millions): 2009 2008 Balance, beginning of period $ 40,068 $ 30,295 Provision for finance credit losses 169,206 39,555 Charge offs, net of recoveries (59,192 ) (29,782 ) Balance, end of period $ 150,082 $ 40,068 At December 31, 2009, the allowance for finance credit losses on finance receivables held for investment was $133.3 million for retail receivables and $16.8 million for wholesale receivables. The allowance for finance credit losses on finance receivables held for investment was $28.4 million for retail receivables and $11.7 million for wholesale receivables at December 31, 2008. HDFS periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for finance credit losses on finance receivables held for investment is generally based on HDFS past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, current economic conditions and the estimated value of any underlying collateral. Operating expenses were also impacted by a restructuring charge of $3.3 million in 2009 as detailed in Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As discussed in Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, during 2009, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $28.4 million related to the goodwill associated with HDFS. As a result of the Companys lower retail sales volume projections and the decline in operating performance at HDFS during 2009 due to significant write downs of its loan portfolio and investment in retained securitization interests, the Company performed an impairment test of the goodwill balance associated with HDFS as of June 28, 2009. The results of the impairment test indicated the current fair value of HDFS had declined below its carrying value. Results of Operations 2008 Compared to 2007 Consolidated Results (in thousands, except earnings per share) 2008 2007 (Decrease)Increase %Change Operating income from motorcycles & related products $ 976,402 $ 1,213,392 $ (236,990 ) (19.5 )% Operating income from financial services 82,765 212,169 (129,404 ) (61.0 ) Operating income 1,059,167 1,425,561 (366,394 ) (25.7 ) Investment income 11,296 22,258 (10,962 ) (49.2 ) Interest expense 4,542 4,542 N/M Income before income taxes 1,065,921 1,447,819 (381,898 ) (26.4 ) Provision for income taxes 381,686 513,976 (132,290 ) (25.7 ) Income from continuing operations 684,235 933,843 (249,608 ) (26.7 )% Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes (29,517 ) (29,517 ) N/M Net income $ 654,718 $ 933,843 $ (279,125 ) (29.9 )% Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations $ 2.92 $ 3.74 $ (0.82 ) (21.9 )% Diluted loss per share from discontinued operations $ (0.13 ) $ $ (0.13 ) N/M Diluted earnings per share $ 2.79 $ 3.74 $ (0.95 ) (25.4 )% 36 Table of Contents Operating income for both of the Companys segments was impacted by the difficult economic environment including lower consumer confidence and significant disruptions in global capital markets. Motorcycles operating income fell 19.5% during 2008, driven by a decrease in shipments of Harley Davidson motorcycles. In addition, lower operating income from Financial Services driven by lower securitization income and a write down of finance receivables and investment in retained securitization interests contributed to the decrease in consolidated income from operations for 2008. Investment income was lower during 2008 due to the decrease in average cash and marketable securities during the year. Interest expense during 2008 relates to debt incurred in connection with the acquisition of MV. The Companys effective income tax rate for 2008 was 35.8% compared to 35.5% in 2007. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations during 2008 were down 21.9% from 2007 on lower net income which more than offset the positive impact of fewer weighted average shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share during 2008 were positively impacted by a decrease in the weighted average shares outstanding, which were 234.5 million in 2008 compared to 249.9 million in 2007. The decrease in weighted average shares outstanding was driven by the Companys repurchases of common stock over 2007 and 2008 through August. Motorcycles & Related Products Segment Harley Davidson Motorcycle Retail Sales Worldwide retail sales of Harley Davidson motorcycles decreased 7.1% during 2008 relative to 2007. Retail sales of Harley Davidson motorcycles decreased 13.0% in the United States while growing 10.3% internationally. On an industry wide basis, the heavyweight (651+cc) portion of the market was down 7.0% in the United States while growing 0.5% in Europe when compared to the same periods in 2007.

During 2008, the Company shipped 303,479 Harley Davidson motorcycles, a decrease of 27,140 motorcycles, or 8.2%, from last year. The Companys shipments in the U.S. in 2008 continued to be negatively impacted by the challenging economic environment, but were consistent with the Companys expectations to ship 23,000 to 27,000 fewer Harley Davidson motorcycles in 2008 than were shipped in 2007. The Companys shipments in international markets grew during 2008, and the percentage of units shipped to international customers increased, consistent with the Companys strategic focus on global markets. 38 Table of Contents Segment Results The following table includes the condensed statement of operations for the Motorcycles segment (in thousands): 2008 2007 (Decrease)Increase %Change Net Revenue Harley Davidson motorcycles $ 4,244,587 $ 4,433,576 $ (188,989 ) (4.3 )% Buell motorcycles 123,085 100,534 22,551 22.4 4,367,672 4,534,110 (166,438 ) (3.7 ) Parts & Accessories 858,748 868,297 (9,549 ) (1.1 ) General Merchandise 313,838 305,435 8,403 2.8 Other 38,156 19,006 19,150 100.8 Net revenue 5,578,414 5,726,848 (148,434 ) (2.6 ) Cost of goods sold 3,647,270 3,612,748 34,522 1.0 Gross profit 1,931,144 2,114,100 (182,956 ) (8.7 ) Selling & administrative expense 774,135 710,065 64,070 9.0 Engineering expense 168,132 190,643 (22,511 ) (11.8 ) Restructuring expense 12,475 12,475 N/M Operating expense 954,742 900,708 54,034 6.0 Operating income from motorcycles $ 976,402 $ 1,213,392 $ (236,990 ) (19.5 )% The net increase in operating expense was primarily due to higher international operating costs associated with the Companys international growth and a $12.4 million restructuring charge incurred by the Company during 2008 (see Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion). The following table includes the estimated impact of the significant factors affecting the comparability of gross profit from 2007 to 2008 (in millions): NetRevenue Cost ofGoods Sold GrossProfit 2007 $ 5,727 $ 3,613 $ 2,114 Volume (339 ) (153 ) (186 ) Price 21 21 Foreign currency exchange rates and hedging 95 28 67 Product mix 70 42 28 Raw material prices 23 (23 ) Manufacturing costs 94 (94 ) Other 4 4 Total (149 ) 34 (183 ) 2008 $ 5,578 $ 3,647 $ 1,931 Volume decreases to revenue and cost of goods sold were primarily the result of the 8.2% decrease in Harley Davidson motorcycle units. Foreign currency exchange rates and hedging were affected primarily by a strengthening of the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar during 2008. Product mix benefited revenue and gross profit due to a shift away from the Companys Sportster motorcycles to custom motorcycles. 39 Table of Contents Manufacturing costs increased partially as the result of a higher fixed cost per unit due to allocating fixed costs to fewer units. Additionally, higher manufacturing costs were the result of increasing product cost associated with new models and increased product content, such as new features and options on the Companys motorcycles. Financial Services Segment Segment Results The following table includes the condensed statements of operations for the Financial Services segment (in thousands): 2008 2007 Increase(Decrease) %Change Interest income $ 290,083 $ 196,803 $ 93,280 47.4 % Income from securitizations 13,439 97,576 (84,137 ) (86.2 ) Other income 73,448 121,817 (48,369 ) (39.7 ) Financial services income 376,970 416,196 (39,226 ) (9.4 ) Interest expense 136,763 81,475 55,288 67.9 Provision for credit losses 39,555 11,252 28,303 251.5 Operating expenses 117,887 111,300 6,587 5.9 Financial services expense 294,205 204,027 90,178 44.2 Operating income from financial services $ 82,765 $ 212,169 $ (129,404 ) (61.0 )% Interest income benefited from higher average retail outstanding receivables, partially offset by lower wholesale lending rates and slightly lower average wholesale outstanding receivables. Interest expense was higher due to increased borrowings to support growth in outstanding retail receivables, partially offset by lower borrowing rates. The increase in retail receivables outstanding was driven by a reduction in term asset backed securitization activity during 2008 due to capital market volatility. Income from securitizations during 2008 was lower as compared to 2007 due to a $41.4 million write down of certain retained securitization interests during 2008, a loss on the first quarter 2008 securitization transaction and the absence of a securitization transaction in the last three quarters of 2008. This compares to a $9.9 million write down and three securitization transactions completed in 2007. During 2008, HDFS sold $540.0 million in retail motorcycle loans in a securitization transaction and recognized a loss of $5.4 million, or 0.99% as a percentage of loans sold. This compares to a gain as a percentage of loans sold of 1.42%, or $36.0 million, on $2.53 billion of loans securitized in 2007. The loss in 2008 was driven by increased securitization funding costs due to capital market volatility and higher projected credit losses. In the 2008 securitization transaction, HDFS retained $54.0 million of the subordinated securities issued by the securitization trust. The subordinated securities that were retained have been included in the investment in retained securitization interests (a component of finance receivables held for investment) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The cash proceeds from the 2008 securitization transaction are net of the cost of the retained subordinated securities. Income from securitizations was also negatively impacted in 2008 by a $41.4 million write down of certain retained securitization interests. The write downs, which occurred in June and December of 2008 and are considered permanent impairments, resulted from a decline in the fair value of certain retained securitization interests due to higher actual and anticipated credit losses on those securitization portfolios and an increase in the discount rate from 12% to 18% in the fourth quarter of 2008. This compares to an impairment charge of $9.9 million incurred in 2007. The fair value of the investment in retained securitization interests was $330.7 million at December 31, 2008. 40 Table of Contents Other income decreased during 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily due to a $37.8 million charge to earnings from the lower of cost or market value of its finance receivables held for sale. HDFS used discounted cash flow methodologies to estimate the fair value of finance receivables held for sale that incorporate appropriate assumptions for discount rate, funding costs and credit enhancement, as well as estimates concerning credit losses and prepayments that, in managements judgment, reflect assumptions marketplace participants would use. Any amount by which cost exceeds fair value is accounted for as a valuation adjustment with an offset to other income. The decline in fair value below cost was due to higher projected credit losses, increased funding costs and an increased discount rate in the fourth quarter of 2008 from 12% to 18%. The $28.3 million increase in the provision for credit losses primarily relates to an increase in the retail and wholesale receivable provisions of $20.9 million and $7.0 million, respectively. Annualized losses on HDFS managed retail motorcycle loans were 2.30% in 2008 compared to 1.91% for 2007. The 30 day delinquency rate for managed retail motorcycle loans at December 31, 2008 increased to 6.29% from 6.15% at December 31, 2007. Managed retail loans include loans held by HDFS as well as those sold through securitization transactions. The increase in losses was primarily due to a higher incidence of loss resulting from an increase in delinquent accounts. Changes in the allowance for finance credit losses on finance receivables held for investment were as follows (in millions): 2008 2007 Balance, beginning of period $ 30,295 $ 27,283 Provision for finance credit losses 39,555 11,252 Charge offs, net of recoveries (29,782 ) (8,240 ) Balance, end of period $ 40,068 $ 30,295 At December 31, 2008, the allowance for finance credit losses on finance receivables held for investment was $28.4 million for retail receivables and $11.7 million for wholesale receivables. The allowance for finance credit losses on finance receivables held for investment was $25.9 million for retail receivables and $4.4 million for wholesale receivables at December 31, 2007. Other Matters New Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 166, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140. SFAS No. 166 amends the guidance within ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing, primarily by removing the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity as well as removing the exception from applying FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. Upon the effective adoption date, formerly qualifying special purpose entities (as defined under previous accounting standards) must be evaluated for consolidation within an entitys financial statements. Additionally, the guidance within ASC Topic 860 will require enhanced disclosures about the transfer of financial assets as well as an entitys continuing involvement, if any, in transferred financial assets. In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R). SFAS No. 167 amends the guidance within ASC Topic 810, Consolidations, by adding previously considered qualifying special purpose entities (the concept of these entities was eliminated by SFAS No. 166). In addition, companies must perform an analysis to determine whether the companys variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity. Companies must also reassess on an ongoing basis whether the company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. 41 Table of Contents The Company is required to adopt the new guidance contained within ASC 810 and ASC 860 as of January 1, 2010. The new guidance will require consolidation of the existing qualifying special purpose entities (QSPEs) that are not currently recorded on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet, resulting in an estimated increase in finance receivables and debt of $1.89 billion. Consolidation of currently unconsolidated QSPEs will also result in an increase in the allowance for finance credit losses for newly consolidated finance receivables along with changes to the timing and line item reporting of income and expense in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Operations. Additionally, as part of the consolidation of these finance receivable securitization trusts, the investment in retained securitization interests will be eliminated and no future valuations will be required. In accordance with the new guidance, the Company will initially measure the assets and liabilities of the former QSPEs at their carrying values (the amounts at which the asset and liabilities would have been carried in the Consolidated Financial Statements if ASC Topic 810 had been effective when the Company first met the conditions as the primary beneficiary). The cumulative effect of adopting these new accounting standards as of January 1, 2010, based on financial information as of December 31, 2009, would result in an estimated aggregate after tax charge to retained earnings in the range of $35.0 million to $45.0 million, which includes the impact of establishing the initial allowance for finance credit losses. The actual impact of adopting the new accounting standards on January 1, 2010 could differ as several uncertainties in the application of these new standards are resolved. The Company does not believe the consolidation of the QSPEs will cause non compliance with its or HDFS debt covenants.(1) Critical Accounting Estimates The Companys financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies, which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions. Management believes that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of accounting policies that currently affect the Companys financial condition and results of operations. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Goodwill The Company reviews its goodwill for impairment, based on financial data related to the reporting unit to which it has been assigned, at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit associated with the goodwill to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill must be adjusted to its implied fair value. In determining the fair value of a reporting unit, the Company utilizes widely accepted techniques such as discounted cash flow methodologies which require the Company to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate macro economic factors, industry economic factors and the future profitability of current business strategies. Changes in these factors can have a significant impact on the impairment evaluation. Asset Groups to Be Disposed of by Sale Asset groups (assets and liabilities to be disposed of together as a group in a single transaction) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell and a loss should be recognized for any initial adjustment required to reduce the carrying amount to the fair value less cost to sell in the period the held for sale criteria are met. The fair value less cost to sell must be assessed each reporting period the asset group remains classified as held for sale. Gains or losses not previously recognized resulting from the sale of an asset group will be recognized on the date of sale. In determining the fair value of an asset group representing a business, the Company utilizes widely accepted techniques such as discounted cash flow methodologies which require the Company to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate macro economic factors, industry economic factors and the future profitability of current business strategies. Changes in these factors can have a significant impact on the impairment evaluation. In addition, the determination of fair value for an asset group held for sale may be influenced by information received from market participants (interested buyers) having appropriate knowledge of the asset group. The appropriate level of knowledge may not be obtainable solely from public observations, but could be obtained in the course of a normal due diligence process. 42 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Finance Receivable Securitizations Prior to 2009, the Company sold retail motorcycle loans through securitization transactions utilizing Qualifying Special Purpose Entities (QSPEs) as defined by ASC Topic 860 40 Transfers to Qualifying Special Purpose Entities (ASC Topic 860 40). Upon sale of retail loans in a securitization transaction, HDFS received cash and retained an interest in excess cash flows, subordinated securities, and cash reserve account deposits, all of which are collectively referred to as retained interests in the securitized receivables. Retained interests are carried at fair value and are periodically reviewed for impairment. Market value quotes of fair value are generally not available for retained interests. Therefore, fair value is measured using discounted cash flow methodologies that incorporate managements best estimate of key assumptions that, in managements judgment, reflect the assumptions marketplace participants would use. The impact of changes to key assumptions is shown in Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. HDFS retains servicing rights under retail loans that it has sold to the securitization trust and receives a servicing fee. The servicing fee paid to HDFS is considered adequate compensation for the services provided and is included in financial services revenue as earned. Gains or losses on securitizations from the sale of retail loans were recorded as a component of financial services revenue and were based in part on certain assumptions including expected credit losses, prepayment speed and discount rates. Gains or losses on sales of retail loans also depended on the original carrying amount of the retail loans, which were allocated between the assets sold and the retained interests based on their relative fair value at the date of transfer. Valuation of Finance Receivables Held for Sale Finance receivables held for sale in the aggregate were carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value. HDFS used discounted cash flow methodologies to estimate the fair value of finance receivables held for sale that incorporated appropriate assumptions for discount rate, funding costs and credit enhancement, as well as estimates concerning credit losses and prepayments that, in managements judgment, reflected assumptions marketplace participants would use. Any amount by which cost exceeded fair value was accounted for as a valuation adjustment with an offset to other income. Allowance for Finance Credit Losses on Finance Receivables Held for Investment The allowance for uncollectible accounts is maintained at a level management believes is adequate to cover the losses of principal in the existing finance receivables held for investment portfolio. Managements periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the retail or other small balance homogeneous loan allowance is generally based on HDFS past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, current economic conditions and the estimated value of any underlying collateral. HDFS wholesale and other large loan allowance policy is based on a loan by loan review which considers the specific borrowers ability to repay and the estimated value of any underlying collateral. Product Warranty Estimated warranty costs are reserved for each motorcycle at the time of sale. The warranty reserve is an estimated cost per unit sold based upon historical Company claim data used in combination with other known factors that may affect future warranty claims. The Company updates its warranty estimates quarterly to ensure that the warranty reserves are based on the most current information available. The Company believes that past claim experience is indicative of future claims; however, the factors affecting actual claims can be volatile. As a result, actual claims experience may differ from estimated which could lead to material changes in the Companys warranty provision and related reserves. The Companys warranty liability is discussed further in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits The Company has several defined benefit pension plans and several postretirement healthcare benefit plans, which cover substantially all employees of the Motorcycles segment. The Company also has unfunded supplemental employee retirement plan agreements (SERPA) with certain employees which were instituted to replace benefits lost under the Tax Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993. Pension, SERPA and postretirement healthcare obligations and costs are calculated through actuarial valuations. The valuation of benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs relies on key assumptions including discount rates, long term expected return on plan assets, future compensation and healthcare cost trend rates. 43 Table of Contents The Company determines its discount rate assumptions by referencing high quality long term bond rates that are matched to the duration of its own benefit obligations. Based on this analysis, the discount rate for pension and SERPA obligations was decreased from 6.1% as of December 31, 2008 to 6.0% as of December 31, 2009. The discount rate for postretirement healthcare obligations was decreased from 6.1% to 5.65%. The Company determines its healthcare trend assumption for the postretirement healthcare obligation by considering factors such as estimated healthcare inflation, the utilization of healthcare benefits and changes in the health of plan participants. Based on the Companys assessment of this data as of December 31, 2009, the Company lowered its healthcare cost trend rate to 7.5% from 8% as of December 31, 2008. The Company expects the healthcare cost trend rate to reach its ultimate rate of 5% beginning in 2014.(1) These assumption changes were reflected immediately in the benefit obligation and will be amortized into net periodic benefit costs over future periods. The following information is provided to illustrate the sensitivity of pension and postretirement healthcare obligations and costs to changes in these major assumptions (in thousands): Amounts basedon currentassumptions Impact of a 1%decrease in thediscount rate Impact of a 1%increase in thehealthcare costtrend rate 2009 Net periodic benefit costs Pension and SERPA $ 84,770 $ 22,740 n/a Postretirement healthcare $ 34,303 $ 2,294 $ 1,082 2009 Benefit obligations Pension and SERPA $ 1,284,722 $ 186,371 n/a Postretirement healthcare $ 377,282 $ 37,180 $ 11,387 This information should not be viewed as predictive of future amounts. The calculation of pension, SERPA and postretirement healthcare obligations and costs is based on many factors in addition to those discussed here. This information should be considered in combination with the information provided in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Stock Compensation Costs The total cost of the Companys share based awards is equal to the grant date fair value per award multiplied by the number of awards granted (adjusted for forfeitures). This cost is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the service periods of the awards. Forfeitures are initially estimated based on historical Company information and subsequently updated over the life of the awards to ultimately reflect actual forfeitures. As a result, changes in forfeiture activity can influence the amount of stock compensation cost recognized from period to period. The Company estimates the fair value of option awards as of the grant date using a lattice based option valuation model which utilizes ranges of assumptions over the expected term of the options, including stock price volatility, dividend yield and risk free interest rate. The valuation model uses historical data to estimate option exercise behavior and employee terminations. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The Company uses a weighted average of historical and implied volatility to determine the expected volatility of its stock. The implied volatility is derived from options that are actively traded and the market prices of both the traded options and underlying shares are measured at a similar point in time to each other and on a date reasonably close to the grant date of the employee share options. In addition, the traded options have exercise prices that are both (a) near the money and (b) close to the exercise price of the employee share options. Finally, the remaining maturities of the traded options on which the estimate is based are at least one year. 44 Table of Contents Dividend yield was based on the Companys expected dividend payments and the risk free rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Changes in the valuation assumptions could result in a significant change to the cost of an individual option. However, the total cost of an award is also a function of the number of awards granted, and as result, the Company has the ability to control the cost of its equity awards by adjusting the number of awards granted. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and other loss carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the Companys worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related deferred tax assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of the Companys business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Accruals for unrecognized tax benefits are provided for in accordance with the requirements of ASC Topic 740. An unrecognized tax benefit represents the difference between the recognition of benefits related to exposure items for income tax reporting purposes and financial reporting purposes. The unrecognized tax benefit is included within other long term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company has a reserve for interest and penalties on exposure items, if applicable, which is recorded as a component of the overall income tax provision. The Company is regularly under audit by tax authorities. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, management believes that it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns and that its annual tax provision includes amounts sufficient to pay any assessments. Nonetheless, the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year. Contractual Obligations A summary of the Companys expected payments for significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009 is as follows (in thousands): 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total Principal payments on debt $ 1,522,090 $ 1,890,231 $ 1,225,433 $ 998,375 $ 5,636,129 Interest payments on debt 265,687 452,547 291,421 235,167 1,244,822 Operating lease payments 11,985 12,023 8,559 17,002 49,569 $ 1,799,762 $ 2,354,801 $ 1,525,413 $ 1,250,544 $ 6,930,520 As described in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2009, the Company classified $378.2 million related to its unsecured commercial paper and its Global Credit Facilities (as defined in Liquidity and Capital Resources) as long term debt as of December 31, 2009. This amount is classified as long term because it is supported by the Global Credit Facilities and is expected to remain outstanding for an uninterrupted period extending beyond one year; accordingly, the Company has assumed that this amount will be repaid in 2011. As described in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, as of December 31, 2009, the Company classified $205.0 million related to its Global Credit Facilities as current portion of long term debt as of December 31, 2009. This amount relates to the Companys investment in MV and subsequent working capital advances. This amount is classified as current portion of long term debt as the Company anticipates that it will be repaid in 2010. 45 Table of Contents Interest obligations include the impact of interest rate hedges outstanding as of December 31, 2009. Interest for floating rate instruments, as calculated above, assumes December 31, 2009 rates remain constant. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had no material purchase obligations other than those created in the ordinary course of business related to inventory and property, plant and equipment which generally have terms of less than 90 days. The Company has long term obligations related to its pension, SERPA and postretirement healthcare plans at December 31, 2009. During 2009, the Company contributed $233.2 million to its pension, SERPA and postretirement healthcare plans. The Company is currently evaluating additional contributions to further fund its pension plans even though no additional contributions are required in 2010. The Company expects it will continue to make on going contributions related to current benefit payments for SERPA and postretirement healthcare plans. The Companys expected future contributions to these plans are provided in Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As described in Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has unrecognized tax benefits of $77.8 million and accrued interest and penalties of $27.4 million as of December 31, 2009. However, the Company cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate for the period of cash settlement for either the $77.8 million of liability of unrecognized tax benefits or accrued interest and penalties of $27.4 million. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of its term asset backed securitization program prior to 2009, HDFS transferred retail motorcycle loans to a special purpose bankruptcy remote wholly owned subsidiary. The subsidiary sold the retail loans to a securitization trust in exchange for the proceeds from term asset backed securities issued by the securitization trust. The term asset backed securities, usually notes with various maturities and interest rates, are secured by future collections of the purchased retail installment loans. Activities of the securitization trust are limited to acquiring retail loans, issuing term asset backed securities and making payments on securities to investors. Due to the nature of the assets held by the securitization trust and the limited nature of its activities, the securitization trusts are considered Qualifying Special Purpose Entities (QSPEs) as defined by the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 860 40 Transfers to Qualifying Special Purpose Entities (ASC Topic 860 40). In accordance with ASC Topic 860 40, assets and liabilities of the QSPEs are not consolidated in the financial statements of the Company (see update below). HDFS does not guarantee payments on the securities issued by the securitization trusts or the projected cash flows from the related loans purchased from HDFS. The Companys retained securitization interests, excluding servicing rights, are subordinate to the interests of securitization trust investors. Such investors have priority interests in the cash collections on the retail loans sold to the securitization trust (after payment of servicing fees) and in the cash reserve account deposits. These priority interests ultimately could impact the value of the Companys investment in retained securitization interests. Investors also do not have recourse to assets of HDFS for failure of the obligors on the retail loans to pay when due. Total investment in retained securitization interests at December 31, 2009 was $245.4 million. The securitization trusts have a limited life and generally terminate upon final distribution of amounts owed to the investors in the term asset backed securities. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of HDFS term asset backed securitization program. As discussed under New Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted, the Company is required to adopt new guidance within ASC Topics 810 and 860 as of January 1, 2010 requiring the consolidation of qualifying special purpose entities previously utilized for its off balance sheet term asset backed securitization transactions. Commitments and Contingencies The Company is subject to lawsuits and other claims related to environmental, product and other matters. In determining required reserves related to these items, the Company carefully analyzes cases and considers the 46 Table of Contents likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes, as well as the potential range of possible loss. The required reserves are monitored on an ongoing basis and are updated based on new developments or new information in each matter. Environmental Protection Agency Notice The Company has received formal, written requests for information from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regarding: (i) certificates of conformity for motorcycle emissions and related designations and labels, (ii) aftermarket parts, and (iii) warranty claims on emissions related components. The Company has submitted written responses to the EPAs inquiry and has engaged in discussions with the EPA. It is possible that a result of the EPAs investigation will be some form of enforcement action by the EPA that will seek a fine or other relief. However, at this time the Company does not know and cannot reasonably estimate the impact of any remedies the EPA might seek. Shareholder Lawsuits: In re Harley Davidson, Inc. Securities Litigation was a consolidated shareholder securities class action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. On October 2, 2006, the Lead Plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Class Action Complaint, which named the Company and certain former Company officers as defendants, that alleged securities law violations and sought unspecified damages relating generally to the Companys April 13, 2005 announcement that it was reducing short term production growth and planned increases of motorcycle shipments. On December 18, 2006, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Consolidated Complaint. On October 8, 2009, the judge granted defendants motion to dismiss, and the clerk of court entered judgment dismissing the consolidated lawsuit. No appeal was taken from the final judgment and the dismissal of the action is now final. On August 25, 2005, a class action lawsuit alleging violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. On October 2, 2006, the ERISA plaintiff filed an Amended Class Action Complaint, which named the Company, the Harley Davidson Motor Company Retirement Plans Committee, the Companys Leadership and Strategy Council, and certain current or former Company officers or employees as defendants. In general, the ERISA complaint included factual allegations similar to those in the consolidated securities class action and alleged on behalf of participants in certain Harley Davidson retirement savings plans that the plan fiduciaries breached their ERISA fiduciary duties. On December 18, 2006, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the ERISA complaint. On October 8, 2009, the judge granted defendants motion to dismiss, and the clerk of court entered judgment dismissing the class action lawsuit. No appeal was taken from the final judgment and the dismissal of the action is now final. Three shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin on June 3, 2005, October 25, 2005 (this lawsuit was later voluntarily dismissed) and December 2, 2005, and two shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed in Milwaukee County Circuit Court on July 22, 2005 and November 16, 2005, against some or all of the following current or former directors and officers of the Company: Jeffrey L. Bleustein, James L. Ziemer, James M. Brostowitz, Barry K. Allen, Richard I. Beattie, George H. Conrades, Judson C. Green, Donald A. James, Sara L. Levinson, George L. Miles, Jr., James A. Norling, James A. McCaslin, Donna F. Zarcone, Jon R. Flickinger, Gail A. Lione, Ronald M. Hutchinson, W. Kenneth Sutton, Jr. and John A. Hevey. The lawsuits also name the Company as a nominal defendant. In general, the shareholder derivative complaints include factual allegations similar to those in the class action complaints and allegations that officers and directors breached their fiduciary duties to the Company. On February 14, 2006, the state court consolidated the two state court derivative actions and appointed Lead Plaintiffs and Lead Plaintiffs counsel, and on April 24, 2006, the state court ordered that the consolidated state court derivative action be stayed until after motions to dismiss the federal securities class action are decided. On February 15, 2006, the federal court consolidated the federal derivative lawsuits with the securities and ERISA actions for administrative purposes. On February 1, 2007, the federal court appointed Lead Plaintiff and Co Lead Plaintiffs Counsel in the consolidated federal derivative action. 47 Table of Contents On November 24, 2009, both federal court derivative plaintiffs moved to voluntarily dismiss their lawsuits and all claims without prejudice. On November 30, 2009, the federal court entered orders granting the motions and dismissing the federal court derivative lawsuits without prejudice, and those cases are now closed. The parties have agreed that the lead plaintiff in the consolidated state court derivative action may have until February 19, 2010 to file an amended complaint in that action and that defendants may have until March 26, 2010 to respond to any amended complaint. The Company believes the allegations in the state court derivative lawsuit are without merit and it intends to vigorously defend against the suit should the plaintiffs file an amended complaint. The Company is unable to predict the scope or outcome or quantify their eventual impact, if any, on the Company. At this time, the Company is also unable to estimate associated expenses or possible losses. The Company maintains insurance that may limit its financial exposure for defense costs and liability for an unfavorable outcome, should it not prevail, for claims covered by the insurance coverage. York Environmental Matters: The Company is involved with government agencies and groups of potentially responsible parties in various environmental matters, including a matter involving the cleanup of soil and groundwater contamination at its York, Pennsylvania facility. The York facility was formerly used by the U.S. Navy and AMF prior to the purchase of the York facility by the Company from AMF in 1981. Although the Company is not certain as to the full extent of the environmental contamination at the York facility, it has been working with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) since 1986 in undertaking environmental investigation and remediation activities, including an ongoing site wide remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS). In January 1995, the Company entered into a settlement agreement (the Agreement) with the Navy. The Agreement calls for the Navy and the Company to contribute amounts into a trust equal to 53% and 47%, respectively, of future costs associated with environmental investigation and remediation activities at the York facility (Response Costs). The trust administers the payment of the Response Costs incurred at the York facility as covered by the Agreement. In February 2002, the Company was advised by the EPA that it considers some of the Companys remediation activities at the York facility to be subject to the EPAs corrective action program under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and offered the Company the option of addressing corrective action under a RCRA facility lead agreement. In July 2005, the York facility was designated as the first site in Pennsylvania to be addressed under the One Cleanup Program. The program provides a more streamlined and efficient oversight of voluntary remediation by both PADEP and EPA and will be carried out consistent with the Agreement with the Navy. As a result, the RCRA facility lead agreement has been superseded. Although the RI/FS is still underway and substantial uncertainty exists concerning the nature and scope of the additional environmental investigation and remediation that will ultimately be required at the York facility, the Company estimates that its share of the future Response Costs at the York facility will be approximately $5.9 million. The Company has established reserves for this amount, which are included in accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The estimate of the Companys future Response Costs that will be incurred at the York facility is based on reports of independent environmental consultants retained by the Company, the actual costs incurred to date and the estimated costs to complete the necessary investigation and remediation activities. Response Costs related to the remediation of soil are expected to be incurred over a period of several years ending in 2015. Response Costs related to ground water remediation may continue for some time beyond 2015. Product Liability Matters: Additionally, the Company is involved in product liability suits related to the operation of its business. The Company accrues for claim exposures that are probable of occurrence and can be reasonably estimated. The 48 Table of Contents Company also maintains insurance coverage for product liability exposures. The Company believes that its accruals and insurance coverage are adequate and that product liability will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources as of December 31, 2009 Over the long term, the Company expects that its business model will continue to generate cash that will allow it to invest in the business, fund future growth opportunities and return value to shareholders.(1) The Company believes the Motorcycles operations will continue to be primarily funded through internally generated cash flows. During 2009, the Companys Financial Services operations were funded with unsecured debt, unsecured commercial paper, an asset backed commercial paper conduit facility, and committed unsecured bank facilities and through the term asset backed securitization market. On January 22, 2010, the Company announced that it believes HDFS anticipated 2010 funding needs have been met through actions taken during 2009.(1) These actions included: In February 2009, the Company accessed the unsecured debt capital markets with the issuance of $600.0 million of senior unsecured five year notes. In April 2009, HDFS increased the size of its asset backed commercial paper conduit facility from $500.0 million to $1.20 billion and extended the maturity date until April 2010. In April 2009, the Company and HDFS entered into a new $625.0 million 364 day credit facility to replace its $950.0 million 364 day credit facility that was set to expire in July 2009. The new 364 day credit facility has a maturity date of April 2010. In May, July, October and December 2009, HDFS transferred a total of $3.08 billion U.S. retail motorcycle finance receivables to four separate special purpose entities (SPEs), which in turn issued a total of $2.46 billion of secured notes, with various maturities and interest rates, to investors. These term asset backed securitization transactions were eligible collateral under the Federal Reserve Bank of New Yorks Term Asset backed securities Loan Facility (TALF) program. In November 2009, HDFS issued $500.0 million of medium term notes. In 2010, the Company and HDFS expect to renew a portion of the $625.0 million 364 day credit facility and the asset backed commercial paper conduit facility, both of which expire in April 2010.(1) Any new capital market funding is expected to be used to pre fund 2011 funding requirements.(1) In addition to the funding achievements discussed above, the Company has taken steps to manage and preserve cash. During 2009, the Companys Board of Directors approved four quarterly dividends of $0.10 per share, a decrease of $0.23 per share from the dividend paid in the fourth quarter of 2008. The dividend reductions resulted in cash savings of approximately $216 million. Going forward, the Companys strategy will be to maintain a minimum of twelve months of its projected liquidity needs through a combination of cash and credit facilities. As a result, the Company will continue to carry higher cash balances until the U.S. economy, as well as the capital and credit markets and the Companys debt ratings, stabilize and improve. The Company is currently reviewing its strategic options relative to its Financial Services operations in order to find more diversified and cost effective funding to meet HDFS goal of providing credit while delivering appropriate returns and profitability. Although the Company believes it has obtained the funding necessary to support HDFS operations for 2010(1), the Company recognizes that it must be able to adjust its business to the current lending environment. The Company intends to continue to diversify its funding profile through a combination of short term and long term funding vehicles, reduce its reliance on the term asset backed securitization market and continue to pursue all avenues to obtain cost effective funding. The Financial Services 49 Table of Contents operations may be negatively affected by the higher cost of funding and the increased difficulty of raising, or potential unsuccessful efforts to raise, funding in the short term and long term capital markets.(1) These negative consequences may in turn adversely affect the Companys business and results of operations in various ways, including through higher costs of capital, reduced funds available through its Financial Services operations to provide loans to independent dealers and their retail customers, and dilution to existing shareholders through the use of alternative sources of capital. The Company has long term obligations related to its pension, SERPA and postretirement healthcare plans at December 31, 2009. During 2009, the Company contributed $233.2 million to its pension, SERPA and postretirement healthcare plans. The Company is currently evaluating additional contributions to further fund its pension plans even though no additional pension plan contributions are required in 2010. The Company expects it will continue to make on going contributions related to current benefit payments for SERPA and postretirement healthcare plans. The Companys expected future contributions to these plans are provided in Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash Flow Activity The following table summarizes the operating, investing and financing cash flow activity of continuing operations for the three years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 (in thousands): 2009 2008 2007 Net cash provided by (used by) operating activities of continuing operations $ 609,010 $ (608,029 ) $ 798,146 Net cash (used by) provided by investing activities of continuing operations (863,487 ) (294,875 ) 391,205 Net cash provided by (used by) financing activities of continuing operations 1,381,937 1,293,390 (1,037,803 ) Total $ 1,127,460 $ 390,486 $ 151,548 Operating Activities The increase in operating cash flow for 2009 compared to 2008 was due primarily to the classification of the Companys retail lending activities partially offset by lower net income and pension contributions. U.S. retail motorcycle loans originated prior to June 28, 2009 were classified as held for sale based on the Companys intent to securitize these retail loans in off balance sheet securitization transactions. Accordingly, the origination and collection of these retail loans as well as any proceeds from off balance sheet securitization transactions were components of operating cash flows. The Company has not conducted an off balance sheet securitization since the first quarter of 2008. At end of the second quarter of 2009, the Company made a decision to structure subsequent securitization transactions in a manner that will require on balance sheet accounting (i.e., the Company no longer has intent to sell at the date of origination). As a result of that decision, the cash flows related to post June retail lending activity are included within the investing cash flow section of the statement of cash flows. As noted above, the Company contributed $233.2 million to its pension plans during 2009 including the on going contribution requirements related to current benefit payments for SERPA and postretirement healthcare plans. Investing Activities The Companys investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures, net changes in finance receivables held for investment and short term investment activity. Capital expenditures were $116.7 million and 50 Table of Contents $229.0 million during 2009 and 2008, respectively. Net changes in finance receivables held for investment reflect the Companys increased utilization of on balance sheet term asset backed securitization transactions. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company completed four such transactions. As a result of the Companys higher cash balances as of December 31, 2009, the Company invested $39.7 million in corporate bonds during December 2009. Sales and redemptions of marketable securities (net of purchases) in 2008 resulted in cash inflow of $2.5 million compared to $657.7 million in 2007. Financing Activities The Companys financing activities consist primarily of debt activity, dividend payments and share repurchases. In 2008, the Company repurchased 6.3 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of $250.4 million. As of December 31, 2009, there were 16.7 million shares remaining on a board approved share repurchase authorization. An additional board approved share repurchase authorization is in place to offset option exercises. The Company paid dividends of $0.40 per share at a total cost of $93.8 million during 2009, compared to dividends of $1.29 per share at a total cost of $302.3 million during 2008. During 2009, debt increased by $1.72 billion compared to 2008 in support of the higher finance receivables outstanding at HDFS and higher cash balances that the Company is maintaining in order to ensure a minimum of twelve months of its projected liquidity needs. The Companys total outstanding debt consisted of the following as of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 (in thousands): 2009 2008 2007 Unsecured commercial paper $ 325,099 $ 1,416,449 $ 842,618 Asset backed conduit facility 500,000 Credit facilities 448,049 390,932 256,531 773,148 2,307,381 1,099,149 Medium term notes 2,103,396 1,607,506 1,000,806 Senior unsecured notes 600,000 On balance sheet securitization debt 2,159,585 Total debt $ 5,636,129 $ 3,914,887 $ 2,099,955 In order to access the debt capital markets, the Company relies on credit rating agencies to assign short term and long term credit ratings. Generally, lower credit ratings result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to debt capital markets. A credit rating agency may change or withdraw the Companys ratings based on its assessment of the Companys current and future ability to meet interest and principal repayment obligations. The Companys short term debt ratings affect its ability to issue unsecured commercial paper. The Companys short and long term debt ratings as of December 31, 2009 were as follows: Short Term Long Term Outlook Moodys P2 Baa1 Negative Standard & Poors A2 BBB Stable Fitch F2 BBB+ Negative Credit Facilities In April 2009, the Company and HDFS entered into a new $625.0 million 364 day credit facility (New 364 Day Credit Facility) to refinance and replace the existing $950.0 million 364 day credit facility (2008 364 Day Credit Facility), which was set to mature in July 2009. The New 364 Day Credit Facility matures in April 2010. In connection with the New 364 Day Credit Facility, the Company and HDFS also amended the existing three year credit facility agreement, which matures in July 2011. The amendments to the three year 51 Table of Contents credit facility were to conform to the terms of the New 364 Day Credit Facility. The New 364 Day Credit Facility and the amended three year credit facility agreement (together, the Global Credit Facilities) bear interest at various variable interest rates, which may be adjusted upward or downward depending on certain criteria, such as credit ratings. The Global Credit Facilities also require the Company to pay a fee based upon the average daily unused portion of the aggregate commitments under the Global Credit Facilities. Commercial Paper Subject to limitations, HDFS could issue unsecured commercial paper of up to $1.58 billion as of December 31, 2009. Outstanding unsecured commercial paper may not exceed the unused portion of the Global Credit Facilities. Maturities may range up to 365 days from the issuance date. HDFS intends to finance the repayment of unsecured commercial paper as it matures by issuing traditional unsecured commercial paper or through other means, such as borrowing under the Global Credit Facilities, borrowing under its asset backed commercial paper conduit facility and term asset backed securitizations.(1) Asset backed commercial paper conduit facility During April 2009, HDFS entered into a new revolving asset backed conduit facility agreement (2009 Conduit Loan Agreement) to refinance and replace the existing $500.0 million asset backed conduit facility agreement (2008 Conduit Loan Agreement). The 2009 Conduit Loan Agreement provides for the extension of credit by a group of third party bank sponsored conduits, some of which were party to the 2008 Conduit Loan Agreement. The 2009 Conduit Loan Agreement provides for total revolving borrowings of up to $1.20 billion based on, among other things, the amount of eligible U.S. retail motorcycle loan collateral. As part of the April 2009 transaction, HDFS increased the U.S. retail motorcycle loan collateral by $354.4 million and also increased the debt issued to the third party bank sponsored conduits from $500.0 million to $640.2 million. At December 31, 2009, HDFS had no outstanding borrowings under the 2009 Conduit Loan Agreement. This debt provides for interest on outstanding principal based on prevailing commercial paper rates, or LIBOR plus a specified margin to the extent the advance is not funded by a conduit lender through the issuance of commercial paper. The 2009 Conduit Loan Agreement also provides for an unused commitment fee based on the unused portion of the total aggregate commitment or $1.20 billion. There is no amortization schedule; however, the debt is reduced monthly as available collections on the related finance receivable collateral are applied to outstanding principal with the balance due at maturity. Unless earlier terminated or extended by mutual agreement of HDFS and the lenders, the 2009 Conduit Loan Agreement will expire on April 29, 2010, at which time HDFS will be obligated to repay any amounts outstanding in full. Medium Term Notes The Company has the following Medium Term Notes (collectively the Notes) issued and outstanding at December 31, 2009 (in thousands): Principal Amount Rate Issue Date Maturity Date $ 200,000 5.00 % December 2005 December 2010 $ 400,000 5.25 % December 2007 December 2012 $1,000,000 6.80 % May 2008 June 2018 $ 500,000 5.75 % November 2009 December 2014 The Notes provide for semi annual interest payments and principal due at maturity. At December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Notes included a fair value adjustment increasing the balance by $6.1 million, $9.7 million and $1.3 million, respectively, due to interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges. The effect of the interest rate swap agreements is to convert the interest rate on a portion of the Notes from a fixed to a floating rate, which is based on 3 month LIBOR. Unamortized discounts on the Notes reduced the balance by $2.7 million, $2.2 million and $0.5 million at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Senior Unsecured Notes In February 2009, the Company issued $600.0 million of senior unsecured notes in an underwritten offering. The senior unsecured notes mature in February 2014 and have an annual interest rate of 15%. The senior unsecured notes provide for semi annual interest payments and principal due at maturity. 52 Table of Contents Prior to the end of the first quarter, the Company transferred the full proceeds from the issuance to HDFS in order to fund HDFS operations. As HDFS diversified its debt structure through a combination of actions during 2009, its funding profile improved. During the fourth quarter of 2009, HDFS transferred the full proceeds back to the Company. On Balance Sheet Securitization Debt In 2009, HDFS transferred $3.08 billion of U.S. retail motorcycle loans to four separate SPEs. The SPEs in turn issued $2.46 billion of secured notes, respectively, with various maturities and interest rates to investors in on balance sheet securitization transactions. These term asset backed securitization transactions were eligible collateral under the TALF program. The notes are secured by future collections of the purchased U.S. retail motorcycle loans. The structure of these term asset backed securitization transactions did not satisfy the requirements for accounting sale treatment under ASC Topic 860 40; therefore, the securitized U.S. retail motorcycle loans, resulting secured borrowings and other related assets and liabilities of the SPEs are included in the Companys consolidated financial statements as HDFS is the primary beneficiary of the SPEs. The SPEs are separate legal entities and the U.S. retail motorcycle loans that have been included in the term asset backed securitizations are only available for payment of the secured debt and other obligations arising from the term asset backed securitization transactions and are not available to pay other obligations or claims of the Companys creditors until the associated secured debt and other obligations are satisfied. Cash and cash equivalent balances held by the SPEs are used only to support the on balance sheet securitizations. There is no amortization schedule for the secured notes; however, the debt is reduced monthly as available collections on the related U.S. retail motorcycle loans are applied to outstanding principal. The notes expected life ranges from one to four years due to credit losses and prepayment speeds. As of December 31, 2009, the assets of the SPEs totaled $2.93 billion, of which $2.75 billion of finance receivables were restricted as collateral for the payment of $2.16 billion secured notes. Also included in the assets of the SPEs were $164.1 million of cash restricted for payment on the outstanding debt at December 31, 2009. Intercompany Borrowing HDFS has a revolving credit line with the Company whereby HDFS may borrow up to $210.0 million from the Company at a market interest rate. As of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, HDFS had no outstanding borrowings owed to the Company under this agreement. The Company has a support agreement with HDFS whereby, if required, the Company agrees to provide HDFS with financial support in order to maintain HDFS fixed charge coverage at 1.25 and minimum net worth of $40.0 million. Support may be provided at the Companys option as capital contributions or loans. Accordingly, certain debt covenants may restrict the Companys ability to withdraw funds from HDFS outside the normal course of business. No amount has ever been provided to HDFS under the support agreement. Operating and Financial Covenants HDFS and the Company are subject to various operating and financial covenants related to the Global Credit Facilities, asset backed commercial paper conduit facility and various operating covenants under the Notes. The more significant covenants are described below. The covenants limit the Companys and HDFS ability to: incur certain additional indebtedness; assume or incur certain liens; participate in a merger, consolidation, liquidation or dissolution; and purchase or hold margin stock. Under the financial covenants of the Global Credit Facilities and the asset backed commercial paper conduit facility, the debt to equity ratio of HDFS and its consolidated subsidiaries cannot exceed 10.0 to 1.0 and HDFS 53 Table of Contents must maintain a consolidated tangible net worth of not less than $500.0 million.

Cautionary Statements The Companys ability to meet the targets and expectations noted in this Form 10 K depends upon, among other factors, the Companys ability to (i) execute its strategy and successfully exit certain product lines and divest certain company assets; (ii) effectively execute the Companys restructuring plans within expected costs and timing; (iii) successfully achieve with the Companys labor unions flexible and cost effective agreements to accomplish restructuring goals and long term competitiveness; (iv) manage the risks that our independent dealers may have difficulty obtaining capital and adjusting to the recession and slowdown in consumer demand; (v) manage supply chain issues; (vi) anticipate the level of consumer confidence in the economy; (vii) continue to have access to reliable sources of capital funding and adjust to fluctuations in the cost of capital; (viii) manage the credit quality, the loan servicing and collection activities, and the recovery rates of HDFS loan portfolio; (ix) continue to realize production efficiencies at its production facilities and manage operating costs including materials, labor and overhead; (x) manage production capacity and production changes; (xi) provide products, services and experiences that are successful in the marketplace; (xii) develop and implement sales and marketing plans that retain existing retail customers and attract new retail customers in an increasingly competitive marketplace; (xiii) sell all of its motorcycles and related products and services to its independent dealers; (xiv) continue to develop the capabilities of its distributor and dealer network; (xv) manage changes and prepare for requirements in legislative and regulatory environments for its products, services and operations; (xvi) adjust to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices; (xvii) adjust to healthcare inflation, pension reform and tax changes; (xviii) retain and attract talented employees; (xix) detect any issues with the Companys motorcycles or manufacturing processes to avoid delays in new model launches, recall campaigns, increased warranty costs or litigation; and (xx) implement and manage enterprise wide information technology solutions and secure data contained in those systems. In addition, the Company could experience delays or disruptions in its operations as a result of work stoppages, strikes, natural causes, terrorism or other factors. These risks, potential delays and uncertainties regarding the costs could also adversely impact the Companys capital expenditure estimates (see Liquidity and Capital Resources section). In addition, see Risk Factors under Item 1A. which includes a discussion of additional risk factors and a more complete discussion of some of the cautionary statements noted above. 54 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. To reduce such risks, the Company selectively uses derivative financial instruments. All hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to regularly reviewed policies and procedures, which prohibit the use of financial instruments for trading purposes. Sensitivity analysis is used to manage and monitor foreign exchange and interest rate risk. The Company sells its products internationally and in most markets those sales are made in the foreign countrys local currency. As a result, the Companys earnings can be affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currency. The Companys most significant foreign currency risk relates to the Euro, the Australian dollar and the Brazilian Real. The Company utilizes foreign currency contracts to mitigate the effect of the Euro and the Australian dollar fluctuations on earnings. The foreign currency contracts are entered into with banks and allow the Company to exchange a specified amount of foreign currency for U.S. dollars at a future date, based on a fixed exchange rate. At December 31, 2009, the notional U.S. dollar value of outstanding Euro and Australian dollar foreign currency contracts was $144.8 million. The Company estimates that a uniform 10% weakening in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies underlying these contracts would result in a decrease in the fair value of the contracts of approximately $15.1 million as of December 31, 2009. Further disclosure relating to the fair value of derivative financial instruments is included in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, the Company financed its acquisition of MV Agusta and subsequent working capital requirements through 143.0 million of Euro denominated debt ($205.0 million at December 31, 2009). The carrying amount of debt is measured at each balance sheet date in the U.S. dollar and the corresponding gains or losses are recognized in the statement of operations. The Companys earnings are affected by changes in interest rates. HDFS utilizes interest rate swaps to reduce the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on its debt and securitization transactions. HDFS also entered into derivative contracts to facilitate the April 2009 asset backed conduit facility, certain of which do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Additionally, to facilitate its first quarter 2008 securitization transaction as well as its third quarter 2007 securitization transaction, HDFS entered into derivative contracts. These derivatives, which hedge assets by an off balance sheet Qualifying Special Purpose Entity, do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in current period earnings within other operating expenses. As of December 31, 2009, HDFS had interest rate swaps outstanding with a notional value of $1.16 billion. HDFS estimates that a 10% decrease in interest rates would result in a $1.4 million decrease in the fair value of the agreements. 55 Table of Contents
