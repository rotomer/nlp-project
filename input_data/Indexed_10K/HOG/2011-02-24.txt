Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Harley Davidson, Inc. is the parent company for the groups of companies doing business as Harley Davidson Motor Company (HDMC), Harley Davidson Financial Services (HDFS) and Buell Motorcycle Company (Buell). HDMC produces heavyweight cruiser and touring motorcycles. HDMC manufactures five families of motorcycles: Touring, Dyna&reg;, Softail&reg;, Sportster&reg; and VRSC. HDFS provides wholesale and retail financing and insurance programs primarily to Harley Davidson and Buell dealers and customers. The Company operates in two business segments: Motorcycles & Related Products (Motorcycles) and Financial Services (Financial Services). The Companys reportable segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services. They are managed separately based on the fundamental differences in their operations. The % Change figures included in the Results of Operations section were calculated using unrounded dollar amounts and may differ from calculations using the rounded dollar amounts presented. Overview The Company is encouraged by 2010 results and its progress against its long term business strategy as announced in 2009. The Companys long term business strategy is centered on four key pillars of growth, continuous improvement, leadership development and sustainability. Under this strategy, the Company expects to drive growth through a focus of efforts and resources on the unique strengths of the Harley Davidson brand and to enhance productivity and profitability through continuous improvement. The strategy focuses Company resources on Harley Davidson products and experiences, global expansion, demographic outreach and commitment to core customers. In addition, the Company will continue to expand its initiatives to enhance profitability through continuous improvement in manufacturing, product development and business operations. During 2010, the Motorcycles segment showed improved financial performance driven by the Companys restructuring efforts and the Financial Services segment returned to profitability. Income from continuing operations for 2010 was $259.7 million, or $1.11 per share, compared to $70.6 million, or $0.30 per share, in 2009. The Companys operating income for 2010 was $560.6 million, an increase of $364.5 million over the prior year driven by higher operating income from Financial Services. Operating income for the Financial Services segment improved by $299.8 million primarily due to favorable net interest income, improved credit performance and two non recurring, non cash charges totaling $101.1 million that were incurred during 2009. Operating income for the Motorcycles segment was $64.7 million higher in 2010 compared to 2009 driven by improved gross profit and a decrease in operating expenses. Please refer to the Results of Operations 2010 Compared to 2009 for additional details concerning the results for 2010.

In addition, the Company announced its expectation for full year 2011 gross margin to be between 34.0% and 35.0%. The Company also announced on January 25, 2011 that it expects the full year 2011 effective income tax rate to be approximately 35% for continuing operations. The Companys capital expenditure estimates for 2011 are between $210 million to $230 million, including approximately $60 million to $75 million to support restructuring activities. The Company anticipates it will have the ability to fund all capital expenditures in 2011 with cash flows generated by operations. Restructuring Activities(1) The Company and the unions representing its production employees in Kansas City, Missouri began negotiations in January 2011 on a new labor agreement to replace the current contract which is set to expire in July 2012. The Company has advised the unions that the Kansas City operations must become more competitive and flexible if those operations are to remain viable. The Company expects to make a decision on the future of the Kansas City operations in early March 2011, and will provide any updated cost and savings information at such time as it discloses a final decision. 2010 Restructuring Plan In September 2010, the Companys unionized employees in Wisconsin ratified three separate new seven year labor agreements which take effect in April 2012 when the current contracts expire. The new contracts are similar to the labor agreement ratified at the Companys York, Pennsylvania facility in December 2009 and allow for similar flexibility and increased production efficiency. Once the new contracts are implemented, the production system in Wisconsin, like York, will include the addition of a flexible workforce component. Based on the new ratified labor agreements, the Company expects to have about 700 full time hourly unionized employees in its Milwaukee area facilities when the contracts are implemented in 2012, about 250 fewer than would be required under the existing contract. In Tomahawk, the Company expects to have a full time hourly unionized workforce of about 200 when the contract is implemented, about 75 fewer than would be required under the current contract. 2009 Restructuring Plan During 2009, in response to the U.S. economic recession and worldwide slowdown in consumer demand, the Company committed to a volume reduction and a combination of restructuring actions that are expected to be completed in 2012. The actions were designed to reduce administrative costs, eliminate excess capacity and exit non core business operations. The Companys significant announced actions, which the Company believes are generally on schedule, include: consolidating its two engine and transmission plants in the Milwaukee area into its facility in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin; closing its distribution facility in Franklin, Wisconsin and consolidating Parts and Accessories and General Merchandise distribution through a third party; discontinuing the domestic transportation fleet; consolidating its vehicle test facilities from three locations in Alabama, Arizona and Florida into one location in Arizona; 29 Table of Contents restructuring its York, Pennsylvania motorcycle production facility to focus on the core operations of motorcycle assembly, metal fabrication and paint; and exiting the Buell product line. The Company ceased production of Buell motorcycles at the end of October 2009 and the sale of remaining Buell motorcycle inventory to independent dealers and or distributors was substantially completed during 2010. The 2009 restructuring plans include a reduction of approximately 2,700 to 2,900 hourly production positions and approximately 720 non production, primarily salaried positions within the Motorcycles segment and approximately 100 salaried positions in the Financial Services segment. These headcount reductions began in 2009 and are expected to be completed during 2011. Restructuring Costs and Savings During 2010, the Company incurred $163.5 million in restructuring expense and other impairments related to 2010 and 2009 restructuring plan activities. This is in addition to $224.3 million in restructuring and impairment expense incurred in 2009. The Company expects total costs for 2010 and 2009 restructuring plan activities to result in one time restructuring and impairment expenses of $495 million to $510 million from 2009 through 2012 of which approximately 30% are expected to be non cash. In 2011, the Company expects to incur restructuring expenses of $85 million to $95 million. The Company anticipates annual ongoing total savings from restructuring of approximately $290 million to $310 million upon completion of all announced restructuring activities. In the near term, the Company has realized or estimates that it will realize savings from these restructuring activities, measured against 2008 spending, as follows: 2009 $91 million (91% operating expense and 9% cost of sales); 2010 $172 million (64% operating expense and 36% cost of sales); 2011 $210 million to $230 million (45 55% operating expense and 45 55% cost of sales); 2012 $275 million to $295 million (35 45% operating expense and 55 65% cost of sales); and Ongoing annually upon completion $290 million to $310 million (30 40% operating expense and 60 70% cost of sales). Discontinued Operations On August 6, 2010, the Company concluded the sale of MV Agusta to a company controlled by the former owner of MV Agusta. During 2010, the Company incurred a loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $113.1 million, comprised of operating losses and impairment charges. The loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $125.8 million during 2009. 30 Table of Contents Results of Operations 2010 Compared to 2009 Consolidated Results (in thousands, except earnings per share) 2010 2009 Increase %Change Operating income from motorcycles & related products $ 378,758 $ 314,055 $ 64,703 20.6 % Operating income (loss) from financial services 181,873 (117,969 ) 299,842 N/M Operating income 560,631 196,086 364,545 185.9 Investment income 5,442 4,254 1,188 27.9 Interest expense 90,357 21,680 68,677 316.8 Loss on debt extinguishment 85,247 85,247 N/M Income before income taxes 390,469 178,660 211,809 118.6 Provision for income taxes 130,800 108,019 22,781 21.1 Income from continuing operations 259,669 70,641 189,028 267.6 Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes (113,124 ) (125,757 ) 12,633 10.0 Net income (loss) $ 146,545 $ (55,116 ) $ 201,661 N/M Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations $ 1.11 $ 0.30 $ 0.81 270.0 % Diluted loss per share from discontinued operations $ (0.48 ) $ (0.54 ) $ 0.06 11.1 % Diluted earnings (loss) per share $ 0.62 $ (0.24 ) $ 0.86 N/M Operating income for the Motorcycles segment was $64.7 million higher in 2010 compared to 2009 driven by improved gross profit and a decrease in operating expenses. Operating income for the Financial Services segment improved by $299.8 million primarily due to favorable net interest income, improved credit performance and two non recurring, non cash charges totaling $101.1 million that were incurred during 2009. The favorable net interest income was primarily due to the increase in on balance sheet finance receivables and a lower cost of funds. As discussed below, the lower cost of funds was due in part to HDFS transfer in the fourth quarter of 2009 to the Company of amounts related to the Companys $600.0 million senior unsecured notes issued in February 2009. Please refer to the Motorcycles and Related Products Segment and Financial Services Segment discussions following for a more detailed discussion of the factors affecting operating income. Interest expense for 2010 includes $87.5 million related to the Companys senior unsecured notes, compared to $16.2 million in 2009. During the first quarter of 2009, the Company transferred the full $600.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of the notes to HDFS to fund HDFS operations. As HDFS diversified its debt structure through a combination of actions during 2009, its funding profile improved and allowed HDFS to transfer the full $600.0 million of proceeds back to the Company during the fourth quarter of 2009. As a result, interest expense for 2009 includes interest on the notes only during the periods when the full $600.0 million of proceeds were held by the Company. Interest expense for the periods in which the full $600.0 million of proceeds were held by HDFS is included in financial services interest expense. During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company repurchased $297.0 million of the $600.0 million senior unsecured notes at a price of $380.8 million. As a result of the transaction, the Company incurred a loss on debt extinguishment of $85.2 million which also includes $1.4 million of capitalized debt issuance costs that were written off. The Company used cash on hand for the repurchase and the repurchased notes were cancelled. By repurchasing the notes, the Company will not incur interest expense of approximately $45.0 million per year in 2011 through 2013 and $3.7 million in 2014. The effective income tax rate for 2010 continuing operations was 33.5% compared to 60.5% for 2009. During the first quarter of 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was signed into law. As a result of this Act, reimbursements the Company receives under Medicare Part D coverage for providing retiree prescription drug benefits would no longer be tax free beginning in 2011. At the beginning of second quarter of 31 Table of Contents 2010, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 delayed the impact of this change to 2013. On April 14, 2010, the SEC staff announced that the Office of the Chief Accountant would not object to a view that the two Acts should be considered together for accounting purposes. The Company accounted for both Acts in the first quarter of 2010 and recorded income tax expense of $13.3 million associated with this change. Also impacting the effective income tax rate for 2010 were a favorable impact from a domestic manufacturing benefit and the favorable conclusion of an Internal Revenue Service audit in 2010 and, in connection with the audit settlement, an adjustment to income taxes payable. The effective income tax rate for 2009 was impacted by a $28.4 million non deductible goodwill charge incurred during the second quarter of 2009 as well as an unanticipated change in Wisconsin tax law during the first quarter of 2009 which resulted in the Company establishing a valuation allowance of $22.5 million related to net operating loss carryforwards. Motorcycles and Related Products Segment Harley Davidson Motorcycle Retail Sales Worldwide independent dealer retail sales of Harley Davidson motorcycles decreased 8.5% during 2010 compared to 2009. Retail sales continued to be impacted on a global basis by difficult economic conditions. Retail sales of Harley Davidson motorcycles decreased by 11.7% in the United States and 1.9% internationally during 2010 compared to 2009. On an industry wide basis, the heavyweight (651+cc) portion of the market was down 14.6% in the United States and down 3.9% in Europe when compared to 2009.

During 2010, the Company shipped 210,494 Harley Davidson motorcycles, a decrease of 12,529 motorcycles, or 5.6%, from last year. The Companys 2010 shipment volume was in line with Company expectations and resulted in lower U.S. dealer inventory of new Harley Davidson motorcycles at the end of 2010 compared to the end of 2009. On January 25, 2011, the Company announced that it expects full year 2011 shipments of Harley Davidson motorcycle units to be between 221,000 to 228,000, an increase of 5% to 8% from 2010 shipments.(1) The Company expects that its 2011 shipments of Harley Davidson motorcycles to independent dealers in the U.S. will exceed their retail sales for 2011 as dealers increase their retail inventory levels. The Company believes that stronger than expected fourth quarter 2010 retail sales resulted in the aggregate U.S. dealer inventory dipping below what the Company believes is an appropriate level at the end of 2010.(1) The Company remains committed to balancing supply in line with demand for its Harley Davidson motorcycles. 33 Table of Contents Segment Results The following table includes the condensed statement of operations for the Motorcycles segment (in thousands): 2010 2009 (Decrease)Increase %Change Revenue: Harley Davidson motorcycles $ 3,136,987 $ 3,174,810 $ (37,823 ) (1.2 )% Buell motorcycles 16,280 46,514 (30,234 ) (65.0 ) Parts & Accessories 749,240 767,275 (18,035 ) (2.4 ) General Merchandise 259,125 282,210 (23,085 ) (8.2 ) Other 14,995 16,321 (1,326 ) (8.1 ) Total revenue 4,176,627 4,287,130 (110,503 ) (2.6 ) Cost of goods sold 2,749,224 2,900,934 (151,710 ) (5.2 ) Gross profit 1,427,403 1,386,196 41,207 3.0 Selling & administrative expense 756,177 702,854 53,323 7.6 Engineering expense 128,960 148,311 (19,351 ) (13.0 ) Restructuring expense and other impairments 163,508 220,976 (57,468 ) (26.0 ) Operating expense 1,048,645 1,072,141 (23,496 ) (2.2 ) Operating income from motorcycles $ 378,758 $ 314,055 $ 64,703 20.6 % The following table includes the estimated impact of the significant factors affecting the comparability of net revenue, cost of goods sold and gross profit from 2009 to 2010 (in millions): NetRevenue Cost ofGoods Sold GrossProfit 2009 $ 4,287 $ 2,901 $ 1,386 Volume (282 ) (201 ) (81 ) Foreign currency exchange rates and hedging 17 17 Product mix 126 10 116 Raw material prices 11 (11 ) Manufacturing costs 27 (27 ) Buell exit costs 29 (16 ) 45 Total (110 ) (152 ) 42 2010 $ 4,177 $ 2,749 $ 1,428 Volume decreases were primarily the result of the 5.6% decrease in wholesale shipments of Harley Davidson motorcycle units as well as lower volumes for Parts & Accessories and General Merchandise. Foreign currency exchange rates during 2010 relative to 2009 resulted in a positive impact on net revenue. Gains and losses associated with the revaluation of foreign denominated assets and liabilities and foreign currency hedging (included in cost of goods sold) were unfavorable when compared to the same period last year which offset the positive impact of currency included in net revenue. Product mix benefited revenue and gross profit due to a higher mix of the Companys higher margin touring motorcycles and changes in product mix within the Companys motorcycle families. Product mix changes were also impacted by motorcycle option offerings, shipment location and related products. 34 Table of Contents Raw material prices were higher in 2010 relative to 2009 due to unfavorability in steel and aluminum prices. Manufacturing costs increased partially as the result of a higher fixed cost per unit due to allocating fixed costs across fewer units. Higher manufacturing costs were also the result of increasing product cost associated with new models and increased product content. Finally, manufacturing costs were also higher due to temporary inefficiencies associated with the Companys transition to outsourcing non core operations at its York, Pennsylvania facility. These increased costs were partially offset by productivity gains. In 2009, the Company incurred Buell exit costs consisting of sales incentives to independent dealers and inventory write downs. The sales incentives lowered 2009 revenue while the inventory write downs increased 2009 cost of sales. The increase in selling and administrative expense was primarily due to increased expense associated with the Companys variable incentive compensation programs and increased spending on growth initiatives partially offset by savings from the Companys restructuring efforts and lower warranty and recall charges. During 2010, the Company accrued for a payout of variable incentive compensation programs; no accrual was made during 2009 due to the Companys determination that plan targets would not be met. Increased spending on growth initiatives during 2010 included approximately $19 million of costs associated with the Companys efforts to expand its presence in Brazil. As part of these expansion efforts, Harley Davidson recently reached an agreement with the previous dealer in Brazil that permits the Company to develop a new network of independent dealers as it expands its presence in that market. The decrease in engineering expense was primarily due to savings from the Companys restructuring efforts. The Companys announced restructuring plans are further discussed in Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Financial Services Segment Segment Results The following table includes the condensed statements of operations for the Financial Services segment (in thousands): 2010 2009 Increase(Decrease) %Change Interest income $ 635,207 $ 434,152 $ 201,055 46.3 % Loss from securitizations (13,676 ) 13,676 N/M Other income 47,502 74,303 (26,801 ) (36.1 ) Financial services revenue 682,709 494,779 187,930 38.0 Interest expense 272,484 283,634 (11,150 ) (3.9 ) Provision for credit losses 93,118 169,206 (76,088 ) (45.0 ) Operating expenses 135,234 128,219 7,015 5.5 Goodwill impairment 28,387 (28,387 ) N/M Restructuring expense 3,302 (3,302 ) N/M Financial services expense 500,836 612,748 (111,912 ) (18.3 ) Operating income (loss) from financial services $ 181,873 $ (117,969 ) $ 299,842 N/M On January 1, 2010, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 166, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140 (codified within ASC Topic 860), and SFAS No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (codified in ASC Topic 810). As a result of the adoption of the new accounting guidance, the Company consolidated the assets and 35 Table of Contents liabilities of its formerly unconsolidated Qualifying Special Purpose Entities (QSPEs) on January 1, 2010. Beginning on January 1, 2010, the Company began recognizing interest income and credit losses on the previously unconsolidated securitized receivables and interest expense on the related debt within its statement of operations. The Companys statement of operations no longer includes income from securitizations, including the initial gain or loss previously recorded on off balance sheet securitizations, income on the investment in retained securitization interests and servicer fees. In addition, the Company no longer incurs charges related to other than temporary impairments on its investment in retained securitization interests as that asset has been derecognized. Interest income during 2010 benefited primarily from higher average retail finance receivables, which was driven by the consolidation of formerly off balance sheet QSPEs. Interest expense decreased by $11.2 million compared to 2009 due to more favorable cost of funds, partially offset by increased borrowings related to the newly consolidated securitization trusts. There was no income or loss from securitizations during 2010 due to the elimination of the investment in retained securitization interests. During 2009, HDFS recorded a $45.4 million other than temporary impairment of certain retained securitization interests due to higher actual and anticipated credit losses partially offset by a slowing in actual and expected prepayment speeds. Partially offsetting the other than temporary impairment was $31.7 million of income earned from the investment in the retained securitization interests. Other income decreased during 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to no servicer fee income partially offset by the benefit of no lower of cost or market valuation adjustment for finance receivables held for sale. As a result of the consolidation of the formerly off balance sheet securitization trusts, the Company no longer records servicer fee income from servicing off balance sheet finance receivables. During 2009, the Company earned $25.5 million of servicer fee income. The Company recognized a $5.9 million charge to earnings for a lower of cost or market valuation adjustment related to its finance receivables held for sale during 2009. The charge, which was the result of the determination that the cost exceeded the fair value of the finance receivables held for sale, was due to higher projected credit losses partially offset by lower funding costs. HDFS used discounted cash flow methodologies to estimate the fair value of finance receivables held for sale that incorporated appropriate assumptions for discount rate, funding costs and credit enhancement, as well as estimates concerning credit losses and prepayments that, in managements judgment, reflected assumptions that market participants would use. The provision for credit losses related to retail and wholesale receivables decreased by $68.5 million and $7.9 million, respectively, in 2010 compared to 2009. The decrease in the provision for retail credit losses was primarily driven by the second quarter 2009 reclassification of $3.14 billion of finance receivables held for sale to finance receivables held for investment. The reclassification resulted in a $72.7 million increase in the allowance for finance credit losses during 2009. The provision for wholesale credit losses was $7.9 million lower during 2010 versus 2009 due to a reduction in wholesale finance receivables outstanding from prior year and lower specific reserve needs in 2010 as a number of dealer credit situations were resolved. As part of the January 1, 2010 adoption of the new accounting guidance within ASC Topic 810 and ASC Topic 860, the Company established an initial allowance for credit losses of $49.4 million related to the previously unconsolidated securitized finance receivables through an adjustment to retained earnings. Subsequent changes in the provision are included in the statement of operations. Annual losses on HDFS managed retail motorcycle finance receivables were 2.11% in 2010 compared to 2.86% for 2009. The 30 day delinquency rate for managed retail motorcycle finance receivables at December 31, 2010 decreased to 5.07% from 6.51% at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2010, managed retail finance receivables were comprised of all finance receivables held by HDFS, including those that were consolidated beginning January 1, 2010. Prior to January 1, 2010, managed retail finance receivables included finance receivables held by HDFS and those sold through off balance sheet securitization transactions. The decrease in credit losses from 2009 was due to a lower frequency of loss and a modest improvement in the recovery values of repossessed motorcycles. 36 Table of Contents Changes in the allowance for finance credit losses on finance receivables were as follows (in millions): 2010 2009 Balance, beginning of period $ 150,082 $ 40,068 Allowance related to newly consolidated finance receivables(a) 49,424 Provision for finance credit losses 93,118 169,206 Charge offs, net of recoveries (119,035 ) (59,192 ) Balance, end of period $ 173,589 $ 150,082 (a) As part of the required consolidation of formerly off balance sheet securitization trusts, the Company established a $49.4 million allowance for credit losses related to the newly consolidated finance receivables. At December 31, 2010, the allowance for finance credit losses on finance receivables was $15.8 million for wholesale receivables and $157.8 million for retail receivables, which includes $103.8 million related to finance receivables held by consolidated variable interest entities, (VIEs). See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the Companys VIEs. The allowance for finance credit losses on finance receivables was $133.3 million for retail receivables and $16.8 million for wholesale receivables at December 31, 2009. HDFS periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for finance credit losses on finance receivables is generally based on HDFS past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, current economic conditions and the estimated value of any underlying collateral. Please refer to Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding the Companys allowance for finance credit losses on finance receivables. As discussed in Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $28.4 million during 2009 related to the goodwill associated with HDFS.

Motorcycles operating income fell 67.8% during 2009 driven by a decrease in shipments of Harley Davidson motorcycles and restructuring charges. Financial Services operating loss was driven primarily by increased 37 Table of Contents provision for credit losses and a goodwill impairment. Please refer to the Motorcycles and Related Products Segment and Financial Services Segment discussions following for a more detailed discussion of the factors affecting operating income. Interest expense of $21.7 million included a portion of interest expense related to the Companys $600.0 million senior unsecured notes issued in February 2009. During the first quarter of 2009, the Company transferred the full $600.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of the notes to HDFS to fund HDFS operations. As HDFS diversified its debt structure through a combination of actions during 2009, its funding profile improved and allowed HDFS to transfer the full $600.0 million of proceeds back to the Company during the fourth quarter of 2009. As a result, interest expense for 2009 includes interest on the notes only during the periods when the full $600.0 million of proceeds were held by the Company. Interest expense for the periods in which the full $600.0 million of proceeds were held by HDFS is included in financial services interest expense. The effective income tax rate for 2009 continuing operations was 60.5% compared to 35.8% for 2008. The increase in the effective income tax rate was due to a one time charge for a change in Wisconsin tax law, the nondeductible goodwill impairment charge at HDFS and the impact of reduced earnings. Motorcycles and Related Products Segment Harley Davidson Motorcycle Retail Sales Worldwide independent dealer retail sales of Harley Davidson motorcycles decreased 22.7% during 2009 compared to 2008. Retail sales continued to be impacted on a global basis by difficult economic conditions. Retail sales of Harley Davidson motorcycles decreased by 25.8% in the United States and 15.4% internationally during 2009 compared to 2008. On an industry wide basis, the heavyweight (651+cc) portion of the market was down 36.6% in the United States and down 19.5% in Europe when compared to 2008.

The Companys shipments in 2009 were negatively impacted by the challenging economic environment. 39 Table of Contents Segment Results The following table includes the condensed statement of operations for the Motorcycles segment (in thousands): 2009 2008 (Decrease)Increase %Change Revenue: Harley Davidson motorcycles $ 3,174,810 $ 4,244,587 $ (1,069,777 ) (25.2 )% Buell motorcycles 46,514 123,085 (76,571 ) (62.2) Parts & Accessories 767,275 858,748 (91,473 ) (10.7) General Merchandise 282,210 313,838 (31,628 ) (10.1) Other 16,321 38,156 (21,835 ) (57.2) Total revenue 4,287,130 5,578,414 (1,291,284 ) (23.1) Cost of goods sold 2,900,934 3,647,270 (746,336 ) (20.5) Gross profit 1,386,196 1,931,144 (544,948 ) (28.2) Selling & administrative expense 702,854 774,135 (71,281 ) (9.2) Engineering expense 148,311 168,132 (19,821 ) (11.8) Restructuring expense and other impairments 220,976 12,475 208,501 N/M Operating expense 1,072,141 954,742 117,399 12.3 Operating income from motorcycles $ 314,055 $ 976,402 $ (662,347 ) (67.8 )% The following table includes the estimated impact of the significant factors affecting the comparability of net revenue, cost of goods sold and gross profit from 2008 to 2009 (in millions): NetRevenue Cost ofGoods Sold GrossProfit 2008 $ 5,578 $ 3,647 $ 1,931 Volume (1,276 ) (773 ) (503 ) Price (2 ) (2 ) Foreign currency exchange rates and hedging (51 ) (25 ) (26 ) Product mix 67 54 13 Raw material prices (65 ) 65 Manufacturing costs 47 (47 ) Buell exit costs (29 ) 16 (45 ) Total (1,291 ) (746 ) (545 ) 2009 $ 4,287 $ 2,901 $ 1,386 Volume decreases were primarily the result of the 26.5% decrease in wholesale shipments of Harley Davidson motorcycle units. Foreign currency exchange rates and hedging were affected by a weakening Euro and Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar during 2009. Product mix benefited revenue and gross profit due to a shift towards the Companys higher margin touring motorcycles. Manufacturing costs increased partially as the result of a higher fixed cost per unit due to allocating fixed costs across fewer units. Additionally, higher manufacturing costs were the result of increasing product cost associated with new models and increased product content. These increased costs were partially offset by productivity gains. Buell exit costs consisted of sales incentives to independent dealers and inventory write downs. The sales incentives lowered revenue while the inventory write downs increased cost of sales. 40 Table of Contents The net increase in operating expense was primarily due the Companys previously announced restructuring activities and asset impairments partially offset by cost reduction initiatives. For further information regarding the Companys previously announced restructuring activities and asset impairments, refer to Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Financial Services Segment Segment Results The following table includes the condensed statements of operations for the Financial Services segment (in thousands): 2009 2008 Increase(Decrease) %Change Interest income $ 434,152 $ 290,083 $ 144,069 49.7 % (Loss) income from securitizations (13,676 ) 13,439 (27,115 ) (201.8 ) Other income 74,303 73,448 855 1.2 Financial services revenue 494,779 376,970 117,809 31.3 Interest expense 283,634 136,763 146,871 107.4 Provision for credit losses 169,206 39,555 129,651 327.8 Operating expenses 128,219 117,887 10,332 8.8 Restructuring expense 3,302 3,302 N/M Goodwill impairment 28,387 28,387 N/M Financial services expense 612,748 294,205 318,543 108.3 Operating (loss) income from financial services $ (117,969 ) $ 82,765 $ (200,734 ) (242.5 )% Interest income benefited from higher average retail and wholesale finance receivables outstanding, partially offset by lower wholesale lending rates. The increase in retail finance receivables outstanding was driven by a reduction in off balance sheet term asset backed securitization activity throughout 2008 due to capital market volatility and the utilization of on balance sheet term asset backed securitization structures during 2009. The increase in wholesale outstanding finance receivables resulted from an increased use of floorplan financing combined with a higher number of average days financed. Interest expense was higher in 2009 due primarily to increased borrowings to support the higher average outstanding retail and wholesale finance receivables as well as an increased cost of borrowing as compared to 2008. During 2009, HDFS recorded a loss from securitizations compared to income from securitizations during 2008. The change from 2008 was due to reduced income earned from the investment in retained securitization interests and a larger other than temporary write down of certain retained securitization interests in 2009 compared to 2008. Income earned from the investment in retained securitization interests was $28.5 million lower due to a reduction in outstanding off balance sheet term asset backed securitization transactions. There were no off balance sheet term asset backed securitization transactions completed during 2009 while the Company completed one off balance sheet term asset backed securitization transaction during 2008. For the 2008 off balance sheet term asset backed securitization transaction, the Company recognized a $5.4 million loss. In addition, HDFS recognized a $45.4 million write down of certain retained securitization interests during 2009 due to higher actual and anticipated credit losses partially offset by a slowing in actual and expected prepayment speeds. This compares to an other than temporary impairment of $41.4 million in 2008. HDFS reviewed its assumptions for determining the fair value of the investment in retained securitization interests each quarter. Key assumptions included expected losses, prepayment speed and discount rate. HDFS determined these assumptions by reviewing historical trends and current economic conditions. Given the 41 Table of Contents challenging U.S. economy, credit losses on HDFS retail finance receivables have increased, and as a result, the fair value of retained securitization interests has declined, and in some cases this decline is other than temporary. A write down in the retained securitization interest generally represents a non cash charge in the period in which it is recorded, but ultimately represents a reduction in the residual cash flow that HDFS expects to receive from its investment in retained securitization interests. The fair value of the investment in retained securitization interests was $245.4 million at December 31, 2009. Other income remained relatively flat in 2009 compared to 2008. During 2009, the Company recognized a $5.9 million charge to earnings for the lower of cost or market valuation adjustment of its finance receivables held for sale prior to the reclassification to finance receivables held for investment as discussed below. This compares to a lower of cost or market valuation charge of $37.8 million in 2008. This change was partially offset by a $16.3 million decrease in servicing fee income resulting from fewer outstanding off balance sheet term asset backed securitization transactions and lower insurance commissions in 2009 compared to 2008. The increase in the provision for credit losses during 2009 primarily resulted from the reclassification of $3.14 billion of finance receivables held for sale to finance receivables held for investment at the end of the second quarter of 2009. The reclassification was due to the structure of the Companys May 2009 term asset backed securitization transaction and managements intent to structure subsequent securitization transactions in a manner that would not meet the requirements of accounting sale treatment. The reclassification resulted in an additional provision for credit losses of $72.7 million. In addition, the provisions for credit losses related to retail receivables and wholesale receivables increased by $51.8 million and $2.1 million, respectively, over 2008. The increase was primarily the result of higher expected incidence of loss, lower expected recovery values on repossessed motorcycles, and an increase in the finance receivables held for investment. Annual losses on HDFS managed retail motorcycle finance receivables were 2.86% in 2009 compared to 2.30% for 2008. The 30 day delinquency rate for managed retail motorcycle finance receivables at December 31, 2009 increased to 6.51% from 6.29% at December 31, 2008. Managed retail finance receivables included finance receivables held by HDFS as well as those sold through off balance sheet term asset backed securitization transactions. The year over year increase in credit losses was driven by a higher frequency of loss and higher average loss per motorcycle resulting from pressure on values for repossessed motorcycles. Changes in the allowance for finance credit losses on finance receivables held for investment were as follows (in millions): 2009 2008 Balance, beginning of period $ 40,068 $ 30,295 Provision for finance credit losses 169,206 39,555 Charge offs, net of recoveries (59,192 ) (29,782 ) Balance, end of period $ 150,082 $ 40,068 At December 31, 2009, the allowance for finance credit losses on finance receivables held for investment was $133.3 million for retail finance receivables and $16.8 million for wholesale finance receivables. The allowance for finance credit losses on finance receivables held for investment was $28.4 million for retail finance receivables and $11.7 million for wholesale finance receivables at December 31, 2008. HDFS periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for finance credit losses on finance receivables held for investment is generally based on HDFS past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, current economic conditions and the estimated value of any underlying collateral. Operating expenses were also impacted by a restructuring charge of $3.3 million in 2009 as detailed in Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 42 Table of Contents As discussed in Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, during 2009, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $28.4 million related to the goodwill associated with HDFS. As a result of the Companys lower retail sales volume projections and the decline in operating performance at HDFS during 2009 due to significant write downs of its finance receivable portfolio and investment in retained securitization interests, the Company performed an impairment test of the goodwill balance associated with HDFS as of June 28, 2009. The results of the impairment test indicated the current fair value of HDFS had declined below its carrying value. Other Matters Critical Accounting Estimates The Companys financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies, which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions. Management believes that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of accounting policies that currently affect the Companys financial condition and results of operations. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Goodwill The Company reviews its goodwill for impairment, based on financial data related to the reporting unit to which it has been assigned, at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit associated with the goodwill to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill must be adjusted to its implied fair value. In determining the fair value of a reporting unit, the Company utilizes widely accepted techniques such as discounted cash flow methodologies which require the Company to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate macro economic factors, industry economic factors and the future profitability of current business strategies. Changes in these factors can have a significant impact on the impairment evaluation. Asset Groups to Be Disposed of by Sale Asset groups (assets and liabilities to be disposed of together as a group in a single transaction) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell and a loss should be recognized for any initial adjustment required to reduce the carrying amount to the fair value less cost to sell in the period the held for sale criteria are met. The fair value less cost to sell must be assessed each reporting period the asset group remains classified as held for sale. Gains or losses not previously recognized resulting from the sale of an asset group will be recognized on the date of sale. In determining the fair value of an asset group representing a business, the Company utilizes widely accepted techniques such as discounted cash flow methodologies which require the Company to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate macro economic factors, industry economic factors and the future profitability of current business strategies. Changes in these factors can have a significant impact on the impairment evaluation. In addition, the determination of fair value for an asset group held for sale may be influenced by information received from market participants (interested buyers) having appropriate knowledge of the asset group. The appropriate level of knowledge may not be obtainable solely from public observations, but could be obtained in the course of a normal due diligence process. Off Balance Sheet Finance Receivable Securitizations Prior to 2009, the Company sold retail motorcycle finance receivables through securitization transactions utilizing QSPEs that qualified for accounting sale treatment under prior U.S. GAAP. Upon sale of retail finance receivables in a securitization transaction, HDFS received cash and retained an interest in excess cash flows, subordinated securities, and cash reserve account deposits, all of which were collectively referred to as retained interests in the securitized receivables. Retained interests were carried at fair value and were periodically reviewed for impairment. Market value quotes of fair value are generally not available for retained interests. Therefore, fair value was measured using discounted cash flow methodologies that incorporated managements best estimate of key assumptions that, in managements 43 Table of Contents judgment, reflected the assumptions marketplace participants would use. The impact of changes to key assumptions is shown in Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. HDFS retained servicing rights under retail finance receivables that it sold to the securitization trust and received a servicing fee. The servicing fee paid to HDFS was considered adequate compensation for the services provided and was included in financial services revenue as earned. As discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company adopted new accounting guidance within ASC topic 810 and ASC topic 860 as of January 1, 2010 that ultimately required the Company to consolidate these formerly off balance sheet QSPEs. Gains or losses on securitizations from the sale of retail finance receivables were recorded as a component of financial services revenue and were based in part on certain assumptions including expected credit losses, prepayment speed and discount rates. Gains or losses on sales of retail finance receivables also depended on the original carrying amount of the retail finance receivables, which were allocated between the assets sold and the retained interests based on their relative fair value at the date of transfer. Valuation of Finance Receivables Held for Sale Finance receivables held for sale in the aggregate were carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value. HDFS used discounted cash flow methodologies to estimate the fair value of finance receivables held for sale that incorporated appropriate assumptions for discount rate, funding costs and credit enhancement, as well as estimates concerning credit losses and prepayments that, in managements judgment, reflected assumptions marketplace participants would use. Any amount by which cost exceeded fair value was accounted for as a valuation adjustment with an offset to other income. Allowance for Finance Credit Losses on Finance Receivables The allowance for uncollectible accounts is maintained at a level management believes is adequate to cover the losses of principal in the existing finance receivables portfolio. HDFS performs a periodic and systematic collective evaluation of the adequacy of the retail allowance. HDFS utilizes loss forecast models which consider a variety of factors including, but not limited to, historical loss trends, origination or vintage analysis, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, the value of the underlying collateral, recovery rates and current economic conditions including items such as unemployment rates. The wholesale portfolio is primarily composed of large balance, non homogeneous finance receivables. HDFS wholesale allowance evaluation is first based on a loan by loan review. A specific allowance is established for wholesale finance receivables determined to be individually impaired when management concludes that the borrower will not be able to make full payment of contractual amounts due based on the original terms of the loan agreement. The impairment is determined based on the cash that the Company expects to receive discounted at the loans original interest rate or the fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral dependent. In establishing the allowance, management considers a number of factors including the specific borrowers financial performance as well as ability to repay. Finance receivables in the wholesale portfolio that are not considered impaired on an individual basis are segregated, based on similar risk characteristics, according to the Companys internal risk rating system and collectively evaluated for impairment. The related allowance is based on factors such as the Companys past loan loss experience, current economic conditions as well as the value of the underlying collateral. Product Warranty Estimated warranty costs are reserved for each motorcycle at the time of sale. The warranty reserve is an estimated cost per unit sold based upon historical Company claim data used in combination with other known factors that may affect future warranty claims. The Company updates its warranty estimates quarterly to ensure that the warranty reserves are based on the most current information available. The Company believes that past claim experience is indicative of future claims; however, the factors affecting actual claims can be volatile. As a result, actual claims experience may differ from estimated which could lead to material changes in the Companys warranty provision and related reserves. The Companys warranty liability is discussed further in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 44 Table of Contents Pensions and Other Postretirement Healthcare Benefits The Company has several defined benefit pension plans and several postretirement healthcare benefit plans, which cover substantially all employees of the Motorcycles segment. The Company also has unfunded supplemental employee retirement plan agreements (SERPA) with certain employees which were instituted to replace benefits lost under the Tax Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993. Pension, SERPA and postretirement healthcare obligations and costs are calculated through actuarial valuations. The valuation of benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs relies on key assumptions including discount rates, long term expected return on plan assets, future compensation and healthcare cost trend rates. The Company determines its discount rate assumptions by referencing high quality long term bond rates that are matched to the duration of its own benefit obligations. Based on this analysis, the discount rate for pension and SERPA obligations was decreased from 6.0% as of December 31, 2009 to 5.79% as of December 31, 2010. The discount rate for postretirement healthcare obligations was decreased from 5.65% to 5.28%. The Company determines its healthcare trend assumption for the postretirement healthcare obligation by considering factors such as estimated healthcare inflation, the utilization of healthcare benefits and changes in the health of plan participants. Based on the Companys assessment of this data as of December 31, 2010, the Company increased its healthcare cost trend rate to 8.5% from 7.5% as of December 31, 2009. The Company expects the healthcare cost trend rate to reach its ultimate rate of 5% beginning in 2019.(1) These assumption changes were reflected immediately in the benefit obligation and will be amortized into net periodic benefit costs over future periods. The following information is provided to illustrate the sensitivity of pension and postretirement healthcare obligations and costs to changes in these major assumptions (in thousands): Amounts basedon currentassumptions Impact of a 1%decrease in thediscount rate Impact of a 1%increase in thehealthcare costtrend rate 2010 Net periodic benefit costs Pension and SERPA $ 71,945 $ 21,474 n/a Postretirement healthcare $ 39,073 $ 2,289 $ 1,296 2010 Benefit obligations Pension and SERPA $ 1,390,374 $ 216,223 n/a Postretirement healthcare $ 378,341 $ 35,368 $ 15,100 This information should not be viewed as predictive of future amounts. The calculation of pension, SERPA and postretirement healthcare obligations and costs is based on many factors in addition to those discussed here. This information should be considered in combination with the information provided in Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Stock Compensation Costs The total cost of the Companys share based awards is equal to the grant date fair value per award multiplied by the number of awards granted (adjusted for forfeitures). This cost is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the service periods of the awards. Forfeitures are initially estimated based on historical Company information and subsequently updated over the life of the awards to ultimately reflect actual forfeitures. As a result, changes in forfeiture activity can influence the amount of stock compensation cost recognized from period to period. The Company estimates the fair value of option awards as of the grant date using a lattice based option valuation model which utilizes ranges of assumptions over the expected term of the options, including stock price volatility, dividend yield and risk free interest rate. The valuation model uses historical data to estimate option exercise behavior and employee terminations. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. 45 Table of Contents The Company uses a weighted average of historical and implied volatility to determine the expected volatility of its stock. The implied volatility is derived from options that are actively traded and the market prices of both the traded options and underlying shares are measured at a similar point in time to each other and on a date reasonably close to the grant date of the employee stock options. In addition, the traded options have exercise prices that are both (a) near the money and (b) close to the exercise price of the employee stock options. Finally, the remaining maturities of the traded options on which the estimate is based are at least one year. Dividend yield was based on the Companys expected dividend payments and the risk free rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Changes in the valuation assumptions could result in a significant change to the cost of an individual option. However, the total cost of an award is also a function of the number of awards granted, and as result, the Company has the ability to control the cost of its equity awards by adjusting the number of awards granted. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and other loss carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the Companys worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related deferred tax assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of the Companys business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Accruals for unrecognized tax benefits are provided for in accordance with the requirements of ASC Topic 740. An unrecognized tax benefit represents the difference between the recognition of benefits related to exposure items for income tax reporting purposes and financial reporting purposes. The unrecognized tax benefit is included within other long term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company has a reserve for interest and penalties on exposure items, if applicable, which is recorded as a component of the overall income tax provision. The Company is regularly under audit by tax authorities. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, management believes that it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns and that its annual tax provision includes amounts sufficient to pay any assessments. Nonetheless, the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year. Contractual Obligations A summary of the Companys expected payments for significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010 is as follows (in thousands): 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total Principal payments on debt $ 1,484,264 $ 2,146,577 $ 1,084,849 $ 1,036,665 $ 5,752,355 Interest payments on debt 245,554 366,236 175,766 167,381 954,937 Operating lease payments 11,399 16,089 10,877 8,414 46,779 $ 1,741,217 $ 2,528,902 $ 1,271,492 $ 1,212,460 $ 6,754,071 As described in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company classified $315.9 million related to its unsecured commercial paper and its Global Credit Facilities (as defined in Liquidity and Capital Resources) as long term debt as of December 31, 2010. This amount is classified as long term because it is supported by the Global Credit Facilities and is expected to remain outstanding for an uninterrupted period extending beyond one year; accordingly, the Company has assumed that this amount will be repaid in 2012. 46 Table of Contents Interest obligations include the impact of interest rate hedges outstanding as of December 31, 2010. Interest for floating rate instruments, as calculated above, assumes December 31, 2010 rates remain constant. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had no material purchase obligations other than those created in the ordinary course of business related to inventory and property, plant and equipment which generally have terms of less than 90 days. The Company has long term obligations related to its pension, SERPA and postretirement healthcare plans at December 31, 2010. During 2009, the Company contributed $233.2 million to its pension, SERPA and postretirement healthcare plans. No additional contributions were required during 2010 beyond current benefit payments for SERPA and postretirement healthcare plans. In January 2011, the Company contributed $200.0 million to further fund its pension plans. The Company will evaluate additional contributions to further fund its pension plans even though no additional pension plan contributions are required in 2011. The Company expects it will continue to make on going contributions related to current benefit payments for SERPA and postretirement healthcare plans. The Companys expected future contributions to these plans are provided in Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As described in Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has unrecognized tax benefits of $69.8 million and accrued interest and penalties of $26.2 million as of December 31, 2010. However, the Company cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate for the period of cash settlement for either the $69.8 million of liability for unrecognized tax benefits or accrued interest and penalties of $26.2 million. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of its term asset backed securitization program prior to 2009, HDFS transferred retail motorcycle finance receivables to a special purpose bankruptcy remote wholly owned subsidiary. The subsidiary sold the retail finance receivables to a securitization trust in exchange for the proceeds from term asset backed securities issued by the securitization trust. The term asset backed securities, usually notes with various maturities and interest rates, were secured by future collections of the purchased retail installment finance receivables. Activities of the securitization trust were limited to acquiring retail finance receivables, issuing term asset backed securities and making payments on securities to investors. Due to the nature of the assets held by the securitization trust and the limited nature of its activities, the securitization trusts were considered QSPEs as defined under prior U.S. GAAP. In accordance with prior U.S. GAAP, assets and liabilities of the QSPEs were not consolidated in the financial statements of the Company (see update below). HDFS did not guarantee payments on the securities issued by the securitization trusts or the projected cash flows from the related finance receivables purchased from HDFS. The Companys retained securitization interests, excluding servicing rights, were subordinate to the interests of securitization trust investors. Such investors had priority interests in the cash collections on the retail finance receivables sold to the securitization trust (after payment of servicing fees) and in the cash reserve account deposits. Investors do not have recourse to assets of HDFS for failure of the obligors on the retail finance receivables to pay when due. Total investment in retained securitization interests at December 31, 2009 was $245.4 million. The securitization trusts have a limited life and generally terminate upon final distribution of amounts owed to the investors in the term asset backed securities. See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of HDFS term asset backed securitization program. As discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company was required to adopt new guidance within ASC Topics 810 and 860 as of January 1, 2010 requiring the consolidation of qualifying special purpose entities previously utilized for its off balance sheet term asset backed securitization transactions. 47 Table of Contents Commitments and Contingencies The Company is subject to lawsuits and other claims related to environmental, product and other matters. In determining required reserves related to these items, the Company carefully analyzes cases and considers the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes, as well as the potential range of possible loss. The required reserves are monitored on an ongoing basis and are updated based on new developments or new information in each matter. Environmental Protection Agency Notice The Company has received formal, written requests for information from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regarding: (i) certificates of conformity for motorcycle emissions and related designations and labels, (ii) aftermarket parts, and (iii) warranty claims on emissions related components. The Company has submitted written responses to the EPAs inquiry and has engaged in discussions with the EPA. It is possible that a result of the EPAs investigation will be some form of enforcement action by the EPA that will seek a fine or other relief. However, at this time the Company does not know and cannot reasonably estimate the impact of any remedies the EPA might seek. Shareholder Lawsuits: In re Harley Davidson, Inc. Securities Litigation was a consolidated shareholder securities class action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. On October 8, 2009, the judge granted defendants motion to dismiss, and the clerk of court entered judgment dismissing the consolidated lawsuit. No appeal was taken from the final judgment and the dismissal of the case became final. Subsequently, on March 18, 2010, a group of individuals who appear to be inmates in a federal correctional institution filed a motion to intervene which was immediately dismissed by the District Court because judgment had already been entered. On April 5, 2010, two of the individuals filed notices of appeal of the dismissal. On May 27, 2010, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit dismissed the appeals for failure to pay the required docketing fees. The dismissal of the action again became final. In 2005, three shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, and two shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed in Milwaukee County Circuit Court on July 22, 2005 and November 16, 2005, against some or all of the following current or former directors and officers of the Company: Jeffrey L. Bleustein, James L. Ziemer, James M. Brostowitz, Barry K. Allen, Richard I. Beattie, George H. Conrades, Judson C. Green, Donald A. James, Sara L. Levinson, George L. Miles, Jr., James A. Norling, James A. McCaslin, Donna F. Zarcone, Jon R. Flickinger, Gail A. Lione, Ronald M. Hutchinson, W. Kenneth Sutton, Jr. and John A. Hevey. On November 24, 2009, all federal court derivative plaintiffs moved to voluntarily dismiss their lawsuits and all claims without prejudice. On November 30, 2009, the federal court entered orders granting the motions and dismissing the federal court derivative lawsuits without prejudice. The remaining state court shareholder state derivative action (which was a consolidation of the two lawsuits filed in Milwaukee County Circuit Court) was dismissed in a hearing on November 29, 2010, and the dismissal became final on January 24, 2011. York Environmental Matters: The Company is involved with government agencies and groups of potentially responsible parties in various environmental matters, including a matter involving the cleanup of soil and groundwater contamination at its York, Pennsylvania facility. The York facility was formerly used by the U.S. Navy and AMF prior to the purchase of the York facility by the Company from AMF in 1981. Although the Company is not certain as to the full extent of the environmental contamination at the York facility, it has been working with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) since 1986 in undertaking environmental investigation and remediation activities, including an ongoing site wide remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS). In January 1995, the Company entered into a settlement agreement (the Agreement) with the Navy. The Agreement calls for 48 Table of Contents the Navy and the Company to contribute amounts into a trust equal to 53% and 47%, respectively, of future costs associated with environmental investigation and remediation activities at the York facility (Response Costs). The trust administers the payment of the Response Costs incurred at the York facility as covered by the Agreement. In February 2002, the Company was advised by the EPA that it considers some of the Companys remediation activities at the York facility to be subject to the EPAs corrective action program under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and offered the Company the option of addressing corrective action under a RCRA facility lead agreement. In July 2005, the York facility was designated as the first site in Pennsylvania to be addressed under the One Cleanup Program. The program provides a more streamlined and efficient oversight of voluntary remediation by both PADEP and EPA and will be carried out consistent with the Agreement with the Navy. As a result, the RCRA facility lead agreement has been superseded. Although the RI/FS is still underway and substantial uncertainty exists concerning the nature and scope of the additional environmental investigation and remediation that will ultimately be required at the York facility, the Company estimates that its share of the future Response Costs at the York facility will be approximately $5.9 million. The Company has established reserves for this amount, which are included in accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The estimate of the Companys future Response Costs that will be incurred at the York facility is based on reports of independent environmental consultants retained by the Company, the actual costs incurred to date and the estimated costs to complete the necessary investigation and remediation activities. Response Costs related to the remediation of soil are expected to be incurred over a period of several years ending in 2015. Response Costs related to ground water remediation may continue for some time beyond 2015. Product Liability Matters: Additionally, the Company is involved in product liability suits related to the operation of its business. The Company accrues for claim exposures that are probable of occurrence and can be reasonably estimated. The Company also maintains insurance coverage for product liability exposures. The Company believes that its accruals and insurance coverage are adequate and that product liability will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources as of December 31, 2010 Over the long term, the Company expects that its business model will continue to generate cash that will allow it to invest in the business, fund future growth opportunities and return value to shareholders.(1) The Company believes the Motorcycles operations will continue to be primarily funded through cash flows generated by operations. The Companys Financial Services operations have been funded with unsecured debt, unsecured commercial paper, an asset backed commercial paper conduit facility, committed unsecured bank facilities and through the term asset backed securitization market. 49 Table of Contents The Companys strategy is to maintain a minimum of twelve months of its projected liquidity needs through a combination of cash and marketable securities and availability under credit facilities. The following table summarizes the Companys cash and marketable securities and availability under credit facilities as of December 31, 2010 (in thousands): Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,021,933 Marketable securities 140,118 Total cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 1,162,051 Global credit facilities(a) 553,656 Asset backed conduit facility(b) 600,000 Total availability under credit facilities 1,153,656 Total $ 2,315,707 (a) $675.0 million of the Companys total credit facilities is set to expire in April, 2011. (b) The conduit facility is set to expire in September, 2011. Although the Company believes it has obtained the funding necessary to support HDFS operations for 2011(1), the Company recognizes that it must continue to adjust its business to changes in the lending environment. The Company intends to continue with a diversified funding profile through a combination of short term and long term funding vehicles and to pursue a variety of sources to obtain cost effective funding. The Financial Services operations could be negatively affected by higher costs of funding and the increased difficulty of raising, or potential unsuccessful efforts to raise, funding in the short term and long term capital markets.(1) These negative consequences could in turn adversely affect the Companys business and results of operations in various ways, including through higher costs of capital, reduced funds available through its Financial Services operations to provide loans to independent dealers and their retail customers, and dilution to existing shareholders through the use of alternative sources of capital. The Company has long term obligations related to its pension, SERPA and postretirement healthcare plans at December 31, 2010. During 2009, the Company contributed $233.2 million to its pension, SERPA and postretirement healthcare plans. No additional contributions were required during 2010 beyond current benefit payments for SERPA and postretirement healthcare plans. In January 2011, the Company contributed $200.0 million to further fund its pension plans. The Company will evaluate additional contributions to further fund its pension plans even though no additional pension plan contributions are required in 2011. The Company expects it will continue to make on going contributions related to current benefit payments for SERPA and postretirement healthcare plans. The Companys expected future contributions to these plans are provided in Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash Flow Activity The following table summarizes the cash flow activity of continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 (in thousands): 2010 2009 2008 Net cash provided by (used by) operating activities $ 1,163,418 $ 609,010 $ (608,029 ) Net cash provided by (used by) investing activities 145,437 (863,487 ) (294,875 ) Net cash (used by) provided by financing activities (1,856,090 ) 1,381,937 1,293,390 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 4,940 6,789 (20,352 ) Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents of continuing operations $ (542,295 ) $ 1,134,249 $ 370,134 50 Table of Contents Operating Activities The increase in operating cash flow for 2010 compared to 2009 was due primarily to the classification of the Companys retail lending activities and favorable movements in working capital. U.S. retail motorcycle finance receivables originated prior to June 28, 2009 were classified as held for sale based on the Companys intent to securitize these U.S. retail motorcycle finance receivables in off balance sheet securitization transactions under prior U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, the origination and collection of these retail finance receivables were components of operating cash flows. The Company has not conducted an off balance sheet securitization since the first quarter of 2008. At the end of the second quarter of 2009, the Company made a decision to structure subsequent securitization transactions in a manner that would require on balance sheet accounting (i.e., the Company no longer had intent to sell at the date of origination). As a result of that decision, the cash flows related to post June 2009 retail lending activity are included within the investing cash flow section of the statement of cash flows. Investing Activities The Companys investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures, net changes in finance receivables and short term investment activity. Capital expenditures were $170.8 million and $116.7 million during 2010 and 2009, respectively. Net changes in finance receivables held for investment in 2010 reflect the incremental cash flows from finance receivables held by securitization trusts that were not consolidated prior to January 1, 2010. The effects of consolidating formerly off balance sheet QSPEs are discussed further in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Financing Activities The Companys financing activities consist primarily of debt activity, dividend payments and share repurchases. As of December 31, 2010, there were 16.7 million shares remaining on a board approved share repurchase authorization. An additional board approved share repurchase authorization is in place to offset option exercises. The Company paid dividends of $0.40 per share totaling $94.1 million and $93.8 million during 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Companys total outstanding debt consisted of the following as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 (in thousands): 2010 2009 2008 Global credit facilities $ 213,772 $ 448,049 $ 390,932 Unsecured commercial paper 582,572 325,099 1,416,449 Medium term notes 1,897,778 2,103,396 1,607,506 Senior unsecured notes 303,000 600,000 2,997,122 3,476,544 3,414,887 Asset backed conduit facility 500,000 Term asset backed securitization debt 2,755,234 2,159,585 Debt held by variable interest entities 2,755,234 2,159,585 500,000 Total debt $ 5,752,356 $ 5,636,129 $ 3,914,887 In order to access the debt capital markets, the Company relies on credit rating agencies to assign short term and long term credit ratings. Generally, lower credit ratings result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to debt capital markets. A credit rating agency may change or withdraw the Companys ratings based on its 51 Table of Contents assessment of the Companys current and future ability to meet interest and principal repayment obligations. The Companys short term debt ratings affect its ability to issue unsecured commercial paper. The Companys short and long term debt ratings as of December 31, 2010 were as follows: Short Term Long Term Outlook Moodys P2 Baa1 Negative Standard & Poors A2 BBB Stable Fitch F2 BBB+ Stable Global Credit Facilities On April 29, 2010, the Company and HDFS entered into a new $675.0 million 364 day credit facility (2010 364 Day Credit Facility) to refinance and replace a $625.0 million 364 day credit facility, which matured in April 2010. The 2010 364 Day Credit Facility matures in April 2011. In connection with the 2010 364 Day Credit Facility, the Company and HDFS also entered into a new $675.0 million three year credit facility agreement to refinance and replace a $950.0 million three year credit facility agreement, which was set to mature in July 2011. The new three year credit facility matures in April 2013. The 2010 364 Day Credit Facility and the new three year credit facility agreement (together, the Global Credit Facilities) bear interest at variable interest rates, which may be adjusted upward or downward depending on certain criteria, such as credit ratings. The Global Credit Facilities also require the Company to pay a fee based upon the average daily unused portion of the aggregate commitments under the Global Credit Facilities. The Global Credit Facilities are committed facilities and primarily used to support HDFS unsecured commercial paper program. At the end of 2009, the Company had $205.0 million of credit facilities debt related to the MV acquisition and subsequent working capital advances. In conjunction with the sale of MV, the Company repaid all outstanding credit facility debt associated with MV. Unsecured Commercial Paper Subject to limitations, HDFS could issue unsecured commercial paper of up to $1.35 billion as of December 31, 2010. Outstanding unsecured commercial paper may not exceed the unused portion of the Global Credit Facilities. Maturities may range up to 365 days from the issuance date. HDFS intends to finance the repayment of unsecured commercial paper as it matures by issuing additional unsecured commercial paper or through other means, such as borrowing under the Global Credit Facilities, borrowing under its asset backed commercial paper conduit facility and term asset backed securitizations.(1) Medium Term Notes The Company has the following medium term notes (collectively, the Notes) issued and outstanding at December 31, 2010 (in thousands): Principal Amount Rate Issue Date Maturity Date $ 400,000 5.25 % December 2007 December 2012 $ 500,000 5.75 % November 2009 December 2014 $1,000,000 6.80 % May 2008 June 2018 The Notes provide for semi annual interest payments and principal due at maturity. At December 31, 2009, HDFS had $200.0 million of 5.00% medium term notes outstanding which were due in December 2010. In December 2010, the notes matured and the principal and accrued interest were paid in full. As a result, the Notes no longer include a fair value adjustment as the interest rate swaps were related to that particular medium term note. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Notes included a fair value adjustment increasing the balance by $6.1 million and $9.7 million, respectively, due to interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges. The effect of the interest rate swap agreements is to convert the interest rate on a portion of the Notes from a fixed to a floating rate, which is based on 3 month LIBOR. Unamortized discounts on the Notes reduced the balance by $2.2 million, $2.7 million and $2.2 million at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Senior Unsecured Notes In February 2009, the Company issued $600.0 million of senior unsecured notes in an underwritten offering. The senior unsecured notes mature in February 2014 and have an annual interest rate 52 Table of Contents of 15%. The senior unsecured notes provide for semi annual interest payments and principal due at maturity. During the first quarter of 2009, the Company transferred the full $600.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of the notes to HDFS to fund HDFS operations. As HDFS diversified its debt structure through a combination of actions during 2009, its funding profile improved and allowed HDFS to transfer the full $600.0 million of proceeds back to the Company during the fourth quarter of 2009. During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company repurchased $297.0 million of the $600.0 million senior unsecured notes at a price of $380.8 million. As a result of the transaction, the Company incurred a loss on debt extinguishment of $85.2 million which also includes $1.4 million of capitalized debt issuance costs that were written off. The Company used cash on hand for the repurchase and the repurchased notes were cancelled. By repurchasing the notes, the Company will not incur interest expense of approximately $45.0 million per year in 2011 through 2013 and $3.7 million in 2014. Asset Backed Commercial Paper Conduit Facility On September 10, 2010, the Company amended and restated its revolving asset backed conduit facility which provides for a total aggregate commitment of $600.0 million. At December 31, 2010, HDFS had no outstanding borrowings under the conduit facility. This debt provides for interest on outstanding principal based on prevailing commercial paper rates, or LIBOR plus a specified margin to the extent the advance is not funded by a conduit lender through the issuance of commercial paper. The conduit facility also provides for an unused commitment fee based on the unused portion of the total aggregate commitment of $600.0 million. There is no amortization schedule; however, the debt is reduced monthly as available collections on the related finance receivable collateral are applied to outstanding principal. Upon expiration of the conduit facility, any outstanding principal will continue to be reduced monthly through available collections. Unless earlier terminated or extended by mutual agreement of HDFS and the lenders, as of December 31, 2010, the conduit facility expires on September 9, 2011. Term Asset Backed Securitization Debt On January 1, 2010, the Company adopted new guidance within ASC Topics 810 and 860 for consolidating VIEs. As a result, the Company consolidated the securitized U.S. retail motorcycle finance receivables, resulting in secured borrowings, and other related assets and liabilities related to the formerly unconsolidated QSPEs in the Companys consolidated financial statements. The consolidation of the secured notes related to these VIEs resulted in a $1.89 billion increase in securitization debt on January 1, 2010, the effective date of adoption. During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company issued $600.0 million of secured notes through a term asset backed securitization transaction. During 2009, the Company issued $2.46 billion of secured notes through four separate term asset backed securitization transactions that were consolidated in the Companys financial statements due to the structure of those transactions at the time of issuance. For all of the term asset backed securitization transactions, the Company transferred U.S. retail motorcycle finance receivables to separate VIEs, which in turn issued secured notes, with various maturities and interest rates to investors. All of the notes held by VIEs are secured by future collections of the purchased U.S. retail motorcycle finance receivables. The U.S. retail motorcycle finance receivables included in the term asset backed securitization transactions are not available to pay other obligations or claims of the Companys creditors until the associated debt and other obligations are satisfied. Cash and cash equivalent balances held by the VIEs are used only to support the securitizations. There is no amortization schedule for the secured notes; however, the debt is reduced monthly as available collections on the related U.S. retail motorcycle finance receivables are applied to outstanding principal. The secured notes contractual lives have various maturities ranging from 2011 to 2018. As of December 31, 2010, the assets of the VIEs totaled $3.65 billion, of which $3.36 billion of finance receivables and $287.3 of cash were restricted as collateral for the payment of $2.76 billion secured notes. Approximately $751.3 million of the obligations under the secured notes were classified as current at December 31, 2010, based on the contractual maturities of the restricted finance receivables. 53 Table of Contents Intercompany Borrowing HDFS has a revolving credit line with the Company whereby HDFS may borrow up to $210.0 million from the Company at a market interest rate. As of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, HDFS had no outstanding borrowings owed to the Company under this agreement. The Company has a support agreement with HDFS whereby, if required, the Company agrees to provide HDFS with financial support in order to maintain HDFS fixed charge coverage at 1.25 and minimum net worth of $40.0 million. Support may be provided at the Companys option as capital contributions or loans. Accordingly, certain debt covenants may restrict the Companys ability to withdraw funds from HDFS outside the normal course of business. No amount has ever been provided to HDFS under the support agreement. Operating and Financial Covenants HDFS and the Company are subject to various operating and financial covenants related to the Global Credit Facilities and the asset backed commercial paper conduit facility and various operating covenants under the Notes. The more significant covenants are described below. The covenants limit the Companys and HDFS ability to: incur certain additional indebtedness; assume or incur certain liens; participate in a merger, consolidation, liquidation or dissolution; and purchase or hold margin stock. Under the financial covenants of the Global Credit Facilities and the asset backed commercial paper conduit facility, the debt to equity ratio of HDFS and its consolidated subsidiaries cannot exceed 10.0 to 1.0 and HDFS must maintain a consolidated tangible net worth of not less than $500.0 million. In addition, the Company must maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.25 to 1.0 for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2010 and 2.5 to 1.0 for each fiscal quarter thereafter. No financial covenants are required under the Notes or the Companys senior unsecured notes. At December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, HDFS and the Company remained in compliance with all of the existing covenants.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. To reduce such risks, the Company selectively uses derivative financial instruments. All hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to regularly reviewed policies and procedures, which prohibit the use of financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. Sensitivity analysis is used to manage and monitor foreign exchange and interest rate risk. The Company sells its products internationally and in most markets those sales are made in the foreign countrys local currency. As a result, the Companys earnings can be affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currency. The Companys most significant foreign currency risk relates to the Euro, the Australian dollar and the Japanese yen. The Company utilizes foreign currency contracts to mitigate the effect of the Euro, the Australian dollar and the Japanese yen fluctuations on earnings. The foreign currency contracts are entered into with banks and allow the Company to exchange a specified amount of foreign currency for U.S. dollars at a future date, based on a fixed exchange rate. At December 31, 2010, the notional U.S. dollar value of outstanding Euro, Australian dollar and Japanese yen foreign currency contracts was $270.9 million. The Company estimates that a uniform 10% weakening in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies underlying these contracts would result in a decrease in the fair value of the contracts of approximately $30.8 million as of December 31, 2010. Further disclosure relating to the fair value of derivative financial instruments is included in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Companys earnings are affected by changes in interest rates. HDFS utilizes interest rate swaps to reduce the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on its debt and securitization transactions. HDFS also entered into derivative contracts to facilitate its first quarter 2008 securitization. These derivatives, which hedge assets held by a VIE, do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in current period earnings within other income. As of December 31, 2010, HDFS had interest rate swaps outstanding with a notional value of $173.2 million. HDFS estimates that a 10% decrease in interest rates would result in a $0.5 million decrease in the fair value of the agreements. 56 Table of Contents
