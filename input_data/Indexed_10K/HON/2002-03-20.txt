ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net sales in 2001 were $23,652 million, a decrease of $1,371 million, or 5 percent compared with 2000. Net sales in 2000 were $25,023 million, an increase of $1,288 million, or 5 percent compared with 1999. The change in net sales in 2001 and 2000 is attributable to the following: 2001 2000 VERSUS VERSUS 2000 1999 Acquisitions................................................ 1 % 9% Divestitures................................................ (2) (3) Foreign Exchange............................................ (1) (2) Price/Volume................................................ (3) 1 (5)% 5% Cost of goods sold of $20,429, $19,090 and $18,495 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, included merger, repositioning and other charges of $2,438, $830 and $947 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in Note 5 of Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion of the merger, repositioning and other charges. Excluding these charges, cost of goods sold was $17,991, $18,260 and $17,548 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Excluding merger, repositioning and other charges, cost of goods sold as a percent of sales was 76.1, 73.0 and 73.9 percent in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase in cost of goods sold as a percent of sales in 2001 compared with 2000 principally reflected significantly lower sales in our Specialty Materials segment and lower sales of higher margin aftermarket products and services in our Aerospace segment. This increase was partially offset by lower costs due to headcount reductions. The decrease in cost of goods sold as a percent of sales in 2000 compared with 1999 related principally to lower costs due to headcount reductions and increased sales of higher margin aftermarket products and services in our Aerospace segment partially offset by higher raw materials costs, primarily in our Specialty Materials segment. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $3,064, $3,134 and $3,216 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses included merger, repositioning and other charges of $151 and $300 million in 2001 and 1999, respectively. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in Note 5 of Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion of the merger, repositioning and other charges. Excluding these charges, selling, general and administrative expenses were $2,913, $3,134 and $2,916 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Excluding merger, repositioning and other charges, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 12.3, 12.5 and 12.3 percent in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales in 2001 compared with 2000 principally reflected the impact of headcount reductions and a decline in discretionary spending for professional services, travel and overtime. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales in 2000 compared with 1999 principally reflected our acquisition of Pittway, which had a higher level of selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales. Retirement benefit (pension and other post retirement) plans contributed cost reductions of $165, $282 and $61 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, principally due to the funding status of our pension plans (described in
