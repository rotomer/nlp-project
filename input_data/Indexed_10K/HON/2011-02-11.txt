Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations), we do not expect to be significantly affected by any proposed changes in 2011 federal spending due principally to the varied mix of the government programs which impact us (OEM production, engineering development programs, aftermarket spares and repairs and overhaul programs). Our contracts with the U.S. Government are subject to audits, investigations, and termination by the government. See Item 1A. Risk Factors. Backlog Our total backlog at December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $14,616 and $13,182 million, respectively. We anticipate that approximately $10,609 million of the 2010 backlog will be filled in 2011. We believe that backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of our future sales because a substantial portion of the orders constituting this backlog may be canceled at the customers option. Competition We are subject to active competition in substantially all product and service areas. Competition is expected to continue in all geographic regions. Competitive conditions vary widely among the thousands of products and services provided by us, and vary by country. Depending on the particular customer or market involved, our businesses compete on a variety of factors, such as price, quality, reliability, delivery, customer service, performance, applied technology, product innovation and product recognition. Brand identity, service to customers and quality are generally important competitive factors for our products and services, and there is considerable price competition. Other competitive factors for certain products include breadth of product line, research and development efforts and technical and managerial capability. While our competitive position varies among our products and services, we believe we are a significant competitor in each of our major product and service classes. However, a number of our products and services are sold in competition with those of a large number of other companies, some of which have substantial financial resources and significant technological capabilities. In addition, some of our products compete with the captive component divisions of original equipment manufacturers. See Item 1A Risk Factors for further discussion. International Operations We are engaged in manufacturing, sales, service and research and development mainly in the United States, Europe, Asia, Canada, Middle East and Latin America. U.S. exports and foreign manufactured products are significant to our operations. U.S. exports comprised 11, 12 and 10 percent of our total sales in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Foreign manufactured products and services, mainly in Europe, were 41, 39 and 39 percent of our total sales in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Approximately 17 percent of total 2010 sales of Aerospace related products and services were exports of U.S. manufactured products and systems and performance of services such as aircraft repair and overhaul. Exports were principally made to Europe, Canada, Asia and Latin America. Foreign manufactured products and systems and performance of services comprised approximately 15 percent of total 2010 Aerospace sales. The principal manufacturing facilities outside the U.S. are in Europe, with less significant operations in Canada and Asia. Approximately 2 percent of total 2010 sales of Automation and Control Solutions products and services were exports of U.S. manufactured products. Foreign manufactured products and performance of services accounted for 58 percent of total 2010 Automation and Control Solutions sales. The principal manufacturing facilities outside the U.S. are in Europe, with less significant operations in Asia and Canada. Approximately 30 percent of total 2010 sales of Specialty Materials products and services were exports of U.S. manufactured products. Exports were principally made to Asia and Latin America. Foreign manufactured products and performance of services comprised 27 percent of total 2010 Specialty Materials sales. The principal manufacturing facilities outside the U.S. are in Europe, with less significant operations in Asia and Canada. 10 Approximately 3 percent of total 2010 sales of Transportation Systems products were exports of U.S. manufactured products. Foreign manufactured products accounted for 70 percent of total 2010 sales of Transportation Systems. The principal manufacturing facilities outside the U.S. are in Europe, with less significant operations in Asia and Latin America.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, including the overview of the Company and each of our segments and the discussion of their respective economic and other factors and areas of focus for 2011. These sections and other parts of this report (including this Item 1A) contain forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward looking statements are those that address activities, events or developments that management intends, expects, projects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future. They are based on managements assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends, current economic and industry conditions, expected future developments and other relevant factors. They are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results, developments and business decisions may differ significantly from those envisaged by our forward looking statements. We do not undertake to update or revise any of our forward looking statements. Our forward looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that can affect our performance in both the near and long term. These forward looking statements should be considered in light of the information included in this Form 10 K, including, in particular, the factors discussed below. Risk Factors Our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition are subject to the risks and uncertainties set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. Industry and economic conditions may adversely affect the market and operating conditions of our customers, which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations. The operating results of our segments are impacted by general global industry and economic conditions that can cause changes in spending and capital investment patterns, demand for our products and services and the level of our manufacturing and shipping costs. The operating results of our Aerospace segment, which generated 32 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2010, are directly tied to cyclical industry and economic conditions, including global demand for air travel as reflected in new aircraft production, the deferral or cancellation of orders for new aircraft, delays in launch schedules for new aircraft platforms, the retirement of aircraft, global flying hours, and business and general aviation aircraft utilization rates, as well as changes in customer buying patterns with respect to aftermarket parts, supplier consolidation, factory transitions, capacity constraints, and the level and mix of U.S. Government appropriations for defense and space programs (as further discussed in other risk factors below). The challenging operating environment faced by the commercial airline industry may be influenced by a wide variety of factors including global flying hours, aircraft fuel prices, labor issues, airline consolidation, airline insolvencies, terrorism and safety concerns as well as changes in regulations. Future terrorist actions or pandemic health issues could dramatically reduce both the demand for air travel and our Aerospace aftermarket sales and margins. The operating results of our Automation and Control Solutions (ACS) segment, which generated 41 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2010, are impacted by the level of global residential and commercial construction (including retrofits and upgrades), capital spending and operating expenditures on building and process automation, industrial plant capacity utilization and expansion, inventory levels in distribution channels, and global economic growth rates. Specialty Materials operating results, which generated 14 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2010, are impacted by global economic growth rates, capacity utilization for chemical, industrial, refining, petrochemical and semiconductor plants, our customers availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion, and commodity demand volatility. Transportation Systems operating results, which generated 13 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2010, are impacted by global production and demand for automobiles and trucks equipped with turbochargers, and regulatory changes regarding automobile and truck emissions and fuel economy, delays in launch schedules for new automotive platforms, and consumer demand and spending for automotive aftermarket and car care products. Demand of global automotive and truck manufacturers will continue to be influenced by a wide variety of factors, including ability of consumers to obtain financing, ability to reduce operating costs and overall consumer and business confidence. Each of the segments is impacted by volatility in raw material prices (as further described below) and non material inflation. Raw material price fluctuations, the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements, or catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services, impact our ability to meet commitments to customers, and cause us to incur significant liabilities. 13 The cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products, particularly in our Specialty Materials (benzene (the key component in phenol), natural gas, ethylene, fluorspar and sulfur), Transportation Systems (nickel, steel, other metals and ethylene glycol) and Aerospace (nickel, titanium and other metals) segments. Our inability to offset material price inflation through increased prices to customers, formula or long term fixed price contracts with suppliers, productivity actions or through commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations. Our manufacturing operations are also highly dependent upon the delivery of materials (including raw materials) by outside suppliers and their assembly of major components and subsystems used in our products in a timely manner and in full compliance with purchase order terms and conditions, quality standards, and applicable laws and regulations. In addition, many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a single source basis; in some circumstances these suppliers are the sole source of the component or equipment. Our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers ability to adjust delivery of long lead time products during times of volatile demand. Our suppliers may fail to perform according to specifications as and when required and we may be unable to identify alternate suppliers or to otherwise mitigate the consequences of their non performance. The supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by suppliers decisions to exit certain businesses and by external events such as natural disasters, extreme weather events, pandemic health issues, terrorist actions, labor disputes, governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes (e.g., product certification or stewardship requirements, sourcing restrictions, climate change or greenhouse gas emission standards, etc.). Our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts, which could, in turn, result in reduced sales and profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships. Transitions to new suppliers may result in significant costs and delays, including those related to the required recertification of parts obtained from new suppliers with our customers and or regulatory agencies. In addition, because our businesses cannot always immediately adapt their cost structure to changing market conditions, our manufacturing capacity for certain products may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements, which could adversely impact our operating costs, profitability and customer and supplier relationships. Our facilities, distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to, among other things fire, flood, terrorism or other natural or man made disasters. If any of these facilities or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, result in personal injury or property damage, damage relationships with our customers and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facilities or systems, as well as result in other liabilities and adverse impacts. The same risk can also arise from the failure of critical systems supplied by Honeywell to large industrial, refining and petrochemical customers. Our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins. Our businesses operate in global markets that are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry standards. Accordingly, our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to (i) identify emerging technological trends in our target end markets, (ii) develop and maintain competitive products, (iii) enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products, (iv) develop, manufacture and bring products to market quickly and cost effectively, and (v) develop and retain individuals with the requisite expertise. Our ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect our competitive position and requires the investment of significant resources. These development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses, and they may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or that meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings. In addition, the markets for our products may not develop or grow as we currently anticipate. The failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects. Protecting our intellectual property is critical to our innovation efforts. We own or are licensed under a large number of U.S. and non U.S. patents and patent applications, trademarks and copyrights. Our intellectual property rights may expire or be challenged, invalidated or infringed upon by third parties or we may be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new licenses of third party proprietary intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms. In some non U.S. countries, laws affecting intellectual property are uncertain in their application, which can affect the scope or enforceability of our patents and other 14 intellectual property rights. Any of these events or factors could diminish or cause us to lose the competitive advantages associated with our intellectual property, subject us to judgments, penalties and significant litigation costs, and or temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services. Our systems are subject to risks from unlawful attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems through the Internet. The theft and or unauthorized use or production of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could reduce the value of our investment in R&D and product development and could subject us to claims by third parties relating to loss of their confidential or proprietary information. An increasing percentage of our sales and operations is in non U.S. jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, regulatory and other risks of international operations. Our international operations, including U.S. exports, comprise a growing proportion of our operating results. Our strategy calls for increasing sales to and operations in overseas markets, including developing markets such as Mexico, Brazil, China, India, Malaysia, the Middle East and Eastern Europe. In 2010, 52 percent of our total sales (including products manufactured in the U.S. and in international locations) were outside of the U.S. including 28 percent in Europe and 11 percent in Asia. Risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations, wage and price controls, employment regulations, foreign investment laws, import, export and other trade restrictions (such as embargoes), changes in regulations regarding transactions with state owned enterprises, nationalization of private enterprises, government instability, and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions. We are also subject to U.S. laws prohibiting companies from doing business in certain countries, or restricting the type of business that may be conducted in these countries. The cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide can also impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins. As we continue to grow our businesses internationally, our operating results could be increasingly affected by the relative strength of the European and Asian economies and the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. We do have a policy to reduce the risk of volatility through hedging activities, but such activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us and may not be successful in eliminating such volatility. We may be required to recognize impairment charges for our long lived assets or available for sale investments. At December 31, 2010, the net carrying value of long lived assets (property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets) and available for sale securities totaled approximately $19.0 billion and $0.3 billion, respectively. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in impairments to goodwill and other long lived assets. An other than temporary decline in the market value of our available for sale securities may also result in an impairment charge. Future impairment charges could significantly affect our results of operations in the periods recognized. Impairment charges would also reduce our consolidated shareowners equity and increase our debt to total capitalization ratio, which could negatively impact our credit rating and access to the public debt and equity markets. A change in the level of U.S. Government defense and space funding or the mix of programs to which such funding is allocated could adversely impact Aerospaces defense and space sales and results of operations. Sales of our defense and space related products and services are largely dependent upon government budgets, particularly the U.S. defense budget. Sales as a prime contractor and subcontractor to the U.S. Department of Defense comprised approximately 33 and 10 percent of Aerospace and total sales, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2010. We cannot predict the extent to which total funding and or funding for individual programs will be included, increased or reduced as part of the 2011 and subsequent budgets ultimately approved by Congress, or be included in the scope of separate supplemental appropriations. We also cannot predict the impact of potential changes in priorities due to military transformation and planning and or the nature of war related activity on existing, follow on or replacement programs. A shift in defense or space spending to programs in which we do not participate and or reductions in funding for or termination of existing programs could adversely impact our results of operations. 15 As a supplier of military and other equipment to the U.S. Government, we are subject to unusual risks, such as the right of the U.S. Government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance. In addition to normal business risks, companies like Honeywell that supply military and other equipment to the U.S. Government are subject to unusual risks, including dependence on Congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of funds, changes in governmental procurement legislation and regulations and other policies that reflect military and political developments, significant changes in contract scheduling, complexity of designs and the rapidity with which they become obsolete, necessity for constant design improvements, intense competition for U.S. Government business necessitating increases in time and investment for design and development, difficulty of forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on developmental and highly sophisticated technical work, and other factors characteristic of the industry, such as contract award protests and delays in the timing of contract approvals. Changes are customary over the life of U.S. Government contracts, particularly development contracts, and generally result in adjustments of contract prices. Our contracts with the U.S. Government are subject to audits. Like many other government contractors, we have received audit reports that recommend downward price adjustments to certain contracts or changes to certain accounting systems or controls to comply with various government regulations. We have made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in appropriate cases and may do so in the future. U.S. Government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform under the applicable contract. In the case of a termination for convenience, we are typically entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred, plus termination costs and a reasonable profit. If a contract is terminated by the government for our failure to perform we could be liable for additional costs incurred by the government in acquiring undelivered goods or services from any other source and any other damages suffered by the government. We are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations. If Honeywell or one of its businesses were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations (including violations of certain environmental or export laws), it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceedings and or have its export privileges suspended. The U.S. Government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent, criminal or other egregious misconduct. Debarment generally does not exceed three years. Our reputation and ability to do business may be impacted by the improper conduct of employees, agents or business partners. We cannot ensure that our extensive compliance controls, policies and procedures will in all instances protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, agents or business partners that would violate the laws of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including laws governing payments to government officials, competition and data privacy. Any improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations, monetary and non monetary penalties and could adversely impact our ability to conduct business, results of operations and reputation. Changes in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations. The sales and margins of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations. Safety and performance regulations (including mandates of the Federal Aviation Administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft), product certification requirements and government procurement practices can impact Aerospace sales, research and development expenditures, operating costs and profitability. The demand for and cost of providing Automation and Control Solutions products, services and solutions can be impacted by fire, security, safety, health care, environmental and energy efficiency standards and regulations. Specialty Materials results of operations can be affected by environmental (e.g. government regulation of fluorocarbons), safety and energy efficiency standards and regulations, while emissions and energy efficiency standards and regulations can impact the demand for turbochargers in our Transportation Systems segment. Legislation or regulations regarding areas such as labor and employment, employee benefit plans, tax, health, safety and environmental matters, import, export and trade, intellectual property, product certification, and product liability may impact the results of each of our operating segments and our consolidated results. Completed acquisitions may not perform as anticipated or be integrated as planned, and divestitures may not occur as planned. 16 We regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest non core businesses. We may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis or at all. In addition, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by (i) the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns, (ii) the discovery of unanticipated issues or liabilities, (iii) the failure to integrate acquired businesses into Honeywell on schedule and or to achieve synergies in the planned amount or within the expected timeframe, (iv) the inability to dispose of non core assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions and within the expected timeframe, and (v) the degree of protection provided by indemnities from sellers of acquired companies and the obligations under indemnities provided to purchasers of our divested businesses. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters, government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties. We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employment, employee benefits plans, intellectual property, import and export matters and environmental, health and safety matters. Resolution of these matters can be prolonged and costly, and the ultimate results or judgments are uncertain due to the inherent uncertainty in litigation and other proceedings. Moreover, our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, and we may become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities. It also is not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all our operational risks and liabilities. The incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition. Our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities. Mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures. We have incurred remedial response and voluntary clean up costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations, and require installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit emissions and or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. We incur, and expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs to comply with these laws and regulations. In addition, changes in laws, regulations and enforcement of policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites, the establishment of stricter state or federal toxicity standards with respect to certain contaminants, or the imposition of new clean up requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Our expenses include significant costs related to employee and retiree health benefits. With approximately 130,000 employees, including approximately 53,000 in the U.S., our expenses relating to employee health and retiree health benefits are significant. In recent years, we have experienced significant increases in certain of these costs, largely as a result of economic factors beyond our control, in particular, ongoing increases in health care costs well in excess of the rate of inflation. Continued increasing health care costs, legislative or regulatory changes, and volatility in discount rates, as well as changes in other assumptions used to calculate retiree health benefit expenses, may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. 17 Risks related to our defined benefit pension plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow. Significant changes in actual investment return on pension assets, discount rates, and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and pension contributions in future periods. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest rates, which may change based on economic conditions. Funding requirements for our U.S. pension plans may become more significant. However, the ultimate amounts to be contributed are dependent upon, among other things, interest rates, underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations. For a discussion regarding the significant assumptions used to estimate pension expense, including discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets, and how our financial statements can be affected by pension plan accounting policies, see Critical Accounting Policies included in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Additional tax expense or additional tax exposures could affect our future profitability. We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and various non U.S. jurisdictions, and our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions. In 2010, our tax expense represented 28.4 percent of our income before tax, and includes estimates of additional tax which may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions, including assessments of future earnings of the Company that could effect the valuation of our deferred tax assets. Our future results could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the overall profitability of the Company, changes in tax legislation, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures. Volatility of credit markets or macro economic factors could adversely affect our business. Changes in U.S. and global financial and equity markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity, and interest rate volatility, may increase the cost of financing as well as the risks of refinancing maturing debt. In addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short and long term ratings assigned by independent rating agencies. A decrease in these ratings could increase our cost of borrowing. Delays in our customers ability to obtain financing, or the unavailability of financing to our customers, could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. The inability of our suppliers to obtain financing could result in the need to transition to alternate suppliers, which could result in significant incremental cost and delay, as discussed above. Lastly, disruptions in the U.S. and global financial markets could impact the financial institutions with which we do business. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments Not Applicable Item 2. Properties We have approximately 1,300 locations consisting of plants, research laboratories, sales offices and other facilities. Our headquarters and administrative complex is located in Morris Township, New Jersey. Our plants are generally located to serve large marketing areas and to provide accessibility to raw materials and labor pools. Our properties are generally maintained in good operating condition. Utilization of these plants may vary with sales to customers and other business conditions; however, no major operating facility is significantly idle. We own or lease warehouses, railroad cars, barges, automobiles, trucks, airplanes and materials handling and data processing equipment. We also lease space for administrative and sales staffs. Our properties and equipment are in good operating condition and are adequate for our present needs. We do not anticipate difficulty in renewing existing leases as they expire or in finding alternative facilities. Our principal plants, which are owned in fee unless otherwise indicated, are as follows: 18 Aerospace Anniston, AL (leased) South Bend, IN Greer, SC Glendale, AZ (leased) Olathe, KS Toronto, Canada Phoenix, AZ Minneapolis, MN (partially leased) Olomouc, Czech Republic (leased) Tempe, AZ Plymouth, MN Raunheim, Germany Tucson, AZ Rocky Mount, NC Penang, Malaysia Torrance, CA Albuquerque, NM Singapore (leased) Clearwater, FL Urbana, OH Yeovil, UK (leased) Automation and Control Solutions San Diego, CA (leased) Pleasant Prairie, WI (leased) Chihuahua, Mexico Northford, CT Shenzhen, China (leased) Juarez, Mexico (partially leased) Freeport, IL Suzhou, China Tijuana, Mexico (leased) St. Charles, IL (leased) Mosbach, Germany Emmen, Netherlands Golden Valley, MN Neuss, Germany Newhouse, Scotland Houston, TX (leased) Schonaich, Germany (leased) York, PA (leased) Pune, India (leased) Specialty Materials Mobile, AL Geismar, LA Colonial Heights, VA Des Plaines, IL Shreveport, LA Hopewell, VA Metropolis, IL Pottsville, PA Spokane, WA Baton Rouge, LA Orange, TX Seelze, Germany Chesterfield, VA Transportation Systems Shanghai, China Atessa, Italy Mexicali, Mexico (partially leased) Conde, France Kodama, Japan Bucharest, Romania Glinde, Germany Ansan, Korea (leased) Pune India Item 3. Legal Proceedings We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and claims (some of which involve substantial amounts) arising out of the conduct of our business. See a discussion of environmental, asbestos and other litigation matters in Note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements. Environmental Matters Involving Potential Monetary Sanctions in Excess of $100,000 Although the outcome of the matters discussed below cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that any of them, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations or operating cash flows. The United States Environmental Protection Agency and the United States Department of Justice (federal authorities) are investigating whether the storage of certain sludges generated during uranium hexafluoride production at our Metropolis, Illinois facility has been in compliance with the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The federal authorities have convened a grand jury in this matter. The Company has cooperated fully in the investigation and has been engaged in discussions with the federal authorities regarding a resolution of this matter, which the Company expects to finalize in the first quarter of 2011. The storage issue at the Metropolis site was also previously voluntarily disclosed to the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, with whom Honeywell has been working to resolve related civil environmental claims. In November 2010 Honeywell reached a final settlement agreement with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation to settle allegations that Honeywell failed to properly close out waste storage areas associated with legacy operations in Syracuse, New York, which areas are known as the Solvay Settling Basins. Under the terms of the settlement, Honeywell will pay a fine of $100,000 and implement certain environmental projects in the area. 19 The United States Environmental Protection Agency and the United States Department of Justice are investigating whether the Companys manufacturing facility in Hopewell, Virginia is in compliance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act and the facilitys air operating permit. Based on these investigations, the federal authorities have issued notices of violation with respect to the facilitys benzene waste operations, leak detection and repair program, emissions of nitrogen oxides and emissions of particulate matter. The Company has entered into negotiations with federal authorities to resolve the alleged violations.
