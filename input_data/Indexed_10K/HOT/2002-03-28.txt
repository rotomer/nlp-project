Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) discusses the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and costs and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those relating to revenue recognition, bad debts, inventories, investments, plant, property and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets, income taxes, financing operations, frequent guest program liability, self insurance claims payable, restructuring costs, retirement benefits and contingencies and litigation. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. On December 20, 2001, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requested that all registrants list their most critical accounting policies in MD&A. The SEC indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results and requires managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The Company believes that the following accounting policies fit this definition: Revenue Recognition. The Companys revenues are primarily derived from the following sources: (1) hotel and resort revenues at the Companys owned, leased and consolidated joint venture properties; (2) management and franchise fees; (3) vacation ownership revenues; and (4) other revenues which are ancillary to the Companys operations. Generally, revenues are recognized when the services have been rendered. The following is a description of the composition of revenues for the Company: Owned, Leased and Consolidated Joint Ventures Represents revenue primarily derived from hotel and leisure operations, including the rental of rooms and food and beverage sales, from a worldwide network of owned, leased or consolidated joint venture hotels and resorts operated primarily under the Companys proprietary brand names including St. Regis, The Luxury Collection, Sheraton, Westin, W and Four Points by Sheraton. Revenue is recognized when rooms are occupied and services have been rendered. Management and Franchise Fees Represents fees earned on hotels managed worldwide, usually under long term contracts with the hotel owner, and franchise fees received in connection with the franchise of the Companys Sheraton, Westin and Four Points by Sheraton brand names. Management fees are comprised of a base fee, which is generally based on a percentage of gross revenues, and an incentive fee, which is generally based on the propertys profitability. Base fee revenues are recognized when earned in accordance with the terms of the contract. For any time during the year, incentive fees are recognized for the fees due as if the contract was terminated at that date, exclusive of any termination fees due or payable. Franchise fees are generally based on a percentage of hotel room revenues and are recognized in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 45, Accounting for Franchise Fee Revenue, as the fees are earned and become due from the franchisee. Management and franchise fees are recognized in other hotel and leisure revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Vacation Ownership The Company recognizes revenue from VOI sales in accordance with SFAS No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate. The Company recognizes sales when a minimum of 10% of the purchase price for the VOI has been received, the period of cancellation with refund has 19 Table of Contents expired and receivables are deemed collectible. For sales that do not qualify for full revenue recognition as the project has progressed beyond the preliminary stages but has not yet reached completion, all revenue and profit are initially deferred and recognized in earnings through the percentage of completion method. Vacation ownership revenues are recognized in other hotel and leisure revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Goodwill and intangible assets arise in connection with acquisitions, including the acquisition of management contracts, and are amortized using the straight line method over the useful life of the asset. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. In accordance with this guidance, the Company will cease amortizing goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. Intangible assets with finite lives will continue to amortize on a straight line basis over their respective useful lives. The Company will also review all goodwill and intangible assets for impairment by comparisons of fair value to book value annually, or upon the occurrence of a trigger event. Impairments, excluding those in the year of adoption, will be recognized in operating results. In connection with the adoption of this standard, the Company has completed its initial recoverability test on goodwill and intangible assets, which did not result in any impairment write downs. Estimates based on existing goodwill and intangible assets indicate that adoption will result in an annual increase in net income of approximately $64 million in 2002. Frequent Guest Program. SPG is the Companys frequent guest incentive marketing program. SPG members earn points based on their spending at the Companys properties and, to a lesser degree, through participation in affiliated partners programs, such as those offered by airlines. Points can be redeemed at most Company owned, leased, managed and franchised properties; however, points cannot be redeemed for cash. SPG is provided as a marketing program to the Companys properties. The cost of operating the program, including the estimated cost of award redemption, is charged to properties based on members qualifying expenditures. Revenue is recognized by participating hotels and resorts when points are redeemed for hotel stays. The Company, through the services of third party actuarial analysts, determines the fair value of the future redemption obligation based on statistical formulas which project timing of future point redemption based on historical experience, including an estimate of the breakage for points that will never be redeemed, and an estimate of the points that will eventually be redeemed. These factors determine the required liability for outstanding points. The Companys management and franchise agreements require that the Company be reimbursed currently for the costs of operating the program, including marketing, promotion, communications with, and performing member services for the SPG members. Actual expenditures for SPG may differ from the actuarially determined liability. The liability for the SPG program is included in other long term liabilities and accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The total actuarially determined liability as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 is $159 million and $137 million, respectively. Valuation of Long Lived Assets and Investments. The Company evaluates the carrying value of each of the Companys long lived assets for impairment. The expected undiscounted future cash flows of the assets are compared to the net book value of the assets. If the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the net book value of the assets, the excess of the net book value over the estimated fair value is charged to current earnings. Fair value is based upon discounted cash flows of the assets at a rate deemed reasonable for the type of asset and prevailing market conditions, appraisals and, if appropriate, current estimated net sales proceeds from pending offers. The Company also assesses the carrying value of its long term investments. The fair market value of investments is based on the market prices for the last day of the period if the investment trades on quoted exchanges. For non traded investments, fair value is estimated based on the underlying value of the investment, which is dependent on the performance of the companies or ventures in which the Company has invested, as well as the volatility inherent in external markets for these types of investments. 20 Table of Contents In assessing potential impairment for these investments, the Company will consider these factors as well as forecasted financial performance of its investees. If these forecasts are not met, the Company may have to record impairment charges. Thus, the carrying value of investments at December 31, 2001 approximates fair value based on market prices and the value of the underlying collateral. The following discussion presents an analysis of results of our operations for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999. Year Ended December 31, 2001 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2000 Continuing Operations The Companys operating results for 2001 were dramatically impacted by the continued weakening of the general global economy and, in particular, the U.S. economy which was exacerbated by the September 11 Attacks, leading to an unprecedented decline in industry wide demand in the U.S. and internationally. The initial closing of all airports in the United States and the significant decline in business and leisure travel following the September 11 Attacks resulted in significant decreases in revenues and earnings for September and the fourth quarter of 2001 when compared to the same periods in 2000. Immediately following the September 11 Attacks, the Company began developing operating plans commensurate with the reduced demand levels and began implementing cost reduction plans at all owned and managed hotels worldwide as well as corporate and division offices. Revenues. Total revenues decreased 8.7% from $4.345 billion to $3.967 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001 when compared to the corresponding period in 2000. The decrease in revenues reflects an 8.6% decrease in revenues from the Companys owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels to $3.343 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001 when compared to $3.659 billion in the corresponding period of 2000 and a slight decrease in other hotel and leisure revenues to $624 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 when compared to $686 million in the corresponding periods of 2000 due primarily to a decline in management and franchise fees, offset by a slight increase in revenues from the sale of VOIs. The decrease in revenues from owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels is due primarily to decreased revenues at the Companys hotels owned during both periods (Comparable Owned Hotels) (157 hotels for the year ended December 31, 2001, excluding 10 hotels sold and 8 hotels without comparable results during 2000 and 2001). Revenues at the Companys Comparable Owned Hotels decreased 10.8% to $3.211 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001 when compared to the same period of 2000 due primarily to a decrease in REVPAR. REVPAR at the Companys Same Store Owned Hotels decreased 11.3% to $101.98 for the year ended December 31, 2001 when compared to the corresponding 2000 period. The decrease in REVPAR at these 155 Same Store Owned Hotels was attributed to a decrease in occupancy to 65.1% from 71.2% in the year ended December 31, 2001 when compared to the same period of 2000. ADR decreased slightly to $156.73 for the year ended December 31, 2001 when compared to $161.59 in the corresponding 2000 period. REVPAR at Same Store Owned Hotels in North America decreased 11.9% for the year ended December 31, 2001 when compared to the same period of 2000 due to the weakening of the U.S. economy which was exacerbated by the September 11 Attacks, resulting in an unprecedented decline in industry wide demand, particularly in New York City, where the Company has seven owned hotels with a total of approximately 3,900 rooms. REVPAR at the Companys international Same Store Owned Hotels, which decreased by 9.6% for the year ended December 31, 2001 when compared to the same period of 2000, was also impacted by the September 11 Attacks as international travel from the U.S. declined dramatically. The unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation and adverse political and economic conditions, primarily in countries like Argentina and Australia, also contributed to these declines in REVPAR. REVPAR for Same Store Owned Hotels in Europe, the Companys largest international presence, decreased 1.0% excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation. EBITDA. Total Company EBITDA decreased $343 million to $1.230 billion as of December 31, 2001, primarily due to EBITDA declines at the Companys owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels. EBITDA for the Companys owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels decreased $248 million to $978 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 when compared to the corresponding period in 2000. This 21 Table of Contents decrease was primarily due to a $255 million or 21.0% decrease in EBITDA at the Companys Comparable Owned Hotels, with North America accounting for most of this decline, due to a $209 million decrease in EBITDA over the same period in 2000 resulting primarily from the weakening U.S. economy and the September 11 Attacks. As mentioned above, the Companys significant presence in New York contributed to the decline as EBITDA at seven owned hotels in this city decreased $73 million in 2001 when compared to 2000. The sale of nine hotels during 2000 and early 2001 and the effective closure of two hotels in Chicago which were being converted to W hotels also contributed to the decline in EBITDA. Selling, General, Administrative and Other. Selling, general, administrative and other expenses were $411 million and $403 million for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in selling, general, administrative and other expenses is due primarily to increased expenses associated with Starwood Vacation Ownership, Inc. (SVO) in connection with increased sales, offset by a $24 million foreign exchange gain as a result of the devaluation of the Argentinean Peso and reduced corporate overhead, including a $14 million pretax gain resulting from the termination of a pension plan. Restructuring and Other Special Charges. During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company recorded $70 million in restructuring and other special charges related primarily to the September 11 Attacks and the resulting decline in industry wide demand. Immediately following the September 11 Attacks, the Company began analyzing and implementing a cost reduction plan and began reviewing the carrying value of certain assets for potential impairment, resulting in restructuring and other special charges aggregating approximately $47 million. These charges consisted primarily of severance and retention costs (approximately $25 million); bad debt expense associated with receivables no longer deemed collectible (approximately $17 million); and impairments of certain investments and other assets (approximately $5 million). Approximately $14 million of these special items represent cash charges, with the remaining amount being non cash. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company recorded a charge to write down the Companys investments in various e business ventures by approximately $23 million. These charges were offset in part by the reversal of a $20 million bad debt charge taken in 1998 relating to a note receivable which is now fully performing. Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $433 million and $93 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $391 million and $90 million, respectively, in the corresponding period of 2000. The increase in depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2001 was primarily attributable to the additional depreciation resulting from capital expenditures at many of the Companys owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels over the past two years. Net Interest Expense. Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, which is net of interest income of $11 million and $19 million, respectively, and discontinued gaming operations allocations of $6 million in the year ended December 31, 2000, decreased to $358 million from $420 million. This decrease was due primarily to lower interest rates compared to 2000 due to reduced LIBOR rates and the impact of certain financing transactions, including the issuance of zero coupon convertible debt in May 2001. The Companys weighted average interest rate was 5.10% at December 31, 2001 versus 7.44% at December 31, 2000. Gain (Loss) on Asset Dispositions, Net, and Asset Impairments. Due to the September 11 Attacks and the weakening of the U.S. economy, the Company conducted a comprehensive review of the carrying value of certain assets for potential impairment. As a result, the Company recorded a net charge relating primarily to the impairment of certain investments in the fourth quarter of 2001 totaling $57 million. Income Tax Expense. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2001 decreased to 23.2% compared to 33.0% in the corresponding period in 2000. The Companys effective income tax rate is determined by the level and composition of pretax income subject to varying foreign, state and local taxes and other items. The decrease from prior year is due to the combination of lower pretax income in 2001 due primarily to the weakening U.S. economy and the September 11 Attacks, while maintaining the Companys normal dividend level. 22 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2000 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 1999 Continuing Operations Revenues. Total revenues increased 13.5% to $4.345 billion for the year ended December 31, 2000 when compared to the corresponding period in 1999. The increase in revenues was due to the 7.9% increase in revenues for the Companys owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels to $3.659 billion for the year ended December 31, 2000 when compared to $3.391 billion in the corresponding period of 1999 and the increase in other hotel and leisure revenues to $686 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 when compared to $438 million in the corresponding period of 1999. The increase in revenues from owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels is due primarily to the increased revenues at the Companys 158 Comparable Owned Hotels (excluding 16 hotels sold or without comparable results during 1999 and 2000) and the addition of four hotels, including a full year of operations at the W hotels in San Francisco, California and Seattle, Washington, which opened in May 1999 and September 1999, respectively. These increases were offset by the loss of revenues on 12 hotels sold since April 1999 and the impact of hotels with rooms out of service due to significant renovations. The increase in revenues was further offset by currency weaknesses, primarily in the Euro. Revenues at the Companys Comparable Owned Hotels increased 6.7% to $3.527 billion for the year ended December 31, 2000 when compared to the same period of 1999 due primarily to an increase in REVPAR. REVPAR at 122 Same Store Owned Hotels increased 7.3% to $114.90 for the year ended December 31, 2000 when compared to the corresponding 1999 period. The increase in REVPAR at these hotels was attributed to the increase in ADR of 4.5% to $160.55 for the year ended December 31, 2000 when compared to the corresponding 1999 period. Occupancy for these 122 Same Store Owned Hotels rose to 71.6% from 69.7% in the year ended December 31, 2000 when compared to the same period in 1999. REVPAR at Same Store Owned Hotels in North America increased 11.0% for the year ended December 31, 2000 when compared to the same period of 1999. REVPAR at the Companys international Same Store Owned Hotels, which decreased by 0.3% for the year ended December 31, 2000 when compared to the same period of 1999, was impacted primarily by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation. The increase in other hotel and leisure revenues resulted primarily from the acquisition of SVO in October 1999. The increase is also due to the addition of hotels to the Companys management and franchise system and the stronger performance at the Companys existing managed and franchised hotels. EBITDA. Total Company EBITDA increased $221 million to $1.573 billion as of December 31, 2000 primarily due to EBITDA increases at the Companys owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels. EBITDA for the Companys owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels increased $148 million or 13.7% to $1.226 billion for the year ended December 31, 2000 when compared to $1.078 billion in the corresponding period in 1999. Most of this increase resulted from the Companys Comparable Owned Hotels, which increased $115 million or 10.7% to $1.186 billion. These results were strongest in North America, where the Company has its largest concentration of hotels, offset by weak results internationally due primarily to unfavorable political and economic conditions. The addition of four hotels, including a full year of operations at the W hotels in San Francisco, California and Seattle, Washington, which opened in May 1999 and September 1999, respectively, contributed to the overall increase, offset by the sale of seven hotels since December 31, 1999. Selling, General, Administrative and Other. Selling, general, administrative and other expenses were $403 million and $220 million for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase in selling, general, administrative and other expenses is due primarily to a full year of costs associated with the vacation ownership operations due to the acquisition of SVO in October 1999. Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $391 million and $90 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2000 compared to $370 million and $82 million, respectively, in the corresponding period of 1999. The increase in depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2000 was primarily attributable to the acquisition of SVO in October 1999, the addition of four new hotels, including a full year of depreciation on the W hotels in San Francisco, California and Seattle, 23 Table of Contents Washington, which opened in May 1999 and September 1999, respectively, and the additional depreciation resulting from an extensive renovation program, offset, in part, by the suspension of depreciation on hotels held for sale and hotels sold during the year. Net Interest Expense. Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, which is net of interest income of $19 million and $16 million, respectively, and discontinued gaming operations allocations of $6 million and $163 million, respectively, decreased to $420 million from $484 million. This decrease was due primarily to the paydown of debt with approximately $3.3 billion of cash proceeds from the Caesars World, Inc. (Caesars) and the Desert Inn Resort & Casino (the Desert Inn) sales (interest reflected in discontinued operations and thereby excluded from net interest expense in 1999 was limited to $2.1 billion of allocated debt) and cash repatriation from overseas, partially offset by additional borrowings during 1999 and 2000 for Share repurchases, capital expenditures and the acquisition of the CIGA minority interest. Income Tax Expense. The effective income tax rate for 2000 was 33.0%. As a result of the Reorganization, the tax provision for the year ended December 31, 1999 included a $936 million one time charge to establish a deferred tax liability related to the difference between the book and tax basis in the assets of the Trust. Excluding this charge, a one time tax benefit of $37 million attributable to the resolution of certain employment related contingencies and other one time pro forma comparable adjustments, the Companys effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 1999 was 36.5%. The Companys effective income tax rate is determined by the level and composition of pretax income subject to varying foreign, state and local taxes and other items. Minority Equity in Net Income. In June 2000, the Company completed the acquisition of the minority ownership interest of CIGA not previously owned by Starwood. The aggregate purchase price of the incremental shares was approximately $312 million. This acquisition resulted in an increase in net income of $10 million in 2000 when compared to 1999, excluding the minority interest in the gain on the sale of CIGAs investment in Lampsa, SA, a Greek company that owned the Grande Bretagne Hotel in Athens, Greece. Discontinued Operations During the first quarter of 1999, the Company provided for estimated after tax losses on the gaming dispositions of $180 million ($158 million pretax), which included anticipated operating results through the expected closing date. In addition, the Company recorded, on an after tax basis, a $173 million gain on the sale of the Companys remaining interest in Educational Services during the first quarter of 1999. Due to the sale of Caesars in December 1999 and the Desert Inn in June 2000, results for the Companys gaming operations are included in discontinued operations in the years ended December 31, 1999 and 2000. Results for the Desert Inn are included in discontinued operations through June 23, 2000 and for Caesars through December 30, 1999. The gaming operations net loss of $8 million and $27 million for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively, includes the allocation of pretax corporate interest expense of $6 million and $163 million, respectively. Gaming revenues decreased to $57 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 when compared to $1.541 billion in the corresponding period of 1999, and operating income (loss) for year ended December 31, 2000 decreased to a loss of $3 million when compared to operating income of $154 million for the same period of 1999. The decreases in 2000 were due to the sales of Caesars and the Desert Inn in December 1999 and June 2000, respectively. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Based upon the current level of operations, management believes that the Companys cash flow from operations, together with available borrowings under the Companys domestic and international revolving facilities (approximately $487 million at December 31, 2001) and capacity with additional borrowings, will be adequate to meet the Companys anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, marketing and advertising expenditures, program and other discretionary investments, interest payments and scheduled principal payments for the foreseeable future, including at least the next three years. Starwood had a 24 Table of Contents substantial amount of indebtedness and a working capital deficiency of $690 million at December 31, 2001, including $332 million of current maturities of long term debt. The Company continues to monitor the credit markets and in light of the possibility of a portion of the zero coupon convertible notes being put back to the Company at a price of approximately $202 million in May 2002 and the maturities of certain existing credit facilities totaling $2.187 billion in 2003, Starwood expects to access the credit markets this year as well as enter into a new senior bank facility to refinance this indebtedness. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will be able to refinance the indebtedness and if refinanced, whether it can do so on favorable terms, nor can there be any assurance that the Companys business will continue to generate cash flow at or above current levels or that currently anticipated improvements will be achieved. If Starwood is unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service the Companys debt, the Company may be required to sell assets, reduce capital expenditures, refinance all or a portion of its existing debt or obtain additional financing. The Companys ability to make scheduled principal payments, to pay interest or to refinance the Companys indebtedness depends on its future performance and financial results, which, to a certain extent, are subject to general conditions in or affecting the hotel and leisure industry and to general economic, political, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors beyond the Companys control, including the duration and severity of the current economic downturn exacerbated by the September 11 Attacks. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available to enable Starwood to service its indebtedness or to make necessary capital expenditures, marketing and advertising expenditures and program and other discretionary investments. Since the September 11 Attacks, the Company successfully amended certain terms of its Senior Credit Facility. The amendment gives the Company greater financial flexibility by modifying various financial covenants until the expiration of the facility in early 2003. The amended provisions include adjustments to the Companys combined leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio as well as modification of the timing of amortization payments. See Debt Financing in Part I for risks. The Company has been adversely affected in the aftermath of the September 11 Attacks. Since the attacks, the Companys owned hotels have experienced significant short term declines in occupancy compared to the prior year. At present, it is not possible to predict either the severity or duration of such declines in the medium or long term range, or the potential impact on the Companys results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. However, as a result of the significant short term declines in occupancy, the Company has taken steps to reduce costs, including reductions in force. The Company has undertaken a comprehensive analysis of its cost structure including, among other things, overall staffing levels and facilities related costs. Furthermore, the Company has evaluated hotel financial performance subsequent to the September 11 Attacks and its impact on the Companys investments and contingent obligations. Impairments to investments in hotel management contracts, receivables or other investments due to declines in hotel profitability and reduced management and franchise fees have been reviewed and recognized where considered necessary. The outcome of the Companys analysis has resulted in write downs through restructuring and other special charges and losses on asset dispositions as discussed in Notes 9 and 4, respectively, in the notes to financial statements filed as part of this Joint Annual Report. Capital Expenditures Starwood incurs capital expenditures for upgrading and, in some cases, repositioning its owned hotels and for ongoing maintenance of acquired and existing hotels in accordance with the Companys standards. During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company spent approximately $526 million on improving and upgrading its owned hotels and resorts and VOI construction, including costs to convert two hotels in Chicago to W hotels, expenditures at the W Times Square which opened in December 2001, continuing construction of the St. Regis San Francisco and land in Maui for a VOI project. Due to the September 11 Attacks and the continued weakening of the worldwide economies, the Company reevaluated its planned capital expenditures, significantly reducing these expenditures until signs of the economic recovery become evident. Cash Flow from Operating Activities Cash flow from operating activities is the principal source of cash to be used to fund the Companys operating expenses, interest expense, capital expenditures and distributions. Starwood anticipates that cash 25 Table of Contents flow provided by operating activities will be sufficient to service short term indebtedness, fund maintenance capital expenditures and meet operating cash requirements, including distributions to shareholders. Other general economic considerations, such as those experienced after the September 11 Attacks, may have a negative impact on the Companys results of operations. In addition, while our vacation ownership operations generate strong operating cash flow, annual amounts are affected by the timing of cash outlays for the acquisition and development of new resorts and cash received from purchaser financing and asset securitizations. Cash proceeds from asset securitizations in 2001 were $202 million. See Note 5 in the notes to financial statements filed as part of this Joint Annual Report. Cash Flow from Investing and Financing Activities In limited cases, the Company has made loans to owners or partners in hotel or resort ventures whereby the Company has a management or franchise agreement. Loans outstanding under this program totaled $155 million at December 31, 2001. The Company evaluates these loans for impairment, and at December 31, 2001, believes these loans are collectible. Unfunded commitments aggregating $26 million were outstanding at December 31, 2001, of which $11 million are expected to be funded in 2002 and $13 million are expected to be funded in total. These loans typically are secured by pledges of project ownership interests and/ or mortgages on the projects. The Company participates in programs with unaffiliated lenders in which the Company may partially guarantee loans made to facilitate third party ownership of hotels that the Company manages or franchises. At December 31, 2001, loan guarantees totaled $153 million relating to three projects: the St. Regis in Monarch Beach, California, which opened in mid 2001; the Westin Kierland hotel in Arizona, which is scheduled to open at the end of 2002; and the Westin in Charlotte, North Carolina, which is scheduled to open at the end of 2002. With respect to the Westin Kierland, the guarantee is joint and several with another equity partner. The Company does not anticipate any funding under these loan guarantees in 2002, as all projects are well capitalized. Furthermore, in order to secure management and franchise contracts, the Company may provide performance guarantees to third party owners. Most of these performance guarantees allow the Company to abandon a contract rather than fund shortfalls if certain performance levels are not met. In limited cases, the Company is obliged to fund shortfalls in performance levels. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had six management contracts with performance guarantees with possible cash outlays of up to $68 million, $50 million of which, if required, would be funded over a period of 25 years.

On February 23, 1998, Starwood entered into two credit facilities with Lehman Brothers, Bankers Trust Company, The Chase Manhattan Bank and other financial institutions. The Senior Credit Facility and the Senior Secured Notes Facility comprise Starwoods primary existing credit facilities. In September 1998, the Company increased its borrowings under the Senior Secured Notes Facility with a $1 billion, five year term borrowing facility (Tranche II Loans).

In January 1999, the Company completed a $542 million long term financing (the Mortgage Loan), secured by mortgages on a portfolio of 11 hotels.

The proceeds of the Euro 450 million loan were drawn down in two tranches: the first 270 million Euros was drawn down in December 2001 and used to repay the previously outstanding Euro 270 million facility and the remaining 180 million Euros was drawn down in January 2002, and the proceeds were used to repay a portion of the Companys Revolving Credit Facility. In May 2001, the Company sold an aggregate face amount of $816 million zero coupon convertible senior notes due 2021 (the Notes). The Company received gross proceeds from these sales of approximately $500 million, which were used to repay a portion of its Tranche II Loans that bore interest at LIBOR plus 275 basis points.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. The Company seeks to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates by entering into financial arrangements intended to provide a hedge against a portion of the risks associated with such volatility. The Company continues to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not hedged. Interest rate swap agreements are the primary instruments used to manage interest rate risk. The Company currently has five outstanding long term interest rate swap agreements under which the Company pays a fixed interest rate and receives variable interest rates. At December 31, 2001, the Company also has three long term interest rate swap agreements under which the Company pays a variable interest rate and 29 Table of Contents receives a fixed interest rate. The following table sets forth the scheduled maturities and the total fair value of the Companys debt portfolio: Total Fair At December 31, Total at Value at December 31, December 31, 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 Thereafter 2001 2001 Liabilities Fixed rate (in millions) $ 23 $ 270 $ 19 $ 470 $ 20 $ 1,828 $ 2,630 $ 2,398 Average interest rate 6.26 % Floating rate (in millions) $ 309 $ 2,505 $ 13 $ 13 $ 45 $ 44 $ 2,929 $ 2,929 Average interest rate 3.63 % Interest Rate Swaps Long term variable to fixed (in millions) $ 247 $ 700 $ 947 Average pay rate 5.80 % Average receive rate LIBOR Long term fixed to variable (in millions) $ 450 $ 450 Average pay rate LIBOR Average receive rate 4.73 % Foreign currency forward transactions are used by the Company to hedge exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The gains or losses on the forward contracts are largely offset by the gains or losses of the underlying transactions, and consequently, a sudden significant change in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material impact on future net income or cash flows on such underlying transactions. The Company monitors its foreign currency exposure on a monthly basis to maximize the overall effectiveness of its foreign currency hedge positions. As of December 31, 2001, the Euro and the British Pound were the principal currencies hedged by the Company. Changes in the value of forward foreign exchange contracts designated as hedges of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are classified in the same manner as changes in the underlying assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2001, the notional amount of the Companys open forward foreign exchange contracts protecting the value of the Companys foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities was approximately $366 million. Of these contracts, $353 million matured in January 2002. A hypothetical 10% change in currency exchange rates under the remaining contracts would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $1.2 million to the fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts at December 31, 2001, which would be offset by an opposite effect on the related hedged positions. The Company enters into a derivative financial arrangement only to the extent it meets the objectives described above, and the Company does not engage in such transactions for trading or speculative purposes. See Note 18 in the notes to financial statements filed as part of this Joint Annual Report and incorporated herein by reference for further description of derivative financial instruments.
