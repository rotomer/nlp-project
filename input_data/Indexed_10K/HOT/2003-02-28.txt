Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) discusses the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and costs and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those relating to revenue recognition, bad debts, inventories, investments, plant, property and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets, income taxes, financing operations, frequent guest program liability, self insurance claims payable, restructuring costs, retirement benefits and contingencies and litigation. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. The Company believes the following to be its critical accounting policies: Revenue Recognition. The Companys revenues are primarily derived from the following sources: (1) hotel and resort revenues at the Companys owned, leased and consolidated joint venture properties; (2) management and franchise fees; (3) vacation ownership revenues; and (4) other revenues which are ancillary to the Companys operations. Generally, revenues are recognized when the services have been rendered. The following is a description of the composition of revenues for the Company: Owned, Leased and Consolidated Joint Ventures Represents revenue primarily derived from hotel operations, including the rental of rooms and food and beverage sales, from a worldwide network of owned, leased or consolidated joint venture hotels and resorts operated primarily under the Companys proprietary brand names including St. Regis, The Luxury Collection, Sheraton, Westin, W and Four Points by Sheraton. Revenue is recognized when rooms are occupied and services have been rendered. Management and Franchise Fees Represents fees earned on hotels managed worldwide, usually under long term contracts with the hotel owner, and franchise fees received in connection with the franchise of the Companys Sheraton, Westin, Four Points by Sheraton and Luxury Collection brand names. Management fees are comprised of a base fee, which is generally based on a percentage of gross revenues, and an incentive fee, which is generally based on the propertys profitability. Base fee revenues are recognized when earned in accordance with the terms of the contract. For any time during the year, incentive fees are recognized for the fees due and earned as if the contract was terminated at that date, exclusive of any termination fees due or payable. Franchise fees are generally based on a percentage of hotel room revenues and are recognized in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 45, Accounting for Franchise Fee Revenue, as the fees are earned and become due from the franchisee. Management and franchise fees are recognized in other hotel and leisure revenues in the consolidated statements of income. Vacation Ownership The Company recognizes revenue from VOI sales in accordance with SFAS No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate. The Company recognizes sales when a minimum of 10% of the purchase price for the VOI has been received in cash, the period of cancellation with refund has expired and receivables are deemed collectible. For sales that do not qualify for full revenue recognition as the project has progressed beyond the preliminary stages but has not yet reached 20 Table of Contents completion, all revenue and profit are initially deferred and recognized in earnings through the percentage of completion method. Vacation ownership revenues are recognized in other hotel and leisure revenues in the consolidated statements of income. From time to time, the Company may also securitize or sell its VOI receivables. These securitizations are accounted for as sales transactions under the guidance of SFAS No. 140 Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities replacement of FASB Statement No. 125. See Note 5 for additional discussion. Frequent Guest Program. SPG is the Companys frequent guest incentive marketing program. SPG members earn points based on their spending at the Companys properties and, to a lesser degree, through participation in affiliated partners programs, such as those offered by airlines. Points can be redeemed at most Company owned, leased, managed and franchised properties. SPG is provided as a marketing program to the Companys properties, including as incentives to first time buyers of VOIs. The cost of operating the program, including the estimated cost of award redemption, is charged to properties based on members qualifying expenditures. Revenue is recognized by participating hotels and resorts when points are redeemed for hotel stays. The Company, through the services of third party actuarial analysts, determines the fair value of the future redemption obligation based on statistical formulas which project the timing of future point redemption based on historical experience, including an estimate of the breakage for points that will never be redeemed, and an estimate of the points that will eventually be redeemed. These factors determine the required liability for outstanding points. The Companys management and franchise agreements require that the Company be reimbursed currently for the costs of operating the program, including marketing, promotion, communications with, and performing member services for the SPG members. Actual expenditures for SPG may differ from the actuarially determined liability. The liability for the SPG program is included in other long term liabilities and accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The total actuarially determined liability as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 is $175 million and $159 million, respectively. Asset Valuations. The Company continually evaluates the carrying value of its assets for impairment. Asset impairment analysis is conducted on the following classes of assets: (1) long lived assets; (2) investments; and (3) goodwill and intangible assets. Long Lived Assets The expected undiscounted future cash flows of the assets are compared to the net book value of the assets. If the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the net book value of the assets, the excess of the net book value over the estimated fair value is charged to current earnings. Fair value is based upon discounted cash flows of the assets at a rate deemed reasonable for the type of asset and prevailing market conditions, appraisals and, if appropriate, current estimated net sales proceeds from pending offers. The Company evaluates the carrying value of its long lived assets based on its plans, at the time, for such assets. Changes to the Companys plans, including a decision to dispose of an asset, can have a material impact on the carrying value of the asset, the Companys financial position and the Companys results from operations. Investments The Company also assesses the carrying value of its long term investments. The fair market value of investments is based on the market prices for the last day of the accounting period if the investment trades on quoted exchanges. For non traded investments, fair value is estimated based on the underlying value of the investment, which is dependent on the performance of the companies or ventures in which the Company has invested, as well as the volatility inherent in external markets for these types of investments. In assessing potential impairment for these investments, the Company will consider these factors as well as forecasted financial performance of its investees. If these forecasts are not met, the Company may have to record impairment charges. Thus, fair value of investments, which is based on market prices or the value of the underlying collateral, exceeds the carrying value of investments at December 31, 2002 and 2001. 21 Table of Contents Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill and intangible assets arise in connection with acquisitions, including the acquisition of management contracts. The Company has ceased amortizing goodwill in connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Intangible assets with finite lives continue to amortize on a straight line basis over their respective useful lives. The Company reviews all goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment by comparisons of fair value to net book value annually, or upon the occurrence of a trigger event. Impairments, excluding those in the year of adoption, are recognized in operating results. Intangibles with finite lives are assessed for impairment on a basis consistent with the analysis conducted for long lived assets described above. Beneficial and Retained Interests. The Company periodically sells notes receivable originated by its vacation ownership business in connection with the sale of VOIs. The Company retains interests in the assets transferred to qualified and non qualified special purpose entities which are accounted for as over collateralizations and interest only strips (Beneficial or Retained Interests). These Beneficial or Retained Interests are treated as trading for transactions prior to 2002 and available for sale for transactions thereafter under the provisions of SFAS No. 115 Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. The Company reports changes in the fair values of these Beneficial or Retained Interests through the accompanying consolidated statements of income for trading securities and through the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income for available for sale securities. The Company had Beneficial and Retained Interests of $47 million and $31 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Legal Contingencies. The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty. SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a significant loss has been incurred. The Company evaluates, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact the Companys financial position or its results of operations. Income Taxes. SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entitys financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Companys financial statements or tax returns. Fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact the Companys financial position or its results of operations. The following discussion presents an analysis of results of our operations for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2001 Continuing Operations The Companys operating results for the year ended December 31, 2002 were significantly impacted by the weakened worldwide economic environment, which has resulted in a dramatic slowdown in business and transient travel. The decrease in business transient demand, when compared to the same period of 2001, had an adverse impact on the Companys majority owned hotels, many of which are located in major urban markets. Revenues. Total revenues, excluding other revenues from managed and franchised properties (Total Revenues), decreased 2.2% from $3.967 billion to $3.879 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002 when compared to the corresponding period in 2001. The decrease in Total Revenues reflects a 3.3% decrease in revenues from the Companys owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels to $3.232 billion for the year 22 Table of Contents ended December 31, 2002 when compared to $3.343 billion in the corresponding period of 2001 partially offset by a 3.7% increase in other hotel and leisure revenues to $647 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 when compared to $624 million in the corresponding period of 2001. The decrease in revenues from owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels is due primarily to decreased revenues at the Companys Same Store Owned Hotels offset in part by revenues generated by the W Times Square, which opened in late December 2001, the Westin Dublin, which opened in September 2001, the W Lakeshore Drive in Chicago, Illinois which reopened in October 2001 after a significant renovation and repositioning, and the Sheraton Centre Toronto in Toronto, Canada of which the Company acquired the remaining 50% not previously owned in April 2001. Revenues at the Companys Same Store Owned Hotels decreased 6.0% to $3.013 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002 when compared to the same period of 2001 due primarily to a decrease in REVPAR. REVPAR at the Companys Same Store Owned Hotels decreased 5.9% to $95.46 for the year ended December 31, 2002 when compared to the corresponding 2001 period. The decrease in REVPAR at these Same Store Owned Hotels was attributed to a decrease in occupancy to 63.5% in the year ended December 31, 2002 when compared to 65.1% in the same period of 2001 and a decrease in ADR at these Same Store Owned Hotels. ADR decreased 3.4% to $150.42 for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to $155.77 for the corresponding 2001 period. REVPAR at Same Store Owned Hotels in North America decreased 6.0% for the year ended December 31, 2002 when compared to the same period of 2001. As discussed above, the decrease in REVPAR and revenues from owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels in North America was primarily due to the decline in business transient demand as a result of the weakened global economies. REVPAR at the Companys international Same Store Owned Hotels, which decreased by 5.6% for the year ended December 31, 2002 when compared to the same period of 2001, was also impacted by weakened global economies, the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation and adverse political and economic conditions. REVPAR for Same Store Owned Hotels in Europe decreased 0.3%, in Latin America decreased 22.7% and in Asia Pacific increased 6.8% when compared to 2001. The increase in other hotel and leisure revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2002 when compared to the same period in 2001, resulted from the increase in VOI sales of 14.0% to $276 million in 2002 compared to $242 million in 2001. Contract sales of VOI inventory increased 16.8% in the year ended December 31, 2002 when compared to the same period in 2001, primarily as a result of sales at the Westin Mission Hills Resort Villas in Rancho Mirage, California and the Westin Kaanapali Ocean Resort Villas in Maui, Hawaii. These increases were partially offset by lower management fees, primarily due to reduced incentive management fees, and decreased equity earnings from joint ventures, as a result of the previously discussed weakened global economies and the construction remediation costs at an unconsolidated joint venture property. Other hotel and leisure revenues also include $16 million and $12 million, respectively, primarily related to gains from the sale of $133 million and $226 million of vacation ownership receivables during the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Included in the $226 million of VOI receivable sales in 2001 are $145 million of VOI receivables which were repurchased from existing securitizations. Other revenues and expenses from managed and franchised properties were $780 million and $740 million for 2002 and 2001, respectively. These revenues represent reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed hotel properties and franchisees. These costs relate primarily to payroll costs at managed properties where the Company is the employer. Since the reimbursements are made based upon the costs incurred with no added margin, these revenues and corresponding expenses have no effect on the Companys operating income, net income or profit margins. EBITDA. Total Company EBITDA (which excludes $7 million of restructuring and other special credits, $30 million of foreign exchange gains related to the devaluation of the Argentine Peso and $8 million of construction remediation charges in 2002 and $50 million of restructuring and other special charges and $24 million of foreign exchange gains related to the devaluation of the Argentine Peso in 2001) decreased 11.0% or $135 million to $1.095 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002 when compared to 2001, primarily due to EBITDA declines at the Companys owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels. EBITDA for the Companys owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels decreased $123 million or 12.6% to $855 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 when compared to the corresponding period in 23 Table of Contents 2001. This decrease was primarily due to a $139 million or 14.5% decrease in EBITDA at the Companys Same Store Owned Hotels to $819 million resulting primarily from the weakened global economies as discussed earlier. The decrease in EBITDA at these hotels was due primarily to the $111 million decrease in EBITDA over the same period in 2001 at the Companys Same Store Owned Hotels in North America, as well as the effects of the devaluation of the Argentine Peso and other South American currencies. The declines in our hotel segment were partially offset by a $29 million increase in EBITDA for the vacation ownership segment, primarily related to the contract sales growth noted above. Selling, General, Administrative and Other. Selling, general, administrative and other expenses were $426 million and $411 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in selling, general, administrative and other expenses is due to the inclusion, in the year ended December 31, 2001, of a $14 million pretax gain resulting from the termination of a pension plan, compared to a $3 million pretax gain in 2002 offset by the net $30 million and $24 million of foreign exchange gain resulting from the devaluation of the Argentine Peso, included in the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Restructuring and Other Special Charges (Credits). During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company reversed $7 million of previously recorded restructuring and other special charges primarily related to adjustments to the severance liability established in connection with the cost containment efforts after the September 11 Attacks, sales of its investments in certain e business ventures previously deemed impaired and the collection of receivables which were previously deemed uncollectible. Due to the September 11 Attacks and the weakening of the U.S. economy, in the third and fourth quarters of 2001, the Company implemented a cost reduction plan and conducted a comprehensive review of the carrying value of certain assets for potential impairment, resulting in 2001 restructuring charges of $15 million and noncash other special charges aggregating approximately $36 million. The restructuring charges were primarily for severance costs incurred as part of the cost reduction plan. The other special charges consisted primarily of employee retention costs associated with the accelerated vesting of 50% of restricted stock awards granted in February 2001 (approximately $11 million); bad debt expense associated with receivables no longer deemed collectible (approximately $17 million); impairments of certain investments and other assets (approximately $5 million); and abandoned pursuit projects (approximately $3 million). In addition, in early 2001, the Company wrote down its investments in various e business ventures by approximately $19 million based on the market conditions for the technology sector at the time and managements assessment that the impairment of these investments was other than temporary. This special charge was offset by the reversal of a $20 million restructuring charge taken in 1998 relating to a note receivable, which previously had been written down due to non performance. Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation expense increased to $476 million in the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to $433 million in the corresponding period of 2001. The increase was due to additional depreciation resulting from capital expenditures at the Companys owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels including the opening of the W Times Square in December 2001 and the Westin Dublin in September 2001, as well as costs to reposition the W Lakeshore and the W Midland hotels in Chicago and capital expenditures on technology development. Amortization expense decreased to $20 million in the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to $93 million in the corresponding period of 2001. The decrease in the amortization expense was primarily attributable to the implementation of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which resulted in a $75 million pretax reduction in amortization expense. Net Interest Expense. Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, which is net of interest income of $2 million and $11 million, respectively, decreased to $338 million from $367 million. Excluding $30 million and $9 million related to the early extinguishment of debt for 2002 and 2001, respectively, and an $11 million reversal of accrued interest on tax liabilities that have now been settled in 2002, net interest expense decreased $39 million from the comparable period of the prior year. This decrease was due primarily to lower interest rates compared to 2001 and the impact of certain financing transactions during the past two years. The Companys weighted average interest rate was 5.64% at December 31, 2002 versus 5.10% at December 31, 2001. 24 Table of Contents Gain (loss) on Asset Dispositions and Impairments, Net. During 2002, the Company sold its investment in Interval International, for a gain of $6 million. This gain is offset primarily by a net loss on the disposition of two hotels. In 2001, due to the September 11 Attacks and the weakening of the U.S. economy, the Company conducted a comprehensive review of the carrying value of certain assets for potential impairment. As a result, the Company recorded a net charge relating primarily to the impairment of certain investments totaling $57 million. Income Tax Expense. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2002, excluding special items, decreased to 15.2% compared to 26.6% in the corresponding period in 2001. Including the $32 million net tax benefit on special items primarily related to approximately $39 million of various adjustments to federal and state tax liabilities resulting from the successful settlement of tax matters dating back to 1993, the Companys effective tax rate was 1.6% for the year ended December 31, 2002 and 23.2% for the year ended December 31, 2001. The Companys effective income tax rate is determined by the level and composition of pretax income subject to varying foreign, state and local taxes and other items. The tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2002 is significantly lower than the prior year due to the combination of lower pretax income, the distribution of $0.84 per share and the cessation of amortization of goodwill (as discussed above), which was not deductible for tax purposes. Discontinued Operations During 2002, the Company recorded an after tax gain of $109 million from discontinued operations primarily related to the issuance of new Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations in early 2002, which allowed the Company to recognize a $79 million tax benefit from a tax loss on the 1999 sale of Caesars World, Inc. The tax loss was previously disallowed under the old regulations. In addition, the Company recorded a $25 million gain resulting from an adjustment to the Companys tax basis in ITT World Directories, a subsidiary which was disposed of in early 1998 through a tax deferred reorganization. The increase in the tax basis has the effect of reducing the deferred tax charge recorded on the disposition in 1998. This gain also included the reversal of $5 million (after tax) of liabilities set up in conjunction with the sale of the gaming segment that are no longer required as the related contingencies have been resolved. Year Ended December 31, 2001 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2000 Continuing Operations The Companys operating results for 2001 were dramatically impacted by the continued weakening of the general global economy and, in particular, the U.S. economy which was exacerbated by the September 11 Attacks, leading to an unprecedented decline in industry wide demand in the U.S. and internationally. The initial closing of all airports in the United States and the significant decline in business and leisure travel following the September 11 Attacks resulted in significant decreases in revenues and earnings for September and the fourth quarter of 2001 when compared to the same periods in 2000. Immediately following the September 11 Attacks, the Company began developing operating plans commensurate with the reduced demand levels and began implementing cost reduction plans at all owned and managed hotels worldwide as well as corporate and division offices. Revenues. Total Revenues decreased 8.7% from $4.345 billion to $3.967 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001 when compared to the corresponding period in 2000. The decrease in Total Revenues reflects an 8.6% decrease in revenues from the Companys owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels to $3.343 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001 when compared to $3.659 billion in the corresponding period of 2000 and a slight decrease in other hotel and leisure revenues to $624 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 when compared to $686 million in the corresponding periods of 2000 due primarily to a decline in management and franchise fees, offset by a slight increase in revenues from the sale of VOIs. The decrease in revenues from owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels is due primarily to decreased revenues at the Companys hotels owned during both periods (Comparable Owned Hotels) (157 hotels for the year ended December 31, 2001, excluding 10 hotels sold and 8 hotels without comparable results during 2000 and 2001). Revenues at the Companys Comparable Owned Hotels decreased 10.8% to 25 Table of Contents $3.211 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001 when compared to the same period of 2000 due primarily to a decrease in REVPAR. REVPAR at the Companys Comparable Owned Hotels decreased 11.3% to $101.98 for the year ended December 31, 2001 when compared to the corresponding 2000 period. The decrease in REVPAR at these 155 Comparable Owned Hotels was attributed to a decrease in occupancy to 65.1% from 71.2% in the year ended December 31, 2001 when compared to the same period of 2000. ADR decreased slightly to $156.73 for the year ended December 31, 2001 when compared to $161.59 in the corresponding 2000 period. REVPAR at Comparable Owned Hotels in North America decreased 11.9% for the year ended December 31, 2001 when compared to the same period of 2000 due to the weakening of the U.S. economy which was exacerbated by the September 11 Attacks, resulting in an unprecedented decline in industry wide demand, particularly in New York City, where the Company has seven owned hotels with a total of approximately 3,900 rooms. REVPAR at the Companys international Comparable Owned Hotels, which decreased by 9.6% for the year ended December 31, 2001 when compared to the same period of 2000, was also impacted by the September 11 Attacks as international travel from the U.S. declined dramatically. The unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation and adverse political and economic conditions, primarily in countries like Argentina and Australia, also contributed to these declines in REVPAR. REVPAR for Comparable Owned Hotels in Europe, the Companys largest international presence, decreased 1.0% excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation. The decrease in other hotel and leisure revenue for the year ended December 31, 2001, when compared to the same period in 2000, resulted from lower management fees, primarily due to reduced incentive management fees, decreased equity earnings from joint ventures as a result of the previously discussed weakened global economies, offset by an increase in VOI volume sales of 3.5%, to $242 million in 2001 compared to $234 million in 2000. Other hotel and leisure revenues also include $12 million and $14 million for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, primarily related to gains from the sale of VOI receivables. Other revenues and expenses from managed and franchised properties were $740 million and $695 million for 2001 and 2000, respectively. These revenues represent reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed hotel properties and franchisees. These costs relate primarily to payroll costs at managed properties where the Company is the employer. Since the reimbursements are made based upon the costs incurred with no added margin, these revenues and corresponding expenses have no effect on the Companys operating income, net income or profit margins. EBITDA. Total Company EBITDA (which excludes $50 million in restructuring and other special charges and $24 million of foreign exchange gains related to the devaluation of the Argentine Peso in 2001) decreased $343 million to $1.230 billion as of December 31, 2001, primarily due to EBITDA declines at the Companys owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels. EBITDA for the Companys owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels decreased $248 million to $978 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 when compared to the corresponding period in 2000. This decrease was primarily due to a $255 million or 21.0% decrease in EBITDA at the Companys Comparable Owned Hotels, with North America accounting for most of this decline, ($209 million decrease over the same period in 2000) resulting primarily from the weakening U.S. economy and the September 11 Attacks. As mentioned above, the Companys significant presence in New York contributed to the decline as EBITDA at seven owned hotels in this city decreased $73 million in 2001 when compared to 2000. The sale of nine hotels during 2000 and early 2001 and the effective closure of two hotels in Chicago which were being converted to W hotels also contributed to the decline in EBITDA. EBITDA was also impacted by a $29 million decrease in the vacation ownership segment. Selling, General, Administrative and Other. Selling, general, administrative and other expenses were $411 million and $403 million for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in selling, general, administrative and other expenses was due primarily to increased expenses associated with SVO in connection with increased sales, offset by a $24 million foreign exchange gain as a result of the devaluation of the Argentinean Peso and reduced corporate overhead, including a $14 million pretax gain resulting from the termination of a pension plan for 2001. 26 Table of Contents Restructuring and Other Special Charges (Credits). During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company recorded $50 million in restructuring and other special charges related primarily to the September 11 Attacks and the resulting decline in industry wide demand. Due to the September 11 Attacks and the weakening of the U.S. economy, in the third and fourth quarter of 2001, the Company implemented a cost reduction plan and conducted a comprehensive review of the carrying value of certain assets for potential impairment, resulting in 2001 restructuring charges of $15 million and noncash other special charges aggregating approximately $36 million. The restructuring charges were primarily for severance costs incurred as part of the cost reduction plan. The other special charges consisted primarily of employee retention costs associated with the accelerated vesting of 50% of restricted stock awards granted in February 2001 (approximately $11 million); bad debt expense associated with receivables no longer deemed collectible (approximately $17 million); impairments of certain investments and other assets (approximately $5 million); and abandoned pursuit projects (approximately $3 million). In addition, in early 2001, the Company wrote down its investments in various e business ventures by approximately $19 million based on the market conditions for the technology sector at the time and managements assessment that impairment of these investments, was other than temporary. This special charge was offset by the reversal of a $20 million bad debt restructuring charge taken in 1998 relating to a note receivable, which is now fully performing. Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $433 million and $93 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $391 million and $90 million, respectively, in the corresponding period of 2000. The increase in depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2001 was primarily attributable to the additional depreciation resulting from capital expenditures at many of the Companys owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels over the past two years. Net Interest Expense. Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, which is net of interest income of $11 million and $19 million, respectively, and discontinued gaming operations allocations of $6 million in the year ended December 31, 2000, decreased to $367 million from $423 million. These balances also include charges of $9 and $3 million for 2001 and 2000, respectively, related to debt extinguishment costs. This decrease was due primarily to lower interest rates compared to 2000 and the impact of certain financing transactions, including the issuance of zero coupon convertible debt in May 2001. The Companys weighted average interest rate was 5.10% at December 31, 2001 versus 7.44% at December 31, 2000. Gain (Loss) on Asset Dispositions and Impairments, Net. Due to the September 11 Attacks and the weakening of the U.S. economy, the Company conducted a comprehensive review of the carrying value of certain assets for potential impairment. As a result, the Company recorded a net charge relating primarily to the impairment of certain investments in the fourth quarter of 2001 totaling $57 million. In 2000, the Company recorded a net gain of $2 million related primarily to seven hotel sales. Income Tax Expense. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2001 decreased to 23.2% compared to 33.0% in the corresponding period in 2000. The Companys effective income tax rate is determined by the level and composition of pretax income subject to varying foreign, state and local taxes and other items. The decrease from prior year is due to the combination of lower pretax income in 2001 due primarily to the weakening U.S. economy and the September 11 Attacks, while maintaining the Companys normal dividend level. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash from Operating Activities Cash flow from operating activities is the principal source of cash used to fund the Companys operating expenses, interest payments on debt, maintenance capital expenditures and distribution payments by the Trust. Despite the weakened global economies, the Company anticipates that cash flow provided by operating activities will be sufficient to service these cash requirements. In 2002, the Company shifted from a quarterly distribution to an annual distribution, declaring a distribution of $0.84 per share to shareholders of record on 27 Table of Contents December 31, 2002. The Company paid the 2002 distribution in January 2003. The Company believes that existing borrowing availability together with capacity from additional borrowings and cash from operations will be adequate to meet all funding requirements for the foreseeable future. Cash Used for Investing Activities In limited cases, the Company has made loans to owners of or partners in hotel or resort ventures for which the Company has a management or franchise agreement. Loans outstanding under this program totaled $156 million at December 31, 2002. The Company evaluates these loans for impairment, and at December 31, 2002, believes these loans are collectible. Unfunded loan commitments aggregating $33 million were outstanding at December 31, 2002, of which $7 million are expected to be funded in 2003 and $15 million are expected to be funded in total. These loans typically are secured by pledges of project ownership interests and or mortgages on the projects. The Company participates in programs with unaffiliated lenders in which the Company may partially guarantee loans made to facilitate third party ownership of hotels that the Company manages or franchises. As of December 31, 2002, the Company was a guarantor for loans which could reach a maximum of $164 million relating to three projects: the St. Regis in Monarch Beach, California, which opened in mid 2001; the Westin Kierland Resort and Spa in Scottsdale, Arizona, which opened in November 2002; and the Westin in Charlotte, North Carolina, which is scheduled to open in the first quarter of 2003. In connection with the loan guarantee for the Westin Charlotte, the Company also entered into a guarantee to fund working capital shortfalls for this resort through 2005. No fundings are anticipated under this working capital guarantee. With respect to the Westin Kierland, the guarantee is joint and several with another equity partner. The Company does not anticipate any funding under these loan guarantees in 2003, as all projects are well capitalized. Furthermore, since each of these properties was funded with significant equity and subordinated debt financing, if the Companys loan guarantees were to be called, the Company could take an equity position in these properties at values significantly below construction costs. Surety bonds issued on behalf of the Company as of December 31, 2002 totaled $119 million, the majority of which were required by state or local governments relating to our vacation ownership operations and by our insurers to secure large deductible insurance programs. Furthermore, in order to secure management and franchise contracts, the Company may provide performance guarantees to third party owners. Most of these performance guarantees allow the Company to terminate the contract rather than fund shortfalls if certain performance levels are not met. In limited cases, the Company is obliged to fund shortfalls in performance levels. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had eight management contracts with performance guarantees with possible cash outlays of up to $74 million, $50 million of which, if required, would be funded over a period of 25 years and would be largely offset by management fees received under these contracts. Many of the performance tests are multi year tests, are tied to the results of a competitive set of hotels, and have exclusions for force majeure and acts of war and terrorism. The Company does not anticipate any significant funding under the performance guarantees in 2003. In addition, the Company has agreed to guarantee certain performance levels at a managed property that has authorized VOI sales and marketing. The exact amount and nature of the guaranty is currently under dispute. However, the Company does not believe that any payments under this guaranty will be significant. Lastly, the Company does not anticipate losing a significant number of management or franchise contracts in 2003. 28 Table of Contents The Company had the following contractual obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2002 (in millions): Due in Less Than 1 Due in Due in Due After Total Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years 5 Years Long term debt $ 5,318 $ 869 $ 1,025 $ 1,332 $ 2,092 Capital lease obligations 1 1 Operating lease obligations 949 73 120 98 658 Unconditional purchase obligations(1) 165 66 78 20 1 Other long term obligations 6 6 Total contractual obligations $ 6,439 $ 1,009 $ 1,229 $ 1,450 $ 2,751 (1) Included in these balances are commitments that may be satisfied by the Companys managed and franchised properties.

The Company periodically reviews its business with a view to identifying properties or other assets that we believe either are non core, no longer complement our business, are in markets which may not benefit us as much as other markets during an economic recovery or could be sold at significant premiums. The Company is focused on restructuring and enhancing real estate returns and monetizing investments. In the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company completed the sale of the Doubletree Minneapolis hotel for $47 million. Including this sale, the Company is targeting net proceeds of at least $500 million from domestic and or international asset sales by the end of 2003. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will be able to complete dispositions on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Cash Used for Financing Activities In October 2002, the Company refinanced its previous Senior Credit Facility with a new four year $1.3 billion Senior Credit Facility. The new facility is comprised of a $1.0 billion revolving facility and a $300 million term loan, each maturing in 2006, with a one year extension option, and an initial interest rate of LIBOR + 1.625%. The proceeds of the new Senior Credit Facility were used to pay off all amounts owed under the Companys previous Senior Credit Facility, which was due to mature in February 2003. The Company incurred approximately $1 million in charges in connection with this early extinguishment of debt. In September 2002, the Company terminated certain Fair Value Swaps, resulting in a $78 million cash payment to the Company. These proceeds were used to pay down the previous revolving credit facility and will result in a decrease to the interest expense on the hedged debt through its maturity in 2007. In order to retain its fixed versus floating rate debt position, the Company immediately entered into five new Fair Value Swaps on the same underlying debt as the terminated swaps. 29 Table of Contents In April 2002, the Company sold $1.5 billion of senior notes in two tranches $700 million principal amount of 7 3/8% senior notes due 2007 and $800 million principal amount of 7 7/8% senior notes due 2012 (the Senior Notes Offering). The Company used the proceeds to repay all of its senior secured notes facility and a portion of its previous Senior Credit Facility. In connection with the repayment of debt, the Company incurred charges of approximately $29 million including approximately $23 million for the early termination of interest rate swap agreements associated with repaid debt, and $6 million write off of deferred financing costs and termination fees for the early extinguishment of debt. In December 2001, the Company entered into an 18 month 450 million Euro loan that automatically extended for six additional months until December 2003, as the lender group elected not to exercise its put option. The loan has an interest rate of Euribor plus 195 basis points. The proceeds of the Euro loan were drawn down in two tranches; the first 270 million Euros was drawn down in December 2001 and used to repay the previously outstanding 270 million Euro facility and the remaining 180 million Euros was drawn down in January 2002 and the proceeds were used to pay down a portion of the Companys previous Senior Credit Facility. The Company maintains non U.S. dollar denominated debt, which provides a hedge of the Companys international net assets and operations but also exposes its debt balance to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. During the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was a net increase in debt of approximately $135 million and a net decrease in debt of approximately $27 million, respectively. The Companys debt balance is also affected by changes in interest rates as a result of the Companys Fair Value Swaps. The fair market value of the Fair Value Swaps is recorded as an asset or liability and as the Fair Value Swaps are deemed to be effective, an adjustment is recorded against the corresponding debt. At December 31, 2002, the Companys debt included an increase of approximately $75 million related to the unamortized gain on terminated fair value swaps and the fair market value of current Fair Value Swap assets. At December 31, 2001 the Companys debt included a decrease of approximately $1 million related to Fair Value Swap liabilities. In May 2001, the Company sold an aggregate face amount of $816 million zero coupon convertible senior notes due 2021. The two series of notes had an initial blended yield to maturity of 2.35%. The notes are convertible, subject to certain conditions, into an aggregate 9,657,000 Shares. The Company received gross proceeds from these sales of approximately $500 million, which were used to repay a portion of its senior secured notes facility that bore interest at LIBOR plus 275 basis points. The Company incurred approximately $9 million of charges in connection with this early debt extinguishment. In May 2002, the Company repurchased all of the outstanding Series A convertible notes for $202 million in cash. Holders of Series B Notes may first put these notes to the Company in May 2004 for a purchase price of approximately $330 million. In addition to the $450 million Euro loan maturing in December 2003, approximately $250 million of the Sheraton Holdings public debt matures in November 2003. Based upon the current level of operations, management believes that the Companys cash flow from operations, together with available borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility (approximately $555 million at December 31, 2002), available borrowings from international revolving lines of credit (approximately $112 million at December 31, 2002), capacity from additional borrowings and proceeds from non core asset sales, will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for scheduled maturities, dividends, working capital, capital expenditures, marketing and advertising program expenditures, other discretionary investments, interest and scheduled principal payments for the foreseeable future. Starwood has a substantial amount of indebtedness and had a working capital deficiency of $1.249 billion at December 31, 2002. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to refinance its indebtedness as it becomes due and, if so, on favorable terms, nor can there be assurance that the Companys business will continue to generate cash flow at or above historical levels or that currently anticipated results will be achieved. While the Companys senior debt is currently rated investment grade by one of the two major rating agencies, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to maintain this rating. On December 20, 2002, that rating agency placed the Companys investment grade rating on CreditWatch with negative implica 30 Table of Contents tions. In the event the senior debt is not investment grade, the Company would likely incur higher borrowing costs on future financings. At December 31, 2002, the Companys overall Corporate Credit Rating by Standard & Poors was BBB (investment grade), and the Companys Senior Implied Issuer Rating by Moodys was Ba1 (the highest non investment grade rating). If Starwood is unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service the Companys debt, the Company may be required to sell additional assets, reduce capital expenditures, refinance all or a portion of its existing debt or obtain additional financing. The Companys ability to make scheduled principal payments, to pay interest on or to refinance the Companys indebtedness depends on its future performance and financial results, which, to a certain extent, are subject to general conditions in or affecting the hotel and vacation ownership industries and to general economic, political, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors beyond the Companys control, including the severity and duration of the current economic downturn. Following is a summary of the Companys debt portfolio as of December 31, 2002: Amount Interest Rate at Outstanding at December 31, Average December 31, 2002(a) Interest Terms 2002 Maturity (Dollars in millions) Floating Rate Debt Senior Credit Facility: Term Loan $ 300 LIBOR(c) +162.5 3.01 % 3.0 years Revolving Credit Facility 325 Various 4.10 % 3.8 years Euro Loan 473 Euribor(d) +195 4.81 % 1.0 years Mortgages and Other 255 Various 5.53 % 2.6 years Interest Rate Swaps 1,002 5.29 % Total/ Average $ 2,355 4.76 % 2.4 years Fixed Rate Debt Sheraton Holding Public Debt $ 1,324 (e) 6.52 % 8.2 years Senior Notes 1,542 (e) 7.13 % 7.0 years Convertible Senior Notes Series B 316 3.25 % 1.4 years (b) Mortgages and Other 784 7.37 % 9.4 years Interest Rate Swaps (1,002 ) 7.19 % Total/ Average $ 2,964 6.34 % 7.4 years Total Debt Total Debt and Average Terms $ 5,319 5.64 % 6.2 years (a) Excludes approximately $355 million of the Companys share of unconsolidated joint venture debt, all of which was non recourse, except as noted earlier. (b) Maturity reflects the earliest date the debt can be put to the Company. (c) At December 31, 2002, LIBOR was 1.38% (d) At December 31, 2002, Euribor was 2.86% (e) Included approximately $27 million and $48 million at December 31, 2002 of fair value adjustments related to the fixed to floating interest rate swaps for the Sheraton Holding public debt and the Senior Notes, respectively. During each of the quarters of 2001, the Trust declared a distribution of $0.20 per Share. Total 2001 distributions were $156 million. In 2002, the Company shifted from a quarterly distribution to an annual distribution. A distribution of $0.84 per Share, representing a 5% increase over the aggregate 2001 distribution, was paid in January 2003 to shareholders of record as of December 31, 2002. 31 Table of Contents Stock Sales and Repurchases At December 31, 2002, Starwood had outstanding approximately 200 million Shares, 1 million partnership units and 2 million Class A EPS, Class B EPS and exchangeable units. Through January 31, 2003, in accordance with the terms of the Class B EPS, which allow the shareholders to put these units back to the Company at $38.50 beginning on the fifth anniversary of the Westin acquisition, 422,753 units of Class B EPS were put back to the Company for approximately $16 million. Mr. Sternlicht held, individually and through various family trusts, an aggregate of 240,391 Class B EPS and limited partnership units of the Realty Partnership and Operating Partnership convertible to Class B EPS on a one to one basis. On January 2, 2003, Mr. Sternlicht redeemed all of these Class B EPS for $38.50 per Share. In 1998, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the repurchase of up to $1 billion of Shares under a Share repurchase program (the Share Repurchase Program). On April 2, 2001, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $500 million of Shares under the Share Repurchase Program, subject to the terms of the previous Senior Credit Facility. Pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program, Starwood repurchased 3.2 million Shares in the open market for an aggregate cost of $96 million during 2001. No shares were repurchased during 2002. As of December 31, 2002, approximately $633 million remains available under the Share Repurchase Program. During 2002, approximately 4,000 shares of Class B EPS were exchanged by certain stockholders for an equal number of shares of Class A EPS. Additionally, approximately 60,000 shares of Class A EPS were exchanged for an equal number of Shares. During 2002, the Company exchanged approximately 126,000 limited partnership units of the Realty Partnership and the Operating Partnership held by third parties for Shares on a one for one basis. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. In limited instances, the Company seeks to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates by entering into financial arrangements intended to provide a hedge against a portion of the risks associated with such volatility. The Company continues to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not hedged. Interest rate swap agreements are the primary instruments used to manage interest rate risk. At December 31, 2002, the Company had five outstanding long term interest rate swap agreements under which the Company pays variable interest rates and receives fixed interest rates. At December 31, 2002, the Company also had one interest rate swap agreement under which the Company pays a fixed rate and receives a 32 Table of Contents variable rate. The following table sets forth the scheduled maturities and the total fair value of the Companys debt portfolio: Expected Maturity or Transaction Date Total Fair At December 31, Total at Value at December 31, December 31, 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Thereafter 2002 2002 Liabilities Fixed rate (in millions) $ 273 $ 340 $ 498 $ 21 $ 769 $ 2,065 $3,966 $ 3,824 Average interest rate 6.54% Floating rate (in millions) $ 597 $ 70 $ 118 $ 533 $ 9 $ 26 $1,353 $ 1,353 Average interest rate 4.37% Interest Rate Swaps Variable to fixed (in millions) $ 48 $ $ $ $ $ $ 48 Pay rate 4.09% Receive rate ST. LIBOR Fixed to variable (in millions) $ $ $ 450 $ $ 600 $ $1,050 Average pay rate LIBOR Average receive rate 3.19% Foreign currency forward transactions are used by the Company to hedge exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The gains or losses on the forward contracts are largely offset by the gains or losses of the underlying transactions, and consequently, a sudden significant change in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material impact on future net income or cash flows on such underlying transactions. The Company monitors its foreign currency exposure on a monthly basis to maximize the overall effectiveness of its foreign currency hedge positions. Changes in the value of forward foreign exchange contracts designated as hedges of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are classified in the same manner as changes in the underlying assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2002, the notional amount of the Companys open forward foreign exchange contract protecting the value of the Companys foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities was approximately $2 million. A hypothetical 10% change in currency exchange rates under the remaining contracts would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $240,000 to the fair value of the forward foreign exchange contract at December 31, 2002, which would be offset by an opposite effect on the related hedged position. The Company enters into a derivative financial arrangement only to the extent it meets the objectives described above, and the Company does not engage in such transactions for trading or speculative purposes. See Note 17 in the notes to financial statements filed as part of this Joint Annual Report and incorporated herein by reference for further description of derivative financial instruments.
