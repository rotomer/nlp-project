Through our brands, we are well represented in most major markets around the world. Our operations are grouped into two business segments, hotels and vacation ownership and residential operations. Our revenue and earnings are derived primarily from hotel operations, which include the operation of our owned hotels; management and other fees earned from hotels we manage pursuant to management contracts; and the receipt of franchise and other fees. Our hotel business emphasizes the global operation of hotels and resorts primarily in the luxury and upscale segment of the lodging industry. We seek to acquire interests in, or management or franchise rights with respect to properties in this segment. At December 31, 2005, our hotel portfolio included owned, leased, managed and franchised hotels totaling 845 hotels with approximately 258,000 rooms in approximately 100 countries, and is comprised of 130 hotels that we own or lease or in which we have a majority equity interest, 378 hotels managed by us on behalf of third party owners (including entities in which we have a minority equity interest) and 337 hotels for which we receive franchise fees. Our revenues and earnings are also derived from the development, ownership and operation of vacation ownership resorts, marketing and selling vacation ownership interests (VOIs) in the resorts and providing financing to customers who purchase such interests. Generally these resorts are marketed under the brand names described above. At December 31, 2005, we had 19 vacation ownership resorts and residential properties in the United States, Mexico and the Bahamas. Additionally, our revenues and earnings are derived from the development, marketing and selling of residential units at mixed use hotel projects owned by us as well as fees earned from the marketing and selling of residential units at mixed use hotel projects developed by third party owners of hotels operated under our brands. The Trust was organized in 1969, and the Corporation was incorporated in 1980, both under the laws of Maryland. Sheraton Hotels & Resorts and Westin Hotels & Resorts, Starwoods largest brands, have been 2 Table of Contents serving guests for more than 60 years. Starwood Vacation Ownership (and its predecessor, Vistana, Inc.) has been selling VOIs for more than 20 years. Our principal executive offices are located at 1111 Westchester Avenue, White Plains, New York 10604, and our telephone number is (914) 640 8100. For a discussion of our revenues, profits, assets and geographical segments, see the notes to financial statements of this Joint Annual Report. For additional information concerning our business, see Item 2. Properties, of this Joint Annual Report. Competitive Strengths Management believes that the following factors contribute to our position as a leader in the lodging and vacation ownership industry and provide a foundation for the Companys business strategy: Brand Strength. We have assumed a leadership position in markets worldwide based on our superior global distribution, coupled with strong brands and brand recognition. Our upscale and luxury brands continue to capture market share from our competitors by aggressively cultivating new customers while maintaining loyalty among the worlds most active travelers. The strength of our brands is evidenced, in part, by the superior ratings received from our hotel guests and from industry publications. In 2005 we had 35 of our hotels on the Cond Nast Travelers 2005 Readers Choice Awards List, including three hotels on their Top 100 Best Hotels in the World. Frequent Guest Program. Our loyalty program, Starwood Preferred Guest (SPG), has over 27 million members and since its inception in 1999, has been awarded the Hotel Program of the Year six times by consumers via the prestigious Freddie Awards. SPG has also received top honors for awards for Best Customer Service, Best Elite Level Program, Best Award and Best Redemption. SPG, which was the first loyalty program in the hotel industry with a policy of no blackout dates and no capacity controls, enables members to redeem stays when they want and where they want. SPG yields repeat guest business primarily by rewarding customers with points towards free hotel stays and other rewards, or airline miles with any of the participating 33 airline programs. Significant Presence in Top Markets. Our luxury and upscale hotel and resort assets are well positioned throughout the world. These assets are primarily located in major cities and resort areas that management believes have historically demonstrated a strong breadth, depth and growing demand for luxury and upscale hotels and resorts, in which the supply of sites suitable for hotel development has been limited and in which development of such sites is relatively expensive. Premier and Distinctive Properties. We control a distinguished and diversified group of hotel properties throughout the world, including the St. Regis in New York, New York; The Phoenician in Scottsdale, Arizona; the Hotel Gritti Palace in Venice, Italy; the St. Regis in Beijing, China; and the Westin Palace in Madrid, Spain. These are among the leading hotels in the industry and are at the forefront of providing the highest quality and service. Our properties are consistently recognized as the best of the best by readers of Cond Nast Traveler, who are among the worlds most sophisticated and discerning group of travelers. The January 2006 issue of the Cond Nast Traveler Magazine included 45 Starwood properties among its prestigious Gold List and Gold List Reserve, including the Sheraton Laguna in the Best by Design category. Scale. As one of the largest hotel and leisure companies focusing on the luxury and upscale full service lodging market, we have the scale to support our core marketing and reservation functions. We also believe that our scale will contribute to lower our cost of operations through purchasing economies areas such as insurance, energy, telecommunications, technology, employee benefits, food and beverage, furniture, fixtures and equipment and operating supplies. Diversification of Cash Flow and Assets. Management believes that the diversity of our brands, market segments served, revenue sources and geographic locations provides a broad base from which to enhance revenue and profits and to strengthen our global brands. This diversity limits our exposure to any particular lodging or vacation ownership asset, brand or geographic region. 3 Table of Contents While we focus on the luxury and upscale portion of the full service lodging, vacation ownership and residential markets, our brands cater to a diverse group of sub markets within this market. For example, the St. Regis hotels cater to high end hotel and resort clientele while Four Points by Sheraton hotels deliver extensive amenities and services at more affordable rates. The newly announced aloft brand will provide a youthful alternative to the commodity lodging of currently existing brands in the select service market segment. We derive our cash flow from multiple sources within our hotel and vacation ownership and residential segments, including owned hotels activity and management and franchise fees, and are geographically diverse with operations around the world.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) discusses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and costs and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those relating to revenue recognition, bad debts, inventories, investments, plant, property and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets, income taxes, financing operations, frequent guest program liability, self insurance claims payable, restructuring costs, retirement benefits and contingencies and litigation. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. 24 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES We believe the following to be our critical accounting policies: Revenue Recognition. Our revenues are primarily derived from the following sources: (1) hotel and resort revenues at our owned, leased and consolidated joint venture properties; (2) management and franchise fees; (3) vacation ownership and residential revenues; (4) revenues from managed and franchised properties; and (5) other revenues which are ancillary to our operations. Generally, revenues are recognized when the services have been rendered. The following is a description of the composition of our revenues: Owned, Leased and Consolidated Joint Ventures Represents revenue primarily derived from hotel operations, including the rental of rooms and food and beverage sales from owned, leased or consolidated joint venture hotels and resorts. Revenue is recognized when rooms are occupied and services have been rendered. These revenues are impacted by global economic conditions affecting the travel and hospitality industry as well as relative market share of the local competitive set of hotels. REVPAR is a leading indicator of revenue trends at owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels as it measures the period over period growth in rooms revenue for comparable properties. Management and Franchise Fees Represents fees earned on hotels managed worldwide, usually under long term contracts, franchise fees received in connection with the franchise of the our Sheraton, Westin, Four Points by Sheraton, Le Mridien, St. Regis, W and Luxury Collection brand names and termination fees, offset by payments by us under performance and other guarantees. Management fees are comprised of a base fee, which is generally based on a percentage of gross revenues, and an incentive fee, which is generally based on the propertys profitability. For any time during the year, when the provisions of our management contracts allow receipt of incentive fees upon termination, incentive fees are recognized for the fees due and earned as if the contract was terminated at that date, exclusive of any termination fees due or payable. Therefore, during periods prior to year end, the incentive fees recorded may not be indicative of the eventual incentive fees that will be recognized at year end as conditions and incentive hurdle calculations may not be final. Franchise fees are generally based on a percentage of hotel room revenues. As with hotel revenues discussed above, these revenue sources are affected by conditions impacting the travel and hospitality industry as well as competition from other hotel management and franchise companies. Vacation Ownership and Residential We recognize revenue from VOI sales and financings and the sales of residential units which are typically a component of mixed use projects that include a hotel. Such revenues are impacted by the state of the global economies and, in particular, the U.S. economy, as well as interest rate and other economic conditions affecting the lending market. We determine the portion of revenues to recognize for sales accounted for under the percentage of completion method based on judgments and estimates including total project costs to complete. Additionally, we record reserves against these revenues based on expected default levels. Changes in costs could lead to adjustments to the percentage of completion status of a project, which may result in differences in the timing and amount of revenues recognized from the projects. We anticipate developing future high end VOI projects adjacent to or as part of our luxury resorts, resulting in cross selling opportunities and an audience of higher end purchasers, yielding both higher revenues and reduced risks associated with financing these VOI sales. We have also entered into licensing agreements with third party developers to offer consumers branded condominiums or residences. Our fees from these agreements are generally based on the gross sales revenue of units sold. Revenues from Managed and Franchised Properties These revenues represent reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed hotel properties and franchisees. These costs relate primarily to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer. Since the reimbursements are made based upon the costs incurred with no added margin, these revenues and corresponding expenses have no effect on our operating income and our net income. Frequent Guest Program. SPG is our frequent guest incentive marketing program. SPG members earn points based on spending at our properties, as incentives to first time buyers of VOIs and residences and, to a 25 Table of Contents lesser degree, through participation in affiliated partners programs. Points can be redeemed at most of our owned, leased, managed and franchised properties as well as through other redemption opportunities with third parties, such as conversion to airline miles. Properties are charged based on hotel guests expenditures. Revenue is recognized by participating hotels and resorts when points are redeemed for hotel stays. We, through the services of third party actuarial analysts, determine the fair value of the future redemption obligation based on statistical formulas which project the timing of future point redemption based on historical experience, including an estimate of the breakage for points that will never be redeemed, and an estimate of the points that will eventually be redeemed as well as the cost of reimbursing hotels and other third parties in respect of other redemption opportunities for point redemptions. Actual expenditures for SPG may differ from the actuarially determined liability. The total actuarially determined liability as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 is $314 million and $255 million, respectively. A 10% reduction in the breakage of points would result in an increase of $47 million to the liability at December 31, 2005. Long Lived Assets. We evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets for impairment by comparing the expected undiscounted future cash flows of the assets to the net book value of the assets if certain trigger events occur. If the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the net book value of the assets, the excess of the net book value over the estimated fair value is charged to current earnings. Fair value is based upon discounted cash flows of the assets at a rate deemed reasonable for the type of asset and prevailing market conditions, appraisals and, if appropriate, current estimated net sales proceeds from pending offers. We evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets based on our plans, at the time, for such assets and such qualitative factors as future development in the surrounding area, status of expected local competition and projected incremental income from renovations. Changes to our plans, including a decision to dispose of or change the intended use of an asset, can have a material impact on the carrying value of the asset. Assets Held for Sale. We consider properties to be assets held for sale when management approves and commits to a formal plan to actively market a property or group of properties for sale and a signed sales contract and significant non refundable deposit or contract break up fee exist. Upon designation as an asset held for sale, we record the carrying value of each property or group of properties at the lower of its carrying value which includes allocable segment goodwill or its estimated fair value, less estimated costs to sell, and we stop recording depreciation expense. Any gain realized in connection with the sale of properties for which we have significant continuing involvement (such as through a long term management agreement) is deferred and recognized over the life of the associated involvement (e.g., the initial term of the related agreement). The operations of the properties held for sale prior to the sale date are recorded in discontinued operations unless we will have continuing involvement (such as through a management or franchise agreement) after the sale. Legal Contingencies. We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty. SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss and changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations. Income Taxes. We provide for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entitys financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. 26 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion presents an analysis of results of our operations for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Our operating results for 2005 and 2004 improved significantly when compared to 2003 due, in large part, to the continued economic recovery in the United States, particularly its effect on the hospitality industry. Our operating results for a substantial part of 2003 were significantly impacted by the weakened worldwide economic environment, the war in Iraq and its aftermath and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic, all of which resulted in a dramatic slowdown in business and international travel. In the latter part of 2003 and continuing into 2004 and 2005, transient travel in North America, where we have our largest concentration of owned hotels, began to increase, more than offsetting the weaknesses in group travel. Historically, we have derived the majority of our revenues and operating income from our owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels and, as discussed above, a significant portion of these results were driven by these hotels in North America. Total revenues generated from these hotels worldwide for the years ending December 31, 2005 and 2004 were $3.517 billion and $3.326 billion, respectively (total revenues from our owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels in North America were $2.571 billion and $2.423 billion for 2005 and 2004, respectively). The following represents the geographical breakdown of our owned, leased and consolidated joint venture revenues in North America by metropolitan area for the year ended December 31, 2005 (with comparable data for 2004): Top Ten Metropolitan Areas as a % of Owned North America Revenues for the Year Ended December 31, 2005 with Comparable Data for 2004 2005 2004 Metropolitan Area Revenues Revenues New York, NY 20.0 % 19.2 % Boston, MA 9.1 % 9.4 % San Diego, CA 5.3 % 5.2 % Los Angeles Long Beach, CA 5.1 % 4.8 % Phoenix, AZ 4.8 % 5.0 % Atlanta, GA 4.6 % 4.4 % Seattle, WA 3.9 % 3.8 % Toronto, Canada 3.9 % 3.9 % Maui, HI 3.7 % 3.5 % Houston, TX 3.0 % 2.8 % All Other 36.6 % 38.0 % Total 100 % 100 % An indicator of the performance of our owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels is REVPAR, as it measures the period over period growth in rooms revenue for comparable properties. This is particularly the case in the United States where there is no impact on this measure from foreign exchange rates. Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2004 Continuing Operations Revenues. Total revenues, including other revenues from managed and franchised properties, were $5.977 billion, an increase of $609 million when compared to 2004 levels. Revenues reflect a 5.7% increase in revenues from our owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels to $3.517 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005 when compared to $3.326 billion in the corresponding period of 2004, a 38.9% increase in vacation ownership and residential revenues to $889 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 when compared to $640 million in the corresponding period of 2004, a 19.6% increase in management fees, franchise fees and other income to $501 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 when compared to $419 million 27 Table of Contents in the corresponding period of 2004 and an increase of $87 million in other revenues from managed and franchised properties to $1.070 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005 when compared to $983 million in the corresponding period of 2004. The increase in revenues from owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels is due primarily to strong results at our owned hotels in New York, New York, the Hawaiian Islands, Los Angeles, California, San Diego California, Atlanta, Georgia, Seattle, Washington and Houston, Texas, partially offset by the loss of business due to Hurricanes Dennis, Katrina, Rita and Wilma at our two owned hotels and one joint venture hotel in New Orleans, two owned hotels in Florida and two owned hotels in Cancun, Mexico. Revenues at our Same Store Owned Hotels (119 hotels for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, excluding 12 hotels sold or closed and 11 hotels undergoing significant repositionings or without comparable results in 2005 and 2004) increased 8.2%, or $240 million, to $3.183 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005 when compared to $2.943 billion in the same period of 2004 due primarily to an increase in REVPAR. REVPAR at our Same Store Owned Hotels increased 10.9% to $123.14 for the year ended December 31, 2005 when compared to the corresponding 2004 period. The increase in REVPAR at these Same Store Owned Hotels was attributed to increases in occupancy rates to 70.5% in the year ended December 31, 2005 when compared to 68.3% in the same period in 2004, and a 7.5% increase in ADR to $174.70 for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $162.50 for the corresponding 2004 period. REVPAR at Same Store Owned Hotels in North America increased 11.7% for the year ended December 31, 2005 when compared to the same period of 2004 due to increased transient and group travel business for the period, primarily at our large owned hotels in the major United States cities and destinations discussed above. REVPAR at our international Same Store Owned Hotels increased by 8.8% for the year ended December 31, 2005 when compared to the same period of 2004, with Europe, where we have our biggest concentration of international owned hotels, increasing 7.8%. REVPAR for Same Store Owned Hotels internationally increased 6.8% for the year ended December 31, 2005 excluding the favorable effects of foreign currency translation. REVPAR for Same Store Owned Hotels in Europe increased 6.5% excluding the favorable effects of foreign currency translation. The increase in vacation ownership and residential sales and services is primarily due to sales of residential units at the St. Regis Museum Tower in San Francisco, California, which did not begin until the fourth quarter of 2004. In the year ended December 31, 2005, we recognized approximately $183 million of revenues from the San Francisco project compared to sales of $15 million in 2004. The St. Regis Museum Tower opened in November 2005 with 260 hotel rooms and 102 condominium units. The increase in vacation ownership and residential sales and services in 2005 is also due to an increase in the sales of VOIs of 11.3% to $591 million in 2005 compared to $531 million in 2004. These increases represent increased sales volume as well as the revenue recognition from progressing and completed projects accounted for under the percentage of completion accounting methodology as required by generally accepted accounting principles primarily at the Westin Kaanapali Ocean Resort Villas in Maui, Hawaii, the Westin Kierland Resort and Spa in Scottsdale, Arizona, and the Sheraton Vistana Villages in Orlando, Florida, partially offset by reduced revenues at the Westin Mission Hills Resort in Rancho Mirage, California where substantially all of the available inventory has now been sold. Contract sales of VOI inventory, which represents vacation ownership revenues before adjustments for percentage of completion accounting and rescission and excluding fractional sales at the St. Regis Aspen, increased 14.7% in the year ended December 31, 2005 when compared to the same period in 2004. The increase in management fees, franchise fees and other income of $82 million was primarily a result of increased management and franchise fees of $59 million to $362 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 due to improved operating results at the underlying hotels, the addition of new managed and franchised hotels, including approximately $5 million of fees earned on the Le Mridien hotels for the six week period that we managed and franchised these hotels in 2005, and certain termination fees offset by lost fees from contracts that were terminated during 2005. The increase in other income is also due to increased revenues from our Bliss and Remede spas and from the sales of Bliss and Remede products. Other revenues and expenses from managed and franchised properties increased to $1.070 billion from $983 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These revenues represent reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed hotel properties and franchisees and relate primarily to 28 Table of Contents payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer. Since the reimbursements are made based upon the costs incurred with no added margin, these revenues and corresponding expenses have no effect on our operating income and our net income. Operating Income. Our total operating income was $822 million in the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $653 million in 2004. Excluding depreciation and amortization of $407 million and $431 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, operating income increased 13.4% or $145 million to $1.229 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005 when compared to $1.084 billion in the same period in 2004, primarily due to the improved owned hotel performance and vacation ownership and residential sales discussed above. Operating income at our hotel segment was $792 million in the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $664 million in the same period of 2004. Our strong results at owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels were partially offset by the negative impact of Hurricanes Dennis, Katrina, Rita and Wilma. In addition to the lost business at two owned hotels and a joint venture hotel in New Orleans, two owned hotels in Florida and two owned hotels in Cancun, Mexico, we incurred insurance deductible expenses associated with the property damage. Operating income for the vacation ownership and residential segment was $215 million in the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $142 million for the same period in 2004 primarily due to the sale of residential units at the St. Regis Museum Tower in San Francisco, California, the significant increase in sales of VOIs and percentage of completion accounting methodology discussed above. Restructuring and Other Special Charges (Credits), Net. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, we recorded $13 million in restructuring and other special charges primarily related to severance costs in connection with our corporate restructuring as a result of our planned disposition of significant real estate assets and transition costs associated with the Le Mridien transaction. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, we reversed a $37 million reserve previously recorded through restructuring and other special charges due to a favorable judgment in a litigation matter. Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation expense decreased $26 million to $387 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $413 million in the corresponding period of 2004 primarily due to reduced depreciation from assets sold during 2005 and due to the fact that we ceased depreciation in November and December 2005 on the 41 hotels classified as held for sale at December 31, 2005, partially offset by additional depreciation expense resulting from capital expenditures at our owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels in the past 12 months. Amortization expense increased to $20 million in the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $18 million in the corresponding period of 2004. Gain on Sale of VOI Notes Receivable. Gains from the sale of VOI receivables of $25 million and $14 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, are primarily due to the sale of approximately $221 million and $113 million of vacation ownership receivables during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, our remaining fixed rate VOI notes receivable were approximately $190 million and $180 million, respectively. Net Interest Expense. Net interest expense decreased to $239 million from $254 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, due to a reduction in our level of debt as well as interest income earned from significant cash on hand in 2005. Our weighted average interest rate was 6.27% at December 31, 2005 versus 5.81% at December 31, 2004. Gain (Loss) on Asset Dispositions and Impairments, Net. During 2005, we recorded a net loss of $30 million primarily related to the impairment of a hotel and impairment charges associated with our owned Sheraton hotel in Cancun, Mexico that is being partially demolished to build vacation ownership units. These losses were offset by net gains recorded on the sale of several hotels in 2005. During 2004, we recorded a net loss of $33 million primarily related to the sale of two hotels in 2004, the sale of one hotel in January 2005, and three investments deemed impaired in 2004. 29 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the loss from operations represents a $2 million sales and use tax assessment related to periods prior to our disposal of our gaming business, which was disposed of in 1999, offset by a $1 million income tax benefit related to this business. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the net gain on dispositions includes $16 million related to the favorable resolution of certain tax matters and $10 million primarily related to the reversal of reserves, both of which related to our former gaming business. The reserves were reversed as the related contingencies were resolved. Income Tax Expense. The effective income tax rate for continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 was 34.1% compared to 10.5% in 2004. The increase was primarily due to $47 million of tax expense on the adoption of a plan to repatriate foreign earnings in accordance with the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and $52 million of additional tax expense related to our 1998 disposition of ITT World Directories recorded in 2005. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2005 also includes a net tax credit of $15 million related to the deferred gain on the sale of the Hotel Danieli in Venice, Italy and an $8 million benefit related to tax refunds for tax years prior to the 1995 split up of ITT Corporation. Our effective income tax rate is determined by the level and composition of pre tax income subject to varying foreign, state and local taxes and other items. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2004 includes a $28 million benefit primarily related to the reversal of tax reserves as a result of the resolution of certain tax matters during the year. Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2003 Continuing Operations Revenues. Total revenues, including other revenues from managed and franchised properties, were $5.368 billion, an increase of $738 million when compared to 2003 levels. Revenues reflect a 7.8% increase in revenues from our owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels to $3.326 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004 when compared to $3.085 billion in the corresponding period of 2003, an increase of $164 million in management fees, franchise fees and other income to $419 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 when compared to $255 million in the corresponding period of 2003, an increase of $201 million in vacation ownership and residential revenues to $640 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 when compared to $439 million in the corresponding period of 2003 and an increase of $132 million in other revenues from managed and franchised properties to $983 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 when compared to $851 million in the corresponding period of 2003. The increase in revenues from owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels is due in large part to the continued economic recovery, particularly its effect on the hospitality industry. The war in Iraq, the SARS epidemic and the weakened worldwide economic environment in 2003 negatively impacted the results for a substantial part of the year ended December 31, 2003. Results in 2004 were also favorably impacted by the addition of the Sheraton Kauai in Hawaii, which we acquired in March 2004. These improved results in 2004 were offset, in part, by the absence in 2004 of the revenues generated by 16 non strategic domestic hotels and four hotels in Costa Smeralda, Italy, which were, for the most part, sold in the first half of 2003. Revenues from these hotels in 2003 were $110 million. Revenues at our hotels owned during both periods (Same Store Owned Hotels) (138 hotels for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, excluding 26 hotels sold or closed or without comparable results in 2004 and 2003) increased 11.4%, or $333 million, to $3.266 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004 when compared to $2.933 billion in the same period of 2003 due primarily to an increase in REVPAR. REVPAR at our Same Store Owned Hotels increased 13.0% to $110.81 for the year ended December 31, 2004 when compared to the corresponding 2003 period. The increase in REVPAR was attributed to increases in occupancy rates to 68.5% in the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 64.7% in the same period in 2003, and a 6.8% increase in ADR at these Same Store Owned Hotels to $161.74 for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to $151.49 for the corresponding 2003 period. REVPAR at Same Store Owned Hotels in North America increased 12.1% for the year ended December 31, 2004 when compared to the same period of 2003 due to increased transient and group travel business for the period. REVPAR growth at these hotels, and thereby revenues, was strongest in major metropolitan cities such as 30 Table of Contents New York, Boston, Toronto and Los Angeles where we have a large concentration of owned hotels. REVPAR at our international Same Store Owned Hotels increased by 15.6% for the year ended December 31, 2004 when compared to the same period of 2003, with Europe, where we have our biggest concentration of international owned hotels, increasing 13.2%. REVPAR for Same Store Owned Hotels internationally increased 6.7% for the year ended December 31, 2004 excluding the favorable effects of foreign currency translation. REVPAR for Same Store Owned Hotels in Europe increased 3.1% excluding the favorable effect of foreign currency translation. The increase in vacation ownership and residential sales and services is primarily due to the increase in the sales of VOIs of 47.1% to $531 million in 2004 compared to $361 million in 2003. These increases represent increased sales volume as well as the revenue recognition from progressing and completed projects accounted for under the percentage of completion accounting methodology as required by generally accepted accounting principles primarily at the Westin Kaanapali Ocean Resort Villas in Maui, Hawaii, The St. Regis in Aspen, Colorado, the Westin Kierland Resort and Spa in Scottsdale, Arizona, the Sheraton Vistana Villages in Orlando, Florida, and the Westin Mission Hills Resort in Rancho Mirage, California. Contract sales of VOI inventory, which represents vacation ownership revenues before adjustments for percentage of completion accounting and rescissions and excluding fractional sales at the St. Regis Aspen and residential sales at the St. Regis Museum Tower in San Francisco, California described below, increased 28.4% in the year ended December 31, 2004 when compared to the same period in 2003. The increase in vacation ownership and residential sales in 2004, when compared to 2003, was also due to sales of fractional units at the St. Regis in Aspen, Colorado and residential units at the St. Regis Museum Tower in San Francisco, California, both of which were new projects in 2004. In December 2004, we completed the conversion of 98 guest rooms at the St. Regis in Aspen into 25 fractional units, which are being sold in four week intervals, and 20 new hotel rooms. In 2004, we recognized approximately $51 million of revenues from this project. We also began selling condominiums at the St. Regis Museum Tower in San Francisco in late 2004 and recognized approximately $15 million of revenues from this project in 2004. In 2004, the St. Regis Museum Tower was under construction and expected to open in the summer of 2005 with 260 hotel rooms and 102 condominium units. The increase in management fees, franchise fees and other income of $164 million was primarily due to the inclusion of approximately $49 million of revenues from the Bliss spas and product sales, which were acquired at the beginning of 2004, and approximately $46 million of income (including the impact of foreign exchange rates) earned on the Le Mridien debt participation acquired by us in late December 2003. Additionally, management and franchise fees increased approximately $53 million to $303 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, when compared to $250 million in the same period of 2003, due to strong top line growth resulting from the economic recovery discussed earlier. Other revenues and expenses from managed and franchised properties increased to $983 million from $851 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These revenues represent reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed hotel properties and franchisees and relate primarily to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer. Since the reimbursements are made based upon the costs incurred with no added margin, these revenues and corresponding expenses have no effect on our operating income and our net income. Operating Income. Our total operating income was $653 million in the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to $427 million in 2003. Excluding depreciation and amortization of $431 million and $429 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, operating income increased 26.6% or $228 million to $1.084 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004 when compared to $856 million in the same period in 2003, primarily due to the improved owned hotel performance and vacation ownership sales discussed above, offset in part by certain non recurring increases in selling, general, and administrative costs, including the accrual, not payment, for separation costs for our Executive Chairman as provided for in his employment agreement, higher incentive compensation costs commensurate with our improved performance, certain legal settlement costs, and costs associated with our World Conference in January 2004 (we did not have a conference in the prior year). 31 Table of Contents Operating income at our hotel segment was $664 million in the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to $445 million in the same period of 2003. The improved operating results at our owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels more than offset the absence of operating income from the hotels sold in 2003 as discussed above, as well as the increased energy and health insurance costs. Operating income for the vacation ownership and residential segment was $142 million in the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to $89 million for the same period in 2003 primarily due to the significant increase in income from the sales of VOIs and the percentage of completion accounting methodology discussed above. Restructuring and Other Special Credits, Net. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, we reversed a $37 million reserve previously recorded through restructuring and other special charges due to a favorable judgment in a litigation matter. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, we received $12 million in a favorable settlement of a litigation matter. This credit was offset by an increase of $13 million in a reserve for legal defense costs associated with a separate litigation matter. Additionally, we reversed a $9 million liability that was originally established in 1997 for the ITT Excess Pension Plan and is no longer required as we finalized the settlement of the remaining obligations associated with the plan and reversed $1 million related to the collection of receivables previously deemed impaired. Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation expense increased $3 million to $413 million during the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to $410 million in the corresponding period of 2003. This slight increase was due to additional depreciation expense resulting from capital expenditures at our owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels in the past 12 months. Amortization expense decreased to $18 million in the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to $19 million in the corresponding period of 2003. Gain on Sale of VOI Notes Receivable. Gains from the sale of VOI receivables of $14 million and $15 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively, are primarily due to the sale of $113 million and $181 million of vacation ownership receivables during the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Net Interest Expense. Interest expense, which is net of discontinued operations allocations of $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, decreased to $254 million from $282 million. This decrease was due primarily to the lower debt balances in 2004 compared to the same period of 2003 as a result of the paydown of debt in 2003 with the proceeds from asset sales, the payoff of the Series B Convertible Senior Notes in 2004, and the amortization of deferred gains recorded as a result of interest rate swap terminations completed in early March 2004, offset in part by slightly higher interest rates. Our weighted average interest rate was 5.81% at December 31, 2004 versus 5.46% at December 31, 2003. Loss On Asset Dispositions and Impairments, Net. During 2004, we recorded a net loss of $33 million primarily related to the sale of two hotels in 2004, the sale of one hotel in January 2005, and three investments deemed impaired in 2004. During 2003, we recorded a $181 million charge related to the impairment of 18 non core domestic hotels that were held for sale. We sold 16 of these hotels for net proceeds of $404 million. We also recorded a $9 million gain on the sale of a 51% interest in undeveloped land in Costa Smeralda in Sardinia, Italy. This gain was offset by a $9 million write down of the value of a hotel which was formerly operated together with one of the non core domestic hotels and is now closed and under review for alternative use and a $2 million charge related to an impairment of an investment. Discontinued Operations. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the net gain on dispositions includes $16 million related to the favorable resolution of certain tax matters and $10 million primarily related to the reversal of reserves, both of which related to our former gaming business which was disposed of in 1999. The reserves were reversed as the related contingencies were resolved. For the year ended December 31, 2003, loss from discontinued operations represents the results of the Principe di Savoia Hotel in Milan, Italy (Principe) net of $7 million of allocated interest expense. We sold the Principe in June 2003, with no continuing involvement. The net gain on dispositions for the year ended December 31, 2003 consists of $174 million of gains recorded in connection with the sale of the Principe on June 30, 2003 and the reversal of a $32 million accrual relating to our former gaming business disposed of in 32 Table of Contents 1999 and 2000. We believe that these accruals are no longer required as the related contingencies have been resolved. Income Tax Expense. The effective income tax rate for continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 was approximately 10.5%. Our effective income tax rate is determined by the level and composition of pre tax income subject to varying foreign, state and local taxes and other items. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2004 benefited from approximately $28 million primarily related to the reversal of tax reserves as a result of the resolution of certain tax matters during the year. For the year ended December 31, 2003 we had a tax benefit of $113 million on a pre tax loss of $11 million, primarily due to the tax exempt Trust income and the favorable settlement of various tax matters. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash From Operating Activities Cash flow from operating activities is the principal source of cash used to fund our operating expenses, interest payments on debt, maintenance capital expenditures and distribution payments by the Trust. We anticipate that cash flow provided by operating activities will be sufficient to service these cash requirements. We declared a distribution of $0.84 per Share to shareholders of record on December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. We paid the 2003 distribution in January 2004, the 2004 distribution in January 2005, and the 2005 distribution in January 2006. In connection with the expected sale of 38 hotels to Host Marriott Corporation, on February 17, 2006, the Trust declared a dividend of $0.21 per Share to shareholders of record on February 28, 2006, which will be paid on March 10, 2006. In addition, on February 10, 2006, the Board approved a dividend policy pursuant to which it is anticipated that the dividend will be held constant at $0.84 per Share, including the first quarter dividend of $0.21. We believe that existing borrowing availability together with capacity from additional borrowings and cash from operations will be adequate to meet all funding requirements for our operating expenses, principal and interest payments on debt, maintenance capital expenditures and distribution payments by the Trust for the foreseeable future. State and local regulations governing sales of VOIs allow the purchaser of such a VOI to rescind the sale subsequent to its completion for a pre specified number of days. As such, cash collected from such sales during the rescission period, as well as cash collected from sales before the certificate of occupancy is obtained, are both classified as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we have $216 million and $200 million, respectively, of such restricted cash. In addition, provisions of certain of our secured debt require that cash reserves be maintained. Additional cash reserves are required if aggregate operations of the related hotels fall below a specified level over a specified time period. Additional cash reserves became required in late 2003 following a difficult period in the hospitality industry, resulting from the war in Iraq and the worldwide economic downturn. The industry performance has since improved substantially, and in August 2005, the aggregate hotel operations met the specified levels over the required time period, and the additional cash reserves, plus accrued interest, were released to us. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, $9 million and $132 million, respectively, is classified as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheets related to these required cash reserves. Cash From (Used for) Investing Activities In November 2005, we acquired the Le Mridien brand and the related management and franchise business for the portfolio of 122 hotels and resorts for approximately $225 million. The purchase price was funded from available cash and the return of the original Le Mridien investment. In limited cases, we have made loans to owners of or partners in hotel or resort ventures for which we have a management or franchise agreement. Loans outstanding under this program, excluding the Westin Boston, Seaport Hotel discussed below, totaled $151 million at December 31, 2005. We evaluate these loans for impairment, and at December 31, 2005, believe these loans are collectible. Unfunded loan commitments, excluding the Westin Boston, Seaport Hotel discussed below, aggregating $28 million were outstanding at 33 Table of Contents December 31, 2005, of which $8 million are expected to be funded in 2006 and $10 million are expected to be funded in total. These loans typically are secured by pledges of project ownership interests and or mortgages on the projects. We also have $90 million of equity and other potential contributions associated with managed or joint venture properties, $18 million of which is expected to be funded in 2006. Additionally, during 2004, we entered into a long term management contract to manage the Westin Boston, Seaport Hotel in Boston, Massachusetts, which is under construction and scheduled to open in mid 2006. In connection with this project, we agreed to provide up to $28 million in mezzanine loans and other investments (all of which has been funded) as well as various guarantees, including a principal repayment guarantee for the term of the senior debt (four years with a one year extension option), which is capped at $40 million, and a debt service guarantee during the term of the senior debt which is limited to the interest expense on the amounts drawn under such debt and principal amortization. Any payments under the debt service guarantee, attributable to principal, will reduce the cap under the principal repayment guarantee. The fair value of these guarantees of $3 million is reflected in other liabilities in our accompanying balance sheet as of December 31, 2005. In addition, we have issued a completion guarantee for this approximate $200 million project. In the event the completion guarantee is called on, we would have recourse to a guaranteed maximum price contract from the general contractor, performance bonds from all major trade contractors and a payment bond from the general contractor. We would only be required to perform under the completion guaranty in the event of a default by the general contractor that is not cured by the contractor or the applicable bonds. We do not anticipate that we will be required to perform under these guarantees. Surety bonds issued on our behalf as of December 31, 2005 totaled $51 million, the majority of which were required by state or local governments relating to our vacation ownership operations and by our insurers to secure large deductible insurance programs. To secure management contracts, we may provide performance guarantees to third party owners. Most of these performance guarantees allow us to terminate the contract rather than fund shortfalls if certain performance levels are not met. In limited cases, we are obliged to fund shortfalls in performance levels through the issuance of loans. As of December 31, 2005, we had six management contracts with performance guarantees with possible cash outlays of up to $75 million, $50 million of which, if required, would be funded over several years and would be largely offset by management fees received under these contracts. Many of the performance tests are multi year tests, are tied to the results of a competitive set of hotels, and have exclusions for force majeure and acts of war and terrorism. We do not anticipate any significant funding under the performance guarantees in 2006. In addition, we have agreed to guarantee certain performance levels at a managed property that has authorized VOI sales and marketing. The exact amount and nature of the guaranty is currently under dispute. However, we do not believe that any payments under this guaranty will be significant. In connection with the acquisition of the Le Mridien brand in November 2005, we assumed the obligation to guarantee certain performance levels at one Le Mridien managed hotel for the periods 2007 through 2013. This guarantee is uncapped, and we are still evaluating the potential impact. We do not anticipate losing a significant number of management or franchise contracts in 2006. In connection with the purchase of the Le Mridien brand in November 2005, we were indemnified for certain of Le Mridiens historical liabilities by the entity that bought Le Mridiens owned and leased hotel portfolio. The indemnity is limited to the financial resources of that entity. At this time, we believe that it is unlikely that we will have to fund any of these liabilities. 34 Table of Contents We had the following contractual obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2005 (in millions): Due in Less Due in Due in Due After Total Than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years Long term debt $ 4,143 $ 1,219 $ 851 $ 481 $ 1,592 Capital lease obligations(1) 2 2 Operating lease obligations 1,142 78 140 125 799 Unconditional purchase obligations(2) 135 45 57 25 8 Other long term obligations Total contractual obligations $ 5,422 $ 1,342 $ 1,048 $ 631 $ 2,401 (1) Excludes sublease income of $2 million.

In January 2004, we acquired a 95% interest in Bliss World LLC which at that time operated three stand alone spas (two in New York, New York and one in London, England) and a beauty products business with distribution through its own internet site and catalogue as well as through third party retail stores. The purchase price for the acquired interest was approximately $25 million, and was funded from available cash. In 2005, we acquired the remaining 5% interest for approximately $1 million. We intend to finance the acquisition of additional hotel properties (including equity investments), hotel renovations, VOI and residential construction, capital improvements, technology spend and other core and ancillary business acquisitions and investments and provide for general corporate purposes (including dividend payments) through our credit facilities described below, through the net proceeds from dispositions, through the assumption of debt, through the issuance of additional equity or debt securities and from cash generated from operations. We are actively reviewing our business to identify properties or other assets that we believe either are non core (including hotels where the return on invested capital is not adequate), no longer complement our business, are in markets which may not benefit us as much as other markets during an economic recovery or could be sold at significant premiums. We are focused on restructuring and enhancing real estate returns and monetizing investments. In 2005 we sold ten hotels for cash proceeds of approximately $510 million and, in January 2006, we sold four hotels for cash proceeds of approximately $234 million. Additionally, we have entered into an agreement to sell approximately $4.1 billion of assets to Host Marriott Corporation which we expect to consummate in the second quarter of 2006. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to complete dispositions on commercially reasonable terms or at all. 35 Table of Contents Cash Used for Financing Activities The following is a summary of our debt portfolio (including capital leases) as of December 31, 2005: Amount Interest Rate at Outstanding at December 31, Average December 31, 2005(a) Interest Terms 2005 Maturity (Dollars in millions) (In years) Floating Rate Debt Senior Credit Facility: Term Loan $ 450 LIBOR(b) +1.25% 5.64 % 0.7 Revolving Credit Facility 11 CBA + 1.25% 4.57 % 0.8 Mortgages and Other 481 Various 4.05 % 1.4 Interest Rate Swaps 300 8.77 % Total/ Average $ 1,242 5.77 % 1.0 Fixed Rate Debt Sheraton Holding Public Debt $ 148 7.75 % 19.9 Senior Notes 1,494 (c) 6.70 % 3.9 Convertible Debt 360 3.50 % 0.4 Mortgages and Other 649 7.07 % 4.6 Interest Rate Swaps (300 ) 7.88 % Total/ Average $ 2,351 6.23 % 4.5 Floating Rate Debt Classified as Held for Sale $ 25 4.30 % 4.0 Fixed Rate Debt Classified as Held for Sale $ 527 7.59 % 10.1 Total Debt Total Debt and Average Terms $ 4,145 6.27 % 4.4 (a) Excludes approximately $469 million of our share of unconsolidated joint venture debt, all of which was non recourse.

Recent Events. On February 21, 2006, we began the process to redeem the Class B EPS for $38.50 per share. The redemption is expected to be completed at the end of the first quarter. In February 2006, we closed a new, five year $1.5 billion Senior Credit Facility (2006 Facility). The 2006 Facility replaces the existing $1.45 billion Revolving and Term Loan Credit Agreement (Existing Facility) which would have matured in October 2006. Approximately $240 million of the Term Loan balance under the Existing Facility was paid down with cash and the remainder was refinanced with the 2006 Facility. The 2006 Facility is expected to be used for general corporate purposes. The 2006 Facility matures February 10, 2011 and has a current interest rate of LIBOR + 0.70%. We currently expect to be in compliance with all covenants of the 2006 Facility. In February 2006 we defeased approximately $470 million of debt secured in part by several hotels that are part of the transaction with Host Marriott Corporation. In order to accomplish this, we purchased Treasury securities sufficient to make the monthly debt service payments and the balloon payment due under the loan agreement. The Treasury securities were then substituted for the real estate and hotels that originally served as collateral for the loan. As part of the defeasance, the Treasury securities and the debt were transferred to a third party successor borrower who in turn is liable for all obligations under this debt. As such, this debt will not be reflected on our balance sheet in the future. 36 Table of Contents Fiscal 2005 Developments. On November 14, 2005, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell 38 properties to Host for approximately $4.1 billion (based on the closing price of Hosts stock immediately prior to that date) including 133.5 million shares of Host stock and approximately $1,767 million in cash and debt assumption. As part of this transaction, a subsidiary of Host will be acquiring, among other assets, all the stock of the Trust in a transaction that will be taxable to shareholders. Starwoods shareholders will receive 0.6122 shares of Host stock and 50.3 cents in cash for each share of Class B stock they own. We will receive approximately $1,645 million of the proceeds in the form of cash and debt assumption. Under the terms of the Master Agreement and Plan of Merger (Merger Agreement) with Host, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts and Host is required to cooperate with us in such efforts to receive the consent of the bondholders of the $450 million, 2015 Sheraton Holding Corporation (SHC) bonds to enable these bonds to remain obligations of SHC following the transaction with Host. We and Host are currently in discussions regarding the form and timing of this consent, including whether to amend the Merger Agreement such that a consent would not be pursued. In the event the consent is not received or we and Host agree not to go through the consent process, it is expected that we will seek to retain the debt and, if retained, will be paid an additional $450 million in cash. In addition, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Host has given notice that Host is excluding the $150 million, 2025 SHC bonds as Specified Indebtedness (as defined in the Merger Agreement), and therefore SHC will not retain this debt. The Company expects that these bonds will be redeemed. In May 2003, we issued $360 million of convertible notes. Holders of these notes can force conversion if the underlying Shares trade at more than 120% of the conversion price for 20 out of 30 trading days ending on the last trading day of the calendar quarter preceding the calendar quarter in which the conversion occurs. This conversion right was met in the fourth quarter of 2005 as the share prices closed at over $60 for 20 days. We expect the principal portion of these notes will be settled in cash with the excess amount settled in shares. As a result, approximately 400,000 shares are included in our December 31, 2005 diluted shares based on our closing stock price of $63.86 on December 30, 2005. On October 22, 2004, the President signed the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act). The Act creates a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85 percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. In order to repatriate funds in accordance with the Act, in October 2005 we increased several existing bank credit lines available to our wholly owned subsidiary, Starwood Italia, from 129 million euros to 399 million euros, approximately 350 million euros of which was borrowed at that time. These credit lines had interest rates ranging from Euribor + 0.50% to Euribor + 0.85% and maturities ranging from April 1, 2006 to May 8, 2007. These proceeds, along with approximately 100 million euros which Starwood Italia borrowed from our Corporate Credit Line (total borrowings of 450 million euros) were used to temporarily finance the repatriation of approximately $550 million pursuant to the Act. These temporary borrowings are being paid off with Starwood Italia asset sales, and as of December 31, 2005, approximately 175 million euros had been repaid. We expect the remainder of these borrowings to be repaid over the course of 2006. In connection with the repatriation, we recorded a tax liability of approximately $47 million in the third quarter of 2005, when our Board of Directors adopted the repatriation plan. In accordance with the Act, the repatriated funds were reinvested pursuant to the terms of a domestic reinvestment plan which was approved by our Board of Directors. Fiscal 2004 Developments. In August 2004, we completed a $300 million addition to the term loan under our existing Senior Credit Facility. The proceeds were used to repay a portion of the existing revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. The existing Senior Credit Facility then consisted of a $1.0 billion revolving loan and a $600 million term loan. In February 2006, we closed a new Senior Credit Facility which replaced the existing facility. See further discussion under the subheading Recent Events. In March 2004, we terminated certain interest rate swap agreements, with a notional amount of $1 billion, under which we paid floating rates and received fixed rates of interest (the Fair Value Swaps), resulting in a $33 million cash payment to us. These proceeds were used for general corporate purposes and will result in a decrease to interest expense for the corresponding underlying debt (Sheraton Holding Public 37 Table of Contents Debt and the Senior Notes) through 2007, the final scheduled maturity date of the terminated Fair Value Swaps. In order to adjust our fixed versus floating rate debt position, we immediately entered into two new Fair Value Swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300 million. In May 2001, we sold an aggregate face amount of $572 million Series B zero coupon convertible senior notes (along with $244 million of Series A notes, which were subsequently repurchased in May 2002) due 2021. The Series B convertible notes were convertible when the market price of our Shares exceeds 120% of the then accreted conversion price of the convertible senior notes. The maximum conversion of notes was approximately 5.8 million Shares. Holders of Series B Convertible Senior Notes put the majority of these notes to us in May 2004 for a purchase price of approximately $311 million, and in December 2004 we purchased the remaining $20 million, leaving a zero balance as of December 31, 2004. Other. We have approximately $1.219 billion of outstanding debt maturing in 2006. Based upon the current level of operations, management believes that our cash flow from operations and pending asset sales, together with our significant cash balances (approximately $1.204 billion at December 31, 2005, including $307 million, of restricted cash discussed earlier), available borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility (approximately $860 million at December 31, 2005), available borrowings from international revolving lines of credit (approximately $83 million at December 31, 2005), and capacity for additional borrowings will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for scheduled maturities, dividends, working capital, capital expenditures, marketing and advertising program expenditures, other discretionary investments, interest and scheduled principal payments for the foreseeable future. However, we have a substantial amount of indebtedness at December 31, 2005. There can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance our indebtedness as it becomes due and, if refinanced, on favorable terms. In addition, there can be no assurance that our business will continue to generate cash flow at or above historical levels or that currently anticipated results will be achieved. We maintain non U.S. dollar denominated debt, which provides a hedge of our international net assets and operations but also exposes our debt balance to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was a net decrease in debt of approximately $23 million compared to a net increase in debt in 2004 of $13 million. Our debt balance is also affected by changes in interest rates as a result of our Fair Value Swaps. The fair market value of the Fair Value Swaps is recorded as an asset or liability and as the Fair Value Swaps are deemed to be effective, an adjustment is recorded against the corresponding debt. At December 31, 2005, our debt included a decrease of approximately $3 million related to the unamortized gains on terminated Fair Value Swaps and the fair market value of current Fair Value Swap liabilities. At December 31, 2004 our debt included an increase of approximately $29 million related to Fair Value Swap liabilities. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt, we may be required to sell additional assets, reduce capital expenditures, refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing. Our ability to make scheduled principal payments, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance and financial results, which, to a certain extent, are subject to general conditions in or affecting the hotel and vacation ownership industries and to general economic, political, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors beyond our control. On January 27, 2005, Standard & Poors (S & P) gave us a BB+ rating with a stable outlook. On March 7, 2005, Moodys Investor Services (Moodys) gave us a Bal rating with a stable outlook. Following the announcement of the Host Marriott transaction on November 14, 2005, the rating agencies took the following actions: S & P affirmed our BB+ rating and revised their outlook to positive from stable. At the same time, S & P placed the BB+ ratings of Sheraton Holding Corporation on CreditWatch with negative implications, reflecting the possibility that these obligations will be assumed by Host Marriott, a lower rated entity. 38 Table of Contents Moodys affirmed our Ba1 rating and placed it on review for a potential upgrade, and simultaneously placed the Ba1 ratings of Sheraton Holding Corporation on review for possible downgrade for the same reasons cited above. A distribution of $0.84 per Share was paid in January 2006, January 2005 and January 2004 to shareholders of record as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In connection with the expected sale of 38 hotels to Host Marriott Corporation, on February 17, 2006, the Trust declared a dividend of $0.21 per Share to shareholders of record on February 28, 2006, which will be paid on March 10, 2006. In addition, on February 10, 2006, the Board approved a dividend policy pursuant to which it is anticipated that the dividend will be held constant at $0.84 per Share, including the first quarter dividend of $0.21. Stock Sales and Repurchases At December 31, 2005, we had outstanding approximately 217 million Shares, 1.1 million partnership units and 587,000 Class A EPS and Class B EPS. Through December 31, 2005, in accordance with the terms of the Class B EPS, approximately 28,000 shares of Class B EPS were redeemed for approximately $1 million in cash. In addition, during 2005, approximately 36,000 shares of Class A EPS were redeemed for approximately $2 million in cash. In October 2005, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $1 billion of Shares under our existing Share repurchase program (the Share Repurchase Program). Pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program, Starwood repurchased 4.0 million Shares in the open market for an aggregate cost of $253 million during 2005 and, through February 23, 2006, an additional 4.3 million Shares were repurchased for an aggregate cost of $272 million in 2006. Approximately $771 million remains available under the Share Repurchase Program. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Our off balance sheet arrangements include beneficial interest in securitizations of $68 million, third party loan guarantees of $47 million, letters of credit of $129 million, unconditional purchase obligations of $135 million and surety bonds of $51 million. These items are more fully discussed earlier in this section and in the Notes to Financial Statements, and Item 8 of Part II of this report. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. In limited instances, we seek to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates by entering into financial arrangements intended to provide a hedge against a portion of the risks associated with such volatility. We continue to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not hedged. 39 Table of Contents Interest rate swap agreements are the primary instruments used to manage interest rate risk. At December 31, 2005, we had two outstanding long term interest rate swap agreements under which we pay variable interest rates and receive fixed interest rates. At December 31, 2005, we had no interest rate swap agreements under which we pay a fixed rate and receive a variable rate. The following table sets forth the scheduled maturities and the total fair value of our debt portfolio: Expected Maturity or Transaction Date Total Fair At December 31, Total at Value at December 31, December 31, 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter 2005 2005 Liabilities Fixed rate (in millions) $ 380 $ 740 $ 22 $ 435 $ 7 $ 1,594 $ 3,178 $ 3,466 Average interest rate 6.61 % Floating rate (in millions) $ 839 $ 85 $ 4 $ 36 $ 3 $ $ 967 $ 967 Average interest rate 4.81 % Interest Rate Swaps Fixed to variable (in millions) $ $ $ $ $ $ 300 $ 300 Average pay rate 8.77 % Average receive rate 7.88 % We use foreign currency hedging instruments to manage exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The gains or losses on the hedging instruments are largely offset by gains or losses on the underlying asset or liability, and consequently, a sudden significant change in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material impact on future net income or cash flows of the hedged item. We monitor our foreign currency exposure on a monthly basis to maximize the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. Changes in the fair value of hedging instruments are classified in the same manner as changes in the underlying assets or liabilities due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2005, the notional amount of our open foreign exchange hedging contracts protecting the value of our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities was approximately $162 million. A hypothetical 10% change in the spot currency exchange rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $16 million in the fair value of the hedges at December 31, 2005, which would be offset by an opposite effect on the related underlying net asset or liability. We enter into a derivative financial arrangement to the extent it meets the objectives described above, and we do not engage in such transactions for trading or speculative purposes. See Note 20. Derivative Financial Instruments in the notes to financial statements filed as part of this Joint Annual Report and incorporated herein by reference for further description of derivative financial instruments.
