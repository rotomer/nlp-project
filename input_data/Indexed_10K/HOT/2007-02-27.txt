Our operations are grouped into two business segments, hotels and vacation ownership and residential operations. Our revenue and earnings are derived primarily from hotel operations, which include management and other fees earned from hotels we manage pursuant to management contracts, the receipt of franchise and other fees and the operation of our owned hotels. Our hotel business emphasizes the global operation of hotels and resorts primarily in the luxury and upscale segment of the lodging industry. We seek to acquire interests in, or management or franchise rights with respect to properties in this segment. At December 31, 2006, our hotel portfolio included owned, leased, managed and franchised hotels totaling 871 hotels with approximately 266,000 rooms in approximately 100 countries, and is comprised of 85 hotels that we own or lease or in which we have a majority equity interest, 426 hotels managed by us on behalf of third party owners (including entities in which we have a minority equity interest) and 360 hotels for which we receive franchise fees. 2 Table of Contents Our revenues and earnings are also derived from the development, ownership and operation of vacation ownership resorts, marketing and selling vacation ownership interests (VOIs) in the resorts and providing financing to customers who purchase such interests. Generally these resorts are marketed under the brand names described above. Additionally, our revenues and earnings are derived from the development, marketing and selling of residential units at mixed use hotel projects owned by us as well as fees earned from the marketing and selling of residential units at mixed use hotel projects developed by third party owners of hotels operated under our brands. At December 31, 2006, we had 25 vacation ownership resorts and residential properties in the United States, Mexico, Aruba and the Bahamas. The Corporation was incorporated in 1980 under the laws of Maryland. Sheraton Hotels & Resorts and Westin Hotels & Resorts, Starwoods largest brands, have been serving guests for more than 60 years. Starwood Vacation Ownership (and its predecessor, Vistana, Inc.) has been selling VOIs for more than 20 years. Our principal executive offices are located at 1111 Westchester Avenue, White Plains, New York 10604, and our telephone number is (914) 640 8100. For a discussion of our revenues, profits, assets and geographical segments, see the notes to financial statements of this Annual Report. For additional information concerning our business, see Item 2. Properties, of this Annual Report. Competitive Strengths Management believes that the following factors contribute to our position as a leader in the lodging and vacation ownership industry and provide a foundation for the Companys business strategy: Brand Strength. We have assumed a leadership position in markets worldwide based on our superior global distribution, coupled with strong brands and brand recognition. Our upscale and luxury brands continue to capture market share from our competitors by aggressively cultivating new customers while maintaining loyalty among the worlds most active travelers. The strength of our brands is evidenced, in part, by the superior ratings received from our hotel guests and from industry publications. Frequent Guest Program. Our loyalty program, Starwood Preferred Guest (SPG), made headlines when it launched in 1999 with a breakthrough policy of no blackout dates and no capacity controls, allowing members to redeem free nights anytime, anywhere. Since then, the program has grown to include more than 33 million members and continues to be cited for its hassle free award redemption, outstanding customer service, dedicated member website and innovative promotions and benefits for elite members. The program yields repeat guest business by uniting a world of distinctive hotels and rewarding customers with the rewards and recognition they want from points that can be used for free hotel stays, indulgent experiences and airline miles with 32 participating airlines. Significant Presence in Top Markets. Our luxury and upscale hotel and resort assets are well positioned throughout the world. These assets are primarily located in major cities and resort areas that management believes have historically demonstrated a strong breadth, depth and growing demand for luxury and upscale hotels and resorts, in which the supply of sites suitable for hotel development has been limited and in which development of such sites is relatively expensive. Premier and Distinctive Properties. We control a distinguished and diversified group of hotel properties throughout the world, including the St. Regis in New York, New York; The Phoenician in Scottsdale, Arizona; the Hotel Gritti Palace in Venice, Italy; and the St. Regis in Beijing, China. These are among the leading hotels in the industry and are at the forefront of providing the highest quality and service. Our properties are consistently recognized as the best of the best by readers of Cond Nast Traveler, who are among the worlds most sophisticated and discerning group of travelers. The January 2007 issue of the Cond Nast Traveler Magazine included 37 Starwood properties among its prestigious Gold List. Scale. As one of the largest hotel and leisure companies focusing on the luxury and upscale full service lodging market, we have the scale to support our core marketing and reservation functions. We also believe that our scale will contribute to lower our cost of operations through purchasing economies in areas such as insurance, 3 Table of Contents energy, telecommunications, technology, employee benefits, food and beverage, furniture, fixtures and equipment and operating supplies. Diversification of Cash Flow and Assets. Management believes that the diversity of our brands, market segments served, revenue sources and geographic locations provide a broad base from which to enhance revenue and profits and to strengthen our global brands. This diversity limits our exposure to any particular lodging or vacation ownership asset, brand or geographic region. While we focus on the luxury and upscale portion of the full service lodging, vacation ownership and residential markets, our brands cater to a diverse group of sub markets within this market. For example, the St. Regis hotels cater to high end hotel and resort clientele while Four Points by Sheraton hotels deliver extensive amenities and services at more affordable rates. The aloft brand will provide a youthful alternative to the commodity lodging of currently existing brands in the select service market segment, and the Element brand will provide modern, upscale hotels for extended stay travel. We derive our cash flow from multiple sources within our hotel and vacation ownership and residential segments, including owned hotels operations, management and franchise fees and the sale of VOIs and residential units. These operations are in geographically diverse locations around the world. The following tables reflect our hotel and vacation ownership and residential properties by type of revenue source and geographical presence by major geographic area as of December 31, 2006: Number of Properties Rooms Managed and unconsolidated joint venture hotels 426 142,000 Franchised hotels 360 95,800 Owned hotels(a) 85 27,800 Vacation ownership resorts and residential properties 25 6,900 Total properties 896 272,500 (a) Includes wholly owned, majority owned and leased hotels.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) discusses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and costs and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those relating to revenue recognition, bad debts, inventories, investments, plant, property and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets, income taxes, financing operations, frequent guest program liability, self insurance claims payable, restructuring costs, retirement benefits and contingencies and litigation. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. 26 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES We believe the following to be our critical accounting policies: Revenue Recognition. Our revenues are primarily derived from the following sources: (1) hotel and resort revenues at our owned, leased and consolidated joint venture properties; (2) vacation ownership and residential revenues; (3) management and franchise revenues; (4) revenues from managed and franchised properties; and (5) other revenues which are ancillary to our operations. Generally, revenues are recognized when the services have been rendered. The following is a description of the composition of our revenues: Owned, Leased and Consolidated Joint Ventures Represents revenue primarily derived from hotel operations, including the rental of rooms and food and beverage sales from owned, leased or consolidated joint venture hotels and resorts. Revenue is recognized when rooms are occupied and services have been rendered. These revenues are impacted by global economic conditions affecting the travel and hospitality industry as well as relative market share of the local competitive set of hotels. REVPAR is a leading indicator of revenue trends at owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels as it measures the period over period growth in rooms revenue for comparable properties. Vacation Ownership and Residential We recognize revenue from VOI sales and financings and the sales of residential units which are typically a component of mixed use projects that include a hotel. Such revenues are impacted by the state of the global economies and, in particular, the U.S. economy, as well as interest rate and other economic conditions affecting the lending market. Revenue is generally recognized upon the buyer demonstrating a sufficient level of initial and continuing involvement. We determine the portion of revenues to recognize for sales accounted for under the percentage of completion method based on judgments and estimates including total project costs to complete. Additionally, we record reserves against these revenues based on expected default levels. Changes in costs could lead to adjustments to the percentage of completion status of a project, which may result in differences in the timing and amount of revenues recognized from the projects. We have also entered into licensing agreements with third party developers to offer consumers branded condominiums or residences. Our fees from these agreements are generally based on the gross sales revenue of units sold. Management and Franchise Revenues Represents fees earned on hotels managed worldwide, usually under long term contracts, franchise fees received in connection with the franchise of the our Sheraton, Westin, Four Points by Sheraton, Le Mridien, St. Regis, W and Luxury Collection brand names, termination fees and the amortization of deferred gains related to sold properties for which we have significant continuing involvement, offset by payments by us under performance and other guarantees. Management fees are comprised of a base fee, which is generally based on a percentage of gross revenues, and an incentive fee, which is generally based on the propertys profitability. For any time during the year, when the provisions of our management contracts allow receipt of incentive fees upon termination, incentive fees are recognized for the fees due and earned as if the contract was terminated at that date, exclusive of any termination fees due or payable. Therefore, during periods prior to year end, the incentive fees recorded may not be indicative of the eventual incentive fees that will be recognized at year end as conditions and incentive hurdle calculations may not be final. Franchise fees are generally based on a percentage of hotel room revenues. As with hotel revenues discussed above, these revenue sources are affected by conditions impacting the travel and hospitality industry as well as competition from other hotel management and franchise companies. Revenues from Managed and Franchised Properties These revenues represent reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed hotel properties and franchisees. These costs relate primarily to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer. Since the reimbursements are made based upon the costs incurred with no added margin, these revenues and corresponding expenses have no effect on our operating income and our net income. Frequent Guest Program. SPG is our frequent guest incentive marketing program. SPG members earn points based on spending at our properties, as incentives to first time buyers of VOIs and residences and through participation in affiliated programs. Points can be redeemed at substantially all of our owned, leased, managed and 27 Table of Contents franchised properties as well as through other redemption opportunities with third parties, such as conversion to airline miles. Properties are charged based on hotel guests qualifying expenditures. Revenue is recognized by participating hotels and resorts when points are redeemed for hotel stays. We, through the services of third party actuarial analysts, determine the fair value of the future redemption obligation based on statistical formulas which project the timing of future point redemption based on historical experience, including an estimate of the breakage for points that will never be redeemed, and an estimate of the points that will eventually be redeemed as well as the cost of reimbursing hotels and other third parties in respect of other redemption opportunities for point redemptions. Actual expenditures for SPG may differ from the actuarially determined liability. The total actuarially determined liability as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 is $409 million and $314 million, respectively. A 10% reduction in the breakage of points would result in an estimated increase of $59 million to the liability at December 31, 2006. Long Lived Assets. We evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets for impairment by comparing the expected undiscounted future cash flows of the assets to the net book value of the assets if certain trigger events occur. If the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the net book value of the assets, the excess of the net book value over the estimated fair value is charged to current earnings. Fair value is based upon discounted cash flows of the assets at a rate deemed reasonable for the type of asset and prevailing market conditions, appraisals and, if appropriate, current estimated net sales proceeds from pending offers. We evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets based on our plans, at the time, for such assets and such qualitative factors as future development in the surrounding area, status of expected local competition and projected incremental income from renovations. Changes to our plans, including a decision to dispose of or change the intended use of an asset, can have a material impact on the carrying value of the asset. Assets Held for Sale. We consider properties to be assets held for sale when management approves and commits to a formal plan to actively market a property or group of properties for sale and a signed sales contract and significant non refundable deposit or contract break up fee exist. Upon designation as an asset held for sale, we record the carrying value of each property or group of properties at the lower of its carrying value which includes allocable segment goodwill or its estimated fair value, less estimated costs to sell, and we stop recording depreciation expense. Any gain realized in connection with the sale of a property for which we have significant continuing involvement (such as through a long term management agreement) is deferred and recognized over the initial term of the related agreement. The operations of the properties held for sale prior to the sale date are recorded in discontinued operations unless we will have continuing involvement (such as through a management or franchise agreement) after the sale. Legal Contingencies. We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations. Income Taxes. We provide for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entitys financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. 28 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion presents an analysis of results of our operations for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2005 Continuing Operations Revenues. Total revenues, including other revenues from managed and franchised properties, were $5.979 billion, an increase of $2 million when compared to 2005 levels. Revenues reflected a 23.5% decrease in revenues from our owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels to $2.692 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006 when compared to $3.517 billion in the corresponding period of 2005, a 39.1% increase in management fees, franchise fees and other income to $697 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 when compared to $501 million in the corresponding period of 2005, a 13.0% increase in vacation ownership and residential revenues to $1.005 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006 when compared to $889 million in the corresponding period of 2005, and an increase of $515 million in other revenues from managed and franchised properties to $1.585 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006 when compared to $1.070 billion in the corresponding period of 2005. The decrease in revenues from owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels of $825 million was primarily due to lost revenues from 45 wholly owned hotels sold or closed during 2006. These hotels had revenues of $384 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $1.299 billion in the corresponding period of 2005. The decrease in revenues from sold hotels was partially offset by business interruption insurance proceeds received in 2006 of approximately $33 million, primarily related to Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Wilma in 2005, and by improved results at our remaining owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels. Revenues at our Same Store Owned Hotels (74 hotels for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, excluding 56 hotels sold or closed and 11 hotels undergoing significant repositionings or without comparable results in 2006 and 2005) increased 8.8%, or $157 million, to $1.942 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006 when compared to $1.785 billion in the same period of 2005 due primarily to an increase in REVPAR. REVPAR at our Same Store Owned Hotels increased 10.1% to $136.33 for the year ended December 31, 2006 when compared to the corresponding 2005 period. The increase in REVPAR at these Same Store Owned Hotels was attributed to increases in occupancy rates to 71.2% in the year ended December 31, 2006 when compared to 69.9% in the same period in 2005, and an 8.2% increase in ADR to $191.56 for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $177.04 for the corresponding 2005 period. REVPAR at Same Store Owned Hotels in North America increased 10.2% for the year ended December 31, 2006 when compared to the same period of 2005. REVPAR growth was particularly strong at our owned hotels in Chicago, Illinois, Boston, Massachusetts, and Seattle, Washington. REVPAR at our international Same Store Owned Hotels increased by 10.0% for the year ended December 31, 2006 when compared to the same period of 2005. REVPAR for Same Store Owned Hotels internationally increased 9.5% excluding the favorable effects of foreign currency translation. The increase in management fees, franchise fees and other income of $196 million was primarily a result of a $202 million increase in management and franchise revenue to $564 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 due to the addition of new managed and franchised hotels. The increase included approximately $44 million of management and franchise fees from the 33 hotels sold to Host, as well as approximately $34 million of revenues from the amortization of the deferred gain associated with the Host Transaction. The increase was also due to $58 million of management and franchise fees from the Le Mridien hotels in 2006 as compared to $5 million in 2005. We acquired the Le Mridien brand and related management and franchise business in November 2005 (the Le Mridien Acquisition). Additionally, improved operating results at the underlying managed and franchised hotels, increased revenue from our Bliss spas and from the sale of Bliss products and income associated with the settlement of a dispute related to an agreement to manage a hotel contributed to the increase in 2006. These increases were partially offset by lost fees from contracts that were terminated in the last 12 months and by lost income on the Le Mridien debt participation which was used to fund a portion of the Le Mridien Acquisition. The increase in vacation ownership and residential sales and services of $116 million was primarily due to increased sales at ongoing projects in Hawaii and Orlando as well as sales of $41 million at a new project in New 29 Table of Contents York City. In addition, we recorded a gain of $17 million on the sale of approximately $133 million of vacation ownership receivables in 2006. The gain on the sale of VOI notes receivable in 2005, prior to our adoption of SFAS No. 152, Accounting for Real Estate Time Sharing Transactions, of $25 million was reflected in a separate line in the consolidated statement of income, below operating income. Contract sales of VOI inventory, which represents vacation ownership revenues before adjustments for percentage of completion accounting and rescission, increased 19.2% in the year ended December 31, 2006 when compared to the same period in 2005. These increases were offset by a decrease in residential sales associated with the residences at the St. Regis Museum Tower in San Francisco which sold out in the first half of 2006. Other revenues and expenses from managed and franchised properties increased to $1.585 billion from $1.070 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. These revenues represent reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed hotel properties and franchisees and relate primarily to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer. Since the reimbursements were made based upon the costs incurred with no added margin, these revenues and corresponding expenses had no effect on our operating income and our net income. Selling, General, Administrative and Other. Selling, general, administrative and other expenses, which includes costs and expenses from our Bliss spas and from the sale of Bliss products, was $470 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 when compared to $370 million in 2005. The increase was primarily due to the impact of stock based compensation, including stock option expense of $47 million. The remaining increase includes investments in our global development capability and costs associated with the launch of our new brands, aloft and Element, as well as the addition of the Le Mridien business. Operating Income. Our total operating income was $839 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $822 million in 2005. Excluding depreciation and amortization of $306 million and $407 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, operating income decreased 6.8% or $84 million to $1.145 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006 when compared to $1.229 billion in the same period in 2005, primarily due to the lost income from the 45 wholly owned hotels sold or closed during 2006 and approximately $47 million of stock option expense recorded in 2006 as a result of the implementation of SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment, a revision of the FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, on January 1, 2006. These items were offset, in part, by the increase in management fees, franchise fees and other income discussed above. Restructuring and Other Special Charges (Credits), Net. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, we recorded $20 million in net restructuring and other special charges primarily related to transition costs associated with the Le Mridien Acquisition in November 2005 and severance costs primarily related to certain executives in connection with the continued corporate restructuring that began at the end of 2005. These charges were offset, in part, by the reversal of accruals for a lease we assumed as part of the merger with Sheraton Holding Corporation (Sheraton Holding) and its subsidiaries (formerly ITT Corporation) in 1998 as the lease matured at the end of 2006 and the accruals exceeded our maximum remaining obligation under the lease. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, we recorded $13 million in restructuring and other special charges primarily related to severance costs in connection with our corporate restructuring as a result of our planned disposition of significant real estate assets and transition costs associated with the Le Mridien Acquisition. Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation expense decreased $107 million to $280 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $387 million in the corresponding period of 2005 primarily because, beginning in November 2005, we ceased depreciation on the hotels included in the Host Transaction, partially offset by additional depreciation expense resulting from capital expenditures at our owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels in the past 12 months. Amortization expense increased to $26 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $20 million in the corresponding period of 2005 primarily due to amortization of intangible assets that we acquired in connection with the Le Mridien Acquisition in November 2005. Gain on Sale of VOI Notes Receivable. Gain on sale of VOI receivable was $25 million in 2005, primarily due to the sale of approximately $221 million of vacation ownership receivables during the year ended December 31, 2005. In 2006 we recorded a $17 million gain on sale of VOI notes receivable related to the sale of 30 Table of Contents approximately $133 million of vacation ownership receivables during 2006. However, as discussed above, the gain is now included in vacation ownership and residential sales and services revenue. Equity Earnings and Gains and Losses from Unconsolidated Ventures, Net. Equity earnings and gains and losses from unconsolidated joint ventures decreased to $61 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $64 million in the same period of 2005. Net Interest Expense. Net interest expense decreased to $215 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $239 million in the same period of 2005, primarily due to interest savings from the reduction of our debt with proceeds from the asset sales discussed earlier offset in part by increased interest rates. In addition, we recorded interest income in 2006 of approximately $13 million in association with the full payment of principal and interest on a loan receivable which was previously reserved. The decrease was partially offset by $37 million of expenses related to the early extinguishment of debt in connection with two transactions completed in the first quarter of 2006 whereby we defeased and were released from certain debt obligations that allowed us to sell certain hotels that previously served as collateral for such debt. These transactions also resulted in the release of other owned hotels as collateral, providing us with flexibility to sell or reposition those hotels. Our weighted average interest rate was 6.97% at December 31, 2006 versus 6.27% at December 31, 2005. Loss on Asset Dispositions and Impairments, Net. During 2006, we recorded a net loss of $3 million primarily related to several offsetting gains and losses, including the sale of ten wholly owned hotels, which were sold unencumbered by management agreements, impairment charges related to various properties, including the Sheraton Cancun which was damaged by Hurricane Wilma in 2005, and an adjustment to reduce the previously recorded gain on the sale of a hotel consummated in 2004 as certain contingencies associated with the sale became probable in 2006. These losses were primarily offset by a gain of $29 million on the sale of our interests in two joint ventures and a $13 million gain as a result of insurance proceeds received as reimbursement for property damage caused by Hurricane Wilma. During 2005, we recorded a net loss of $30 million primarily related to the impairment of a hotel and impairment charges associated with the Sheraton Cancun in Cancun, Mexico which was demolished in order to build vacation ownership units. These losses were offset by net gains recorded on the sale of several hotels in 2005. Income Tax Expense. We recorded an income tax benefit from continuing operations of $434 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to an expense of $219 million in the corresponding period of 2005. The 2006 tax benefit includes a one time benefit of approximately $524 million realized in connection with the Host Transaction, a $59 million benefit due primarily to the completion of various state and federal income tax audits of prior years, a $34 million benefit associated with Companys election to claim U.S. foreign tax credits in 2006 and 2005 and a $32 million benefit associated with the Trust prior to its acquisition by Host. The 2005 income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 included the recognition of $47 million of tax expense as a result of the adoption of a plan to repatriate foreign earnings in accordance with the American Jobs Creation Act and the recording of an additional provision of $52 million related to our 1998 disposition of ITT World Directories. The income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 also included a net tax credit of $15 million related to the deferred gain on the sale of the Hotel Danieli in Venice, Italy, an $8 million benefit related to tax refunds for tax years prior to the 1995 split up of ITT Corporation, and a $64 million benefit associated with the Trust. Our effective income tax rate is determined by the level and composition of pre tax income subject to varying foreign, state and local taxes. Discontinued Operations For the year ended December 31, 2006, the loss on disposition represented a $2 million tax assessment associated with the disposition of our gaming business in 1999. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the loss from operations represented a $2 million sales and use tax assessment related to periods prior to our disposal of our gaming business, offset by a $1 million income tax benefit related to this business. 31 Table of Contents Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change, Net of Tax On January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 152 and recorded a charge of $70 million, net of a $46 million tax benefit, in cumulative effect of accounting change. Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2004 Continuing Operations Revenues. Total revenues, including other revenues from managed and franchised properties, were $5.977 billion, an increase of $609 million when compared to 2004 levels. Revenues reflected a 5.7% increase in revenues from our owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels to $3.517 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005 when compared to $3.326 billion in the corresponding period of 2004, a 38.9% increase in vacation ownership and residential revenues to $889 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 when compared to $640 million in the corresponding period of 2004, a 19.6% increase in management fees, franchise fees and other income to $501 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 when compared to $419 million in the corresponding period of 2004 and an increase of $87 million in other revenues from managed and franchised properties to $1.070 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005 when compared to $983 million in the corresponding period of 2004. The increase in revenues from owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels was due primarily to strong results at our owned hotels in New York, New York, the Hawaiian Islands, Los Angeles, California, San Diego California, Atlanta, Georgia, Seattle, Washington and Houston, Texas, partially offset by the loss of business due to Hurricanes Dennis, Katrina, Rita and Wilma at our two owned hotels and one joint venture hotel in New Orleans, two owned hotels in Florida and two owned hotels in Cancun, Mexico. Revenues at our Same Store Owned Hotels (119 hotels for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, excluding 12 hotels sold or closed and 11 hotels undergoing significant repositionings or without comparable results in 2005 and 2004) increased 8.2%, or $240 million, to $3.183 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005 when compared to $2.943 billion in the same period of 2004 due primarily to an increase in REVPAR. REVPAR at our Same Store Owned Hotels increased 10.9% to $123.14 for the year ended December 31, 2005 when compared to the corresponding 2004 period. The increase in REVPAR at these Same Store Owned Hotels was attributed to increases in occupancy rates to 70.5% in the year ended December 31, 2005 when compared to 68.3% in the same period in 2004, and a 7.5% increase in ADR to $174.70 for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $162.50 for the corresponding 2004 period. REVPAR at Same Store Owned Hotels in North America increased 11.7% for the year ended December 31, 2005 when compared to the same period of 2004 due to increased transient and group travel business for the period, primarily at our large owned hotels in the major United States cities and destinations discussed above. REVPAR at our international Same Store Owned Hotels increased by 8.8% for the year ended December 31, 2005 when compared to the same period of 2004, with Europe, where we have our biggest concentration of international owned hotels, increasing 7.8%. REVPAR for Same Store Owned Hotels internationally increased 6.8% for the year ended December 31, 2005 excluding the favorable effects of foreign currency translation. REVPAR for Same Store Owned Hotels in Europe increased 6.5% excluding the favorable effects of foreign currency translation. The increase in vacation ownership and residential sales and services of $249 million was primarily due to sales of residential units at the St. Regis Museum Tower in San Francisco, California, which did not begin until the fourth quarter of 2004. In the year ended December 31, 2005, we recognized approximately $183 million of revenues from the San Francisco project compared to sales of $15 million in 2004. The St. Regis Museum Tower opened in November 2005 with 260 hotel rooms and 102 condominium units. The increase in vacation ownership and residential sales and services in 2005 was also due to an increase in the sales of VOIs of 11.3% to $591 million in 2005 compared to $531 million in 2004. These increases represented increased sales volume as well as the revenue recognition from progressing and completed projects accounted for under the percentage of completion accounting methodology as required by generally accepted accounting principles primarily at the Westin Kaanapali Ocean Resort Villas in Maui, Hawaii, the Westin Kierland Resort and Spa in Scottsdale, Arizona, and the Sheraton Vistana Villages in Orlando, Florida, partially offset by reduced revenues at the Westin Mission Hills Resort in Rancho Mirage, California where substantially all of the available inventory was sold. Contract sales of VOI inventory, which represents vacation ownership revenues before adjustments for percentage of completion 32 Table of Contents accounting and rescission and excluding fractional sales at the St. Regis Aspen, increased 14.7% in the year ended December 31, 2005 when compared to the same period in 2004. The increase in management fees, franchise fees and other income of $82 million was primarily a result of increased management and franchise fees of $59 million to $362 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 due to improved operating results at the underlying hotels, the addition of new managed and franchised hotels, including approximately $5 million of fees earned on the Le Mridien hotels for the six week period that we managed and franchised these hotels in 2005, and certain termination fees offset by lost fees from contracts that were terminated during 2005. The increase in other income was also due to increased revenues from our Bliss and Remede spas and from the sales of Bliss and Remede products. Other revenues and expenses from managed and franchised properties increased to $1.070 billion from $983 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These revenues represent reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed hotel properties and franchisees and relate primarily to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer. Since the reimbursements are made based upon the costs incurred with no added margin, these revenues and corresponding expenses have no effect on our operating income and our net income. Operating Income. Our total operating income was $822 million in the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $653 million in 2004. Excluding depreciation and amortization of $407 million and $431 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, operating income increased 13.4% or $145 million to $1.229 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005 when compared to $1.084 billion in the same period in 2004, primarily due to the improved owned hotel performance and vacation ownership and residential sales discussed above. Restructuring and Other Special Charges (Credits), Net. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, we recorded $13 million in restructuring and other special charges primarily related to severance costs in connection with our corporate restructuring as a result of our planned disposition of significant real estate assets and transition costs associated with the Le Mridien Acquisition. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, we reversed a $37 million reserve previously recorded through restructuring and other special charges due to a favorable judgment in a litigation matter. Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation expense decreased $26 million to $387 million during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $413 million in the corresponding period of 2004 primarily due to reduced depreciation from assets sold during 2005 and due to the fact that we ceased depreciation in November and December 2005 on the hotels classified as held for sale at December 31, 2005, partially offset by additional depreciation expense resulting from capital expenditures at our owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels in the past 12 months. Amortization expense increased to $20 million in the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $18 million in the corresponding period of 2004. Gain on Sale of VOI Notes Receivable. Gains from the sale of VOI receivables of $25 million and $14 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, were primarily due to the sale of approximately $221 million and $113 million of vacation ownership receivables during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Equity Earnings and Gains and Losses from Unconsolidated Ventures, Net. Equity earnings and gains and losses from unconsolidated joint ventures increased to $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $32 million in the same period of 2004 primarily due to our share of gains on the sale of several hotels in unconsolidated joint ventures in 2005. Net Interest Expense. Net interest expense decreased to $239 million from $254 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, due to a reduction in our level of debt as well as interest income earned from significant cash on hand in 2005. Our weighted average interest rate was 6.27% at December 31, 2005 versus 5.81% at December 31, 2004. Gain (Loss) on Asset Dispositions and Impairments, Net. During 2005, we recorded a net loss of $30 million primarily related to the impairment of a hotel and impairment charges associated with our owned Sheraton hotel in 33 Table of Contents Cancun, Mexico that is being partially demolished to build vacation ownership units. These losses were offset by net gains recorded on the sale of several hotels in 2005. During 2004, we recorded a net loss of $33 million primarily related to the sale of two hotels in 2004, the sale of one hotel in January 2005, and three investments deemed impaired in 2004. Income Tax Expense. The effective income tax rate for continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 was 34.1% compared to 10.5% in 2004. The increase was primarily due to $47 million of tax expense on the adoption of a plan to repatriate foreign earnings in accordance with the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and $52 million of additional tax expense related to our 1998 disposition of ITT World Directories recorded in 2005. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2005 also included a net tax credit of $15 million related to the deferred gain on the sale of the Hotel Danieli in Venice, Italy and an $8 million benefit related to tax refunds for tax years prior to the 1995 split up of ITT Corporation. Our effective income tax rate is determined by the level and composition of pre tax income subject to varying foreign, state and local taxes and other items. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2004 included a $28 million benefit primarily related to the reversal of tax reserves as a result of the resolution of certain tax matters during the year. Discontinued Operations For the year ended December 31, 2005, the loss from operations represented a $2 million sales and use tax assessment related to periods prior to our disposal of our gaming business, which was disposed of in 1999, offset by a $1 million income tax benefit related to this business. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the net gain on dispositions included $16 million related to the favorable resolution of certain tax matters and $10 million primarily related to the reversal of reserves, both of which related to our former gaming business. The reserves were reversed as the related contingencies were resolved. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash From Operating Activities Cash flow from operating activities is generated primarily from operating income from our owned hotels, sales of VOIs and residential units and management and franchise revenues. It is the principal source of cash used to fund our operating expenses, interest payments on debt, capital expenditures, distribution payments and share repurchases. We believe that existing borrowing availability together with capacity for additional borrowings and cash from operations will be adequate to meet all funding requirements for our operating expenses, principal and interest payments on debt, capital expenditures, dividend payments and share repurchases in the foreseeable future. State and local regulations governing sales of VOIs allow the purchaser of such a VOI to rescind the sale subsequent to its completion for a pre specified number of days or until a certificate of occupancy is obtained. As such, cash collected from such sales during the rescission period is classified as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had short term restricted cash balances of $329 million and $295 million, respectively, primarily consisting of such restricted cash. Cash From Investing Activities In limited cases, we have made loans to owners of or partners in hotel or resort ventures for which we have a management or franchise agreement. Loans outstanding under this program, excluding the Westin Boston, Seaport Hotel discussed below, totaled $55 million at December 31, 2006. We evaluate these loans for impairment, and at December 31, 2006, believe these loans are collectible. Unfunded loan commitments aggregating $29 million were outstanding at December 31, 2006, of which $1 million are expected to be funded in 2007 and $11 million are expected to be funded in total. These loans typically are secured by pledges of project ownership interests and or mortgages on the projects. We also have $105 million of equity and other potential contributions associated with managed or joint venture properties, $23 million of which is expected to be funded in 2007. 34 Table of Contents During 2004, we entered into a long term management contract to manage the Westin Boston, Seaport Hotel in Boston, Massachusetts, which opened in June 2006. In connection with this project, we agreed to provide up to $28 million in mezzanine loans and other investments (all of which has been funded) as well as various guarantees, including a principal repayment guarantee for the term of the senior debt which was capped at $40 million, a debt service guarantee during the term of the senior debt, which was limited to the interest expense on the amounts drawn under such debt and principal amortization and a completion guarantee for this project. The fair value of these guarantees of $3 million is reflected in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2006 and 2005. In January 2007, this hotel was sold and the senior debt was repaid in full. As such, we do not expect to fund under these guarantees. In addition, the $28 million in mezzanine loans and other investments, together with accrued interest, was repaid in full. Surety bonds issued on our behalf at December 31, 2006 totaled $122 million, the majority of which were required by state or local governments relating to our vacation ownership operations and by our insurers to secure large deductible insurance programs. To secure management contracts, we may provide performance guarantees to third party owners. Most of these performance guarantees allow us to terminate the contract rather than fund shortfalls if certain performance levels are not met. In limited cases, we are obliged to fund shortfalls in performance levels through the issuance of loans. At December 31, 2006, excluding the Le Mridien management agreement mentioned below, we had six management contracts with performance guarantees with possible cash outlays of up to $75 million, $50 million of which, if required, would be funded over several years and would be largely offset by management fees received under these contracts. Many of the performance tests are multi year tests, are tied to the results of a competitive set of hotels, and have exclusions for force majeure and acts of war and terrorism. We do not anticipate any significant funding under these performance guarantees in 2007. In connection with the Le Mridien Acquisition, we assumed the obligation to guarantee certain performance levels at one Le Mridien managed hotel for the periods 2007 through 2013. This guarantee is uncapped. However, we have estimated the exposure under this guarantee and do not anticipate that payments made under the guarantee will be significant in any single year. The estimated fair value of this guarantee of $6 million is reflected in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2006. We do not anticipate losing a significant number of management or franchise contracts in 2007. In November 2005, we completed the Le Mridien Acquisition for a purchase price of approximately $252 million. The purchase price was funded from available cash and the return of the original Le Mridien investment. In connection with the Le Mridien Acquisition, we were indemnified for certain of Le Mridiens historical liabilities by the entity that bought Le Mridiens owned and leased hotel portfolio. The indemnity is limited to the financial resources of that entity. However, at this time, we believe that it is unlikely that we will have to fund any of these liabilities. In connection with the sale of 33 hotels to Host in 2006, we agreed to indemnify Host for certain liabilities, including operations and tax liabilities. At this time, we believe that we will not have to make any material payments under such indemnities. We had the following contractual obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2006 (in millions): Due in Less Due in Due in Due After Total Than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years Long term debt $ 2,630 $ 805 $ 45 $ 447 $ 1,333 Capital lease obligations(1) 2 2 Operating lease obligations 1,075 66 127 120 762 Unconditional purchase obligations(2) 184 60 78 42 4 Other long term obligations 4 3 1 Total contractual obligations $ 3,895 $ 931 $ 250 $ 612 $ 2,102 (1) Excludes sublease income of $2 million. (2) Included in these balances are commitments that may be satisfied by our managed and franchised properties. 35 Table of Contents We had the following commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2006 (in millions): Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Less Than After Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years Standby letters of credit $ 148 $ 148 $ $ $ Hotel loan guarantees(1) 51 10 41 Total commercial commitments $ 199 $ 158 $ 41 $ $ (1) Excludes fair value of guarantees which are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet. In December 2006, we completed a transaction to, among other things, purchase real assets from Club Regina Resorts (CRR) in Mexico. These assets included land and fixed assets adjacent to The Westin Resort & Spa in Los Cabos, Mexico and terminated CRRs rights to solicit guests at three Westin properties in Mexico. In addition to the purchase of these assets, the transaction included the settlement of all pending and threatened legal claims between the parties and the exchange of a new issue of CRR notes with a lower principal amount for the principal amount of existing CRR notes that had been previously fully reserved. Total consideration of approximately $41 million was paid by us for these items. In May 2006, we partnered with Chef Jean Georges Vongerichten and a private equity firm to create a joint venture that will develop, own, operate, manage and license world class restaurant concepts created by Jean Georges Vongerichten, including operating the existing Spice Market restaurant located in New York City. The concepts owned by the venture will be available for Starwoods upper upscale and luxury hotel brands including W, Westin, Le Mridien and St. Regis. Additionally, the venture may own and operate freestanding restaurants outside of Starwoods hotels. We invested approximately $22 million in this venture. In January 2004, we acquired a 95% interest in Bliss World LLC which at that time operated three stand alone spas (two in New York, New York and one in London, England) and a beauty products business with distribution through its own internet site and catalogue as well as through third party retail stores. The purchase price for the acquired interest was approximately $25 million, and was funded from available cash. In 2005, we acquired the remaining 5% interest for approximately $1 million. We intend to finance the acquisition of additional hotel properties (including equity investments), hotel renovations, VOI and residential construction, capital improvements, technology spend and other core and ancillary business acquisitions and investments and provide for general corporate purposes (including dividend payments) through our credit facilities described below, through the net proceeds from dispositions, through the assumption of debt, through the issuance of additional equity or debt securities and from cash generated from operations. We periodically review our business to identify properties or other assets that we believe either are non core (including hotels where the return on invested capital is not adequate), no longer complement our business, are in markets which may not benefit us as much as other markets during an economic recovery or could be sold at significant premiums. We are focused on enhancing real estate returns and monetizing investments. In the second quarter of 2006, in connection with the Host Transaction, we completed the sale of 33 hotels and the stock of certain controlled subsidiaries to Host for consideration valued at $4.1 billion which consisted of approximately $2.8 billion in the form of Host common stock and cash paid directly to our shareholders and $1.3 billion of consideration paid to Starwood, including $1.2 billion in cash, $77 million in debt assumption and $61 million in Host common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we sold ten additional owned hotels and interests in nine unconsolidated joint ventures for gross proceeds of approximately $588 million in cash. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to complete future dispositions on commercially reasonable terms or at all. 36 Table of Contents Cash Used for Financing Activities The following is a summary of our debt portfolio (including capital leases) as of December 31, 2006: Amount Interest Rate at Outstanding at December 31, Average December 31, 2006(a) Interest Terms 2006 Maturity (Dollars in millions) (In years) Floating Rate Debt Senior Credit Facility: Revolving Credit Facility $ 435 Various + 0.475 % 5.77% 4.1 Mortgages and Other 132 Various 7.10% 1.5 Interest Rate Swaps 300 9.59% Total/Average $ 867 7.30% 3.5 Fixed Rate Debt Sheraton Holding Public Debt $ 449 7.38% 8.9 Senior Notes 1,481 (b) 6.70% 3.0 Mortgages and Other 135 7.49% 8.3 Interest Rate Swaps (300 ) 7.88% Total/Average $ 1,765 6.81% 4.6 Total Debt Total Debt and Average Terms $ 2,632 6.97% 4.4 (a) Excludes approximately $484 million of our share of unconsolidated joint venture debt, all of which was non recourse. (b) Includes approximately $(17) million at December 31, 2006 of fair value adjustments related to existing and terminated fixed to floating interest rate swaps for the Senior Notes. Fiscal 2006 Developments. On March 15, 2006, we completed the redemption of the remaining 25,000 outstanding Class B EPS for approximately $1 million in cash. On April 10, 2006, in connection with the Host Transaction, we redeemed all of the Class A EPS and Realty Partnership units for approximately $34 million in cash. In the year ended December 31, 2006, we redeemed approximately 926,000 SLC Operating Limited Partnership units for approximately $56 million in cash. In February 2006, we closed a new, five year $1.5 billion Senior Credit Facility (2006 Facility). The 2006 Facility replaced the previous $1.45 billion Revolving and Term Loan Credit Agreement (Existing Facility) which would have matured in October 2006. Approximately $240 million of the Term Loan balance under the Existing Facility was paid down with cash and the remainder was refinanced with the 2006 Facility. The 2006 Facility is expected to be used for general corporate purposes. The 2006 Facility matures February 10, 2011 and has a current interest rate of LIBOR + 0.475%. We currently expect to be in compliance with all covenants of the 2006 Facility. During March 2006, we gave notice to receive additional commitments totaling $300 million under our 2006 Facility (2006 Facility Add On) on a short term basis to facilitate the close of the Host Transaction and for general working capital purposes. In June 2006, we amended the 2006 Facility such that the 2006 Facility Add On will not mature until June 30, 2007. In the first quarter of 2006 in two separate transactions we defeased approximately $510 million of debt secured in part by several hotels that were part of the Host Transaction. In one transaction, in order to accomplish this, we purchased Treasury securities sufficient to make the monthly debt service payments and the balloon payment due under the loan agreement. The Treasury securities were then substituted for the real estate and hotels that originally served as collateral for the loan. As part of the defeasance, the Treasury securities and the debt were transferred to a third party successor borrower that is responsible for all remaining obligations under this debt. In the 37 Table of Contents second transaction, we deposited Treasury securities in an escrow account to cover the debt service payments. As such, neither debt is reflected on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2006. In connection with the defeasance, we incurred early extinguishment of debt costs of approximately $37 million which was recorded in interest expense in our consolidated statement of income. In the second quarter of 2006, we gave notice to redeem the $360 million of 3.5% convertible notes, originally issued in May 2003. Under the terms of the convertible indenture, prior to the redemption date of June 5, 2006, the note holders had the right to convert their notes into Shares at the stated conversion rate. Under the terms of the indenture, we settled the conversions by paying the principal portion of the notes in cash and the excess amount by issuing approximately 3 million Corporation Shares. The notes that were not converted prior to the redemption date were redeemed at the price of par plus accrued interest, effective June 5, 2006. In connection with the Host Transaction, a total of $600 million of notes issued by Sheraton Holding were assumed by the Corporation. On June 2, 2006, we redeemed $150 million in principal amount of these notes which had a coupon of 7.75% and a maturity in 2025. The stated redemption price for these notes was 103.186%. We borrowed under the 2006 Facility and used existing unrestricted cash balances to fund the cash portions of these transactions. Fiscal 2005 Developments. On October 22, 2004, the President signed the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act). The Act created a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85 percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. In order to repatriate funds in accordance with the Act, in October 2005 we increased several existing bank credit lines available to our wholly owned subsidiary, Starwood Italia, from 129 million euros to 399 million euros, approximately 350 million euros of which was borrowed at that time. These credit lines had interest rates ranging from Euribor + 0.50% to Euribor + 0.85% and maturities ranging from April 1, 2006 to May 8, 2007. These proceeds, along with approximately 100 million euros which Starwood Italia borrowed from our Corporate Credit Line (total borrowings of 450 million euros) were used to temporarily finance the repatriation of approximately $550 million pursuant to the Act. The majority of these temporary borrowings were repaid in 2006. In connection with the repatriation, we recorded a tax liability of approximately $47 million in the third quarter of 2005, when our Board of Directors adopted the repatriation plan. In accordance with the Act, the repatriated funds were reinvested pursuant to the terms of a domestic reinvestment plan which was approved by our Board of Directors. Other. We have approximately $805 million of outstanding debt maturing in 2007. Based upon the current level of operations, management believes that our cash flow from operations and asset sales, together with our significant cash balances (approximately $519 million at December 31, 2006, including $336 million of short term and long term restricted cash), available borrowing capacity under the 2006 Facility (approximately $1.218 billion at December 31, 2006), available borrowing capacity from international revolving lines of credit (approximately $131 million at December 31, 2006), and capacity for additional borrowings will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for scheduled maturities, dividends, working capital, capital expenditures, marketing and advertising program expenditures, other discretionary investments, interest and scheduled principal payments for the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance our indebtedness as it becomes due and, if refinanced, on favorable terms. In addition, there can be no assurance that our continuing business will generate cash flow at or above historical levels, that currently anticipated results will be achieved, or that we will be able to complete dispositions on commercially reasonable terms or at all. We maintain non U.S. dollar denominated debt, which provides a hedge of our international net assets and operations but also exposes our debt balance to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. During the year ended December 31, 2006, the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates was a net increase in debt of approximately $32 million compared to a net decrease in debt in 2005 of approximately $23 million. Our debt balance is also affected by changes in interest rates as a result of our interest rate swap agreements under which we pay floating rates and receive fixed rates of interest (the Fair Value Swaps). The fair market value of the Fair Value Swaps is recorded as an asset or liability and as the Fair Value Swaps are deemed to be effective, an adjustment is recorded against the corresponding debt. At December 31, 2006, our debt included a decrease of approximately $17 million related to the unamortized gains on terminated Fair Value Swaps and the fair market value of current 38 Table of Contents Fair Value Swap liabilities. At December 31, 2005 our debt included a decrease of approximately $3 million related to the unamortized gains on terminated Fair Value Swaps and the fair market value of current Fair Value Swap assets. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt, we may be required to sell additional assets, reduce capital expenditures, refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing. Our ability to make scheduled principal payments, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance and financial results, which, to a certain extent, are subject to general conditions in or affecting the hotel and vacation ownership industries and to general economic, political, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors beyond our control. On July 26, 2006, Standard & Poors upgraded our rating to BBB from BB+ and revised their outlook from positive to stable. On August 28, 2006, Moodys Investors Service upgraded our rating to Baa3 from Ba1 and revised their outlook from positive to stable.

We continue to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not hedged. Interest rate swap agreements are the primary instruments used to manage interest rate risk.
