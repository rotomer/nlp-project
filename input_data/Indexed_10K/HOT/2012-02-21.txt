Through our brands, we are well represented in most major markets around the world. Our operations are reported in two business segments, hotels and vacation ownership and residential operations. Our revenue and earnings are derived primarily from hotel operations, which include management and other fees earned from hotels we manage pursuant to management contracts, the receipt of franchise and other fees and the operation of our owned hotels. Our hotel business emphasizes the global operation of hotels and resorts primarily in the luxury and upscale segment of the lodging industry. We seek to acquire interests in, or management or franchise rights with respect to properties in this segment. At December 31, 2011, our hotel portfolio included owned, leased, managed and franchised hotels totaling 1,076 hotels with approximately 315,300 rooms in approximately 100 countries, and is 2 Table of Contents comprised of 59 hotels that we own or lease or in which we have a majority equity interest, 518 hotels managed by us on behalf of third party owners (including entities in which we have a minority equity interest) and 499 hotels for which we receive franchise fees. Our revenues and earnings are also derived from the development, ownership and operation of vacation ownership resorts, marketing and selling vacation ownership interests (VOIs) in the resorts and providing financing to customers who purchase such interests. Generally these resorts are marketed under the brand names described above. Additionally, our revenue and earnings are derived from the development, marketing and selling of residential units at mixed use hotel projects owned by us as well as fees earned from the marketing and selling of residential units at mixed use hotel projects developed by third party owners of hotels operated under our brands. At December 31, 2011, we had 22 owned vacation ownership resorts and residential properties (including 13 stand alone, eight mixed use and one unconsolidated joint venture) in the United States, Mexico and the Bahamas. Due to the global economic crisis and its impact on the long term growth outlook for the timeshare industry, in 2009 we evaluated all of our existing vacation ownership projects, as well as land held for future vacation ownership projects. At that time, we decided not to initiate any new vacation ownership projects. We also decided not to develop certain vacation ownership sites and future phases of certain existing projects. As the economy and market conditions improved in 2011, we commenced construction on a future phase at one timeshare location where we had ceased development. Our operations are in geographically diverse locations around the world. The following tables reflect our hotel and vacation ownership and residential properties by type of revenue source and geographical presence by major geographic area as of December 31, 2011: Number ofProperties Rooms Managed and unconsolidated joint venture hotels 518 172,900 Franchised hotels 499 123,000 Owned hotels (a) 59 19,400 Vacation ownership resorts and stand alone properties 13 7,000 Total properties 1,089 322,300 (a) Includes wholly owned, majority owned and leased hotels. Number ofProperties Rooms North America (and Caribbean) 565 179,600 Europe 161 39,000 Asia Pacific 210 66,900 Africa and the Middle East 84 21,600 Latin America 69 15,200 Total properties 1,089 322,300 We have implemented a strategy of reducing our investment in owned real estate and increasing our focus on the management and franchise business. In furtherance of this strategy, since 2006, we have sold 65 hotels for approximately $5.6 billion. As a result, our primary business objective is to maximize earnings and cash flow by increasing the number of our hotel management contracts and franchise agreements; selling VOIs; and investing in real estate assets where there is a strategic rationale for doing so, which may include selectively acquiring interests in additional assets and disposing of non core hotels (including hotels where the return on invested capital is not adequate) and trophy assets that may be sold at significant premiums. We plan to meet these objectives by leveraging our global assets, broad customer base and other resources and by taking advantage of our scale to reduce costs. The implementation of our strategy and financial planning is impacted by the uncertainty relating to geopolitical and economic environments around the world and its consequent impact on travel. 3 Table of Contents The Corporation was incorporated in 1980 under the laws of Maryland. Sheraton Hotels & Resorts and Westin Hotels & Resorts, Starwoods largest brands, have been serving guests for more than 60 years. Starwood Vacation Ownership (and its predecessor, Vistana, Inc.) has been selling VOIs for more than 20 years. Our principal executive offices are located at One StarPoint, Stamford, Connecticut 06902, and our telephone number is (203) 964 6000. For a full discussion of our revenues, profits, assets and geographical segments, see our consolidated financial statements of this Annual Report, including the notes thereto. For additional information concerning our business, see Item 2 Properties, of this Annual Report. Competition The hotel and timeshare industry is highly competitive. Competition is generally based on quality and consistency of room, restaurant and meeting facilities and services, attractiveness of locations, availability of a global distribution system, price, the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points and other factors. Management believes that we compete favorably in these areas. Our properties compete with other hotels and resorts in their geographic markets, including facilities owned by local interests and facilities owned by national and international chains. Our principal competitors include other hotel operating companies, national and international hotel brands, and ownership companies (including hotel REITs). We encounter strong competition as a hotel, resort, residential and vacation ownership operator. While some of our competitors are private management firms, several are large national and international chains that own and operate their own hotels, as well as manage hotels for third party owners and sell VOIs, under a variety of brands that compete directly with our brands. Intellectual Property We operate in a highly competitive industry and our intellectual property, including brands, logos, trademarks, service marks, and trade dress is an important component of our business. The success of our business depends, in part, on the increase in awareness of our brands and our ability to further develop our brands globally through the use of our intellectual property. To that end, we apply to register, register and renew our intellectual property, enforce our rights against the unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties; and otherwise protect our intellectual property through strategies and in jurisdictions where we reasonably deem appropriate. Environmental Matters We are subject to certain requirements and potential liabilities under various foreign and U.S. federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations (Environmental Laws). Under such laws, we could be held liable for the costs of removing or cleaning up hazardous or toxic substances at, on, under, or in our currently or formerly owned or operated properties. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. The presence of hazardous or toxic substances may adversely affect the owners ability to sell or rent such real property or to borrow using such real property as collateral. Persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic wastes may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such wastes at the treatment, storage or disposal facility, regardless of whether such facility is owned or operated by such person. We use certain substances and generate certain wastes that may be deemed hazardous or toxic under applicable Environmental Laws, and we from time to time have incurred, and in the future may incur, costs related to cleaning up contamination resulting from historic uses of certain of our current or former properties or our treatment, storage or disposal of wastes at facilities owned by others. Other Environmental Laws govern occupational exposure to asbestos containing materials (ACMs) and require abatement or removal of certain ACMs (limited quantities of which are present in various building materials such as spray on insulation, floor coverings, ceiling coverings, tiles, decorative treatments and piping located at certain of our hotels) in the event of damage or demolition, or certain renovations or remodeling. Environmental Laws also regulate polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which may be present in electrical equipment. A number of our hotels have underground storage tanks (USTs) and equipment containing chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs); the operation and 4 Table of Contents subsequent removal or upgrading of certain USTs and the use of equipment containing CFCs also are regulated by Environmental Laws. In connection with our ownership, operation and management of our properties, we could be held liable for costs of remedial or other action with respect to PCBs, USTs or CFCs. Congress and some states are considering or have undertaken actions to regulate and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. New or revised laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, such as those related to climate change, could affect the operation of our hotels and or result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions. The cost impact of such legislation, regulation, or new interpretations would depend upon the specific requirements enacted and cannot be determined at this time. Environmental Laws are not the only source of environmental liability. Under common law, owners and operators of real property may face liability for personal injury or property damage because of various environmental conditions such as alleged exposure to hazardous or toxic substances (including, but not limited to, ACMs, PCBs and CFCs), poor indoor air quality, radon or poor drinking water quality. Although we have incurred and expect to incur remediation and various environmental related costs during the ordinary course of operations, management does not anticipate that such costs will have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition. Seasonality and Diversification The hotel industry is seasonal in nature; however, the periods during which our properties experience higher revenue activities vary from property to property and depend principally upon location. Generally, our revenues and operating income have been lower in the first quarter than in the second, third or fourth quarters. Comparability of Owned Hotel Results We continually update and renovate our owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels. While undergoing renovation, these hotels are generally not operating at full capacity and, as such, these renovations can negatively impact our owned hotel revenues and operating income. Other events, such as the occurrence of natural disasters may cause a full or partial closure or sale of a hotel, and such events can negatively impact our revenues and operating income. Finally, as we pursue our strategy of reducing our investment in owned real estate assets, the sale of such assets can significantly reduce our revenues and operating income from owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels. Employees At December 31, 2011, approximately 154,000 people were employed at our corporate offices, owned and managed hotels and vacation ownership resorts, of which approximately 31% were employed in the United States. At December 31, 2011, approximately 25% of the U.S. based employees were covered by various collective bargaining agreements providing, generally, for basic pay rates, working hours, other conditions of employment and orderly settlement of labor disputes. Generally, labor relations have been maintained in a normal and satisfactory manner, and management believes that our employee relations are satisfactory.

Risks Relating to Hotel, Resort, Vacation Ownership and Residential Operations We Are Subject to All the Operating Risks Common to the Hotel and Vacation Ownership and Residential Industries. Operating risks common to the hotel and vacation ownership and residential industries include: changes in general economic conditions, including the severity and duration of downturns in the United States, Europe and global economies; impact of war and terrorist activity (including threatened terrorist activity) and heightened travel security measures instituted in response thereto; domestic and international political and geopolitical conditions; travelers fears of exposures to contagious diseases; decreases in the demand for transient rooms and related lodging services, including a reduction in business travel as a result of general economic conditions; decreases in demand or increases in supply for vacation ownership interests; the impact of internet intermediaries on pricing and our increasing reliance on technology; cyclical over building in the hotel and vacation ownership industries; restrictive changes in zoning and similar land use laws and regulations or in health, safety and environmental laws, rules and regulations and other governmental and regulatory action; changes in travel patterns; changes in operating costs including, but not limited to, energy, labor costs (including the impact of unionization), food costs, workers compensation and health care related costs, insurance and unanticipated costs such as acts of nature and their consequences; the costs and administrative burdens associated with compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including, among others, franchising, timeshare, privacy, licensing and labor and employment; disputes with owners of properties, including condominium hotels, franchisees and homeowner associations which may result in litigation; the availability and cost of capital to allow us and potential hotel owners and franchisees to fund construction, renovations and investments; foreign exchange fluctuations; the financial condition of third party owners, project developers and franchisees, which may impact our ability to recover indemnity payments that may be owed to us and their ability to fund amounts required under development, management and franchise agreements and in most cases our recourse is limited to the equity value said party has in the property; the financial condition of the airline industry and the impact on air travel; and regulation or taxation of carbon dioxide emissions by airlines and other forms of transportation. If We Are Unable to Maintain Existing Management and Franchise Agreements or Obtain New Agreements on as Favorable Terms, our Operating Results May be Adversely Affected. We are impacted by our relationships with hotel owners and franchisees. Our hotel management contracts are typically long term arrangements, but most allow the hotel owner to replace us in certain circumstances, such as the bankruptcy of the hotel owner or franchisee, the failure to meet certain financial or performance criteria and in certain cases, upon a sale of the property. Our ability to meet these financial and performance criteria is subject to, among other things, the risks common to hotel industries described above. Factors outside of our control, such as the current European sovereign debt crisis, could also have a significant negative impact on the financial condition and viability of our hotel property owners. Additionally, the nature of responsibilities under these management and franchise arrangements may give rise to disagreements with the property owners, making it difficult to maintain 6 Table of Contents positive relationships with current and potential hotel owners and franchisees. Consequently, our operating results would be adversely affected if we could not maintain existing management, franchise or representation agreements or obtain new agreements on as favorable terms as the existing agreements. We and Our Third Party Licensees May Not Be Able to Sell Residential Properties Using our Brands for a Profit or at Anticipated Prices. We utilize our brands in connection with the residential portions of certain properties that we develop and license our brands to third parties to use in a similar manner for a fee. Residential properties using our brands could become less attractive due to changes in mortgage rates and the availability of mortgage financing generally, market absorption or oversupply in a particular market. As a result, we and our third party licensees may not be able to sell these residences for a profit or at the prices that we or they have anticipated. The Recent Recession in the Lodging Industry and the Global Economy Generally Will Continue to Impact Our Financial Results and Growth. The recent economic recession and continued economic uncertainty in the United States, Europe and much of the rest of the world has had a negative impact on the hotel and vacation ownership and residential industries. Substantial increases in air and ground travel costs and decreases in airline capacity have reduced demand for our hotel rooms and interval and fractional timeshare products. Accordingly, our financial results have been impacted by the economic recession and both our future financial results and growth could be further harmed if recovery from the economic recession slows or the economic recession becomes worse. In certain cases, we have entered into third party hotel management contracts which contain performance guarantees specifying that certain operating metrics will be achieved. As a result of the impact of the economic downturn on the lodging industry (and despite the stabilization in lodging that began in 2010), we may not meet the requisite performance levels, and we may be forced to loan or contribute monies to fund the shortfall of performance levels or terminate the management contract. For a more detailed description of our performance guarantees, see Note 25 of the consolidated financial statements. Moreover, many businesses, particularly financial institutions, face restrictions on the ability to travel and hold conferences or events at resorts and luxury hotels. These restrictions as well as negative publicity associated with such companies holding large conference and corporate events has resulted in reduced corporate bookings that could impact our financial results in the future. Our Revenues, Profits, or Market Share Could Be Harmed If We Are Unable to Compete Effectively. The hotel, vacation ownership and residential industries are highly competitive. Our properties compete for customers with other hotel and resort properties, ranging from national and international hotel brands to independent, local and regional hotel operators, and, with respect to our vacation ownership resorts and residential projects, with owners reselling their VOIs, including fractional ownership, or apartments. We compete based on a number of factors, including quality and consistency of rooms, restaurant and meeting facilities and services, attractiveness of locations, availability of a global distribution system, price, and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points. Some of our competitors may have substantially greater marketing and financial resources than we do, and if we are unable to successfully compete in these areas, our operating results could be adversely affected. Moreover, our present growth strategy for development of additional lodging facilities entails entering into and maintaining various management agreements, franchise agreements, and leases with property owners. We compete with other hotel companies for this business primarily on the basis of fees, contract terms, brand recognition, and reputation. In connection with entering into these agreements, we may be required to make investments in, or guarantee the obligations of, third parties or guarantee minimum income to third parties. The terms of our management agreements, franchise agreements, and leases for each of our lodging facilities are influenced by contract terms offered by our competitors, among other things. We cannot assure you that any of our current arrangements will continue or that we will be able to enter into future collaborations, renew agreements, or enter into new agreements in the future on terms that are as favorable to us as those that exist today. Our Businesses Are Capital Intensive. For our owned, managed and franchised properties to remain attractive and competitive, the property owners and we have to spend money periodically to keep the properties well maintained, modernized and refurbished. This creates an ongoing need for cash. Third party property owners may be unable to access capital or unwilling to spend available capital when necessary, even if required 7 Table of Contents by the terms of our management or franchise agreements. To the extent that property owners and we cannot fund expenditures from cash generated by operations, funds must be borrowed or otherwise obtained. Failure to make the investments necessary to maintain or improve such properties could adversely affect the reputation of our brands. Recent events, including the failures and near failures of financial services companies and the decrease in liquidity and available capital, have negatively impacted the capital markets for hotel and real estate investments. Any Failure to Protect our Trademarks Could Have a Negative Impact on the Value of Our Brand Names and Adversely Affect Our Business. We believe our trademarks are an important component of our business. We rely on trademark laws to protect our proprietary rights. The success of our business depends in part upon our continued ability to use our trademarks to increase brand awareness and further develop our brand in both domestic and international markets. From time to time, we apply to have certain trademarks registered and there is no guarantee that such trademark registrations will be granted. Further, monitoring the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult. Litigation has been and may continue to be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, may result in counterclaims or other claims against us and could significantly harm our results of operations. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. We cannot assure you that all of the steps we have taken to protect our trademarks in the United States and foreign countries will be adequate to prevent imitation of our trademarks by others. The unauthorized reproduction of our trademarks could diminish the value of our brand and its market acceptance, competitive advantages or goodwill, which could adversely affect our business. Our Dependence on Hotel and Resort Development Exposes Us to Timing, Budgeting and Other Risks. We intend to develop hotel and resort properties and residential components of hotel properties, as suitable opportunities arise, taking into consideration the general economic climate. In addition, the owners and developers of new build properties that we have entered into management or franchise agreements with are subject to these same risks which may impact the amount and timing of fees we had expected to collect from those properties. New project development has a number of risks, including risks associated with: construction delays or cost overruns that may increase project costs; receipt of zoning, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations; development costs incurred for projects that are not pursued to completion; so called acts of God such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods or fires that could adversely impact a project; defects in design or construction that may result in additional costs to remedy or require all or a portion of a property to be closed during the period required to rectify the situation; ability to raise capital; and governmental restrictions on the nature or size of a project or timing of completion. We cannot assure you that any development project, including sites held for development of vacation ownership resorts, will in fact be developed, and, if developed, the time period or the budget of such development may be greater than initially contemplated and the actual number of units or rooms constructed may be less than initially contemplated. International Operations Are Subject to Unique Political and Monetary Risks. We have significant international operations which as of December 31, 2011 included 161 owned, managed or franchised properties in Europe (including 16 properties with majority ownership); 84 managed or franchised properties in Africa and the Middle East; 69 owned, managed or franchised properties in Latin America (including nine properties with majority ownership); and 210 owned, managed or franchised properties in the Asia Pacific region (including four properties with majority ownership). International operations generally are subject to various political, 8 Table of Contents geopolitical, and other risks that are not present in U.S. operations. These risks include exposure to local economic conditions, potential adverse changes in the diplomatic relations between foreign countries and the United States, hostility from local populations, including the risk of war and civil unrest, restrictions on the repatriation of non U.S. earnings and withdrawal of foreign investments, restriction on the ability to pay dividends and remit earnings to affiliated companies, uncertainty as to the enforceability of contractual rights under local law, conflicts between local law and United States law and compliance with complex and changing laws, regulations and policies. In addition, sales in international jurisdictions typically are made in local currencies, which subject us to risks associated with currency fluctuations. Currency devaluations and unfavorable changes in international monetary and tax policies could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and financing plans, as could other changes in the international regulatory climate and international economic conditions. Additionally, our current growth strategy is heavily dependent upon growth in international markets. As of December 31, 2011, 85% of our pipeline represented international growth. Further, 61% of our pipeline represents new properties in Asia Pacific and 44% represents new growth in China alone. If our international expansion plans are unsuccessful, our financial results could be materially adversely affected. We Could be Adversely Affected by Violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Our business operations in countries outside the United States are subject to anti corruption laws and regulations, including restrictions imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). The FCPA and similar anti corruption laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti corruption laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We train our employees concerning anti corruption laws and issues, and also require our third party business partners and agents and others who work with us or on our behalf that they must comply with our anti corruption policies. We also have procedures and controls in place to monitor internal and external compliance. We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and procedures will always protect us from the reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or third parties with whom we work. If we are found to be liable for violations of the FCPA or similar anti corruption laws in international jurisdictions, either due to our own acts or out of inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others, we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties which could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Third Party Internet Reservation Channels May Negatively Impact Our Bookings. Some of our hotel rooms are booked through third party internet travel intermediaries such as Travelocity.com&reg;, Expedia.com&reg;, Orbitz.com&reg; and Priceline.com&reg;. As the percentage of internet bookings increases, these intermediaries may be able to obtain higher commissions, reduced room rates or other significant contract concessions from us. Moreover, some of these internet travel intermediaries are attempting to commoditize hotel rooms by increasing the importance of price and general indicators of quality (such as three star downtown hotel) at the expense of brand identification. Over time consumers may develop loyalties to these third party internet reservations systems rather than to our lodging brands. Although we expect to derive most of our business from traditional channels and our websites, if the amount of sales made through internet intermediaries increases significantly, our business and profitability may be significantly harmed. A Failure to Keep Pace with Developments in Technology Could Impair Our Operations or Competitive Position. The hospitality industry continues to demand the use of sophisticated technology and systems including technology utilized for property management, brand assurance and compliance, procurement, reservation systems, operation of our customer loyalty program, distribution and guest amenities. These technologies can be expected to require refinements, including to comply with the legal requirements such as privacy regulations and requirements established by third parties such as the payment card industry, and there is the risk that advanced new technologies will be introduced. Further, the development and maintenance of these technologies may require significant capital. There can be no assurance that as various systems and technologies become outdated or new technology is required, we will be able to replace or introduce them as quickly as our competition or within budgeted costs and timeframes. Further, there can be no assurance that we will achieve the benefits that may have been anticipated from any new technology or system. 9 Table of Contents Disasters, Disruptions and Other Impairment of Our Information Technologies and Systems Could Adversely Affect our Business. Our business involves the processing, use, storage and transmission of personal information regarding our employees, customers, hotel owners, and vendors for various business purposes, including marketing and promotional purposes. The protection of personal as well as proprietary information is critical to us. We are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect personal information, including Member State implementation of the European Union Directive on Data Protection and various U.S. federal and state laws. We have established policies and procedures to help protect the privacy and security of our information. However, every year the number of laws and regulations continues to grow, as does the complexity of such laws. Further, privacy regulations, on occasion, may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. Compliance with applicable privacy regulations may increase our operating costs and or adversely impact our ability to market our products, properties and services to our guests. We are dependent on information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store proprietary and personal information, and to communicate among our various locations around the world, which may include our reservation systems, vacation exchange systems, hotel/property management systems, customer and employee databases, call centers, administrative systems, and third party vendor systems. The complexity of this infrastructure contributes to the potential risk of security breaches. We rely on the security of our information systems and, those of our vendors and other authorized third parties, to protect our proprietary and personal information. Despite our efforts, information networks and systems may be vulnerable to threats such as system, network or Internet failures; computer hacking or business disruption; cyber terrorism; viruses, worms or other malicious software programs; employee error, negligence, fraud, or misuse of systems; or other unauthorized attempts by third parties to access, modify or delete our proprietary and personal information. Although we have taken steps to address these concerns by implementing network security and internal controls, there can be no assurance that a system failure, unauthorized access, or breach will not occur. Any compromise of our networks or systems, public disclosure, or loss of personal or proprietary information could result in a disruption to our operations; damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence from our customers or employees; legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect personal information, regulatory penalties, potentially resulting in significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines, and or criminal or civil prosecution in one or more jurisdictions; and subjecting us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or additional costs and liabilities which could have a material adverse affect on our business, operations or financial condition. Significant Owners of Our Properties May Concentrate Risks. There is potential for a concentration of ownership of hotels operated under our brands by any single owner. Following the acquisition of the Le M&eacute;ridien brand business and a large disposition transaction to one ownership group in 2006, single ownership groups own significant numbers of hotels operated by us. While the risks associated with such ownership are no different than exist generally (i.e., the financial position of the owner, the overall state of the relationship with the owner and their participation in optional programs and the impact on cost efficiencies if they choose not to participate), they are more concentrated. Our Real Estate Investments Subject Us to Numerous Risks. We are subject to the risks that generally relate to investments in real property because we own and lease hotels and resorts. The investment returns available from equity investments in real estate depend in large part on the amount of income earned and capital appreciation generated by the related properties, and the expenses incurred. In addition, a variety of other factors affect income from properties and real estate values, including governmental regulations, insurance, zoning, tax and eminent domain laws, interest rate levels and the availability of financing. For example, new or existing real estate zoning or tax laws can make it more expensive and or time consuming to develop real property or expand, modify or renovate hotels. When interest rates increase, the cost of acquiring, developing, expanding or renovating real property increases and real property values may decrease as the number of potential buyers decreases. Similarly, as financing becomes less available, it becomes more difficult both to acquire and to sell real property. Finally, under eminent domain laws, governments can take real property. Sometimes this taking is for less compensation than the owner believes the property is worth. Any of these factors could have a material 10 Table of Contents adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition. In addition, equity real estate investments are difficult to sell quickly and we may not be able to adjust our portfolio of owned properties quickly in response to economic or other conditions. If our properties do not generate revenue sufficient to meet operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, our income will be adversely affected. We May Be Subject to Environmental Liabilities. Our properties and operations are subject to a number of Environmental Laws. Under such laws, we could be held liable for the costs of removing or cleaning up hazardous or toxic substances at, on, under, or in our currently or formerly owned or operated properties. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. The presence of hazardous or toxic substances may adversely affect the owners ability to sell or rent such real property or to borrow using such real property as collateral. Persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic wastes may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such wastes at the treatment, storage or disposal facility, regardless of whether such facility is owned or operated by such person. We use certain substances and generate certain wastes that may be deemed hazardous or toxic under applicable Environmental Laws, and we from time to time have incurred, and in the future may incur, costs related to cleaning up contamination resulting from historic uses at certain of our current or former properties or our treatment, storage or disposal of wastes at facilities owned by others. Other Environmental Laws govern occupational exposure to ACMs and require abatement or removal of certain ACMs (limited quantities of which are present in various building materials such as spray on insulation, floor coverings, ceiling coverings, tiles, decorative treatments and piping located at certain of our hotels) in the event of damage or demolition, or certain renovations or remodeling. Environmental Laws also regulate PCBs, which may be present in electrical equipment. A number of our hotels have USTs and equipment containing CFCs; the operation and subsequent removal or upgrading of certain USTs and the use of equipment containing CFCs also are regulated by Environmental Laws. In connection with our ownership, operation and management of our properties, we could be held liable for costs of remedial or other action with respect to PCBs, USTs or CFCs. Congress and some states are considering or have undertaken actions to regulate and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. New or revised laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, such as those related to climate change, could affect the operation of our hotels and or result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on us. The cost impact of such legislation, regulation, or new interpretations would depend upon the specific requirements enacted and cannot be determined at this time. Risks Relating to Operations in Syria and Other Countries Subject to Sanction Laws From time to time the United States may impose sanctions that prohibit U.S. companies from engaging in business activities with certain persons or foreign countries or governments that it determines are adverse to U.S. foreign policy interests. For example, the United States has issued an executive order that prohibits U.S. companies from engaging in certain business activities with the government of Syria, a country that the United States has identified as a state sponsor of terrorism. During fiscal 2011, a foreign subsidiary of Starwood generated approximately $300,000 of revenue from management and other fees from existing hotels located in Syria. This amount constitutes significantly less than 1% of our worldwide annual revenues. We believe our activities in Syria are in full compliance with U.S. and local law. At any time, the United States may impose additional sanctions against Syria. If so, our existing activities in Syria may be adversely affected, or we may incur costs to respond to an executive order, depending on the nature of any further sanctions that might be imposed. In addition, in 2011 the United States issued an executive order that prohibited U.S. companies from transacting with the government of Libya and certain entities and individuals associated with the former Gaddafi regime. A foreign subsidiary of Starwood currently has a management contract for one hotel located in Libya, as well as three hotels outside Libya that are indirectly owned by the government of Libya. Although the restriction was released following the fall of the Gaddafi regime, the United States may impose additional sanctions against Libya at any time. Further, our activities in countries that are subject to U.S. sanction laws may reduce demand for our stock among certain investors. Any restrictions on Starwoods ability to conduct its business operations in a jurisdiction that is subject to U.S. sanctions laws could negatively impact our financial results. 11 Table of Contents Risks Relating to Debt Financing Our Debt Service Obligations May Adversely Affect our Cash Flow. As a result of our debt obligations, we are subject to: (i) the risk that cash flow from operations will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest, (ii) restrictive covenants, including covenants relating to certain financial ratios, and (iii) interest rate risk. Although we anticipate that we will be able to repay or refinance our existing indebtedness and any other indebtedness when it matures, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so or that the terms of such refinancing will be favorable. Our leverage may have important consequences including the following: (i) our ability to obtain additional financing for acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures or other purposes, if necessary, may be impaired or such financing may not be available on terms favorable to us and (ii) a substantial decrease in operating cash flow, EBITDA (as defined in our credit agreements) or a substantial increase in our expenses could make it difficult for us to meet our debt service requirements and restrictive covenants and force us to sell assets and or modify our operations. We Have Little Control Over the Availability of Funds Needed to Fund New Investments and Maintain Existing Hotels. In order to fund new hotel investments, as well as refurbish and improve existing hotels, both we and current and potential hotel owners must have access to capital. The availability of funds for new investments and maintenance of existing hotels depends in large measure on capital markets and liquidity factors over which we have little control. Current and prospective hotel owners may find hotel financing expensive and difficult to obtain. Delays, increased costs and other impediments to restructuring such projects may affect our ability to realize fees, recover loans and guarantee advances, or realize equity investments from such projects. Our ability to recover loans and guarantee advances from hotel operations or from owners through the proceeds of hotel sales, refinancing of debt or otherwise may also affect our ability to raise new capital. In addition, downgrades of our public debt ratings by rating agencies could increase our cost of capital. A breach of a covenant could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in an acceleration of all or a substantial portion of our debt. For a more detailed description of the covenants imposed by our debt obligations, see Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Used for Financing Activities in this Annual Report. Volatility in the Credit Markets Will Continue to Adversely Impact Our Ability to Sell the Loans That Our Vacation Ownership Business Generates. Our vacation ownership business provides financing to purchasers of our vacation ownership units, and we attempt to sell interests in those loans in the securities markets. Volatility in the credit markets may impact the timing and volume of the timeshare loans that we are able to sell. Although we expect to realize the economic value of our vacation ownership note portfolio even if future note sales are temporarily or indefinitely delayed, such delays may result in either increased borrowings to provide capital to replace anticipated proceeds from such sales or reduced spending in order to maintain our leverage and return targets. Risks Relating to So Called Acts of God, Terrorist Activity and War Our financial and operating performance may be adversely affected by so called acts of God, such as natural disasters, in locations where we own and or operate significant properties and areas of the world from which we draw a large number of customers. Similarly, wars (including the potential for war), terrorist activity (including threats of terrorist activity), political unrest and other forms of civil strife and geopolitical uncertainty have caused in the past, and may cause in the future, our results to differ materially from anticipated results. In 2011, our hotels in Syria, Tunisia, Libya and Egypt experienced reduced bookings as a result of the political climate in these countries. If these conditions do not improve, our financial results could be negatively impacted. Risks Related to Pandemic Diseases Our business could be materially and adversely affected by the effect of a pandemic disease on the travel industry. For example, the past outbreaks of SARS and avian flu had a severe impact on the travel industry, and the recent outbreak of swine flu in Mexico had a similar impact. A prolonged recurrence of SARS, avian flu, swine flu or another pandemic disease also may result in health or other government authorities imposing restrictions on travel. Any of these events could result in a significant drop in demand for our hotel and vacation ownership businesses and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 12 Table of Contents Our Insurance Policies May Not Cover All Potential Losses We carry insurance coverage for general liability, property, business interruption, and other risks with respect to our owned and leased properties and we make available insurance programs for owners of properties we manage. These policies offer coverage terms and conditions that we believe are usual and customary for our industry. Generally, our all risk property policies provide that coverage is available on a per occurrence basis and that, for each occurrence, there is a limit as well as various sub limits on the amount of insurance proceeds we will receive in excess of applicable deductibles. In addition, there may be overall limits under the policies. Sub limits exist for certain types of claims such as service interruption, debris removal, expediting costs or landscaping replacement, and the dollar amounts of these sub limits are significantly lower than the dollar amounts of the overall coverage limit. Our property policies also provide that for the coverage of critical earthquake (California and Mexico), hurricane and flood, all of the claims from each of our properties resulting from a particular insurable event must be combined together for purposes of evaluating whether the annual aggregate limits and sub limits contained in our policies have been exceeded and any such claims will also be combined with the claims of owners of managed hotels that participate in our insurance program for the same purpose. Therefore, if insurable events occur that affect more than one of our owned hotels and or managed hotels owned by third parties that participate in our insurance program, the claims from each affected hotel will be added together to determine whether the per occurrence limit, annual aggregate limit or sub limits, depending on the type of claim, have been reached and if the limits or sub limits are exceeded each affected hotel will only receive a proportional share of the amount of insurance proceeds provided for under the policy. In addition, under those circumstances, claims by third party owners will reduce the coverage available for our owned and leased properties. In addition, there are also other risks including but not limited to war, certain forms of terrorism such as nuclear, biological or chemical terrorism, political risks, some environmental hazards and or acts of God that may be deemed to fall completely outside the general coverage limits of our policies or may be uninsurable or may be too expensive to justify insuring against. We may also encounter challenges with an insurance provider regarding whether it will pay a particular claim that we believe to be covered under our policy. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a hotel or resort, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the hotel or resort. In that event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. Our Acquisitions/Dispositions and Investments in New Brands May Ultimately Not Prove Successful and We May Not Realize Anticipated Benefits We consider corporate as well as property acquisitions and investments that complement our business. In many cases, we compete for these opportunities with third parties who may have substantially greater financial resources or different or lower acceptable financial metrics than we do. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify acquisition or investment candidates or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If transactions are consummated, there can be no assurance that any anticipated benefits will actually be realized. Similarly, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing for acquisitions or investments, or that the ability to obtain such financing will not be restricted by the terms of our debt agreements. We periodically review our business to identify properties or other assets that we believe either are non core, no longer complement our business, are in markets which may not benefit us as much as other markets during an economic recovery or could be sold at significant premiums. We are focused on restructuring and enhancing real estate returns and monetizing investments, and from time to time, may attempt to sell these identified properties and assets. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to complete dispositions on commercially reasonable terms or at all or that any anticipated benefits will actually be received. We may develop and launch additional brands in the future. There can be no assurance regarding the level of acceptance of these brands in the development and consumer marketplaces, that the cost incurred in developing the brands will be recovered or that the anticipated benefits from these new brands will be realized. 13 Table of Contents Investing Through Partnerships or Joint Ventures Decreases Our Ability to Manage Risk In addition to acquiring or developing hotels and resorts or acquiring companies that complement our business directly, we have from time to time invested, and expect to continue to invest, as a co venturer. Joint venturers often have shared control over the operation of the joint venture assets. Therefore, joint venture investments may involve risks such as the possibility that the co venturer in an investment might become bankrupt or not have the financial resources to meet its obligations, or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, or be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives. Consequently, actions by a co venturer might subject hotels and resorts owned by the joint venture to additional risk. Further, we may be unable to take action without the approval of our joint venture partners. Alternatively, our joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without our consent. Additionally, should a joint venture partner become bankrupt, we could become liable for our partners share of joint venture liabilities. Our Vacation Ownership Business is Subject to Extensive Regulation and Risk of Default We market and sell VOIs, which typically entitle the buyer to ownership of a fully furnished resort unit for a one week period on either an annual or an alternate year basis. We also acquire, develop and operate vacation ownership resorts, and provide financing to purchasers of VOIs. These activities are all subject to extensive regulation by the federal government and the states in which vacation ownership resorts are located and in which VOIs are marketed and sold including regulation of our telemarketing activities under state and federal Do Not Call laws. In addition, the laws of most states in which we sell VOIs grant the purchaser the right to rescind the purchase contract at any time within a statutory rescission period. Although we believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations to which vacation ownership marketing, sales and operations are currently subject, changes in these requirements, or a determination by a regulatory authority that we were not in compliance, could adversely affect us. In particular, increased regulations of telemarketing activities could adversely impact the marketing of our VOIs. We bear the risk of defaults under purchaser mortgages on VOIs. If a VOI purchaser defaults on the mortgage during the early part of the loan amortization period, we will not have recovered the marketing, selling (other than commissions in certain events), and general and administrative costs associated with such VOI, and such costs will be incurred again in connection with the resale of the repossessed VOI. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the sales price will be fully or partially recovered from a defaulting purchaser or, in the event of such defaults, that our allowance for losses will be adequate. Risks Related to Our Dependence on Senior Management and Our Ability to Achieve Our Growth Strategy Our future success and our ability to manage future growth depend in large part upon the efforts of our senior management and our ability to attract and retain key officers and other highly qualified personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense. In the past several years, we have experienced significant changes in our senior management, including executive officers (see Item 10, Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance of this Annual Report). There can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our senior management will be able to successfully execute and implement our growth and operating strategies. Over the last few years we have been pursuing a strategy of reducing our investment in owned real estate and increasing our focus on the management and franchise business. As a result, we are planning on substantially increasing the number of hotels we open every year and increasing the overall number of hotels in our system. This increase will require us to recruit and train a substantial number of new associates to work at these hotels as well as increasing our capabilities to enable hotels to open on time and successfully. There can be no assurance that our strategy will be successful. Tax Risks Evolving Government Regulation Could Impose Taxes or Other Burdens on Our Business. We rely upon generally available interpretations of tax laws and other types of laws and regulations in the countries and locales in which we operate. We cannot be sure that these interpretations are accurate or that the responsible taxing or 14 Table of Contents other governmental authority is in agreement with our views. The imposition of additional taxes or requirements to change the way we conduct our business could cause us to have to pay taxes that we currently do not collect or pay or increase the costs of our services or increase our costs of operations. Our current business practice with our internet reservation channels is that the intermediary collects hotel occupancy tax from its customer based on the price that the intermediary paid us for the hotel room. We then remit these taxes to the various tax authorities. Several jurisdictions have stated that they may take the position that the tax is also applicable to the intermediaries gross profit on these hotel transactions. If jurisdictions take this position, they should seek the additional tax payments from the intermediary; however, it is possible that they may seek to collect the additional tax payment from us and we would not be able to collect these taxes from the customers. To the extent that any tax authority succeeds in asserting that the hotel occupancy tax applies to the gross revenue on these transactions, we believe that any additional tax would be the responsibility of the intermediary. However, it is possible that we might have additional tax exposure. In such event, such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Risks Relating to Ownership of Our Shares Our Board of Directors May Issue Preferred Stock and Establish the Preferences and Rights of Such Preferred Stock. Our charter provides that the total number of shares of stock of all classes which the Corporation has authority to issue is 1,200,000,000, consisting of one billion shares of common stock and 200 million shares of preferred stock. Our Board of Directors has the authority, without a vote of stockholders, to establish the preferences and rights of any preferred shares to be issued and to issue such shares. The issuance of preferred shares having special preferences or rights could delay or prevent a change in control even if a change in control would be in the interests of our stockholders. Since our Board of Directors has the power to establish the preferences and rights of preferred shares without a stockholder vote, our Board of Directors may give the holders preferences, powers and rights, including voting rights, senior to the rights of holders of our shares. Our Board of Directors May Implement Anti Takeover Devices and Our Charter and Bylaws Contain Provisions which May Prevent Takeovers. Certain provisions of Maryland law permit our Board of Directors, without stockholder approval, to implement possible takeover defenses that are not currently in place, such as a classified board. In addition, our charter contains provisions relating to restrictions on transferability of our common stock, which provisions may be amended only by the affirmative vote of our stockholders holding two thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. As permitted under the Maryland General Corporation Law, our Bylaws provide that directors have the exclusive right to amend our Bylaws. We Cannot Provide Assurance That We Will Continue to Pay Dividends. There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends. Our Board of Directors may suspend the payment of dividends if the Board deems such action to be in the best interests of the Company or stockholders. If we do not pay dividends, the price of our common stock must appreciate for you to realize a gain on your investment in the Company. This appreciation may not occur and our stock may, in fact, depreciate in value. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. Not applicable. Item 2. Properties. We are one of the largest hotel and leisure companies in the world, with operations in approximately 100 countries. We consider our hotels and resorts, including vacation ownership resorts (together Resorts), generally to be premier establishments with respect to desirability of location, size, facilities, physical condition, quality and variety of services offered in the markets in which they are located. Although obsolescence attributable to age, condition of facilities, and style can adversely affect our Resorts, Starwood and third party 15 Table of Contents owners of managed and franchised Resorts expend substantial funds to renovate and maintain their facilities in order to remain competitive. For further information see Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources in this Annual Report. At December 31, 2011 our hotel business included 1,076 owned, managed or franchised hotels with approximately 315,300 rooms and our owned vacation ownership and residential business included 13 stand alone vacation ownership resorts and residential properties at December 31, 2011, predominantly under seven brands. All brands (other than the Four Points by Sheraton and the Aloft and Element brands) represent full service properties that range in amenities from luxury hotels and extended stay resorts to more moderately priced hotels. Our Four Points by Sheraton, Aloft and Element brands are select service properties that cater to more value oriented consumers. The following table reflects our hotel and vacation ownership properties, by brand, as of December 31, 2011: Hotels,VOI and Residential(a) Properties Rooms St. Regis and Luxury Collection 104 20,500 W 41 12,000 Westin 190 74,500 Le M&eacute;ridien 99 25,600 Sheraton 421 148,400 Four Points 159 27.900 Aloft 55 8,700 Independent / Other 20 4,700 Total 1,089 322,300 (a) Includes vacation ownership properties of which 13 are stand alone, eight are mixed use and one is an unconsolidated joint venture totaling rooms of 7,000. Hotel Business Managed and Franchised Hotels. Hotel and resort properties in the United States are often owned by entities that do not manage hotels or own a brand name. Hotel owners typically enter into management contracts with hotel management companies to operate their hotels. When a management company does not offer a brand affiliation, the hotel owner often chooses to pay separate franchise fees to secure the benefits of brand marketing, centralized reservations and other centralized administrative functions, particularly in the sales and marketing area. Management believes that companies, such as Starwood, that offer both hotel management services and well established worldwide brand names appeal to hotel owners by providing the full range of management, marketing and reservation services. In 2011, we opened 80 managed and franchised hotels with approximately 21,000 rooms and 31 managed and franchised hotels with approximately 7,000 rooms left our system. Managed Hotels. We manage hotels worldwide, usually under a long term agreement with the hotel owner (including entities in which we have a minority equity interest). Our responsibilities under hotel management contracts typically include hiring, training and supervising the managers and employees that operate these facilities. For additional fees, we provide centralized reservation services and coordinate national and international advertising and certain marketing and promotional services. We prepare and implement annual budgets for the hotels we manage and are responsible for allocating property owner funds for periodic maintenance and repair of buildings and furnishings. In addition to our owned and leased hotels, at December 31, 16 Table of Contents 2011, we managed 518 hotels with approximately 172,900 rooms worldwide. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we generated management fees by geographic area as follows: United States 33.8 % Asia Pacific 28.0 % Europe 15.9 % Middle East and Africa 13.7 % Americas (Latin America, Caribbean & Canada) 8.6 % Total 100.0 % Management contracts typically provide for base fees tied to gross revenue and incentive fees tied to profits as well as fees for other services, including centralized reservations, national and international advertising and sales and marketing. In our experience, owners seek hotel managers that can provide attractively priced base, incentive and marketing fees combined with demonstrated sales and marketing expertise and operations focused management designed to enhance profitability. Some of our management contracts permit the hotel owner to terminate the agreement when the hotel is sold or otherwise transferred to a third party, as well as if we fail to meet established performance criteria. In addition, many hotel owners seek equity, debt or other investments from us to help finance hotel renovations or conversions to a Starwood brand, so as to align the interests of the owner and Starwood. Our ability or willingness to make such investments may determine, in part, whether we will be offered, will accept or will retain a particular management contract. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we opened 49 managed hotels with approximately 14,000 rooms, and 11 managed hotels with approximately 4,000 rooms left our system. In addition, during 2011, we signed management agreements for 70 hotels with approximately 20,000 rooms, a small portion of which opened in 2011 and the majority of which will open in the future. Brand Franchising and Licensing. We franchise our Sheraton, Westin, Four Points by Sheraton, Luxury Collection, Le M&eacute;ridien, Aloft and Element brand names and generally derive licensing and other fees from franchisees based on a fixed percentage of the franchised hotels room revenue, as well as fees for other services, including centralized reservations, national and international advertising and sales and marketing. In addition, a franchisee may purchase hotel supplies, including brand specific products, from certain Starwood approved vendors. We also review certain plans for, and the location of, franchised hotels and review their design. At December 31, 2011, there were 499 franchised properties with approximately 123,000 rooms. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we generated franchise fees by geographic area as follows: United States 66.9 % Europe 9.8 % Americas (Latin America, Caribbean & Canada) 13.4 % Asia Pacific 9.2 % Middle East and Africa 0.7 % Total 100.0 % In addition to the franchise contracts we retained in connection with the sale of hotels during the year ended December 31, 2011, we opened 31 franchised hotels with approximately 7,000 rooms, and 20 franchised hotels with approximately 4,000 rooms left our system. In addition, during 2011 we signed franchise agreements for 42 hotels with approximately 9,000 rooms, a portion of which opened in 2011 and a portion of which will open in the future. Owned, Leased and Consolidated Joint Venture Hotels. Historically, we have derived the majority of our revenues and operating income from our owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels and a significant portion of these results are driven by these hotels in North America. However, beginning in 2006, we embarked upon a strategy of selling a significant number of hotels. Since 2006 and through December 31, 2011, we have sold 65 wholly owned hotels which has substantially reduced our revenues and operating income from owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels. The majority of these hotels were sold subject to long term 17 Table of Contents management or franchise contracts. To date, where we have sold hotels, we have not provided seller financing or other financial assistance to buyers. Total revenues generated from our owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels worldwide for the years ending December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $1.768 billion, $1.704 billion and $1.584 billion, respectively (total revenues from our owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels in North America were $1.001 billion, $1.067 billion and $1.024 billion for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively).

This is particularly the case in the United States where there is no impact on this measure from foreign exchange rates. The following table summarizes REVPAR, average daily rates (ADR) and average occupancy rates on a year to year basis for our 45 owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels (excluding six hotels sold or closed and 14 hotels undergoing significant repositionings or without comparable results in 2011 and 2010) (Same Store Owned Hotels) for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010: Year EndedDecember 31, 2011 2010 Variance Worldwide (45 hotels with approximately 16,000 rooms) REVPAR (1) $ 159.12 $ 142.76 11.5 % ADR $ 218.65 $ 205.49 6.4 % Occupancy 72.8 % 69.5 % 3.3 North America (22 hotels with approximately 9,000 rooms) REVPAR (1) $ 164.78 $ 153.63 7.3 % ADR $ 215.60 $ 207.44 3.9 % Occupancy 76.4 % 74.1 % 2.3 International (23 hotels with approximately 7,000 rooms) REVPAR (1) $ 152.01 $ 129.11 17.7 % ADR $ 222.95 $ 202.64 10.0 % Occupancy 68.2 % 63.7 % 4.5 (1) REVPAR is calculated by dividing room revenue, which is derived from rooms and suites rented or leased, by total room nights available for a given period. REVPAR may not be comparable to similarly titled measures such as revenues. During the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we invested approximately $283 million and $184 million, respectively, for capital expenditures at owned hotels. These capital expenditures included renovation costs at The Westin Peachtree Plaza in Atlanta, GA, Sheraton Kauai Resort in Koloa, HI, The St. Regis Florence in Florence, Italy, Hotel Alfonso XIII in Seville, Spain and the purchase of the Hotel Goldener Hirsch in Salzburg, Austria.

Owners of VOIs can trade their interval for intervals at other Starwood vacation ownership resorts, intervals at certain vacation ownership resorts not otherwise sponsored by Starwood through an exchange company, or for hotel stays at Starwood properties. From time to time, we securitize or sell the receivables generated from our sale of VOIs. We have also entered into arrangements with several owners for mixed use hotel projects that will include a residential component. We have entered into licensing agreements for the use of certain of our brands to allow the owners to offer branded condominiums to prospective purchasers. In consideration, we typically receive a licensing fee equal to a percentage of the gross sales revenue of the units sold. The licensing arrangement generally terminates upon the earlier of sell out of the units or a specified length of time. We recently completed the development of a residential project in Bal Harbour, Florida and are in the process of selling residential units. At December 31, 2011, we had 22 residential and vacation ownership resorts and sites in our portfolio with 17 actively selling VOIs and residences including one unconsolidated joint venture. During 2011 and 2010 we invested approximately $70 million and $151 million, respectively, for vacation ownership capital expenditures, including VOI construction at the Westin Desert Willow Villas in Palm Desert, CA, the Westin Lagunamar Ocean Resort in Cancun, as well as construction costs at The St. Regis Bal Harbour Resort in Miami Beach, FL (St. Regis Bal Harbour) . Due to the global economic crisis and its impact on the long term outlook for the timeshare industry, during the fourth quarter of 2009, we completed a comprehensive review of our vacation ownership projects. We decided at that time that no new projects were to be initiated, and that we would not develop three vacation ownership sites and future phases of certain existing projects. As a result, inventories, fixed assets and land values at certain projects were determined to be impaired and were written down to their fair value, resulting in a primarily non cash pre tax impairment charge in 2009 of $255 million. Additionally, in connection with this review of the business, we made a decision to reduce the pricing of certain inventory at existing projects, resulting in a pre tax charge of $17 million. As a result of these decisions and future plans for the vacation ownership business, we also recorded a $90 million non cash charge for the impairment of goodwill associated with the vacation ownership reporting unit. As a result of the economic recovery, in 2011, we decided to construct additional timeshare inventory in a small portion of one of the projects where we had ceased development. Item 3. Legal Proceedings. Information regarding Legal Proceedings is incorporated by reference from the Litigation section in Note 25, Commitments and Contingencies, of our consolidated financial statements set forth in 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) discusses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and costs and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those relating to revenue recognition, bad debts, inventories, investments, plant, property and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets, income taxes, financing operations, frequent guest program liability, self insurance claims payable, restructuring costs, retirement benefits and contingencies and litigation. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making decisions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. 25 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES We believe the following to be our critical accounting policies: Revenue Recognition. Our revenues are primarily derived from the following sources: (1) hotel and resort revenues at our owned, leased and consolidated joint venture properties; (2) vacation ownership interests and residential unit revenues; (3) management and franchise revenues; (4) revenues from managed and franchised properties; and (5) other revenues which are ancillary to our operations. Generally, revenues are recognized when the services have been rendered. The following is a description of the composition of our revenues: Owned, Leased and Consolidated Joint Ventures Represents revenue primarily derived from hotel operations, including the rental of rooms and food and beverage sales from owned, leased or consolidated joint venture hotels and resorts. Revenue is recognized when rooms are occupied and services have been rendered. These revenues are impacted by global economic conditions affecting the travel and hospitality industry as well as relative market share of the local competitive set of hotels. REVPAR is a leading indicator of revenue trends at owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels as it measures the period over period growth in rooms revenue for comparable properties. Vacation Ownership Interests and Residential Units We recognize revenue from VOI sales and financings and the sales of residential units which are typically a component of mixed use projects that include a hotel. Such revenues are impacted by the state of the global economy and, in particular, the U.S. economy, as well as interest rates and other economic conditions affecting the lending market. Revenue is generally recognized upon the buyer demonstrating a sufficient level of initial and continuing investment, the period of cancellation with refund has expired and receivables are deemed collectible. We determine the portion of revenues to recognize for sales accounted for under the percentage of completion method based on judgments and estimates including total project costs to complete. Additionally, we record reserves against these revenues based on expected default levels. Changes in costs could lead to adjustments to the percentage of completion status of a project, which may result in differences in the timing and amount of revenues recognized from the projects. We have also entered into licensing agreements with third party developers to offer consumers branded condominiums or residences. Our fees from these agreements are generally based on the gross sales revenue of units sold. Residential fee revenue is recorded in the period that a purchase and sales agreement exists, delivery of services and obligations has occurred, the fee to the owner is deemed fixed and determinable and collectability of the fees is reasonably assured. Residential revenue on whole ownership units is generally recorded using the completed contract method, whereby revenue is recognized only when a sales contract is completed or substantially completed. During the performance period, costs and deposits are recorded on the balance sheet. Management and Franchise Fees Represents fees earned on hotels and resorts managed worldwide, usually under long term contracts, franchise fees received in connection with the franchise of our Sheraton, Westin, Four Points by Sheraton, Le M&eacute;ridien and Luxury Collection brand names, termination fees and the amortization of deferred gains related to sold properties for which we have significant continuing involvement. Management fees are comprised of a base fee, which is generally based on a percentage of gross revenues, and an incentive fee, which is generally based on the propertys profitability. For any time during the year, when the provisions of our management contracts allow receipt of incentive fees upon termination, incentive fees are recognized for the fees due and earned as if the contract was terminated at that date, exclusive of any termination fees due or payable. Therefore, during periods prior to year end, the incentive fees recorded may not be indicative of the eventual incentive fees that will be recognized at year end as conditions and incentive hurdle calculations may not be final. Franchise fees are generally based on a percentage of hotel room revenues. As with hotel revenues discussed above, these revenue sources are affected by conditions impacting the travel and hospitality industry as well as competition from other hotel management and franchise companies. Other Revenues from Managed and Franchised Properties These revenues represent reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed hotel properties and franchisees. These costs relate primarily to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer. Since the reimbursements are made based 26 Table of Contents upon the costs incurred with no added margin, these revenues and corresponding expenses have no effect on our operating income or our net income. Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Goodwill and intangible assets arise in connection with acquisitions, including the acquisition of management contracts. We do not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their respective useful lives. We review all goodwill and intangible assets for impairment annually, or upon the occurrence of a trigger event. Impairment charges, if any, are recognized in operating results. In September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2011 08, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment. This topic permits an entity to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis to determine whether an additional impairment test is necessary. This topic is for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 13, 2011 with early adoption allowed. We early adopted this topic during the fourth quarter of 2011 in conjunction with our annual impairment testing (see Note 7). Frequent Guest Program. Starwood Preferred Guest (SPG) is our frequent guest incentive marketing program. SPG members earn points based on spending at our owned, managed and franchised hotels, as incentives to first time buyers of VOIs and residences, and through participation in affiliated partners programs such as co branded credit cards. Points can be redeemed at substantially all of our owned, managed and franchised hotels as well as through other redemption opportunities with third parties, such as conversion to airline miles. We charge our owned, managed and franchised hotels the cost of operating the SPG program, including the estimated cost of our future redemption obligation, based on a percentage of our SPG members qualified expenditures. The Companys management and franchise agreements require that we be reimbursed for the costs of operating the SPG program, including marketing, promotions and communications and performing member services for the SPG members. As points are earned, the Company increases the SPG point liability for the amount of cash it receives from its managed and franchised hotels related to the future redemption obligation. For our owned hotels we record an expense for the amount of our future redemption obligation with the offset to the SPG point liability. When points are redeemed by the SPG members, the hotels recognize revenue and the SPG point liability is reduced. Through the services of third party actuarial analysts, we determine the value of the future redemption obligation based on statistical formulas which project the timing of future point redemptions based on historical experience, including an estimate of the breakage for points that will never be redeemed, and an estimate of the points that will eventually be redeemed as well as the cost of reimbursing hotels and other third parties in respect of other redemption opportunities for point redemptions. We consolidate the assets and liabilities of the SPG program including the liability associated with the future redemption obligation which is included in other long term liabilities and accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The total actuarially determined liability (see Note 17), as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 is $844 million and $753 million, respectively, of which $251 million and $225 million, respectively, is included in accrued expenses. Long Lived Assets. We evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets for impairment by comparing the expected undiscounted future cash flows of the assets to the net book value of the assets if certain trigger events occur. If the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the net book value of the assets, the excess of the net book value over the estimated fair value is charged to current earnings. Fair value is based upon discounted cash flows of the assets at a rate deemed reasonable for the type of asset and prevailing market conditions, sales of similar assets, appraisals and, if appropriate, current estimated net sales proceeds from pending offers. We evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets based on our plans, at the time, for such assets and such qualitative factors as future development in the surrounding area, status of expected local competition and projected incremental income from renovations. Changes to our plans, including a decision to dispose of or change the intended use of an asset, can have a material impact on the carrying value of the asset. 27 Table of Contents Loan Loss Reserves. For the vacation ownership and residential segment, we record an estimate of expected uncollectibility on our VOI notes receivable as a reduction of revenue at the time we recognize a timeshare sale. We hold large amounts of homogeneous VOI notes receivable and therefore assess uncollectibility based on pools of receivables. In estimating loan loss reserves, we use a technique referred to as static pool analysis, which tracks defaults for each years mortgage originations over the life of the respective notes and projects an estimated default rate. As of December 31, 2011, the average estimated default rate for our pools of receivables was 9.9%. The primary credit quality indicator used by us to calculate the loan loss reserve for the vacation ownership notes is the origination of the notes by brand (Sheraton, Westin, and Other), as we believe there is a relationship between the default behavior of borrowers and the brand associated with the vacation ownership property they have acquired. In addition to quantitatively calculating the loan loss reserve based on its static pool analysis, we supplement the process by evaluating certain qualitative data, including the aging of the respective receivables, current default trends by brand and origination year, and the Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) scores of the buyers. Given the significance of our respective pools of VOI notes receivable, a change in the projected default rate can have a significant impact to its loan loss reserve requirements, with a 0.1% change estimated to have an impact of approximately $4 million. We consider a VOI note receivable delinquent when it is more than 30 days outstanding. All delinquent loans are placed on nonaccrual status and we do not resume interest accrual until payment is made. Upon reaching 120 days outstanding, the loan is considered to be in default and we commence the repossession process. Uncollectible VOI notes receivable are charged off when title to the unit is returned to us. We generally do not modify vacation ownership notes that become delinquent or upon default. For the hotel segment, we measure the impairment of a loan based on the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loans original effective interest rate, or the estimated fair value of the collateral. For impaired loans, we establish a specific impairment reserve for the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the present value of the expected future cash flows or the estimated fair value of the collateral. We apply the loan impairment policy individually to all loans in the portfolio and do not aggregate loans for the purpose of applying such policy. For loans that we have determined to be impaired, we recognize interest income on a cash basis. Assets Held for Sale. We consider properties to be assets held for sale when management approves and commits to a formal plan to actively market a property or group of properties for sale and a signed sales contract and significant non refundable deposit or contract break up fee exist. Upon designation as an asset held for sale, we record the carrying value of each property or group of properties at the lower of its carrying value which includes allocable segment goodwill or its estimated fair value, less estimated costs to sell, and we stop recording depreciation expense. Any gain realized in connection with the sale of a property for which we have significant continuing involvement (such as through a long term management agreement) is deferred and recognized over the initial term of the related agreement. The operations of the properties held for sale prior to the sale date are recorded in discontinued operations unless we will have continuing involvement (such as through a management or franchise agreement) after the sale. Legal Contingencies. We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations. Income Taxes. We provide for income taxes in accordance with principles contained in ASC 740, Income Taxes. Under these principles, we recognize the amount of income tax payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. 28 Table of Contents Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the new rate is enacted. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative earnings experience and expectations of future taxable income by taxing jurisdiction, the carry forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes and tax attributes. We measure and recognize the amount of tax benefit that should be recorded for financial statement purposes for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. With respect to uncertain tax positions, we evaluate the recognized tax benefits for derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, interim period accounting and disclosure requirements. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion presents an analysis of results of our operations for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. The difficult business conditions that plagued the global lodging industry in 2008 and 2009 began to stabilize in 2010. The lodging recovery continued into 2011 as occupancies approached prior peak levels, average daily rate increased, and new hotel supply in the developed world fell well below historic rates of growth. While we remain cautiously optimistic, we acknowledge that known and unknown challenges could slow down or derail the lodging recovery. As we move forward, we believe we are uniquely positioned, due to the strength of our brands, our high end focus, and our geographic diversification. Starwood is particularly well positioned to take advantage of global growth through our operating teams that have worked in the emerging markets for decades. We also expect to grow in the developed world as we build out our underpenetrated brands in these markets. We believe that we have the highest quality pipeline in the industry as measured by percentage growth potential as well as our focus on valuable management contracts in the four and five star segments. We and our hotel owners have continued to invest capital in our hotels and provide innovative ways to utilize public space, such as our Link@Sheraton, which fosters relationships face to face or webcam to webcam, and also by maximizing guest room conveniences. Finally, we believe our SPG loyalty guest program is an industry leader. With our recently announced changes to the program, we expect to drive further loyalty from our SPG members as well as attract the next wave of global elite members. As the program is constantly refined and new promotions are offered, it provides rewards to our patrons while its growth in membership favorably impacts our results. As we move forward to 2012, we will continue to focus on providing superior guest experiences for our business, leisure, and group customers while maintaining a commitment to controlling our costs. As discussed in Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements, following the adoption of ASU Nos. 2009 16 and 2009 17 on January 1, 2010, our statements of income beginning with the year ended December 31, 2010 no longer reflect securitization income, but instead report interest income, net charge offs and certain other income associated with all securitized loan receivables, and interest expense associated with debt issued from the trusts to third party investors in the same line items in our statements of income. Additionally, we no longer record initial gains or losses on new securitization activity since securitized vacation ownership notes receivable no longer receive sale accounting treatment. Finally, we no longer recognize gains or losses on the revaluation of the interest only strip receivable as that asset is not recognized in a transaction accounted for as a secured borrowing. Our statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2009 has not been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the adoption of ASU Nos. 2009 16 and 2009 17. While the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2011 have been accounted for under the new accounting standards, these years are not comparable to 2009 amounts, particularly with regards to vacation ownership and residential sales and services and interest expense. 29 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2010 Continuing Operations Year EndedDecember 31,2011 Year EndedDecember 31,2010 Increase /(decrease)from prioryear Percentagechangefrom prioryear (in millions) Owned, Leased and Consolidated Joint Venture Hotels $ 1,768 $ 1,704 $ 64 3.8 % Management Fees, Franchise Fees and Other Income 814 712 102 14.3 % Vacation Ownership and Residential 703 538 165 30.7 % Other Revenues from Managed and Franchised Properties 2,339 2,117 222 10.5 % Total Revenues $ 5,624 $ 5,071 $ 553 10.9 % The increase in revenues from owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels was primarily due to increased REVPAR (as discussed below) at our existing owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels, offset in part by lost revenues from six wholly owned hotels sold or closed in 2011 and 2010. These sold or closed hotels had revenues of $56 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $158 million in the corresponding period of 2010. Revenues at our Same Store Owned Hotels (45 hotels for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, excluding the six hotels sold or closed and 14 additional hotels undergoing significant repositionings or without comparable results in 2011 and 2010) increased 9.4%, or $123 million, to $1.441 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011 when compared to $1.318 billion in the corresponding period of 2010 due primarily to an increase in REVPAR. REVPAR at our Same Store Owned Hotels increased 11.5% to $159.12 for the year ended December 31, 2011 when compared to the corresponding 2010 period. The increase in REVPAR at these Same Store Owned Hotels was driven by a 6.4% increase in ADR to $218.65 for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $205.49 for the corresponding 2010 period and an increase in occupancy rates to 72.8% for the year ended December 31, 2011 when compared to 69.5% in the corresponding period in 2010. REVPAR at Same Store Owned Hotels in North America increased 7.3% for the year ended December 31, 2011 when compared to the corresponding period of 2010. REVPAR growth was particularly strong at our owned hotels in San Francisco, California, Maui, Hawaii and Scottsdale, Arizona. REVPAR at our international Same Store Owned Hotels increased by 17.7% for the year ended December 31, 2011 when compared to the corresponding period of 2010. REVPAR for Same Store Owned Hotels internationally increased 8.1% excluding the favorable effects of foreign currency translation. The increase in management fees, franchise fees and other income was primarily a result of an $83 million or 12.0% increase in management and franchise revenue to $772 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $689 million in the corresponding period of 2010. Management fees increased $46 million or 11.2% and franchise fees increased $26 million or 16.1% compared to the corresponding period of 2010. These increases were due to growth in REVPAR at existing hotels as well as the net addition of 38 managed and 11 franchised hotels to our system since the beginning of 2011. Additionally, other income increased approximately $19 million, for the year ended December 31, 2011 when compared to the corresponding period of 2010, primarily due to payments received on promissory notes that had previously been reserved due to uncertainty around collection. Total vacation ownership and residential sales and services revenue increased 30.7% to $703 million, for the year ended December 31, 2011 when compared to $538 million in 2010, primarily driven by residential sales related to the St. Regis Bal Harbour project which received its certificate of occupancy in late 2011. Originated contract sales of VOI inventory increased 6.1% for the year ended December 31, 2011, when compared to the corresponding period in 2010. This increase was primarily driven by increased tour flow from new buyers and improved sales performance from existing owner channels. The average contract amount per vacation ownership unit sold was relatively unchanged, for the year ended December 31, 2011 when compared to the corresponding 30 Table of Contents period of 2010, at approximately $14,900. Residential revenue increased approximately $125 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 primarily due to residential sales related to the St. Regis Bal Harbour project as discussed above. Other revenues from managed and franchised properties increased primarily due to an increase in payroll costs commensurate with increased occupancy at our existing managed hotels and payroll costs for the new hotels entering the system. These revenues represent reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed hotel and vacation ownership properties and franchisees and relate primarily to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer. Since the reimbursements are made based upon the costs incurred with no added margin, these revenues and corresponding expenses have no effect on our operating income and our net income.

This increase was partially offset by lower incentive compensation in 2011 compared to 2010.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, we received cash proceeds of $75 million in connection with the favorable settlement of a lawsuit. We recorded this settlement, net of the reimbursement of legal costs incurred in connection with the litigation, as a credit to restructuring, goodwill impairment, and other special (credits) charges. Additionally, we recorded an $8 million credit related to the reversal of a reserve associated with an acquisition in 1998 as the liability is no longer deemed necessary. Year EndedDecember 31,2011 Year EndedDecember 31,2010 Increase /(decrease)from prioryear Percentagechangefrom prioryear (in millions) Depreciation and Amortization $ 265 $ 285 $ (20 ) (7.0 )% The decrease in depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2011, when compared to the corresponding period of 2010, was primarily due to reduced depreciation expense from sold hotels, partially offset by additional depreciation related to capital expenditures made in the last twelve months. Year EndedDecember 31,2011 Year EndedDecember 31,2010 Increase /(decrease)from prioryear Percentagechangefrom prioryear (in millions) Operating Income $ 630 $ 600 $ 30 5.0 % The increase in operating income for the year ended December 31, 2011, when compared to the corresponding period of 2010, was primarily due to continued improvement in results from our owned and leased 31 Table of Contents hotels and the increase in management and franchise fees attributable to the increase in REVPAR as well as the net addition of 49 managed and franchised hotels to our system since the beginning of 2011. Additionally, residential sales at the St. Regis Bal Harbour favorably impacted 2011 operating income by $27 million. Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to 2010, was negatively impacted by a $70 million charge associated with an unfavorable legal decision in 2011, while 2010 benefited from a favorable settlement of a lawsuit of $75 million. Results were also negatively impacted by political unrest in the Middle East and North Africa, as well as the earthquake and tsunami in Japan.

Our weighted average interest rate was 6.66% at December 31, 2011 as compared to 6.86% at December 31, 2010. Year EndedDecember 31,2011 Year EndedDecember 31,2010 Increase /(decrease)from prioryear Percentagechangefrom prioryear (in millions) Loss on Asset Dispositions and Impairments, Net $ $ (39 ) $ (39 ) 100.0 % During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded an impairment charge of $31 million to write off our noncontrolling interest in a joint venture that owns a hotel in Tokyo, Japan, a $9 million loss due to significant renovations and related asset retirements at two properties, $7 million in losses relating to the impairment of six hotels whose carrying value exceeded their book value and a $2 million loss on an investment in a management contract that was terminated during the period. These amounts were offset by a $50 million gain as a result of the write up to fair value of our previously held noncontrolling interest in two hotels in which we obtained a controlling interest (see Note 4). During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded a net loss on dispositions of approximately $39 million, primarily related to a $53 million loss on the sale of one wholly owned hotel (see Note 5) as well as a $4 million impairment of fixed assets that are being retired in connection with a significant renovation of a wholly owned hotel, and a $2 million impairment on one hotel whose carrying value exceeded its fair value. These charges were partially offset by a gain of $14 million from insurance proceeds received for a claim at a wholly owned hotel that suffered damage from a storm in 2008, a $5 million gain as a result of an acquisition of a 32 Table of Contents controlling interest in a joint venture in which we previously held a non controlling interest (see Note 4) and a $4 million gain from the sale of non hotel assets. Year EndedDecember 31,2011 Year EndedDecember 31,2010 Increase /(decrease)from prioryear Percentagechangefrom prioryear (in millions) Income Tax (Benefit) Expense $ (75 ) $ 27 $ (102 ) n/m In 2011, we completed transactions that involved certain domestic and foreign subsidiaries. These transactions generated capital gains, increased the tax basis in subsidiaries including U.S partnerships and resulted in the inclusion of foreign earnings for U.S. tax purposes. The capital gains were largely reduced by the utilization of capital losses. Due to the uncertainty regarding our ability to generate capital gain income, the deferred tax asset associated with these capital losses was offset by a full valuation allowance prior to these transactions. These transactions resulted in a net tax benefit of $87 million. Additionally, during 2011, an income tax benefit of approximately $60 million was generated as the result of the sale of two wholly owned hotels. Also, in 2011, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) closed its audit in respect to tax years 2004 through 2006 resulting in the recognition of a tax benefit of approximately $25 million, primarily for the reversal of tax and interest reserves. These benefits were partially offset by tax on increased pretax income and valuation allowance increases in 2011 compared to 2010. During 2010, the IRS closed its audit with respect to tax years 1998 through 2003 and we recognized a $42 million tax benefit in continuing operations, primarily associated with the refund of interest on taxes already paid. This benefit was partially offset by interest and taxes recorded on uncertain tax positions, which resulted in a charge of $23 million. Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded a loss of $13 million primarily related to an $18 million pre tax loss from the sale of our interest in a consolidated joint venture, offset by a $10 million income tax benefit on the sale. Additionally, we recorded $5 million of interest charges related to an uncertain tax position. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded a gain of $134 million related to the final settlement with the IRS regarding the disposition of World Directories Inc. a pre tax gain of approximately $3 million ($36 million after tax) related to the sale of one wholly owned hotel. The tax benefit was related to the realization of a high tax basis in this hotel that was generated through a previous transaction. Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2009 Continuing Operations Year EndedDecember 31,2010 Year EndedDecember 31,2009 Increase /(decrease)from prioryear Percentagechangefrom prioryear (in millions) Owned, Leased and Consolidated Joint Venture Hotels $ 1,704 $ 1,584 $ 120 7.6 % Management Fees, Franchise Fees and Other Income 712 658 54 8.2 % Vacation Ownership and Residential 538 523 15 2.9 % Other Revenues from Managed and Franchised Properties 2,117 1,931 186 9.6 % Total Revenues $ 5,071 $ 4,696 $ 375 8.0 % The increase in revenues from owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels was primarily due to improved REVPAR (as discussed below) at our existing owned, leased and consolidated joint venture hotels, offset in part by lost revenues from eight wholly owned hotels sold or closed in 2010 and 2009. These sold or closed hotels had revenues of $18 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $98 million in the corresponding period of 2009. Revenues at our Same Store Owned Hotels (54 hotels for the year ended 33 Table of Contents December 31, 2010 and 2009, excluding the eight hotels sold or closed and eight additional hotels undergoing significant repositionings or without comparable results in 2010 and 2009) increased 8.2%, or $107 million, to $1.421 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010 when compared to $1.314 billion in the corresponding period of 2009 due primarily to an increase in REVPAR. REVPAR at our Same Store Owned Hotels increased 11.2% to $136.27 for the year ended December 31, 2010 when compared to the corresponding period of 2009. The increase in REVPAR at these Same Store Owned Hotels resulted from a 2.6% increase in ADR to $196.62 for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $191.60 for the corresponding period of 2009 and an increase in occupancy rates to 69.3% in the year ended December 31, 2010 when compared to 64.0% in the corresponding period in 2009. REVPAR at Same Store Owned Hotels in North America increased 11.6% for the year ended December 31, 2010 when compared to the corresponding period of 2009. REVPAR growth was particularly strong at our owned hotels in New York, New York, Chicago, Illinois, Toronto, Canada and New Orleans, Louisiana. REVPAR at our international Same Store Owned Hotels increased by 10.5% for the year ended December 31, 2010 when compared to the corresponding period of 2009. REVPAR for Same Store Owned Hotels internationally increased 11.6% excluding the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation. The increase in management fees, franchise fees and other income was primarily a result of a $59 million or 9.4% increase in management and franchise revenue to $689 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $630 million in the corresponding period in 2009. Management fees increased $53 million or 14.9% and franchise fees increased $23 million or 16.7% compared to the corresponding period of 2009. These increases were due to growth in REVPAR at existing hotels as well as the net addition of 27 managed and 65 franchised hotels to our system since the beginning of 2009. Total vacation ownership and residential sales and services revenue increased 2.9% to $538 million compared to $523 million in 2009 primarily driven by the impact of ASU 2009 17. Originated contract sales of VOI inventory decreased 3.1% for the year ended December 31, 2010 when compared to the corresponding period in 2009. This decline was primarily driven by lower tour flow which was down 6.8% for the year ended December 31, 2010 when compared to the corresponding period in 2009. The decline in tour flow was a result of the economic climate and resulting closure of fractional sales centers in the latter part of 2009. Additionally, the average contract amount per vacation ownership unit sold decreased 6.0% to approximately $15,000, driven by price reductions and inventory mix. Residential revenue increased approximately $6 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily due to the recognition of $4 million of marketing and license fees associated with a new hotel and residential project in Guangzhou, China which opened in 2010. Other revenues from managed and franchised properties increased primarily due to an increase in payroll costs commensurate with increased occupancy at our managed hotels and payroll costs for new hotels entering the system. These revenues represent reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed hotel and vacation ownership properties and franchisees and relate primarily to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer. Since the reimbursements are made based upon the costs incurred with no added margin, these revenues and corresponding expenses have no effect on our operating income and our net income.

The increase was partially offset by the reimbursement of previously expensed legal costs in connection 34 Table of Contents with the favorable settlement of a lawsuit and an $8 million reversal of a guarantee liability which was favorably settled during the period (see Note 25). Year EndedDecember 31,2010 Year EndedDecember 31,2009 Increase /(decrease)from prioryear Percentagechangefrom prioryear (in millions) Restructuring, Goodwill Impairment and Other Special Charges (Credits), Net $ (75 ) $ 379 $ 454 n/m During the year ended December 31, 2010, we received cash proceeds of $75 million in connection with the favorable settlement of a lawsuit. We recorded this settlement, net of the reimbursement of legal costs incurred in connection with the litigation, as a credit to restructuring, goodwill impairment, and other special (credits) charges. Additionally, we recorded an $8 million credit related to the reversal of a reserve associated with an acquisition in 1998 as the liability is no longer deemed necessary. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we completed a comprehensive review of our vacation ownership business. We decided not to develop certain vacation ownership sites and future phases of certain existing projects. As a result of these decisions, we recorded a primarily non cash impairment charge of $255 million in the restructuring, goodwill impairment and other special charges (credits) line item. Additionally, we recorded a $90 million non cash charge for the impairment of goodwill in the vacation ownership reporting unit. Throughout 2009, we also recorded restructuring and other special charges of $34 million related to our ongoing initiative of rationalizing our cost structure. These charges related to severance charges and costs to close vacation ownership sales galleries.

Our weighted average interest rate was 6.86% at December 31, 2010 as compared to 6.73% at December 31, 2009.

These charges were partially offset by a gain of $14 million from insurance proceeds received for a claim at a wholly owned hotel that suffered damage from a storm in 2008, a $5 million gain as a result of an acquisition of a controlling interest in a joint venture in which we previously held a non controlling interest (see Note 4) and a $4 million gain from the sale of non hotel assets. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded a net loss on dispositions of approximately $91 million, primarily related to $41 million of impairment charges on six hotels whose carrying values exceeded their fair values, a $22 million impairment of our retained interests in vacation ownership mortgage receivables, a $13 million impairment of an investment in a hotel management contract that was cancelled, a $5 million impairment of certain technology related fixed assets and a $4 million loss on the sale of a wholly owned hotel. Year EndedDecember 31,2010 Year EndedDecember 31,2009 Increase /(decrease)from prioryear Percentagechangefrom prioryear (in millions) Income Tax (Benefit) Expense $ 27 $ (293 ) $ 320 n/m The $320 million increase in income tax expense primarily related to 2009 items that did not recur in 2010, including a $120 million deferred tax benefit for an Italian tax incentive program in which the tax basis of land and building for the hotels we owned in Italy was stepped up to fair value in exchange for paying a current tax of $9 million, a $51 million tax benefit related to previously unrecognized foreign tax credits for prior tax years and a $10 million benefit to reverse the deferred interest accrual associated with the deferral of taxable income. The remaining increase was primarily due to higher pretax income in 2010, partially offset by a benefit of $42 million related to an IRS audit. 36 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded a tax benefit of $134 million related to the final settlement with the IRS regarding the disposition of World Directories, Inc. and a pre tax gain of approximately $3 million ($36 million after tax) related to the sale of one wholly owned hotel. The tax benefit was related to the realization of a high tax basis in this hotel that was generated through a previous transaction. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we sold our Bliss spa business and other non core assets for cash proceeds of $227 million. Revenues and expenses from the Bliss spa business, together with revenues and expenses from one hotel that was sold in 2010, were reported in discontinued operations resulting in a loss of $2 million, net of tax. In addition, the net gain on the assets sold in 2009 and the one hotel held for sale at December 31, 2009 has been recorded in discontinued operations resulting in income of $76 million, net of tax. 37 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash From Operating Activities Cash flow from operating activities is generated primarily from management and franchise revenues, operating income from our owned hotels and resorts and sales of VOIs and residential units. Other sources of cash are distributions from joint ventures, servicing financial assets and interest income. These are the principal sources of cash used to fund our operating expenses, interest payments on debt, capital expenditures, dividend payments and property and income taxes. We believe that our existing borrowing availability together with capacity for additional borrowings and cash from operations will be adequate to meet all funding requirements for our operating expenses, principal and interest payments on debt, capital expenditures, dividends and share repurchases. The majority of our cash flow is derived from corporate and leisure travelers and is dependent on the supply and demand in the lodging industry. In a recessionary economy, we experience significant declines in business and leisure travel. The impact of declining demand in the industry and higher hotel supply in key markets could have a material impact on our cash flow from operating activities. Our day to day operations are financed through net working capital, a practice that is common in our industry. The ratio of our current assets to current liabilities was 1.27 and 1.21 as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Consistent with industry practice, we sweep the majority of the cash at our owned hotels on a daily basis and fund payables as needed by drawing down on our existing revolving credit facility. The majority of our restricted cash balance relates to cash used as collateral to reduce fees on letters of credit. Additionally, state and local regulations governing sales of VOIs and residential properties allow the purchaser of such a VOI or property to rescind the sale subsequent to its completion for a pre specified number of days. In addition, cash payments received from buyers of units under construction are held in escrow during the period prior to obtaining a certificate of occupancy. These payments and the deposits collected from sales during the rescission period are another component of our restricted cash balances in our consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had short term restricted cash balances of $232 million and $53 million, respectively. During 2011, we completed the securitization of vacation ownership receivables resulting in proceeds of approximately $177 million and received a tax refund from the IRS of $45 million (see Note 14). Cash From Investing Activities Gross capital spending during the full year ended December 31, 2011 was as follows (in millions): Maintenance Capital Expenditures (1): Owned, Leased and Consolidated Joint Venture Hotels $ 129 Corporate and information technology 124 Subtotal 253 Vacation Ownership and Residential Capital Expenditures (2): Net capital expenditures for inventory (excluding St. Regis Bal Harbour) (43 ) Capital expenditures for inventory St. Regis Bal Harbour 58 Subtotal 15 Development Capital  209 Total Capital Expenditures $ 477 (1) Maintenance capital expenditures includes renovations, asset replacements and improvements that extend the useful life of the asset. (2) Represents gross inventory capital expenditures of $165 less cost of sales of $150. 38 Table of Contents Gross capital spending during the year ended December 31, 2011 included approximately $253 million of maintenance capital, and $209 million of development capital. Investment spending on gross vacation ownership interest and residential inventory was $165 million, primarily related to the construction of our hotel and residential project in Bal Harbour, Florida. Our capital expenditure program includes both offensive and defensive capital. Defensive spending is related to maintenance and renovations that we believe are necessary to stay competitive in the markets we are in. Other than capital to address fire and life safety issues, we consider defensive capital to be discretionary, although reductions to this capital program could result in decreases to our cash flow from operations, as hotels in certain markets could become less desirable. The offensive capital expenditures, which are primarily related to new projects that we expect will generate a return, are also considered discretionary. We currently anticipate that our defensive capital expenditures for the full year 2012 (excluding vacation ownership and residential inventory) will be approximately $200 million for maintenance, renovations, and technology capital. In addition, for the full year 2012, we currently expect to spend approximately $375 million for investment projects, various joint ventures and other investments. In order to secure management or franchise agreements, we have made loans to third party owners, minority investments in joint ventures and provided certain guarantees and indemnifications related thereto. See Note 25 of the consolidated financial statements for discussion regarding the amount of loans we have outstanding with owners, unfunded loan commitments, equity and other potential contributions, surety bonds outstanding, performance guarantees and indemnifications we are obligated under, and investments in hotels and joint ventures. We intend to finance the acquisition of additional hotel properties (including equity investments), hotel renovations, VOI and residential construction, capital improvements, technology spend and other core and ancillary business acquisitions and investments and provide for general corporate purposes, (including dividend payments and share repurchases) through our credit facility described below, the net proceeds from dispositions, the assumption of debt, and from cash generated from operations. We periodically review our business to identify properties or other assets that we believe either are non core (including hotels where the return on invested capital is not adequate), no longer complement our business, are in markets which may not benefit us as much as other markets during an economic recovery or could be sold at significant premiums. We are focused on enhancing real estate returns and monetizing investments. Since 2006, we have sold 65 hotels realizing proceeds of approximately $5.6 billion in numerous transactions (see Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements). There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to complete future dispositions on commercially reasonable terms or at all. During the year ended December 31, 2011 asset sales resulted in gross cash proceeds from investing activities of approximately $280 million. In late 2011, we received certificates of occupancy for our St. Regis Bal Harbour project. As a result, we began closings of units that had previously been sold and, in the fourth quarter of 2011, $74 million of cash was released from escrow accounts related to these closings. 39 Table of Contents Cash Used for Financing Activities The following is a summary of our debt portfolio (including capital leases) as of December 31, 2011: AmountOutstanding atDecember 31,2011 (a) WeightedAverageInterest Rate atDecember 31,2011 WeightedAverageMaturity (Dollars in millions) (In years) Floating Rate Debt Revolving Credit Facility $ 1.9 Mortgages and Other 40 5.02 % 5.0 Interest Rate Swaps 400 4.69 % Total/Average $ 440 4.72 % 5.0 Fixed Rate Debt Senior Notes $ 2,093 7.08 % 3.9 Mortgages and Other 64 7.46 % 11.5 Interest Rate Swaps (400 ) 6.86 % Total/Average $ 1,757 7.14 % 4.1 Total Debt Total Debt and Average Terms $ 2,197 6.66 % 4.2 (a) Excludes approximately $432 million of our share of unconsolidated joint venture debt and securitized vacation ownership debt of $532 million, all of which is non recourse. For specifics related to our financing transactions, issuances, and terms entered into for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, see Note 15 of the consolidated financial statements. We have evaluated the commitments of each of the lenders in our Revolving Credit Facility (the Facility) which matures on November 15, 2013. In addition, we have reviewed our debt covenants and do not anticipate any issues regarding the availability of funds under the Facility. On December 15, 2011, we redeemed all $605 million of our 7.875% Senior Notes, which would have matured in May 2012. We paid $628 million in connection with this early redemption, including $16 million for the call premium and other associated costs (see Note 15). Due to the adoption of ASU Nos. 2009 16 and 2009 17, as discussed in Notes 2, 9, and 10, our 2011 cash flows from financing activities include the borrowings and repayments of securitized vacation ownership debt. December 31,2011 December 31,2010 (in millions) Gross Unsecuritized Debt $ 2,197 $ 2,857 less: cash (including restricted cash of $212 million in 2011 and $44 million in 2010) (666 ) (797 ) Net Unsecuritized Debt $ 1,531 $ 2,060 Gross Securitized Debt (non recourse) $ 532 $ 494 less: cash restricted for securitized debt repayments (not included above) (22 ) (19 ) Net Securitized Debt $ 510 $ 475 Total Net Debt $ 2,041 $ 2,535 40 Table of Contents The cost of borrowing of the Facilities is determined by a combination of our leverage ratios and credit ratings. Changes in our credit ratings may result in changes in our borrowing costs. Downgrades in our credit ratings would likely increase the relative costs of borrowing and reduce our ability to issue long term debt, whereas upgrades would likely reduce costs and increase our ability to issue long term debt. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. On February 1, 2012, our long term debt rating was upgraded to investment grade by one of the major credit rating agencies. Our Facility is used to fund general corporate cash needs. As of December 31, 2011, we have availability of over $1.5 billion under the Facility. The Facility allows for multi currency borrowing and, if drawn upon, would have an applicable margin, inclusive of the commitment fee, of 2.5% plus the applicable currency LIBOR rate. Our ability to borrow under the Facility is subject to compliance with the terms and conditions under the Facility, including certain leverage and coverage covenants. Based upon the current level of operations, management believes that our cash flow from operations, together with our significant cash balances, available borrowings under the Facility, and our capacity for additional borrowings will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for scheduled maturities (primarily our $500 million of Senior Notes due in early 2013), dividends, working capital, capital expenditures, marketing and advertising program expenditures, other discretionary investments, interest and scheduled principal payments and share repurchases for the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance our indebtedness as it becomes due and, if refinanced, on favorable terms. Approximately $159 million, included in our cash balance above, is deemed to be permanently invested in foreign countries and we would be subject to income taxes if we repatriated these amounts. In addition, there can be no assurance that in our continuing business we will generate cash flow at or above historical levels, that currently anticipated results will be achieved or that we will be able to complete dispositions on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt, we may be required to sell additional assets at lower than preferred amounts, reduce capital expenditures, refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing at unfavorable rates. Our ability to make scheduled principal payments, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance and financial results, which, to a certain extent, are subject to general conditions in or affecting the hotel and vacation ownership industries and to general economic, political, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors beyond our control.

These items are discussed in greater detail in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, and in the Notes. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. In limited instances, we seek to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates by entering into financial arrangements intended to provide a hedge against a portion of the risks associated with such volatility. We continue to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not hedged. We enter into a derivative financial arrangement to the extent it meets the objectives described above, and we do not engage in such transactions for trading or speculative purposes. At December 31, 2011, we were party to the following derivative instruments: Forward contracts to hedge forecasted transactions for management and franchise fee revenues earned in foreign currencies. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amounts was approximately $34 million. These contracts expire in 2012. Forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the foreign currency exposure related to certain intercompany loans not deemed to be permanently invested. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amounts of the forward contracts was approximately $659 million. These contracts expire in 2012.
