ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS We are a diversified company with subsidiaries delivering tax, financial, mortgage and business products and services. We are the only major company offering a full range of software, online and in office tax solutions, combined with personalized financial advice about retirement savings, home ownership and other opportunities to help clients build a better financial future. Overall for fiscal 2004, we achieved strong financial results and generally executed well against our strategic priorities. We were able to increase our tax and financial advice offerings, strengthen our multi channel offerings and continued to cross sell our financial services and products across segments, which we believe all help increase brand loyalty and client retention. However, we saw a decline in our retail tax clients served in our offices. Additionally, we again saw Mortgage Operations deliver strong financial results. Our key strategic priorities can be summarized as follows: U.S. Tax Operations expanding our office network, working on service and product differentiation and focusing on advice that supports client growth, increased brand loyalty and business extensions with a tax and financial connection. Mortgage Operations developing a diversified source of originations, distinguishing our service quality, minimizing risk and volatility in performance and using secondary markets to optimize value. Business Services developing a national accounting, tax and consulting firm, adding extended services to middle market companies and enhancing our client service culture. Investment Services serving the broad consumer market through tax based advisory relationships, brand differentiation through relevant advice and multi channel access and providing services clients can use to readily implement that advice. The analysis that follows should be read in conjunction with the tables below, the consolidated income statements and the information contained in Item 1 under Description of Business. Overview A summary of our fiscal year 2004 results is as follows: Diluted earnings per share before change in accounting principle were $3.90, an increase of 23.8% over fiscal year 2003. Revenues grew 12.3% over the prior year, primarily due to revenues from operations in former major franchise territories and growth in our Mortgage Operations segment. We achieved revenue growth in each of our segments. Clients served in company owned retail tax offices grew 5.2%, and the average fee per client served increased 6.7%. The increase in clients served is due entirely to company owned operations in former major franchise territories. Excluding the former major franchise territories, clients served decreased 2.5%. Software and online revenues increased 11.4% and 70.6%, respectively, compared to fiscal year 2003. Mortgage originations totaled $23.3 billion for the year as a result of increases in the sales force, average loan size, loan applications and the closing ratio. Gains on sales of mortgage assets reached $726.7 million, including $40.7 million realized on the sale of previously securitized residual interests. The Business Services segment reported pretax income of $19.3 million, an improvement of $33.4 million over the prior year. Fiscal year 2003 includes an $11.8 million goodwill impairment. The Investment Services segment reported a pretax loss of $64.4 million, an improvement of $63.8 million over prior year. Fiscal year 2003 includes a $24.0 million goodwill impairment. We began expensing stock based compensation as of May 1, 2003. We recorded $25.7 million in expense related to the issuance of stock options, restricted stock and our employee stock purchase plan during fiscal year 2004. Consolidated Results of Operations (in 000s) Year ended April 30, 2004 2003 2002 REVENUES: U.S. Tax Operations $ 2,093,617 $ 1,861,681 $ 1,831,274 Mortgage Operations 1,281,399 1,165,411 702,333 Business Services 499,210 434,140 416,926 Investment Services 229,470 200,794 250,685 International Tax Operations 97,560 85,082 78,710 Corporate Operations 4,314 (651 ) 5,773 $ 4,205,570 $ 3,746,457 $ 3,285,701 INCOME (LOSS): U.S. Tax Operations $ 627,592 $ 547,078 $ 533,468 Mortgage Operations 678,261 693,950 339,388 Business Services 19,321 (14,118 ) 22,716 Investment Services (64,446 ) (128,292 ) (54,862 ) International Tax Operations 11,097 10,464 7,093 Corporate Operations (107,668 ) (122,005 ) (130,963 ) Pretax income $ 1,164,157 $ 987,077 $ 716,840 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES We consider the policies discussed below to be critical to securing an understanding of our financial statements, as they require the use of significant judgment and estimation in order to measure, at a specific point in time, matters that are inherently uncertain. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs. For all of these policies, we caution that future events rarely develop precisely as forecast, and estimates routinely require adjustment and may require material adjustment. Revenue recognition: We have many different revenue streams with different revenue recognition policies. We record retail and online tax preparation revenues when a completed return is filed or accepted by the customer. RAL participation revenue is recorded when we purchase our participation interest in the RAL. Commission revenue is recognized on a trade date basis. Business Services revenues are recognized on a time and materials basis. We recognize interest income on customer margin loan balances daily as earned, based on current rates charged to customers for their margin balance. Accretion income represents interest earned over the life of residual interests using the effective interest method. We record sales of software when the product is ultimately sold to the end user. POM revenues are deferred and recognized over the term of the guarantee based upon historic and actual payment of claims. 14 Table of Contents Form 10 K H&R BLOCK Franchise royalties, which are based upon the contractual percentages of franchise revenues, are recorded in the period in which the franchise provides the service. Gains on sales of mortgage loans: We sell substantially all of the non prime mortgage loans we originate to the Trusts, which are qualifying special purpose entities (QSPEs), with servicing rights generally retained. Prime mortgage loans are sold in whole loan sales, servicing released, to third party buyers. We record the gain on sale as the difference between cash proceeds and the allocated cost of loans sold. We determine the allocated cost of loans sold based on the relative fair values of loans sold, MSRs and the beneficial interest in Trusts, which represents the ultimate expected outcome from the disposition of the loans. The relative fair value of the MSRs and the beneficial interest in Trust is determined using discounted cash flow models, which require various management assumptions (see discussion below in Valuation of residual interests and Valuation of mortgage servicing rights). Variations in these assumptions affect the estimated fair values, which would affect the reported gains on sales. Gains on sales of mortgage loans totaled $716.7 million, $663.6 million and $455.4 million for fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. See discussion in Off Balance Sheet Financing related to the disposition of the loans by the Trusts and subsequent securitization by the Company. Valuation of residual interests: We use discounted cash flow models to arrive at the estimated fair values of our residual interests. See Item 8, note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for our methodology used in valuing residual interests. Variations in our assumptions, including loss, prepayment speeds, discount rate and interest rate assumptions, could materially affect the estimated fair values, which may require us to record impairments or unrealized gains. In addition, variations will also affect the amount of residual interest accretion recorded on a monthly basis. Residual interests available for sale valued at $211.0 million and $264.3 million were recorded as of April 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We recorded $167.1 million in net write ups in other comprehensive income and $30.7 million in impairments in the income statement related to our residual interests during fiscal year 2004 as actual results differed from our assumptions. See Item 8, note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for current assumptions and a sensitivity analysis of those assumptions. See Item 7a for sensitivity analysis related to interest rates. Valuation of mortgage servicing rights: We generally sell non prime mortgage loans with servicing retained. MSRs are recorded at allocated carrying amounts based on relative fair values when the loans are sold (see discussion above in Gains on sales of mortgage loans). Fair values of MSRs are determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows related to servicing loans. Assumptions used in estimating the value of MSRs include discount rates, prepayment speeds (including default) and other factors. The prepayment speeds are somewhat correlated with the movement of market interest rates. As market interest rates decline there is a corresponding increase in actual and expected borrower prepayments as customers refinance existing mortgages under more favorable interest rate terms. This in turn reduces the anticipated cash flows associated with servicing resulting in a reduction, or impairment, to the fair value of the capitalized MSR. Many non prime loans have a prepayment penalty in place for the first two to three years, which has the effect of making prepayment speeds more predictable, regardless of market interest rate movements. Prepayment rates are estimated using our historical experience and third party market sources. Variations in these assumptions could materially affect the carrying value of the MSRs. MSRs are carried at the lower of cost or market and are reviewed quarterly for potential impairment. Impairment is assessed based on the fair value of each risk stratum. MSRs are stratified by: the fiscal year of the loan sale date (which approximates date of origination) and loan type (6 month adjustable, 2 to 3 year adjustable and fixed rate). Fair values take into account the historical prepayment activity of the related loans and our estimates of the remaining future cash flows to be generated through servicing the underlying mortgage loans. If actual prepayment rates prove to be higher than the estimate made by management, impairment of the MSRs could occur. MSRs valued at $113.8 million and $99.3 million were recorded as of April 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. There were no impairments to MSRs during fiscal year 2004. See Item 8, note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for current assumptions and a sensitivity analysis of those assumptions. Valuation of goodwill: We test goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently whenever events occur or circumstances change which would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. We have defined our reporting units as our operating segments or one level below. The first step of the impairment test is to compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the carrying value is less than fair value, no impairment exists. If the carrying value is greater than fair value, a second step is performed to determine the fair value of goodwill and the amount of impairment loss, if any. In estimating each reporting units fair value using discounted cash flow projections and market comparables, when available, we make assumptions, including discount rates, growth rates and terminal values. Changes in the projections or assumptions could materially affect fair values. Our goodwill balances were $959.4 million and $714.2 million as of April 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. No goodwill impairments were identified during fiscal year 2004. In fiscal year 2003, a goodwill impairment charge of $24.0 million was recorded in the Investment Services segment due to unsettled market conditions. Also during 2003, our annual impairment test resulted in an impairment of $11.8 million for a reporting unit within the Business Services segment. No other impairments were identified. Litigation: Our policy is to routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes related to legal matters, as well as ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of the reserves required, if any, for these contingencies is made after thoughtful analysis of each known issue and an analysis of historical experience in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, and related pronouncements. Therefore, we have recorded reserves related to certain legal matters for which it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the range of such loss can be estimated. With respect to other matters, we have concluded that a loss is only reasonably possible or remote and, therefore, no liability is recorded. In addition, there are certain gain contingencies for which we have not recorded an asset. Stock Based Compensation: We record compensation expense for the issuance of stock options, restricted shares and our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP). The expense is calculated based on the fair value of the options/shares and the number of options/shares that vest. We use the Black Scholes model to calculate the fair value for stock options and ESPP shares using the following assumptions: stock volatility, expected life, risk free interest rate and dividend yield. The fair value of restricted shares is the stock price on the date of the grant. We also estimate, based on historical data, the percent of options/shares that we expect to vest. The total expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period. Variations in the assumptions used to calculate fair value could either positively or negatively affect the recorded expense. Variations in the estimate of vesting could result in timing adjustments recorded at the end of the vesting period. We began expensing all stock based compensation grants issued beginning on May 1, 2003. Therefore, our income statements do not fully reflect the expense related to all of our stock options and restricted shares outstanding. We recorded 15 Table of Contents H&R BLOCK Form 10 K $25.7 million and $2.1 million in stock based compensation expense during fiscal year 2004 and 2003, respectively. Additionally, changes in accounting rules related to stock based compensation could result in changes to our assumptions of fair value and expense recognition. Other significant accounting policies: Other significant accounting policies, not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above, are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements. These policies require difficult judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance. Certain of these matters are among topics currently under reexamination by accounting standards setters and regulators. Although no specific conclusions reached by these standard setters appear likely to cause a material change in our accounting policies, outcomes cannot be predicted with confidence. Also see Item 8, note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, which discusses accounting policies we have selected when there are acceptable alternatives. 16 Table of Contents Form 10 K H&R BLOCK RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our business is divided into five reportable segments: U.S. Tax Operations, Mortgage Operations, Business Services, Investment Services and International Tax Operations. U.S. TAX OPERATIONS This segment primarily consists of our income tax preparation businesses retail, online and software.

Tax preparation and related fees increased $140.5 million, or 10.2%, for fiscal year 2004, compared to fiscal year 2003. This increase is due to a 6.7% increase in the average fee per client served in company owned offices, coupled with a 5.2% increase in clients served in those offices. The average fee per client served increased to $146.51 in fiscal year 2004, due to increases in our pricing and the complexity of returns prepared. Clients served increased to 10.6 million from 10.1 million as a result of the former major franchise territories. Excluding the impact of our acquisition of former major franchises, clients served declined 2.5%. We believe this decline is due to a combination of factors including a lack of office network density in some key areas of the country. Given the competitive environment and lack of density in key areas, we believe some potential clients, who are primarily motivated by convenience and who do not want to wait for service in our office or drive as far to our office, will instead go to a competitor who is perceived to be more convenient. This is an indication that, for certain consumers, we have not been able to effectively differentiate our services from the competition. See discussion of our future strategy in Fiscal 2005 Outlook below. We also believe our marketing campaign, which focused primarily on our brand, did not effectively drive clients, particularly early season filers, into our offices. The average fee per client at our franchise offices increased 8.4%, while clients served declined 15.9%. The decline is due to the former major franchise territories being operated as company owned for the majority of fiscal year 2004. These changes, coupled with the re franchising of certain former major franchise territories at higher royalty rates, resulted in an increase in royalty revenue of 6.3%. Revenues earned during the current year in connection with RAL participations totaled $168.4 million. These revenues are approximately $30.1 million higher than waiver fees earned during fiscal year 2003 and $8.4 million higher than participation fees earned in fiscal year 2002. See discussion on the waiver below. Our RAL participation revenues are benefiting from the new company owned operations in former major franchise territories. We participate in RALs at a rate of nearly 50% for company owned offices compared to 25% in major franchise offices. This increased participation rate has allowed our revenues to increase, although the number of RALs has declined 8.2% since fiscal year 2002. During fiscal year 2003, we entered into an agreement with Household, whereby we waived our right to purchase any participation interests in and receive license fees for RALs during the period January 1 through April 30, 2003. In consideration for waiving these rights we received a series of payments from Household in fiscal year 2003, subject to certain adjustments in fiscal year 2004 based on delinquency rates. See discussion in Item 1, RAL Participations and 2003 Tax Season Waiver. A total of 3.8 million software units were sold during fiscal year 2004, an increase of 11.2% compared to unit sales of 3.4 million in 2003. Software units include TaxCut Federal, TaxCut State, DeductionPro, WillPower and Legal Advisor. Revenues from software sales of $69.5 million in fiscal year 2004 increased 11.4% as a result of the higher sales volume. Online tax preparation revenues increased 70.6% to $44.9 million primarily as a result of an increase in the average price and a 31.2% increase in clients served. Increases in software and online unit sales have an especially beneficial impact to our earnings, as these operations have relatively low variable costs. POM revenues for fiscal year 2004 increased $27.3 million, or 57.4%, primarily due to a change in accounting principle. Prior to the adoption of EITF 00 21, revenues related to POM guarantees in premium offices were recorded within tax preparation revenues. With the adoption of EITF 00 21, the revenues are deferred and recognized over the guarantee period. The increase over the prior year is a result of the amortization of larger deferred revenue balances established as part of the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The cumulative effect will increase revenues this year and in future years, but is offset by the $6.4 million reduction to consolidated net income in fiscal year 2004. Total expenses for fiscal year 2004 were up $151.4 million, or 11.5%, from 2003. These increased expenses were partially attributable to the operation of former major franchise territories as company owned. Compensation and benefits increased $42.6 million as a result of the former major franchises and $20.2 million due to field wages during the later part of the tax season. Additionally, $12.9 million was incurred for the expensing of stock options awarded to seasonal tax associates. Occupancy and equipment costs increased $28.1 million due primarily to a 5.7% increase in the average rent and a 3.4% increase in the number of offices under lease. Depreciation and amortization increased as a result of $9.0 million in intangible amortization from the acquisition of assets of former major franchisees and additional equipment purchased for new office locations opened during the period. Bad debt expense increased $26.8 million as a result of bad debt expense associated with RAL participations, which was not recorded in the prior year due to the waiver agreement. Allocated marketing costs increased $20.7 million as a result of additional marketing directed toward our brand repositioning and raising consumer awareness of our advice offerings via the Block Advantage Campaign. Allocated information technology costs increased $13.9 million as a result of additional technology projects. These increases were partially offset by a $62.1 million decrease in legal expenses, which is primarily a result of the Texas RAL litigation settlement and other cases in the prior year. See discussion in RAL Litigation below. Pretax income for fiscal year 2004 increased $80.5 million, or 14.7%, over 2003. The segments operating margin improved sixty basis points to 30.0% in fiscal year 2004. Fiscal 2005 outlook For us to successfully grow our client base in future years, we must improve the convenience of our services through office expansion and differentiate the value of our services through advice and multi channel access. In fiscal year 2005, we plan to expand our company owned office locations by 500 600 offices. We believe by investing in our office network, we can attract potential clients who are primarily motivated by convenience. Although, we expect the additional tax offices to result in incremental revenues during fiscal year 2005, due to the cost of expansion, we do not expect any growth in pretax income from this office expansion. Over the past few fiscal years, we have focused on integrating actionable advice into our relationships with our tax clients. We continue each year to add new areas of free advice targeted at the individual client based on information provided during the preparation of their tax return. We believe our advice based strategy is a key point of differentiation and strengthens our competitive position. In addition, our Licensed Referral Tax Professional (LRTP) program, which provides referrals to HRBFA financial advisors, is key to bringing financial advice and services to the portion of our client base where more sophisticated investment services are appropriate. Our fiscal year 2005 goal is to have 2,500 LRTPs. We believe this advice relationship, as well as our ability to offer retail mortgage products to our client base increases our tax client retention. We will also continue to enhance our digital tax solutions. We believe our multi channel strategy not only allows clients to choose how they want to be served, but also allows us to appeal to a different client base than we do through our offices. Fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 U.S. Tax Operations revenues increased $30.4 million, or 1.7%, to $1.9 billion for fiscal year 2003. 18 Table of Contents Form 10 K H&R BLOCK Tax preparation and related fees increased $14.1 million, or 1.0%, for fiscal year 2003, compared to fiscal year 2002. This increase is due to a 6.7% increase in our average fee per client served, partially offset by a 4.3% decrease in clients served in company owned offices. The increase in the average fee per client served is primarily due to an increase in the complexity of returns prepared. The decrease in clients served in company owned offices during fiscal year 2003 was driven primarily by the impact of the sustained weak economy. Additionally, due to the absence of substantive tax law changes, the marketing programs failed to attract as much new business as in the previous year. Royalty revenue increased $8.7 million, or 5.6%. The average fee per client served at franchise offices increased 8.1%, while clients served declined 2.7%. RAL waiver fees of $138.2 million were recognized during fiscal year 2003. We participated in RALs in fiscal year 2002 and recognized revenues of $160.0 million. A total of 3.4 million software units were sold during fiscal year 2003, an increase of 12.1% compared to unit sales of 3.0 million in 2002. Revenues from software sales of $62.4 million in fiscal year 2003 increased 13.8% as a result of the higher sales volume. This increase was partially offset by increases in the number of rebates offered and customer rebate redemption rates. Online tax preparation revenues increased 80.0% primarily as a result of a 91.3% increase in clients served. Total expenses for fiscal year 2003 were up $16.8 million, or 1.3%, from 2002. These increased expenses were primarily attributable to a litigation reserve of $41.7 million recorded during the second quarter of fiscal year 2003 relating to Texas RAL litigation. Other legal costs increased $20.4 million due to various legal proceedings. Occupancy and equipment costs increased $20.4 million due primarily to a 5.2% increase in the number of offices under lease and increases in related utility and other support charges. Allocated finance expenses increased $9.1 million, or 68.6%, primarily due to increased insurance costs. These increases were partially offset by a $20.8 million decrease in compensation and benefits. This decrease was due to better management of support staff wages, a decline in payroll taxes related to seasonal stock option exercises and changes in the tax preparer compensation plan. Bad debt expense declined $20.9 million as a result of collections of RAL receivables, which were written off in prior years, and the elimination of bad debt expense associated with RAL participations. Other expenses decreased $32.4 million from 2002 primarily due to reduced servicing expenses associated with prior year RAL participations. Pretax income for fiscal year 2003 increased $13.6 million, or 2.6%, over 2002. The segments operating margin improved thirty basis points to 29.4% in fiscal year 2003. RAL litigation We have been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits around the country alleging that we engaged in wrongdoing with respect to the RAL program. In particular, the plaintiffs in these cases have alleged that disclosures in the RAL applications were inadequate, misleading and untimely; that the RAL interest rates were usurious and unconscionable; that we suppressed the fact that we would receive part of the finance charges paid by the customer for such loans; and that we owe, and breached, a fiduciary duty to our customers in connection with the RAL program. In many of these cases, the plaintiffs seek to proceed on behalf of a class of similarly situated RAL customers, and in certain instances the courts have allowed the cases to proceed as class actions. In other cases, courts have held that plaintiffs must pursue their claims on an individual basis, and may not proceed as a class action. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings for additional information. On November 19, 2002, we announced a settlement had been reached in the cases Ronnie and Nancy Haese, et al. v. H&R Block, Inc., et al., Case No. CV96 4213, District Court of Kleberg County, Texas (Haese I) and Ronnie and Nancy Haese, et al. v. H&R Block, Inc., et al., Case No. CV 99 314 D, District Court of Kleberg County, Texas (Haese II), filed originally as one action on July 30, 1996. As a result of that settlement, we recorded a liability and pretax expense of $43.5 million during the 2003 fiscal year. This represented our best estimate of our share of the settlement, plaintiff class legal fees and expenses, tax products and associated mailing expenses. Our share of the settlement is less than the total amount awarded due to amounts recoverable from a co defendant in the case. We believe we have strong defenses to the various RAL cases and will vigorously defend our position. Nevertheless, the amounts claimed by the plaintiffs are, in some instances, very substantial, and there can be no assurances as to the ultimate outcome of the pending RAL cases, or as to the impact of the RAL cases on our financial statements. 19 Table of Contents H&R BLOCK Form 10 K MORTGAGE OPERATIONS This segment is primarily engaged in the origination of non prime mortgage loans through an independent broker network, the origination of prime and non prime mortgage loans through a retail office network, the sale and securitization of mortgage loans and residual interests, and the servicing of non prime loans. We believe offering retail mortgage products to other segments clients results in added value to the total client experience. During fiscal year 2004, 48.9% of our retail loans were made to other segments clients. We estimate, for those clients who purchase these products, their retention as a tax client improves by more than six percentage points.

This increase was primarily a result of higher servicing income, increased production volumes and accretion. The following table summarizes the key drivers of gains on sales of mortgage loans: (dollars in 000s) Year ended April 30, 2004 2003 Number of sales associates (1) 2,812 2,228 Total number of applications 269,267 216,492 Closing ratio (2) 57.7% 53.5% Total number of originations 155,339 115,841 Average loan size $ 150 $ 143 Total originations $ 23,256,013 $ 16,577,621 Non prime/prime origination ratio 17.5:1 8.8:1 Loan sales $ 23,234,935 $ 17,225,774 Execution price net gain on sale (3) 4.09% 4.46% (1) Includes all direct sales and back office sales support associates.

(3) Defined as total premium received divided by total balance of loans delivered to third party investors or securitization vehicles (excluding mortgage servicing rights and the effect of loan origination expenses). 20 Table of Contents Form 10 K H&R BLOCK Gains on sales of mortgage loans increased $53.1 million to $716.7 million for the year ended April 30, 2004. The increase over last year is a result of a significant increase in loan origination volume, an increase in the average loan size and the closing ratio, partially offset by a decrease in the loan sale execution price and increased loan sale repurchase reserves. During the year, the Company originated $23.3 billion in mortgage loans compared to $16.6 billion last year, an increase of 40.3%. The execution price on mortgage loan sales decreased primarily due to lower mortgage rates as the non prime industry adjusted rates to reflect changes in the market interest rates. The loan sale repurchase reserves, which are netted against gains on sales, increased $25.5 million over the prior year. This increase is primarily a result of an increase in loan sales coupled with the increase in whole loan sales compared to securitizations, for which higher reserves are provided at the time of sale for estimated repurchases. Whole loan sales accounted for 76% of total loan sales, compared to 41% in the prior year. In November 2002, the Company completed the sale of previously securitized residual interests and recorded a gain of $130.9 million. This sale accelerated cash flows from these residual interests, effectively realizing previously recorded unrealized gains included in other comprehensive income. Two smaller transactions were completed in fiscal year 2004, which resulted in gains of $40.7 million. Impairments of residual interests in securitizations of $30.7 million were recognized during the year compared with $54.1 million in the prior year. The impairments were due primarily to loan performance of older residuals and changes in assumptions to more closely align with the current economic and interest rate environment. The following table summarizes the key drivers of loan servicing revenues: (dollars in 000s) Year ended April 30, 2004 2003 Average servicing portfolio: With related MSRs $ 32,039,811 $ 23,858,490 Without related MSRs 6,481,069 3,883,980 $ 38,520,880 $ 27,742,470 Number of loans serviced 324,364 246,463 Average delinquency rate 6.04% 7.08% Value of MSRs $ 113,821 $ 99,265 Loan servicing revenues increased $43.4 million, or 25.8%, this year. The increase reflects a higher average loan servicing portfolio, which was partially offset by the reduction of certain of our ancillary fees previously charged to borrowers. The average servicing portfolio for fiscal year 2004 increased 38.9%. Total accretion of residual interests increased $22.9 million over the prior year. This improvement is the result of write ups in the related asset values in fiscal years 2003 and 2004. Increases in fair value are realized in income through accretion over the remaining expected life of the residual interest. For the majority of fiscal year 2004, our residual interests continued to perform better than expected primarily due to lower interest rates during the first part of the year and due to lower credit losses than assumed during the later part of the year. As a result of this performance, our residuals have produced, or are expected to produce, more cash proceeds than projected in previous valuation models. We recorded favorable pretax mark to market adjustments, which increased the fair value of our residual interests $199.7 million during the year. These adjustments were recorded, net of write downs of $32.6 million and deferred taxes of $63.8 million, in other comprehensive income and will be accreted into income throughout the remaining life of the residual interests. Future changes in interest rates, actual loan pool performance or other assumptions could cause additional favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the fair value of the residual interests and could cause changes to the accretion of these residual interests in future periods. Additionally, sales of previously securitized residual interests results in decreases to accretion income in future periods. Accretion of beneficial interest in Trusts increased $64.4 million, or 62.4%, in 2004. The balance of loans held by the Trusts and the interest margin earned impacts our accretion. The average balance of loans held by the Trusts increased to $3.2 billion from $1.8 billion in the prior year. The interest margin is the difference between the rate on the underlying loans and the financing costs of the Trusts. The interest rate margin decreased to 5.40% during fiscal year 2004, from 5.76% in 2003. Total expenses increased $131.7 million, or 27.9%, over the prior year. Servicing and processing expenses increased $32.8 million, or 43.8%, as a result of a higher average servicing portfolio and the acceleration of amortization of certain MSRs. Compensation and benefits increased $55.3 million as a result of a 22.9% increase in the number of employees, reflecting resources needed to support higher loan production volumes. Other expenses increased $37.0 million, or 33.1%, for the current year, primarily due to $10.4 million in increased marketing expenses primarily for retail mortgage direct mail advertising, $13.5 million in increased allocated corporate and shared costs and $7.2 million in increased consulting expenses. Allocated costs increased due to higher insurance costs and the expensing of stock based compensation. Occupancy and equipment expenses increased $6.6 million due to nine additional branch offices opened since October 2002, continued expansion of a second servicing center that opened in August 2002 and additional administrative office space. Pretax income decreased $15.7 million, or 2.3%, for fiscal year 2004. Fiscal 2005 outlook We believe fiscal year 2005 will generally be a rising interest rate environment. In a rising interest rate environment, we expect our profit margins will narrow due to less favorable loan execution pricing compared to the sustained period of declining rates over the last two fiscal years. Actual execution pricing for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2004 was 3.96% and 4.09%, respectively. As of April 30, 2004, we have forward loan sale commitments at an average execution price of 4.38%. With the rising interest rates we have raised our coupon rate since year end. Although the timing and magnitude of changes to non prime mortgage interest rates may differ from changes in other market interest rates, we will be utilizing various strategies in fiscal year 2005 to manage our pricing in a competitive rate environment. Additionally, we believe we can grow our originations at a modest level by continued expansion of our retail business and focusing on controllable drivers in our wholesale business. These drivers include geographic expansion, growing our sales force, increasing our penetration of existing broker relationships and continuing to improve our closing ratios. Based on these assumptions, we expect our mortgage segment pretax income to be flat to slightly down from this year, excluding the gain on sale of previously securitized residual interests. Fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 Mortgage Operations revenues increased $463.1 million, or 65.9%, compared to fiscal year 2002. This increase was primarily a result of increased production volumes and related sales execution pricing, gains on sales of previously securitized residuals and accretion on residual interests. Gains on sales of mortgage loans increased $208.2 million to $663.6 million for the year ended April 30, 2003. The increase over the prior year is a result of a significant increase in loan origination volume, an increase in the average loan size, the closing ratio and the loan sale execution price. During 2003, the Company 21 Table of Contents H&R BLOCK Form 10 K originated $16.6 billion in mortgage loans compared to $11.5 billion in 2002, an increase of 44.7%. The execution price on mortgage loan sales increased primarily due to declining interest rates during the year, offset by a decline in the weighted average coupon rate charged to borrowers. In November 2002, the Company completed the sale of previously securitized residual interests and recorded a gain of $130.9 million. Impairments of residual interests in securitizations of $54.1 million were recognized during fiscal year 2003, due primarily to loan performance of older residuals and changes in assumptions to more closely align with the current economic and interest rate environment. Loan servicing revenues increased $21.2 million, or 14.4%, over fiscal year 2002. The increase reflects a higher average loan servicing portfolio. The average servicing portfolio for fiscal year 2003 increased 39.4%. Total accretion of residual interests increased $94.6 million over fiscal year 2002. This improvement is the result of increases in the related asset values in fiscal years 2002 and 2003. Increases in fair value are realized in income through accretion over the remaining expected life of the residual interest. We recorded favorable pretax mark to market adjustments, which increased the fair value of our residual interests $203.8 million during fiscal year 2003, and write downs of $19.1 million. These adjustments were recorded, net of write downs and deferred taxes of $70.5 million, in other comprehensive income and will be accreted into income throughout the remaining life of the residual interests. Accretion of beneficial interest in Trusts increased $32.6 million, or 46.2%, in 2003, due to the average balance on loans held by the Trusts increasing to $1.8 billion from $1.2 billion in fiscal year 2002. Also contributing to the increase was higher interest margin earned. The interest rate margin increased to 5.76% during fiscal year 2003, from 5.58% in 2002. Total expenses increased $108.5 million, or 29.9%, over fiscal year 2002. This increase is primarily due to a $71.1 million increase in compensation and benefits as a result of a 23.2% increase in the number of employees, reflecting resources needed to support higher loan production volumes. Occupancy and equipment expenses increased $11.9 million due to the opening of an additional servicing center and expansion of the servicing and information technology facilities to support the higher overall activity levels. Servicing and processing expenses declined due to an impairment of $11.6 million on servicing assets recorded during fiscal year 2002, while only $866 thousand was recorded in fiscal year 2003. Other expenses increased $36.9 million, or 49.2%, primarily due to increased consulting, depreciation and marketing expenses. Pretax income increased $354.6 million, or 104.5%, for fiscal year 2003. 22 Table of Contents Form 10 K H&R BLOCK BUSINESS SERVICES This segment offers middle market companies accounting, tax and consulting services, wealth management, retirement resources, payroll services, corporate finance and financial process outsourcing.

This increase was primarily due to a $38.2 million increase in capital markets revenue resulting from a 97.4% increase in the number of platforms delivered. Revenues in accounting, tax and consulting also increased $20.3 million over the prior year as a result of newly acquired tax businesses and increased productivity. The acquisition of U.S. Tax Operations former major franchises allowed us to acquire the tax businesses associated with the original M&P acquisition. We were previously unable to acquire and operate these businesses in direct competition with major franchise territories. The acquired tax businesses contributed $13.0 million in revenues in the current fiscal year. The remainder of the increase was driven primarily by a 3.3% increase in the net collected rate per hour. Total expenses increased $31.6 million, or 7.1%, over the prior year. Compensation and benefits costs increased $43.8 million, primarily as a result of increased activity in the capital markets business and increased costs in traditional accounting. A goodwill impairment charge of $11.8 million was recorded in the prior year. No such impairment was recorded in fiscal year 2004. Pretax income for the year ended April 30, 2004 was $19.3 million compared to a loss of $14.1 million in fiscal year 2003. Fiscal 2005 outlook Our focus for fiscal year 2005 is growing the business within our current markets by expanding our services to existing clients and by targeting other mid size companies in those areas. To achieve this goal, we began the development of a national sales force in fiscal year 2004 and we plan to continue to roll this initiative out in fiscal year 2005. Additionally, in May 2004 we initiated new marketing efforts designed to promote brand awareness and the services we offer. We have no major acquisition plans for fiscal year 2005. Fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 Business Services revenues for fiscal year 2003 improved $17.2 million, or 4.1%, over fiscal year 2002. This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Equico Resources, LLC (EquiCo) in December 2001, which contributed an increase of $24.9 million over fiscal year 2002. Revenues from traditional accounting services declined $13.1 million over fiscal year 2002 as a result of a 20.0% reduction in tax planning services sold and lower revenues per unit sold. This decline was somewhat offset by growth in core accounting and tax services, driven primarily by an increase in the net collected rate per hour. Additionally, fiscal year 2003 was the first year there was no significant year over year growth related to new acquisitions. In fiscal year 2003 we acquired only a few businesses to add scale to existing offices and only one new location was added, resulting in an increase of $1.7 million in revenues. Deferred revenue increased $12.2 million in fiscal year 2003 due to a backlog of scheduled capital markets platforms resulting from staffing shortages. Total expenses increased $54.0 million, or 13.7%, over fiscal year 2002. Compensation and benefits costs increased $26.3 million and occupancy and equipment costs increased $4.5 million, primarily as a result of the EquiCo and MyBenefitSource, Inc. (MBS) acquisitions in December 2001. Other expenses increased by $9.8 million primarily due to increased legal and travel expenses, both related to EquiCo and MBS. As part of our annual goodwill impairment testing, an impairment charge of $11.8 million was recorded related to MBS in fiscal year 2003. The pretax loss for fiscal year 2003 was $14.1 million compared to pretax income of $22.7 million in fiscal year 2002.

The improvement is primarily due to the increase in annuitized revenues. Transactional revenue, which is based on transaction or trade quantities, increased $8.2 million, or 8.8%, from the prior year due to a 24.4% increase in trading activity, partially offset by a slight decline in average revenue per trade. Annuitized revenues increased $22.3 million, or 59.8%, due to increased sales of annuities and mutual funds. The increase in production revenues is also due to an increase in advisor productivity. We added a net 25 advisors this year and advisor productivity continues to improve. Productivity averaged approximately $166,000 per advisor compared to $122,000 last year. Margin interest revenue declined $3.9 million, or 10.4%, from the prior year primarily as a result of a 5.5% decline in average margin balances coupled with lower interest rates. Margin balances declined from an average of $577.0 million in fiscal year 2003 to $545.0 million in the current year. Accordingly, interest expense for fiscal year 2004 declined $3.5 million, or 71.9%, from fiscal year 2003. Margin balances, which steadily declined during most of 2003, have steadily increased in the last several months of fiscal year 2004 and averaged $600.0 million for the fourth quarter. Total expenses decreased $31.7 million, or 9.8%, primarily due to the $24.0 million goodwill impairment charge recorded last year. Other expenses decreased $19.5 million primarily as a result of a reduction in consulting and legal expenses. These decreases were partially offset by a $12.1 million increase in commissions expense due to the increase in customer trading and higher average commissions paid. 24 Table of Contents Form 10 K H&R BLOCK The pretax loss for Investment Services for fiscal year 2004 was $64.4 million compared to a loss of $128.3 million last year. Fiscal 2005 outlook We believe the key to segment profitability is the recruitment and retention of experienced financial advisors. See additional discussion of our advisor production in Item 1, Description of Business. Our goal is to hire 250 300 experienced advisors in fiscal year 2005. We are also partnering with the U.S. Tax Operation segment in the LRTP program, which focuses on adding advice to our tax client relationships through licensing and aligning tax professionals with financial advisors. See additional discussion above in U.S. Tax Operations outlook section. Although we expect to see continued improvements in our financial performance, we still expect to report an operating loss for fiscal year 2005. Fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 Investment Services revenues, net of interest expense, for fiscal year 2003 declined $40.0 million, or 16.9%, compared to fiscal year 2002. The decrease was primarily due to lower net interest income and lower transactional revenues. Transactional revenue decreased $30.6 million, or 24.7%, from the prior year due to a 20.7% decline in trading activity, partially offset by an increase in average revenue per trade. Additionally, syndicate fee revenues of $6.7 million were included in Other revenues for fiscal year 2003 and in fiscal year 2002 they were included in Transactional revenue. Annuitized revenues increased $11.7 million, or 45.5%, due to increased sales of annuities and mutual funds. Margin interest revenue declined $30.5 million, or 45.0%, from fiscal year 2002 primarily as a result of a 42.3% decline in average margin balances coupled with lower interest rates. Margin balances declined from an average of $1.0 billion for fiscal year 2002 to $577.0 million in 2003. Accordingly, interest expense for fiscal year 2003 declined $9.9 million, or 67.2%, from fiscal year 2002. Total expenses increased $33.5 million, or 11.5%, primarily due to a $24.0 million goodwill impairment charge recorded during fiscal year 2003. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2003, in light of unsettled market conditions and the severe decline of comparable business valuations in the investment industry, we engaged an independent valuation firm to perform the goodwill impairment test, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, on the Investment Services segment. As a result, the $24.0 million impairment charge was recorded. Additional expense increases resulted from various new initiatives to expand products and the business, including the installation of a new back office brokerage operating system, relocation to new offices and advisor recruitment initiatives. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in commissions expense due to the decline in customer trading and cost containment measures. As a result of meeting certain three year production goals established in connection with the acquisition of OLDE Financial, certain long term advisors were eligible to receive a one time retention payment. The retention period was through December 31, 2002. Retention payments under this plan of approximately $17.0 million were accrued through the third quarter of fiscal year 2003. The retention payments were paid out in February 2003. The pretax loss for Investment Services for fiscal year 2003 was $128.3 million compared to the prior year loss of $54.9 million. INTERNATIONAL TAX OPERATIONS This segment is primarily engaged in providing local tax return preparation, filing and related services in Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom. In addition, International Tax Operations includes Overseas operations, which consists of company owned and franchise offices preparing tax returns for U.S. citizens living abroad. Operations in this segment are transacted in the local currencies of the countries in which they operate, therefore the results can be affected by the translation into U.S. dollars. The weakening of the U.S. dollar during the current year had the impact of increasing reported revenues, income and losses. International Tax Operations Financial Results (in 000s) Year ended April 30, 2004 2003 2002 Canada $ 64,238 $ 57,985 $ 55,753 Australia 26,577 20,614 17,701 Other 6,745 6,483 5,256 Total revenues 97,560 85,082 78,710 Canada 8,888 8,108 7,728 Australia 4,609 3,802 2,912 Other (2,400 ) (1,446 ) (3,547 ) Pretax income $ 11,097 $ 10,464 $ 7,093 Fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 International Tax Operations revenues for the year ended April 30, 2004 increased $12.5 million, or 14.7%, compared to the prior year. This improvement is due to results in Canada and Australia. Revenues in Canada increased $6.3 million, or 10.8%, entirely as a result of favorable foreign exchange rates. Revenues in Canadian dollars declined 0.4% primarily due to a 3.5% decline in the average charge per return, somewhat offset by an increase in company owned tax returns prepared, most of which were discounted returns. The decline in average charge resulted from our current year marketing program, which was designed to attract students and younger filers. Of the $6.0 million increase in Australian revenues, $4.9 million was due to favorable foreign exchange rates. Additionally, tax returns prepared in company owned offices in fiscal year 2004 increased 3.7% compared to the prior year and the average charge per return increased 2.0%. Pretax income improved $0.6 million, or 6.1%, primarily due to exchange rates, as earnings in local currencies were similar to the prior year. Fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 International Tax Operations revenues for the year ended April 30, 2003 increased $6.4 million, or 8.1%, compared to fiscal year 2002. This improvement is primarily due to results in Australia, where tax returns prepared in company owned offices in fiscal year 2003 increased 3.7% compared to 2002 and the average charge per return increased 3.0%. Revenues in Canada increased $2.2 million, or 4.0%, entirely as a result of foreign exchange rates. Revenues in Canadian dollars declined 2.3% primarily due to the sale of certain operations during 2003 and a decline in the number of returns prepared. Tax returns prepared declined 3.7% as a result of increased competition in the major metropolitan areas. Pretax income improved $3.4 million, or 47.5%, primarily due to cost savings in the United Kingdom as a result of business restructuring and the write off of intangible assets in the prior year, which is included in Other in the above table. 25 Table of Contents H&R BLOCK Form 10 K CORPORATE OPERATIONS This segment consists primarily of corporate support departments, which provide services to our operating segments. These support departments consist of marketing, information technology, facilities, human resources, executive, legal, finance, government relations and corporate communications. Support department costs are generally allocated to our operating segments. Our captive insurance, franchise financing and small business initiative subsidiaries are also included within this segment.

Corporate expenses declined $6.9 million, or 5.4%, due primarily to lower interest expense. Interest expense on acquisition debt declined as a result of lower financing costs and a scheduled payment of $45.1 million in August 2003. Information technology department expenses increased $17.7 million, or 19.0%, primarily due to additional resources needed to support additional projects on behalf of the operating segments and other support departments. Marketing department expenses increased $21.7 million, or 24.4%, primarily as a result of marketing initiatives for U.S. Tax Operations directed toward our brand repositioning and raising consumer awareness of our advice offerings. The pretax loss was $107.7 million, compared with last years loss of $122.0 million. Our effective income tax rate for fiscal year 2004 decreased to 39.5% compared to 41.2% in fiscal year 2003, primarily as a result of non deductible goodwill impairment charges recorded in the prior year. Fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 Corporate Operations revenues declined $6.4 million primarily as a result of a $4.2 million decrease in operating interest income and a $2.0 million write off of investments at our captive insurance subsidiary. Corporate expenses declined $11.7 million, or 8.4%, due primarily to lower interest expense. Interest expense on acquisition debt declined as a result of lower financing costs and a payment of $39.8 million in August 2002. Information technology department expenses increased $8.1 million, or 9.5%, primarily due to a 20.5% increase in department personnel to support additional projects on behalf of the operating segments. Finance department expenses increased $10.4 million, or 52.7%, primarily as a result of $4.7 million in increased insurance costs and $2.4 million in additional consulting fees over fiscal year 2002. The pretax loss was $122.0 million, compared with the fiscal year 2002 loss of $131.0 million. Our effective income tax rate for fiscal year 2003 increased to 41.2% compared to 39.4% in fiscal year 2002, primarily as a result of non deductible goodwill impairment charges recorded in 2003. FINANCIAL CONDITION CAPITAL RESOURCES & LIQUIDITY BY SEGMENT Our sources of capital include cash from operations, issuances of common stock and debt. We use capital primarily to fund working capital requirements, pay dividends, repurchase our shares and acquire businesses. Cash From Operations. Operating cash flows totaled $926.8 million, $690.8 million and $741.4 million in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Operating cash flows in fiscal year 2004 improved compared to fiscal year 2003 due to an increase of $117.8 million in net income and increased cash flows from both Mortgage Operations and U.S. Tax Operations. Mortgage Operations contributed $278.5 million to cash from operations in the current year compared to $145.0 million in fiscal year 2003. U.S. Tax Operations contributed $521.6 million in operating cash flows this year compared to $410.2 million in the prior year. Issuances of Common Stock. We issue shares of our common stock in accordance with our stock based compensation plans out of our treasury shares. Proceeds from the issuance of common stock totaled $120.0 million, $126.3 million and $195.2 million in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Dividends. We have consistently paid quarterly dividends. Dividends paid totaled $138.4 million, $125.9 million and $115.7 million in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Share Repurchases. On June 9, 2004, our Board of Directors approved an authorization to repurchase an additional 15 million shares. This authorization is in addition to the authorization of 20 million shares on June 11, 2003 and 15 million shares on September 12, 2001. During fiscal year 2004, we repurchased 10.6 million shares pursuant to these authorizations at an aggregate price of 26 Table of Contents Form 10 K H&R BLOCK $518.5 million or an average price of $48.90 per share. There were 11.3 million shares remaining under the 2003 authorization and no shares remaining under the 2001 authorization at the end of fiscal year 2004. We plan to continue to purchase shares on the open market in accordance with these authorizations, subject to various factors including the price of the stock, the availability of excess cash, our ability to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility, securities laws restrictions and other investment opportunities available. Acquisitions. We, from time to time, acquire businesses that are a good strategic fit to our organization. Significant acquisitions during fiscal year 2004 were the former major franchise territories we now operate as company owned. Cash paid in fiscal year 2004 related to the acquisition of these territories totaled $243.2 million. Total cash paid for acquisitions was $280.9 million during fiscal year 2004 and $26.4 million during fiscal year 2003. Restricted Cash. We hold certain cash balances that are restricted as to use. Cash and cash equivalents restricted totaled $545.4 million at fiscal year end. Investment Services held $531.6 million of this total segregated in a special reserve account for the exclusive benefit of customers pursuant to Rule 15c3 3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Investment Services restricted cash balance has grown from $400.1 million at the beginning of fiscal year 2004 as customer credit balances have increased at a faster pace than customer debit balances. Restricted cash of $13.2 million at April 30, 2004 held by Business Services is related to funds held to pay payroll taxes on behalf of its customers. Restricted cash held by Mortgage Operations totaled $0.6 million at April 30, 2004 as a result of cash held for outstanding commitments to fund mortgage loans. Fiscal year 2005 outlook. We are planning on refinancing our $250.0 million in Senior Notes, which are due in November 2004. We are also beginning construction on a new world headquarters facility during fiscal year 2005. Estimated construction costs during fiscal year 2005 of $18 million will be financed from operating cash flows. A condensed consolidating statement of cash flows by segment for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2004 follows. Generally, interest is not charged on intercompany activities between segments. Detailed consolidated statements of cash flows are located in Item 8. (in 000s) U.S. Tax Mortgage Business Investment International Tax Corporate Consolidated Operations Operations Services Services Operations Operations H&R Block Cash provided by (used in): Operations $ 521,646 $ 278,461 $ 61,875 $ (28,200 ) $ 19,458 $ 73,567 $ 926,807 Investing (293,711 ) 219,111 (39,373 ) (4,086 ) (4,679 ) (8,395 ) (131,133 ) Financing (59,003 ) (129 ) (540,219 ) (599,351 ) Net intercompany (188,699 ) (546,609 ) 49,668 31,841 (13,831 ) 667,630 Net intercompany activities are excluded from investing and financing activities within the segment cash flows. We believe that by excluding intercompany activities, the cash flows by segment more clearly depicts the cash generated and used by each segment. Had intercompany activities been included, those segments in a net lending situation would have been included in investing activities, and those in a net borrowing situation would have been included in financing activities. U.S. Tax Operations: U.S. Tax Operations has historically been our largest provider of annual operating cash flows. The seasonal nature of U.S. Tax Operations generally results in a large positive operating cash flow in the fourth quarter. U.S. Tax Operations generated $521.6 million in operating cash flows primarily related to net income, as cash is generally collected from clients at the time services are rendered. Cash requirements for investing activities of $293.7 million includes $243.2 million paid to former major franchisees. Household and its designated bank provide funding of all RALs offered pursuant to a contract that expires in June 2006. If Household and its designated bank do not continue to provide funding for RALs, we could seek other RAL lenders to continue offering RALs to our clients or consider alternative funding strategies. We believe that a number of suitable lenders would be available to replace Household should the need arise. We also believe that the RAL program is a productive product line for the Company and a useful product for our customers. The RAL program is regularly reviewed both from a business perspective and to ensure compliance with applicable state and federal laws. It is our intention to continue to offer the RAL program in the foreseeable future. Loss of the RAL program could adversely affect our operating results. In addition to the loss of revenues and income directly attributable to the RAL program, the inability to offer RALs could indirectly result in the loss of retail tax clients and associated tax preparation revenues, unless we were able to take mitigating actions. Revenues from RAL participations were $168.4 million for the year ended April 30, 2004, and after direct costs, contributed $92.7 million to the segments results. Total revenues related to the RAL program (including revenues from participation interests) were $174.2 million for the year ended April 30, 2004, representing 4.1% of consolidated revenues. Revenues related to the RAL program totaled $142.1 million for the year ended April 30, 2003, representing 3.8% of consolidated revenues. Mortgage Operations: This segment primarily generates cash as a result of the sale and securitization of mortgage loans and residual interests and as its residual interests mature. Mortgage Operations provided $278.5 million in cash from operating activities primarily due to the sale of mortgage loans. This segment also generated $219.1 million in cash from investing activities primarily related to cash received from the maturity and sales of residual interests. Gains on Sales. Gains on sales of mortgage loans and related assets totaled $726.7 million, of which 87% was received as cash. The cash was primarily recorded as operating activities. 27 Table of Contents H&R BLOCK Form 10 K The percent of gains on sales of mortgage assets received as cash is calculated as follows: (in 000s) Year ended April 30, 2004 2003 2002 Cash: Whole loans sold by the Trusts $ 721,957 $ 347,241 $ 65,219 Loans securitized 198,226 389,449 414,844 Sale of previously securitized residuals 40,689 130,881 Loan origination expenses, net (325,605 ) (203,511 ) (116,699 ) 635,267 664,060 363,364 Non cash: Retained mortgage servicing rights 84,274 60,078 52,844 Additions (reductions) to balance sheet (1) 11,490 (10,829 ) 22,910 Changes in beneficial interest in Trusts 37,918 74,987 17,028 Impairments to fair value of residual interests (30,661 ) (54,111 ) (30,987 ) Net change in fair value of rate lock commitments (11,570 ) 6,158 (758 ) 91,451 76,283 61,037 Reported gains on sales of mortgage assets $ 726,718 $ 740,343 $ 424,401 % of gains received as cash 87% 90% 86% (1) Includes residual interests and interest rate caps. Another important measure of cash generation is the percentage of cash proceeds we receive from our capital market transactions. These amounts are also included within the gain on sale of mortgage assets as reconciled below. The percent calculation is as follows: (in 000s) Year ended April 30, 2004 2003 2002 Cash proceeds: Whole loans sold by the Trusts $ 721,957 $ 347,241 $ 65,219 Loans securitized 198,226 389,449 414,844 Sale of previously securitized residuals 40,689 130,881 960,872 867,571 480,063 Non cash: Retained mortgage servicing rights 84,274 60,078 52,844 Additions (reductions) to balance sheet (1) 11,490 (10,829 ) 22,910 95,764 49,249 75,754 Portion of gain on sale related to capital market transactions $ 1,056,636 $ 916,820 $ 555,817 Other items included in gain on sale: Changes in beneficial interest in Trusts 37,918 74,987 17,028 Impairments to fair value of residual interests (30,661 ) (54,111 ) (30,987 ) Net change in fair value of rate lock commitments (11,570 ) 6,158 (758 ) Loan origination expenses, net (325,605 ) (203,511 ) (116,699 ) (329,918 ) (176,477 ) (131,416 ) Reported gains on sales of mortgage assets $ 726,718 $ 740,343 $ 424,401 % of gain on sale related to capital market transactions received as cash (2) 91% 95% 86% (1) Includes residual interests and interest rate caps. (2) Cash proceeds divided by portion of gain on sale related to capital market transactions. Warehouse Funding. We regularly sell loans as a source of liquidity. Loan sales in fiscal year 2004 were $23.2 billion compared with $17.2 billion in fiscal year 2003. Additionally, Block Financial Corporation (BFC) provides an additional $150 million line of credit for working capital needs. To finance our prime originations, we utilize a warehouse facility with capacity up to $50 million. This annual facility is currently in the final stage of renegotiation, during which time the original maturity has been extended on a month to month basis. This facility bears interest at one month LIBOR plus 64 to 175 basis points. As of April 30, 2004 and 2003, the balance outstanding under this facility was $4.0 million and $6.3 million, respectively, and is included in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other on the consolidated balance sheets. See discussion of our non prime warehouse facilities below in Off Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements. We believe the sources of liquidity available to the Mortgage Operations segment are sufficient for its needs. Risks to the stability of these sources include, but are not limited to, adverse changes in the perception of the non prime industry, adverse changes in the regulation of non prime lending, changes in the rating criteria of non prime lending by third party rating agencies and, to a lesser degree, reduction in the availability of third parties that provide credit 28 Table of Contents Form 10 K H&R BLOCK enhancement. Past performance of the securitizations will also impact the segments future participation in these markets. The five off balance sheet warehouse facilities used by the Trusts, which have a total current capacity of $7.0 billion, are subject to annual renewal, each at a different time during the year, and any of the above events could lead to difficulty in renewing the lines. These risks are mitigated by a staggering of the renewal dates related to these warehouse lines and through the use of multiple lending institutions to secure these lines. Business Services: Business Services funding requirements are largely related to receivables for completed work and work in process. We provide funding sufficient to cover their working capital needs. Business Services also has future obligations and commitments, which are summarized in the tables below under Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments. This segment generated $61.9 million in operating cash flows primarily related to the collection of receivables and net income. Additionally, Business Services used $39.4 million in investing activities primarily related to contingent payments on prior acquisitions, and $59.0 million in financing activities as a result of payments on acquisition debt. Investment Services: Investment Services, through HRBFA, is subject to regulatory requirements intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker dealers. HRBFA is required to maintain minimum net capital as defined under Rule 15c3 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and complies with the alternative capital requirement, which requires a broker dealer to maintain net capital equal to the greater of $250,000 or 2% of the combined aggregate debit balances arising from customer transactions. The net capital rule also provides that equity capital may not be withdrawn or cash dividends paid if resulting net capital would be less than the greater of 5% of combined aggregate debit items or 120% of the minimum required net capital. At the end of fiscal year 2004, HRBFAs net capital of $115.5 million, which was 17.6% of aggregate debit items, exceeded its minimum required net capital of $13.2 million by $102.3 million. During fiscal year 2004, we contributed additional capital of $32.0 million, even though HRBFA was in excess of the minimum net capital requirement, and we may continue to do so in the future. In fiscal year 2004, Investment Services used $28.2 million in its operating activities primarily due to the timing of cash deposits that are restricted for the benefit of customers. To manage short term liquidity, BFC provides HRBFA a $300 million unsecured credit facility. At the end of fiscal year 2004 there was no outstanding balance on this facility. Liquidity needs relating to client trading and margin borrowing activities are met primarily through cash balances in client brokerage accounts and working capital. We believe these sources of funds will continue to be the primary sources of liquidity for Investment Services. Stock loans have historically been used as a secondary source of funding and could be used in the future, if warranted. Securities borrowed and securities loaned transactions are generally reported as collateralized financings. These transactions require us to deposit cash and or collateral with the lender. Securities loaned consist of securities owned by customers, which were purchased on margin. When loaning securities, we receive cash collateral approximately equal to the value of the securities loaned. The amount of cash collateral is adjusted, as required, for market fluctuations in the value of the securities loaned. Interest rates paid on the cash collateral fluctuate as short term interest rates change. To satisfy the margin deposit requirement of client option transactions with the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), Investment Services pledges customers margined securities. Pledged securities at the end of fiscal year 2004 totaled $46.3 million, an excess of $7.9 million over the margin requirement. Pledged securities at the end of fiscal year 2003 totaled $39.7 million, an excess of $4.3 million over the margin requirement. We believe the funding sources for Investment Services are stable. Liquidity risk within this segment is primarily limited to maintaining sufficient capital levels to obtain securities lending liquidity to support margin borrowing by customers. International Tax Operations: International Tax Operations generated $19.5 million in cash flows from operating activities primarily due to its net income as cash is generally collected from clients when services are rendered. International Tax Operations are generally self funded. Cash balances are held in Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom independently in local currencies. Block Canada has a commercial paper program up to $125 million (Canadian). At April 30, 2004, there was no commercial paper outstanding. The peak borrowing during fiscal year 2004 was $61.0 million (Canadian). OFF BALANCE SHEET FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS We are party to various transactions with an off balance sheet component, including loan commitments and QSPEs, or Trusts. We have commitments to fund mortgage loans in our pipeline of $2.6 billion at April 30, 2004, which are subject to conditions and loan contract verification. There is no commitment on the part of the borrower to close and fund on the mortgage loan at this stage of the lending process and external market forces impact the probability of these loan commitments being closed. Therefore, total commitments outstanding do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. If the loan commitments are exercised, they will be funded as described below. Our relationships with the Trusts serve to reduce our capital investment in our non prime mortgage operations. These arrangements are primarily used to sell mortgage loans, but a portion may also be used to sell servicing advances and finance residual interests. Additionally, these arrangements have freed up cash and short term borrowing capacity, improved liquidity and flexibility, and reduced balance sheet risk, while providing stability and access to liquidity in the secondary market for mortgage loans. Substantially all non prime mortgage loans we originate are sold daily to the Trusts. The Trusts purchase the loans from us utilizing five warehouse facilities, arranged by us, totaling $7.0 billion. These facilities are subject to various Option One performance triggers, limits and financial covenants, including tangible net worth and leverage ratios. In addition, these facilities contain cross default features in which a default in one facility would trigger a default under the other facilities as well. These various facilities bear interest at one month LIBOR plus 50 to 100 basis points and expire on various dates during the year. When we sell loans to the Trusts, we remove the mortgage loans from our balance sheet and record the gain on the sale, cash and a beneficial interest in Trusts, which represents the ultimate expected outcome from the disposition of the loans. Our beneficial interest in Trusts totaled $137.8 million and $122.1 million at April 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Subsequently, the Trusts, as directed by their third party beneficial interest holders, either sell the loans directly to third party investors or back to us to pool the loans for securitization. The decision to complete a whole loan sale or a securitization is dependent on market conditions. 29 Table of Contents H&R BLOCK Form 10 K For fiscal year 2004, the final disposition of loans was 24% securitizations and 76% whole loan sales. For fiscal year 2003, the final disposition was 59% securitizations and 41% whole loan sales. The current year shift to whole loan sales is due to the more favorable pricing in the whole loan market. Increased whole loan sale transactions result in cash being received earlier. Additionally, whole loan sales do not add residual interests to our balance sheet, and therefore do not retain balance sheet risk. If the Trusts choose to sell the mortgage loans in a whole loan sale, we receive cash for our beneficial interest in Trusts. In a securitization transaction, after the Trusts transfer the loans, and the right to receive all payments on the loans, to our consolidated special purpose entity, we transfer our beneficial interest in Trusts and the loans to a securitization trust. The securitization trust meets the definition of a QSPE and is therefore not consolidated. The securitization trust issues bonds, which are supported by the cash flows from the pooled loans, to third party investors. We retain an interest in the loans in the form of a residual interest and, therefore, usually assume the first risk of loss for credit losses in the loan pool. As the cash flows of the underlying loans and market conditions change, the value of our residual interests may also change, resulting in potential write ups or impairment of our residual interests. At the settlement of each securitization, we record cash received and our residual interests. Additionally, we reverse the beneficial interest in Trusts. These residual interests are classified as trading securities. See Item 8, note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for our methodology used in valuing our residual interests. To accelerate the cash flows from our residual interests, we securitize the majority of our residual interests in net interest margin (NIM) transactions. In a NIM transaction, the residual interests are transferred to another QSPE (NIM trust), which then issues bonds to third party investors. The proceeds from the bonds are returned to us as payment for the residual interests. The bonds are secured by the pooled residual interests and are obligations of the NIM trust. We retain a subordinated interest in the NIM trust, and receive cash flows on our residual interest generally after the bonds issued to the third party investors are paid in full. At the settlement of each NIM transaction, we remove the residual interests sold from our consolidated balance sheet and record the cash received and the new residual interest retained. These residual interests are classified as available for sale securities. Residual interests retained from NIM securitizations may also be sold in a subsequent securitization or sale transaction. Loans totaling $3.2 billion and $2.2 billion were held by the Trusts as of April 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and were not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. In connection with the sale of mortgage loans, we provide certain representations and warranties allowing the purchaser the option of returning the purchased loans to us under certain conditions. We may recognize losses as a result of the repurchase of loans under these arrangements. We maintain reserves for the repurchase of loans based on historical trends. See Item 8, note 19 to our consolidated financial statements. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has decided to reissue its exposure draft, Qualifying Special Purpose Entities and Isolation of Transferred Assets, an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 140, during the third quarter of calendar year 2004. The purpose of the proposal is to provide more specific guidance on the accounting for transfers of financial assets to a QSPE. Provisions in the first exposure draft, as well as the tentative decision reached by the FASB during its deliberations, may require us to consolidate the Trusts to whom we sell our non prime loans daily. As of April 30, 2004, the Trusts had assets and liabilities of $3.2 billion. The provisions of the exposure draft are subject to FASB due process and are subject to change. We will continue to monitor the status of the exposure draft, and consider changes, if any, to current structures as a result of the proposed rules. COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUANCE We participate in the United States and Canadian commercial paper (CP) markets to meet daily cash needs. CP is issued by BFC and Block Canada, wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company. The following chart provides the debt ratings for BFC as of April 30, 2004 and 2003: Short term Long term Fitch F1 A Moodys P2 A3 S&P A2 BBB+ The following chart provides the debt ratings for Block Canada as of April 30, 2004 and 2003: Short term Corporate Trend DBRS R 1(low) A Stable Moodys P 2 We use capital primarily to fund working capital requirements, pay dividends, repurchase our shares and acquire businesses. Short term borrowings peaked at $2.3 billion in February 2004 related to funding of our participation interests in RALs. No CP was outstanding at April 30, 2004 or 2003. U.S. CP issuances are supported by an unsecured committed line of credit (CLOC) from a consortium of twenty four banks. The $2.0 billion CLOC is subject to annual renewal in August 2004 and has a one year term out provision with a maturity date in August 2005. This line is subject to various affirmative and negative covenants. This CLOC includes $1.5 billion for CP back up and general corporate purposes and $500 million for working capital use, general corporate purposes and CP back up. An additional line of credit of $500 million was put into place for the period of January 26 to February 25, 2004 to back up peak CP issuance. This line is subject to various covenants, substantially similar to the primary CLOC. These CLOCs were undrawn at April 30, 2004. There are no rating contingencies under the CLOCs. The Canadian issuances are supported by a credit facility provided by one bank in an amount not to exceed $125 million (Canadian). The Canadian CLOC is subject to annual renewal in December 2004. This CLOC was undrawn at April 30, 2004. We believe the CP market to be stable. Risks to the stability of our CP market participation would be a short term rating downgrade, adverse changes in our financial performance, non renewal or termination of the CLOCs, adverse publicity and operational risk within the CP market. We believe if any of these events were to occur, the CLOCs, to the extent available, could be used for an orderly exit from the CP market, though at a higher cost to us. Additionally, we could turn to other sources of liquidity, including cash, debt issuance under the existing shelf registration and asset sales or securitizations. 30 Table of Contents Form 10 K H&R BLOCK CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS A summary of our obligations to make future payments as of April 30, 2004 is as follows: (in 000s) Less Than After 5 Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years Years Debt $ 748,200 $ 249,975 $ 498,225 $ $ Long term obligation to government 279,976 186,651 93,325 Acquisition payments 60,768 25,257 34,963 548 Pension obligation assumed 17,511 2,826 5,048 4,176 5,461 Capital lease obligations 12,512 437 1,035 1,132 9,908 Operating leases 597,883 199,292 258,385 91,609 48,597 Total contractual cash obligations $ 1,716,850 $ 477,787 $ 984,307 $ 190,790 $ 63,966 In April 2000, we issued $500 million of 8 1/2% Senior Notes, due 2007. The Senior Notes are not redeemable prior to maturity. The net proceeds of this transaction were used to repay a portion of the short term borrowings that initially funded the acquisition of OLDE Financial Corporation. In October 1997, we issued $250 million of 6 3/4% Senior Notes, due 2004. The Senior Notes are not redeemable prior to maturity. The net proceeds of this transaction were used to repay short term borrowings that initially funded the acquisition of Option One. These Senior Notes are included in the current portion of long term debt on our consolidated balance sheet. We plan to refinance these Senior Notes during fiscal year 2005. Also included in debt are future payments related to Business Services acquisitions and capital lease obligations. Our debt to total capital ratio was 30.3% at April 30, 2004, compared with 34.5% at April 30, 2003. As of April 30, 2004, we had $250 million remaining under our shelf registration available for additional debt issuance. In connection with our acquisition of the non attest assets of M&P in August 1999, we assumed certain pension liabilities related to M&Ps retired partners. We make payments in varying amounts on a monthly basis. Included in other noncurrent liabilities at April 30, 2004 and 2003 are $17.5 million and $19.5 million, respectively, related to this liability. Operating leases, although requiring future cash payments, are not included in our consolidated balance sheets. A summary of our commitments as of April 30, 2004, which may or may not require future payments, expire as follows: (in 000s) Less Than 1 After 5 Total Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years Years Commitments to fund mortgage loans $ 2,605,878 $ 2,605,878 $ $ $ Commitments to sell mortgage loans 4,748,994 4,748,994 Pledged securities 46,340 46,340 Commitment to fund M&P 40,000 40,000 Franchise Equity Lines of Credit 26,990 9,149 5,995 11,846 Mortgage loan repurchase obligations 25,168 25,168 Other commercial commitments 10,255 5,880 3,595 780 Total commercial commitments $ 7,503,625 $ 7,481,409 $ 9,590 $ 12,626 $ See discussion of commitments in Item 8, note 19 to our consolidated financial statements. REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT The United States, various state, local, provincial and foreign governments and some self regulatory organizations have enacted statutes and ordinances, and or adopted rules and regulations, regulating aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, commercial income tax return preparers, income tax courses, the electronic filing of income tax returns, the facilitation of RALs, loan originations and assistance in loan originations, mortgage lending, privacy, consumer protection, franchising, sales methods, brokers, broker dealers and various aspects of securities transactions, financial planners, investment advisors, accountants and the accounting practice. We seek to determine the applicability of such statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations (collectively, Laws) and comply with those Laws. From time to time in the ordinary course of business, we receive inquiries from governmental and self regulatory agencies regarding the applicability of Laws to our products and services. In response to past inquiries, we have agreed to comply with such Laws, convinced the authorities that such Laws were not applicable or that compliance already exists, and or modified our activities in the applicable jurisdiction to avoid the application of all or certain parts of such Laws. We believe that the past resolution of such inquiries and our ongoing compliance with Laws have not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. We cannot predict what effect future Laws, changes in interpretations of existing Laws, or the results of future regulator inquiries with respect to the applicability of Laws may have on our consolidated financial statements. 31 Table of Contents H&R BLOCK Form 10 K NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Item 8, note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK General Interest Rate Risk. We have established investment guidelines to help minimize the market risk exposure of our cash equivalents and available for sale securities. These guidelines focus on managing liquidity, preservation of principal and earnings, which are primarily affected by credit quality and movements in interest rates. Most of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities are managed at the subsidiary level. Our cash equivalents are primarily held for liquidity purposes and are comprised of high quality, short term investments, including qualified money market funds. As of April 30, 2004, our non restricted cash and cash equivalents had an average maturity of less than one month with an average credit quality of AAA. With such a short maturity, our portfolios market value is relatively insensitive to interest rate changes. We use capital primarily to fund working capital requirements, pay dividends, repurchase our shares and acquire businesses. At April 30, 2004, no commercial paper was outstanding. For fiscal year 2004, the average issuance term was 23 days and the average outstanding balance was $279.7 million. As commercial paper borrowings are seasonal, interest rate risk typically increases through our third fiscal quarter and declines to zero by fiscal year end. See Item 7, Financial Condition for additional information. Our current portion of long term debt and long term debt at April 30, 2004 consists primarily of fixed rate Senior Notes; therefore, a change in interest rates would have no impact on consolidated pretax earnings. See Item 8, note 10 to our consolidated financial statements. We have exposure to interest rate risk through our investment in fixed income securities at our captive insurance subsidiary and our broker dealer. See table below for sensitivities to changes in interest rates. Additionally, we have exposure to interest rate risk in the financial instruments associated with Mortgage Operations. Equity Price Risk. We have exposure to the equity markets in several ways. The largest exposures are through our deferred compensation plans, which have mismatches in asset and liability amounts and investment choices (both fixed income and equity), as well as through equity investments at our captive insurance subsidiary. At April 30, 2004, the impact of a 10% market value change in the combined equity assets of the deferred compensation plans and the captive insurance subsidiary would be approximately $8.9 million, assuming no offset for the liabilities. Mortgage Operations Interest Rate Risk, Prime Mortgage Origination Operations. We regularly enter into rate lock commitments with our customers to fund prime mortgage loans within specified periods of time. The fair value of rate lock commitments and loans held for sale is calculated based on the current market pricing of short sales of FNMA, FHLMC and GNMA mortgage backed securities and the coupon rates of the eligible loans. At April 30, 2004, we recorded a liability of $1.7 million related to rate lock commitments. We sell short FNMA, FHLMC and GNMA mortgage backed securities to reduce the risk related to our prime commitments to fund fixed rate loans. The position hedging certain, or all, of the fixed rate mortgage loans is closed approximately 10 15 days prior to standard Public Securities Association (PSA) settlement dates. At April 30, 2004, the Company recorded an asset of $2.1 million related to these instruments. To finance our prime originations, we utilize a warehouse facility with capacity up to $50 million, which bears interest at one month LIBOR plus 64 to 175 basis points. As of April 30, 2004, the balance outstanding under this facility was $4.0 million. Interest Rate Risk, Non prime Mortgage Origination Operations. Interest rate changes will impact the value of the loans in the origination pipeline, beneficial interest in Trusts and the forward loan sale commitments. Additionally, our accretion earned on our beneficial interest in Trusts may be affected. We are exposed to interest rate risk associated with loans in the origination pipeline, consisting of fixed and adjustable rate loans, which will generally be sold, ultimately, through whole loan sales or securitizations. We have binding commitments ($.6 billion) and non binding commitments ($2.0 billion) to fund mortgage loans at April 30, 2004, subject to conditions and loan contract verification. Of these commitments, external market forces impact the probability of the loans being funded and we estimate only $1.3 billion will likely be originated. As a result of whole loan sales to the Trusts, we remove the mortgage loans from our balance sheet and record the gain on sale, cash and a beneficial interest in Trusts, which represents the ultimate expected outcome from the disposition of the loans. See Item 7, Off Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements. At April 30, 2004, there were $3.2 billion of loans held in the Trusts and the value of our beneficial interest in Trusts was $137.8 million. Changes in interest rates and other market factors may result in a change in value of our beneficial interest in Trusts. We use forward loan sale commitments to reduce risk associated with loans in the pipeline and our beneficial interest in Trusts. These commitments, which represent an obligation to sell a non prime loan at a specific price in the future, increase in value as interest rates rise and decrease as rates fall. At April 30, 2004, there were $4.7 billion in forward loan sale commitments, and most of them give us the option to under or over deliver by five to ten percent. Forward loan sale commitments for non prime loans are not considered derivative instruments and are therefore not recorded in our financial statements. Forward loan sale commitments lock in the execution price net gain on sale on the loans which will ultimately be delivered into a whole loan sale. We also have used interest rate swaps to reduce interest rate risk associated with non prime loans in our pipeline prior to ultimate disposition. Interest rate swaps represent an agreement to exchange interest rate payments, whereby we generally receive a floating rate and pay the fixed rate. These contracts increase in value as rates rise and decrease in value as rates fall. There were no swaps outstanding at April 30, 2004. Prime and non prime loans, as well as rate locks associated with prime loans, have interest rate risk if interest rates rise before the loan is sold or hedged and the rate on the loan does not change. With $4.7 billion of forward loan sale commitments (and the option to adjust the commitment amount between $4.5 to $5.0 billion), netting against pipeline loans estimated at $1.3 billion and 32 Table of Contents Form 10 K H&R BLOCK the anticipated sale of $3.2 billion in loans by the Trusts, we believe the net risk position of loan origination operations at year end is relatively neutral to changes in interest rates. Delivery Risk. We have exposure to delivery risk in our non prime origination operations, which regularly enter into forward loan sale commitments prior to loans being originated. Additionally, it is possible that the loans originated will not meet the required characteristics of the forward loan sale commitments. Several remedies are available, however, use of the remedies could reduce the execution price or the effectiveness of the forward loan sale commitment as a hedge vehicle. Residual Interests. Relative to modeled assumptions, an increase or decrease in interest rates would impact the value of our residual interests. Additionally, accretion income related to our residual interests may be affected. Residual interests bear the interest rate risk embedded within the securitization due to an initial fixed rate period on the loans versus a floating rate funding cost, and the on going basis risk between the indices of the floating rate assets and liabilities. We enter into interest rate caps to mitigate interest rate risk associated with residual interests that are classified as trading securities because they will be sold in a subsequent NIM transaction, and to enhance the marketability of the NIM transactions. Interest rate caps represent a right to receive cash if interest rates rise above a contractual strike rate. Therefore, its value increases as interest rates rise. The interest rate used in our interest rate caps is based on LIBOR. There were no interest rate caps outstanding at April 30, 2004. See table below for sensitivities to changes in interest rates for residual interests. See Item 8, note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional analysis of interest rate risk and other financial risks impacting residual interests. It is our policy to utilize economic hedge vehicles only for the purpose of offsetting or reducing the risk of loss in earnings associated with a defined or quantified exposure. Mortgage Servicing Rights. Declining mortgage rates may cause increased refinancing activity. Increased refinancing activity reduces the life of the loans underlying the residual interests and MSRs, thereby reducing their value. Just the opposite occurs in a rising rate environment, however, MSRs are recorded at the lower of cost or market value. Reductions in the value of these assets impact earnings through impairment charges. See Item 8, note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for further sensitivity analysis of the other assumptions. Investment Services Interest Rate Risk. HRBFA holds interest bearing receivables from customers, brokers, dealers and clearing organizations, which consist primarily of amounts due on margin transactions and are generally short term in nature. We fund these short term assets with short term variable rate liabilities from customers, brokers and dealers, including stock loan activity. Although there may be differences in the timing of the re pricing related to these assets and liabilities, we believe we are not significantly exposed to interest rate risk in this area. As a result, any change in interest rates would not materially impact our consolidated earnings. Our fixed income trading portfolio is affected by changes in market rates and prices. The risk is the loss of income arising from adverse changes in the value of the trading portfolio. We value the trading portfolio at quoted market prices and the market value of our trading portfolio at April 30, 2004 was approximately $13.6 million, net of securities sold short. See table below for sensitivities to changes in interest rates. With respect to our fixed income securities portfolio, we manage our market price risk exposure by limiting concentration risk, maintaining minimum credit quality and limiting inventory to anticipated retail demand and current market conditions. International Tax Operations Foreign Exchange Rate Risk. Our cash and operations in international markets are exposed to movements in currency exchange rates. The currencies involved are the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar and the British pound. We translate revenues and expenses related to these operations at the average of exchange rates in effect during the period. As currency exchange rates change, translation of the financial results into U.S. dollars does not presently materially affect, and has not historically materially affected, our consolidated financial results, although such changes do affect the year to year comparability of the operating results of our international businesses. We estimate a 10% change in foreign exchange rates by itself would impact consolidated pretax income in fiscal year 2004 by approximately $1.3 million and cash balances at April 30, 2004 by $6.1 million. The sensitivities of certain financial instruments to changes in interest rates as of April 30, 2004 are as follows: (in 000s) 50 + 50 + 100 + 200 + 300 Fair Value at Basis Basis Basis Basis Basis April 30, 2004 Points Points Points Points Points Residual interests in securitizations available for sale $ 210,973 $ 45,449 $ (18,563 ) $ (32,709 ) $ (46,527 ) $ (48,090 ) Investments at captive insurance subsidiary 44,667 1,079 (1,069 ) (1,591 ) (3,146 ) (4,667 ) Fixed income trading (net) 13,639 677 (637 ) (1,228 ) (2,271 ) (3,164 ) The table above represents hypothetical instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in interest rates and should not be relied on as an indicator of future expected results. 33 Table of Contents H&R BLOCK Form 10 K
