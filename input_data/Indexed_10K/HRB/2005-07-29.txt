ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The accompanying Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations reflects the restatement of previously issued financial statements, as discussed in Item 8, note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. We are a diversified company with subsidiaries delivering tax, investment, mortgage and business services and products. We are the only major company offering a full range of software, online and in office tax preparation solutions, combined with personalized financial advice concerning retirement savings, home ownership and other opportunities to help clients build a better financial future. Our key strategic priorities can be summarized as follows: Tax Services continue expanding our office network, improve our client service and satisfaction scores, focus on 18 Table of Contents H&R BLOCK 2005 Form 10K advice that supports client growth and increased brand loyalty. Mortgage Services continue growing origination volumes while lowering our cost of origination, distinguish our service quality, minimize risk and volatility in performance and optimize value from secondary markets. Business Services continue expansion of our national accounting, tax and consulting business, add extended services to middle market companies and enhance our client service culture. Investment Services work to align the segments cost structure with its revenues, attract and retain productive advisors, serve the broad consumer market through advisory relationships and integrate the Tax Services client base into this segment. OVERVIEW ... A summary of our fiscal year 2005 results is as follows: Revenues grew 4.1% over the prior year, primarily due to our Tax Services and Business Services segments, with this growth somewhat offset by a revenue decline at our Mortgage Services segment. Diluted earnings per share declined 3.8% from fiscal year 2004 to $3.77, primarily due to lower profitability in our Mortgage Services segment. Current year results included a non operating gain of $0.06 per diluted share for legal recoveries. Tax Services fell short of its target client levels, although increases in our pricing and the complexity of returns prepared allowed the segments revenue growth to continue. Segment revenues increased 7.6% over the prior year and segment pretax income increased $25.0 million, or 3.9%. Mortgage Services origination volumes of $31.0 billion were at record levels, but margin compression drove gains on sales of mortgage assets to decline 10.5% to $822.1 million. Business Services revenues and pretax income increased 14.8% and 54.7%, respectively, over the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher demand for traditional accounting, tax and consulting services. Investment Services reported a pretax loss of $75.4 million compared to $75.6 million in the prior year. Operating results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005 showed marked improvement, which we hope will continue into the fiscal year 2006.

We consider the policies discussed below to be critical to securing an understanding of our financial statements, as they require the use of significant judgment and estimation in order to measure, at a specific point in time, matters that are inherently uncertain. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs. For all of these policies, we caution that future events rarely develop precisely as forecasted, and estimates routinely require adjustment and may require material adjustment. REVENUE RECOGNITION ... We have many different revenue sources, each governed by specific revenue recognition policies. Our revenue recognition policies can be found in Item 8, note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. Additional discussion of our recognition of gains on sales of mortgage assets follows. GAINS ON SALES OF MORTGAGE ASSETS ... We sell substantially all of the non prime mortgage loans we originate to the Trusts, which are qualifying special purpose entities (QSPEs), with servicing rights generally retained. Prime mortgage loans are sold in whole loan sales, servicing released, to third party buyers. Gains on sales of mortgage assets are recognized when control of the assets is surrendered (when loans 19 Table of Contents H&R BLOCK 2005 Form 10K are sold to Trusts) and are based on the difference between cash proceeds and the allocated cost of the assets sold. We determine the allocated cost of assets sold based on the relative fair values of cash proceeds, MSRs and the beneficial interest in Trusts, which represents the ultimate expected outcome from the Trusts disposition of the loans. The relative fair value of the MSRs and the beneficial interest in Trust is determined using discounted cash flow models, which require various management assumptions, limited by the ultimate expected outcome from the disposition of the loans by the Trusts (see discussion below in Valuation of Residual Interests and Valuation of Mortgage Servicing Rights). The following is an example of a hypothetical gain on sale calculation: (in 000s) Acquisition cost of underlying mortgage loans $ 1,000,000 Fair values: Net proceeds $ 990,000 Beneficial interest in Trusts 20,000 MSRs 9,000 $ 1,019,000 Computation of gain on sale: Net proceeds $ 990,000 Less allocated cost ($990,000/$1,019,000 $1,000,000) 971,541 Recorded gain on sale $ 18,459 Recorded beneficial interest in Trusts ($20,000/$1,019,000 $1,000,000) $ 19,627 Recorded value of MSRs ($9,000/$1,019,000 $1,000,000) $ 8,832 Variations in the assumptions we use affect the estimated fair values, which would affect the reported gains on sales. Gains on sales of mortgage loans totaled $772.1 million, $915.6 million and $792.1 million for fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. See discussion in Off Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements related to the disposition of the loans by the Trusts and subsequent securitization by the Company. VALUATION OF RESIDUAL INTERESTS ... We use discounted cash flow models to determine the estimated fair values of our residual interests. We develop our assumptions for expected losses, prepayment speeds, discount rates and interest rates based on historical experience and third party market sources. Variations in our assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair values, which may require us to record impairments or unrealized gains. In addition, variations will also affect the amount of residual interest accretion recorded on a monthly basis. Residual interests valued at $205.9 million and $211.0 million were recorded as of April 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We recorded $95.9 million in net write ups in other comprehensive income and $12.2 million in impairments in the income statement related to our residual interests during fiscal year 2005 as actual performance differed from our assumptions. See Item 8, note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for our methodology used in valuing residual interests. See Item 8, note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for current assumptions and a sensitivity analysis of those assumptions. See Item 7A for sensitivity analysis related to interest rates. VALUATION OF MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS ... MSRs are carried at the lower of cost or fair value. We use discounted cash flow models to determine the estimated fair values of our MSRs. Fair values take into account the historical prepayment activity of the related loans and our estimates of the remaining future cash flows to be generated through servicing the underlying mortgage loans. Variations in our assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair values, which may require us to record impairments. Prepayment speeds are somewhat correlated with the movement of market interest rates. As market interest rates decline there is a corresponding increase in actual and expected borrower prepayments as customers refinance existing mortgages under more favorable interest rate terms. This in turn reduces the anticipated cash flows associated with servicing resulting in a reduction, or impairment, to the fair value of the capitalized MSR. Prepayment rates are estimated based on historical experience and third party market sources. Many non prime loans have a prepayment penalty in place for the first two to three years, which has the effect of making prepayment speeds more predictable, regardless of market interest rate movements. If actual prepayment rates prove to be higher than the estimate made by management, impairment of the MSRs could occur. MSRs valued at $166.6 million and $113.8 million were recorded as of April 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. See Item 8, note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for our methodology used in stratifying and valuing MSRs. See Item 8, note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for current assumptions and a sensitivity analysis of those assumptions. VALUATION OF GOODWILL ... Our goodwill impairment analysis is based on a discounted cash flow approach and market comparables, when available. This analysis, at the reporting unit level, requires significant management judgment with respect to revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital, and the selection and application of an appropriate discount rate. Changes in the projections or assumptions could materially affect fair values. The use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted future operating cash flows and could increase or decrease any impairment charge. Our goodwill balance was $1.0 billion as of April 30, 2005 and $993.5 million as of April 30, 2004. No goodwill impairments were identified during fiscal years 2005 or 2004. In fiscal year 2003, a 20 Table of Contents H&R BLOCK 2005 Form 10K goodwill impairment charge of $108.8 million was recorded in the Investment Services segment due to unsettled market conditions. Also during 2003, our annual impairment test resulted in an impairment of $13.5 million for a reporting unit within the Business Services segment. No other impairments were identified. LITIGATION ... Our policy is to routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes related to legal matters, as well as ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of the reserves required, if any, for these contingencies is made after thoughtful analysis of each known issue and an analysis of historical experience in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, and related pronouncements. Therefore, we have recorded reserves related to certain legal matters for which it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the range of such loss can be estimated. With respect to other matters, we have concluded that a loss is only reasonably possible or remote and, therefore, no liability is recorded. STOCK BASED COMPENSATION ... Stock based compensation expense is determined based on the grant date fair value and the number of equity instruments that vest. We use the Black Scholes model to calculate the fair value for stock options and employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) shares using the following assumptions: stock volatility, expected life, risk free interest rate and dividend yield. The fair value of restricted shares is the stock price on the date of the grant. We also estimate, based on historical data, the percent of equity instruments expected to vest. Variations in the assumptions used to calculate fair value could either positively or negatively affect the recorded expense. Variations between actual performance and the estimate of vesting could result in timing adjustments recorded at the end of the vesting period. Additionally, changes in accounting rules related to stock based compensation could result in changes to our assumptions of fair value and expense recognition. We began expensing all stock based compensation awards under the prospective transition method beginning on May 1, 2003. Therefore, our income statements do not fully reflect the expense related to all of our stock options and restricted shares outstanding. We recorded $44.1 million, $25.7 million and $2.1 million in stock based compensation expense during fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. INCOME TAXES ... We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the applicable calendar year. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified. We file a consolidated federal tax return on a calendar year basis, generally in the second fiscal quarter of the subsequent year. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We have considered taxable income in carry back periods, historical and forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which may result in proposed assessments. Our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. We believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters. However, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire. As a result, our effective tax rate may fluctuate on a quarterly basis. As discussed in Item 9A, Controls and Procedures, we reported a material weakness in our internal controls over accounting for income taxes as of April 30, 2005. OTHER SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ... Other significant accounting policies, not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above, are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements. These policies require difficult judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance. Certain of these matters are among topics currently under reexamination by accounting standard setters and regulators. Although no specific conclusions reached by these standard setters appear likely to cause a material change in our accounting policies, outcomes cannot be predicted with confidence. Also see Item 8, note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, which discusses accounting policies we have selected when there are acceptable alternatives. 21 Table of Contents H&R BLOCK 2005 Form 10K RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ... Our business is divided into four reportable segments: Tax Services, Mortgage Services, Business Services and Investment Services. TAX SERVICES This segment primarily consists of our income tax preparation businesses retail, online and software. The previously reported U.S. Tax Operations has been aggregated with the International Tax Operations segment in the Tax Services segment.

Tax Services revenues increased $167.1 million, or 7.6%, compared to the prior year. Fiscal year 2005 was the first year of a multi year strategy to expand our retail distribution network, to increase client growth by providing more convenient access to our services and to react to increased competition in the tax preparation market. In the U.S., we opened a net 1,252 new offices, 609 of which were part of the expansion of our company owned retail distribution network. This expansion contributed incremental revenues of $24.9 million and pretax 22 Table of Contents H&R BLOCK 2005 Form 10K losses of $18.9 million. Clients served in our U.S. company owned offices declined 0.2% from the prior year. Tax preparation and related fees increased $129.4 million, or 8.1%. This increase is primarily due to an 8.1% increase in the average fee per U.S. client served, resulting from increases in our pricing and the complexity of returns prepared. Online service revenues increased $4.6 million, or 10.2%, primarily as a result of a shift in the mix of services to those with higher prices. Increased competition in the online market, including national marketing campaigns and lower pricing by our competitors, coupled with a 46% increase in returns prepared through the FFA, limited our growth in online paid clients. Other service revenues increased $16.0 million, or 12.6%, primarily as a result of additional revenues associated with RACs and Express IRAs. Royalty revenues increased $12.7 million, or 6.9%, primarily due to a 6.3% increase in the average fee per client served at our franchise offices. Revenues earned during the current year in connection with RAL participations increased $14.4 million, or 8.6%, over the prior year. This increase is primarily due to an increase in the dollar amount of loans in which we purchased participation interests, resulting from an increase in the fee charged by the lender, an increase in our clients average refund size and the maximum loan amount allowed by the lender. A total of 3.3 million software units were sold during fiscal year 2005, a decrease of 13.5% compared to the prior year. Software units include TaxCut Federal, TaxCut State, DeductionPro, WillPower and Legal Advisor. The decline in unit sales was due to increased competition, but was offset by pricing increases and a shift to our premium product lines, which resulted in a 1.4% increase in revenues from software sales. Cost of services for fiscal year 2005 increased $110.7 million, or 9.7%, over the prior year. Compensation and benefits increased $54.6 million primarily due to increased revenues and an increase in the number of tax professionals and support staff needed in new office locations. Stock based compensation related to our seasonal associates also increased $4.1 million. Occupancy expenses increased $26.3 million, or 10.3%, as a result of an 11.4% increase in U.S. company owned offices under lease, which also drove increases in depreciation and amortization and supply costs. Of the total increase in occupancy expenses, $10.7 million was due to our real estate expansion. Other cost of services increased $11.4 million primarily due to additional expenses associated with our POM guarantee and Express IRAs. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $35.5 million over the prior year primarily due to increased spending related to an $18.8 million increase in allocations from support departments and additional legal expenses of $10.2 million. Pretax income of $663.5 million for fiscal year 2005 represents a 3.9% increase from the prior year. The segments operating margin declined 100 basis points to 28.1% in fiscal year 2005. FISCAL 2006 OUTLOOK ... In fiscal year 2006, we plan to continue our office expansion initiative by adding between 500 and 700 more offices across our company owned and franchise network. We believe by investing in our office network, we will attract potential clients who are primarily motivated by convenience. Although we expect the additional tax offices to result in incremental clients and revenues during fiscal year 2006, due to the cost of expansion we expect incremental pretax losses from these newly added offices. We expect the performance of offices added during fiscal year 2005 to improve in the upcoming year. We also plan to be more aggressive in our digital tax solutions marketing efforts to better compete in the market. We believe our multi channel strategy not only allows clients to choose how they want to be served, but also allows us to appeal to a different client base than we do through our offices. We expect overall revenue growth in this segment to be less than ten percent in the upcoming year, and we will continue to focus on cost containment to improve the segments operating margin. FISCAL 2004 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2003 ... Tax Services revenues increased $244.4 million, or 12.6%, for fiscal year 2004. Tax preparation and related fees increased $151.6 million, or 10.5%, compared to fiscal year 2003. This increase is due to a 6.7% increase in the average fee per client served in U.S. offices, coupled with a 5.2% increase in clients served. The average fee per client served increased due to increases in our pricing and the complexity of returns prepared. Clients served in company owned offices increased to 10.6 million as a result of the acquisition of businesses in former major franchise territories. Excluding the impact of our acquisitions of former major franchises, clients served declined 2.5%. Online tax preparation revenues increased $19.0 million, or 73.5%, as a result of an increase in the average price and an increase in clients served. Other service revenues for fiscal year 2004 increased $29.8 million, or 30.5%, primarily due to a change in accounting principle relating to our POM guarantee. The average fee per client at our franchise offices increased 8.4%, while clients served declined 15.9%. The decline is due to the former major franchise territories being operated as company owned for the majority of fiscal year 2004. This, coupled with the re franchising of certain former major franchise territories at higher royalty rates, resulted in a 5.9% increase in royalty revenue. 23 Table of Contents H&R BLOCK 2005 Form 10K Revenues earned during fiscal year 2004 in connection with RAL participations totaled $168.4 million. These revenues are approximately $30.1 million higher than waiver fees earned during fiscal year 2003. See discussion of the waiver below. Our RAL participation revenues benefited from the new company owned operations in former major franchise territories. We participate in RALs at a rate of nearly 50% for company owned offices compared to 25% in major franchise offices. This increased participation rate caused our revenues to increase, although the number of RALs declined. During fiscal year 2003, we entered into an agreement with Household, whereby we waived our right to purchase any participation interests in and receive license fees for RALs during the period January 1 through April 30, 2003. In consideration for waiving these rights we received a series of payments from Household in fiscal year 2003, subject to certain adjustments in fiscal year 2004 based on delinquency rates. See discussion in Item 1, RAL Participations and 2003 Tax Season Waiver. A total of 3.8 million software units were sold during fiscal year 2004, an increase of 11.2% compared to 3.4 million units in 2003. Revenues from software sales in fiscal year 2004 increased 11.5% as a result of the higher sales volume. Cost of services for fiscal year 2004 increased $78.2 million, or 7.4%, from 2003. This increase was partially attributable to the operation of former major franchise territories as company owned. Compensation and benefits increased $80.5 million as a result of the former major franchise acquisitions, increased field wages during the later part of the tax season and $13.7 million in expenses for stock options awarded to seasonal tax associates. Occupancy and equipment costs increased $30.5 million due primarily to a 5.7% increase in the average rent and a 3.4% increase in the number of U.S. offices under lease. Depreciation and amortization increased as a result of additional equipment purchased for new office locations opened during the period. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $77.3 million over 2003 due to $33.3 million in bad debt expense associated with RAL participations, which was not incurred in the prior year due to the waiver agreement. Intangible amortization increased $9.0 million from the acquisition of assets of former major franchisees. Marketing costs increased $20.7 million as a result of additional brand advertising campaigns. Allocated information technology costs increased $13.9 million as a result of additional technology projects. These increases were partially offset by a $62.4 million decrease in legal expenses, which is primarily a result of the Texas RAL litigation settlement and other cases in the prior year. See discussion in RAL Litigation below. Pretax income for fiscal year 2004 increased $81.8 million, or 14.7%, over 2003. The segments operating margin improved fifty basis points to 29.1% in fiscal year 2004. Excluding the 2003 RAL litigation reserve, pretax income increased 6.7% and our operating margin declined 160 basis points. RAL LITIGATION ... In fiscal year 2003, we announced a settlement had been reached in the cases Ronnie and Nancy Haese, et al. v. H&R Block, Inc., et al., Case No. CV96 4213, District Court of Kleberg County, Texas (Haese I) and Ronnie and Nancy Haese, et al. v. H&R Block, Inc., et al., Case No. CV 99 314 D, District Court of Kleberg County, Texas (Haese II), filed originally as one action on July 30, 1996. As a result of that settlement, we recorded a liability and pretax expense of $43.5 million during fiscal year 2003. This represented our best estimate of our share of the settlement, plaintiff class legal fees and expenses, tax products and associated mailing expenses. Our share of the settlement is less than the total amount awarded due to amounts recoverable from a co defendant in the case. We have been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits alleging that we engaged in wrongdoing with respect to the RAL program. We believe we have strong defenses to the various RAL Cases and will vigorously defend our position. Nevertheless, the amounts claimed by the plaintiffs are, in some instances, very substantial, and there can be no assurances as to the ultimate outcome of the pending RAL Cases, or as to the impact of the RAL Cases on our financial statements. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings, for additional information. 24 Table of Contents H&R BLOCK 2005 Form 10K MORTGAGE SERVICES This segment is primarily engaged in the origination of non prime mortgage loans through an independent broker network, the origination of non prime and prime mortgage loans through a retail office network, the sale and securitization of mortgage loans and residual interests, and the servicing of non prime loans.

Mortgage Services revenues decreased $77.7 million, or 5.9%, compared to the prior year. Revenues decreased primarily as a result of a decline in gains on sales of mortgage loans. The following table summarizes the key drivers of gains on sales of mortgage loans: (dollars in 000s) Year Ended April 30, 2005 2004 Application process: Total number of applications 335,203 269,267 Number of sales associates (1) 3,526 2,812 Closing ratio (2) 58.3% 57.7% Originations: Total number of originations 195,392 155,339 WAC 7.36% 7.39% Average loan size (all loans) $ 159 $ 150 Total originations $ 31,001,724 $ 23,256,013 Non prime origination ratio 96.7% 94.6% Direct origination and acquisition expenses, net $ 378,674 $ 278,785 Revenue (loan value): Net gain on sale gross margin 2.64% 3.89% (1) Includes all direct sales and back office sales support associates. (2) Percentage of loans funded divided by total applications in the period. Although origination volumes increased 33.3% over the prior year, gains on sales of mortgage loans declined $143.6 million as a result of increased price competition and poorer execution in the secondary market. As a result, our net margin declined to 1.12% from 2.22% in the prior year. The average market interest rate for a 2 year swap increased to 3.32% in fiscal year 2005 from 1.97% in 2004, while our WAC decreased to 7.36% from 7.39% for the same periods. Because our WAC did not increase as quickly as market rates, our gross margin declined 125 basis points from last year. To mitigate the risk of short term changes in market interest rates, we use interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and forward loan sale commitments. During the current year, we recorded $46.9 million in net gains, compared to a net loss of $12.0 million in the prior year, related to derivative instruments. See Item 8, note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. For the year ended April 30, 2004, we reclassified $167.7 million from interest income to gains on sales of mortgage assets representing excess cash received from our beneficial interest in Trusts. The beneficial interest in Trusts is reported at fair value at each balance sheet date. Changes in its fair value are included in current period earnings. The excess cash received together with the and mark to market adjustment for each period have been classified as gain on sale of mortgage loans. This change had no impact on our net income as previously reported. In fiscal year 2005, we completed a sale of residual interests and recorded a gain of $15.4 million. This sale accelerated cash flows from these residual interests, effectively realizing previously recorded unrealized gains included in other 26 Table of Contents H&R BLOCK 2005 Form 10K comprehensive income. We recorded a gain of $40.7 million in the prior year on similar transactions. Impairments of residual interests in securitizations of $12.2 million were recognized during the year compared with $26.1 million in the prior year. The prior year impairments were due primarily to loan performance of older residuals and changes in assumptions to more closely align with the economic and interest rate environment. Total accretion of residual interests decreased $48.9 million from the prior year. This decrease is primarily due to the sale of previously securitized residual interests during fiscal year 2004, which eliminated future accretion on those residual interests. During fiscal year 2005, our residual interests continued to perform better than expected compared to internal valuation models. As a result of this performance, our residuals have produced, or are expected to produce, more cash proceeds than projected in previous valuation models. We recorded favorable pretax mark to market adjustments, which increased the fair value of our residual interests $154.3 million during the year. These adjustments were recorded, net of write downs of $58.3 million and deferred taxes of $36.6 million, in other comprehensive income and will be accreted into income throughout the remaining life of the residual interests. Future changes in interest rates, actual loan pool performance or other assumptions could cause additional favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the fair value of the residual interests and could cause changes to the accretion of these residual interests in future periods. Additionally, sales of residual interests results in decreases to accretion income in future periods. The following table summarizes the key drivers of loan servicing revenues: (dollars in 000s) Year Ended April 30, 2005 2004 Average servicing portfolio: With related MSRs $ 41,021,448 $ 32,039,811 Without related MSRs 13,838,769 6,481,069 $ 54,860,217 $ 38,520,880 Number of loans serviced 435,290 324,364 Average delinquency rate 4.85% 6.04% Weighted average FICO score 610 596 Value of MSRs $ 166,614 $ 113,821 Loan servicing revenues increased $61.3 million, or 29.0%, over the prior year. The increase reflects a higher average loan servicing portfolio. The average servicing portfolio for fiscal year 2005 increased 42.4%. Cost of services increased $28.3 million, or 14.7%, as a result of a higher average servicing portfolio, particularly loans with MSRs, which also resulted in an increase in MSR amortization. Cost of non service revenues increased $36.7 million, or 12.8%, over the prior year. Compensation and benefits increased $28.0 million as a result of a 25.4% increase in the number of employees, reflecting resources needed to support higher loan production volumes. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $49.7 million, or 32.2%, due to $12.1 million in increased retail marketing expenses and $7.4 million in additional consulting expenses. Pretax income decreased $192.4 million, or 27.9%, for fiscal year 2005. FISCAL 2006 OUTLOOK ... We believe we can continue to grow our origination volumes in fiscal year 2006. Lowering our cost of origination will be a key priority for the upcoming year and we have begun to implement new technologies to enhance the underwriting and origination processes. Based upon these assumptions, we expect loan origination growth to exceed 20% at net margins in the range of .90% to 1.15% in fiscal year 2006. Based on these assumptions, we expect loan origination growth of at least 15% at net margins in the range of 1.00% to 1.25% in fiscal year 2006. FISCAL 2004 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2003 ... Mortgage Services revenues increased $173.6 million, or 15.1%, compared to fiscal year 2003. This increase was primarily a result of increased production volumes, higher servicing income and accretion. Gains on sales of mortgage loans increased $123.6 million, or 15.6%, for the year ended April 30, 2004. The increase over the prior year is a result of a significant increase in loan origination volume, an increase in the average loan size and the closing ratio, partially offset by a decrease in our gross margin and increased loan sale repurchase reserves. During 2004, we originated $23.3 billion in mortgage loans compared to $16.6 billion in 2003, an increase of 40.3%. Our gross margin decreased primarily due to lower WACs. The loan sale repurchase reserves, which are netted against gains on sales, increased $25.5 million over 2003. This increase is primarily a result of an increase in loan sales coupled with the increase in whole loan sales compared to securitizations, for which higher reserves are provided at the time of sale for estimated repurchases. As previously discussed, we reclassified $103.3 million from interest income to gains on sales for fiscal year 2003. 27 Table of Contents H&R BLOCK 2005 Form 10K In November 2002, we completed the sale of previously securitized residual interests and recorded a gain of $93.3 million. Two smaller transactions were completed in fiscal year 2004, which resulted in gains of $40.7 million Impairments of residual interests in securitizations of $26.1 million were recognized during 2004 compared with $54.1 million in 2003. The impairments were due primarily to loan performance of older residuals and changes in assumptions to more closely align with the current economic and interest rate environment. Total accretion of residual interests increased $40.1 million over 2003. This improvement is the result of write ups in the related asset values in fiscal years 2003 and 2004. Increases in fair value are realized in income through accretion over the remaining expected life of the residual interest. We recorded favorable pretax mark to market adjustments, which increased the fair value of our residual interests $199.7 million during 2004. These adjustments were recorded, net of write downs of $32.6 million and deferred taxes of $63.8 million, in other comprehensive income. Loan servicing revenues increased $43.4 million, or 25.8%, in fiscal year 2004. The increase reflects a higher average loan servicing portfolio, which was partially offset by the reduction of certain of our ancillary fees previously charged to borrowers. The average servicing portfolio for fiscal year 2004 increased 38.9%. Cost of services increased $51.6 million, or 36.5%, as a result of a higher average servicing portfolio and the acceleration of amortization of certain MSRs. Cost of non service revenues increased $43.8 million, or 18.0%, over the prior year. Compensation and benefits increased $43.6 million as a result of a 22.9% increase in the number of employees, reflecting resources needed to support higher loan production volumes. Occupancy expenses increased due to nine additional branch offices opened since October 2002. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $46.0 million, primarily due to $10.4 million in increased marketing expenses for retail mortgage direct mail advertising, $13.5 million in increased allocated corporate and shared costs and $7.2 million in increased consulting expenses. Allocated costs increased due to higher insurance costs and the expensing of stock based compensation. Pretax income increased $32.2 million, or 4.9%, for fiscal year 2004. 28 Table of Contents H&R BLOCK 2005 Form 10K BUSINESS SERVICES This segment offers middle market companies accounting, tax and consulting services, wealth management, retirement resources, payroll services, corporate finance and financial process outsourcing.

Business Services revenues for fiscal year 2005 increased $74.1 million, or 14.8%, from the prior year. This increase was primarily due to a $58.7 million increase in accounting, tax and consulting revenues resulting from an 11.5% increase in chargeable hours and a 7.3% increase in the net collected rate per hour. The increase in chargeable hours is primarily due to strong demand for our tax and accounting services as well as our consulting and risk management services. This demand stems from the current business environment and the emphasis placed on the accounting industry. Capital markets revenues declined $5.9 million as a result of an 11.2% decrease in the number of business valuation projects. Payroll, benefits and retirement services revenues increased as a result of three acquisitions completed during the last half of the current year. Other service revenues increased $11.8 million due to the acquisition of our financial process outsourcing business in the second quarter of last year, coupled with overall growth in this business. Increases in reimbursable expenses and contractor revenues also contributed to higher revenues. Cost of services increased $62.1 million, or 20.0%, for fiscal year 2005 compared to the prior year. Compensation and benefits related to our services increased $54.3 million, primarily as a result of increases in the number of personnel and the average wage per employee. The increase in the average wage is being driven by marketplace competition for professional staff. Higher expenses are also attributable to investments we are making in early stage businesses within this segment. Pretax income for the year ended April 30, 2005 was $29.9 million compared to $19.3 million in fiscal year 2004. FISCAL 2006 OUTLOOK ... Our focus for fiscal year 2006 is growing the business within our current markets by expanding our services to existing clients. We will continue to support our national business development strategy and we expect the demand for risk management services and financial process outsourcing to continue. We also believe the demand and competition for qualified professional staff will continue. We expect this segments pretax income for fiscal year 2006 to increase by approximately 30%. FISCAL 2004 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2003 ... Business Services revenues for fiscal year 2004 improved $65.1 million, or 15.0%, over the prior year. This increase was primarily due to a $38.2 million increase in capital markets revenue resulting from a 38.3% increase in the number of business valuation projects. Revenues in accounting, tax and consulting increased $15.8 million over the prior year as a result of newly acquired tax businesses and increased productivity. The acquisition of Tax Services former major franchises allowed us to acquire certain tax businesses associated with the original M&P acquisition. We were previously unable to acquire and operate these businesses in direct competition with major franchise territories. The acquired tax businesses contributed $13.0 million in revenues in 2004. The remainder of the increase 29 Table of Contents H&R BLOCK 2005 Form 10K was driven primarily by a 3.3% increase in the net collected rate per hour. Cost of services increased $23.5 million, or 8.2%, over the prior year. Compensation and benefits increased $23.3 million, primarily as a result of increased activity in the capital markets business and increased costs in our accounting, tax and consulting business. A goodwill impairment charge of $13.5 million was recorded in the prior year. No such impairment was recorded in fiscal year 2004. Pretax income for the year ended April 30, 2004 was $19.3 million compared to a loss of $16.0 million in fiscal year 2003.

Investment Services revenues, net of interest expense, for fiscal year 2005 increased $8.0 million, or 3.5%. The increase is primarily due to higher margin interest revenue. Production revenue increased $5.4 million, or 3.4% over the prior year. Transactional revenue, which is based on individual securities transactions, decreased $11.0 million, or 11.1%, from the prior year due primarily to an 18.7% decline in transactional trading volume. This decline was partially offset by an increase in the average revenue per trade. Annuitized revenue, which consists of sales of mutual funds, insurance, fee based products and unit investment trusts, increased $16.4 million, or 27.0%, due to increased sales of annuities, mutual funds and our fee based wealth management accounts. Annuitized revenues represent 30 Table of Contents H&R BLOCK 2005 Form 10K 46.6% of total production revenues for fiscal year 2005, compared to 38.0% in the prior year. Advisor productivity averaged approximately $166,000 in the current year, essentially flat compared to the prior year. Other service revenue declined $6.4 million, or 18.0%, from the prior year due to fewer fixed income underwriting offerings and Express IRA revenues now being recorded as part of Tax Services. Margin interest revenue increased $10.3 million, or 30.8%, from the prior year, which is primarily a result of higher interest rates earned, coupled with a 9.5% increase in average margin balances. Margin balances have increased from an average of $545.0 million in fiscal year 2004 to $597.0 million in the current year. Cost of services increased $3.7 million, or 2.4%, primarily due to $7.6 million of additional compensation and benefits resulting from a higher average commission rate than the prior year and other financial incentives for attracting new advisors. This increase was partially offset by declines in depreciation and other expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $4.1 million, or 2.8%, over the prior year primarily as the result of $6.8 million in additional legal expenses, partially offset by gains of $4.6 million on the disposition of certain assets. The pretax loss for Investment Services for fiscal year 2005 was $75.4 million compared to a loss of $75.6 million last year. FISCAL 2006 OUTLOOK ... We believe the key to this segments profitability in the near term is aligning the segments cost structure with its revenue. Our focus in the upcoming fiscal year will be on reducing costs and attracting productive advisors. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005, we implemented a series of actions, which are not production dependent, to reduce costs and enhance performance. We have also implemented strict advisor production standards. Although we still expect to report an operating loss for fiscal year 2006, we anticipate that loss will be approximately $25 to $35 million less than the loss recorded in 2005. FISCAL 2004 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2003 ... Investment Services revenues, net of interest expense, for fiscal year 2004 increased $32.1 million, or 16.4%, over fiscal year 2003. The improvement is primarily due to the increase in annuitized revenues. Production revenue increased $30.4 million, or 23.4% over fiscal year 2003. Transactional revenue increased $8.0 million, or 8.7%, from 2003 due to an increase in transactional trading activity, partially offset by a slight decline in average revenue per trade. Annuitized revenues increased $22.4 million, or 58.3%, due to increased sales of annuities and mutual funds and an increase in advisor productivity. Productivity averaged approximately $166,000 per advisor in fiscal year 2004 compared to $122,000 in 2003. Margin interest revenue declined $3.9 million, or 10.4%, from 2003 primarily as a result of a 5.5% decline in average margin balances coupled with lower interest rates. Margin balances declined from an average of $577.0 million in fiscal year 2003 to $545.0 million in 2004. Accordingly, interest expense for fiscal year 2004 declined $3.5 million, or 71.9%, from fiscal year 2003. Cost of services increased $15.2 million over 2003 primarily due to a $19.5 million increase in compensation and benefits, resulting from an increase in customer trading and higher average commissions. A goodwill impairment charge of $108.8 million was recorded in fiscal year 2003 due to unsettled market conditions. This charge includes an additional impairment of $84.8 million as a result of the restatement of previously issued financial statements. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $18.1 million primarily as a result of a reduction in consulting and legal expenses. The pretax loss for Investment Services for fiscal year 2004 was $75.6 million compared to a loss of $219.4 million in 2003. 31 Table of Contents H&R BLOCK 2005 Form 10K CORPORATE This segment consists primarily of corporate support departments, which provide services to our operating segments. These support departments consist of marketing, information technology, facilities, human resources, executive, legal, finance, government relations and corporate communications.

Corporate Financial Results (in 000s) Restated Restated Year Ended April 30, 2005 2004 2003 Operating revenues $ 13,592 $ 12,532 $ 6,448 Eliminations (10,444 ) (8,218 ) (7,099 ) Total revenues 3,148 4,314 (651 ) Corporate expenses: Interest expense 72,701 69,300 74,482 Other 51,262 50,476 56,008 123,963 119,776 130,490 Support departments: Marketing 117,303 110,507 88,819 Information technology 107,306 110,569 92,899 Finance 34,498 33,829 30,232 Other 107,562 78,593 65,734 366,669 333,498 277,684 Allocation of support departments (366,742 ) (336,639 ) (280,677 ) Other income, net 24,345 4,582 6,139 Pretax loss $ (96,397 ) $ (107,739 ) $ (122,009 ) FISCAL 2005 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2004 ... Corporate expenses increased $4.2 million primarily due to higher interest expense, resulting from higher interest rates and higher average debt balances. Marketing department expenses increased $6.8 million, or 6.1%, primarily due to additional marketing efforts in the current year. Other support department expenses increased $29.0 million, primarily due to $15.1 million of additional stock based compensation expenses, increases in the cost of employee insurance and supplies. Other income increased $19.8 million primarily as a result of $17.3 million in legal recoveries. The pretax loss was $96.4 million, compared with last years loss of $107.7 million. Our effective income tax rate for fiscal year 2005 decreased to 37.5% compared to 38.5% in fiscal year 2004. The decrease is due to tax benefits realized on net operating loss carryforwards and their related benefits. FISCAL 2004 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2003 ... Corporate revenues increased $5.0 million primarily as a result of operating capital gains of $1.0 million in 2004 compared to a $2.0 million write off of investments at our captive insurance subsidiary and improved results from our small business subsidiary. Corporate expenses declined $10.7 million, or 8.2%, due primarily to lower interest expense. Interest expense declined as a result of lower financing costs and a scheduled debt payment of $45.1 million in August 2003. Marketing department expenses increased $21.7 million, or 24.4%, primarily as a result of marketing initiatives for Tax Services directed toward our brand repositioning and raising consumer awareness of our advice offerings. Information technology department expenses increased $17.7 million, or 19.0%, primarily due to additional resources needed to support additional projects on behalf of the operating segments and other support departments. The pretax loss was $107.7 million, compared with a loss of $122.0 million in fiscal year 2003. Our effective income tax rate for fiscal year 2004 decreased to 38.5% compared to 44.2% in fiscal year 2003, primarily as a result of non deductible goodwill impairment charges recorded in the prior year. FINANCIAL CONDITION ... CAPITAL RESOURCES & LIQUIDITY BY SEGMENT Our sources of capital include cash from operations, issuances of common stock and debt. We use capital primarily to fund working capital requirements, pay dividends, repurchase shares of our common stock and acquire businesses. CASH FROM OPERATIONS ... Operating cash flows totaled $513.8 million, $852.5 million and $689.7 million in fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Operating cash flows in fiscal year 2005 decreased from fiscal year 2004 due to decreased cash flows from both Mortgage Services and Tax Services and increased income tax payments. Tax Services and Mortgage Services contributed $529.0 million and $98.3 million, respectively, to cash from operations in the current year. Income 32 Table of Contents H&R BLOCK 2005 Form 10K tax payments totaled $437.4 million this year, compared to $331.6 million in fiscal year 2004. ISSUANCES OF COMMON STOCK ... We issue shares of our common stock in accordance with our stock based compensation plans out of our treasury shares. Proceeds from the issuance of common stock totaled $136.1 million, $120.0 million and $126.3 million in fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. DEBT ... In August 2004 we filed an additional shelf registration statement with the SEC for up to $1.0 billion in debt securities. On October 26, 2004, we issued $400.0 million of 5.125% Senior Notes under our shelf registration statements. The proceeds from the notes were used to repay our $250.0 million in 63/4% Senior Notes, which were due on November 1, 2004. The remaining proceeds were used for working capital, capital expenditures, repayment of other debt and other general corporate purposes. DIVIDENDS ... We have consistently paid quarterly dividends. Dividends paid totaled $143.0 million, $138.4 million and $125.9 million in fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. SHARE REPURCHASES ... On June 9, 2004, our Board of Directors approved an authorization to repurchase an additional 15 million shares. This authorization is in addition to the authorization of 20 million shares on June 11, 2003. During fiscal year 2005, we repurchased 11.2 million shares pursuant to these authorizations at an aggregate price of $527.5 million or an average price of $46.98 per share. There were 15.0 million shares remaining under the 2004 authorization and 0.1 million shares remaining under the 2003 authorization at the end of fiscal year 2005. We plan to continue to purchase shares on the open market in accordance with the existing authorizations, subject to various factors including the price of the stock, the availability of excess cash, our ability to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility, securities laws restrictions, targeted capital levels and other investment opportunities available. ACQUISITIONS ... From time to time we acquire businesses that are viewed to be a good strategic fit to our organization. Total cash paid for acquisitions was $37.6 million, $280.9 million and $26.4 million during fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Significant acquisitions during fiscal year 2004 were the former major franchise territories we now operate as company owned. Cash paid in fiscal year 2004 related to the acquisition of these territories totaled $243.2 million. RESTRICTED CASH ... We hold certain cash balances that are restricted as to use. Cash and cash equivalents restricted totaled $516.9 million at fiscal year end. Investment Services held $465.0 million of this total segregated in a special reserve account for the exclusive benefit of customers pursuant to Rule 15c3 3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Restricted cash of $28.1 million at April 30, 2005 held by Business Services is related to funds held to pay payroll taxes on behalf of its customers. Restricted cash held by Mortgage Services totaled $23.8 million at April 30, 2005 for outstanding commitments to fund mortgage loans. FISCAL YEAR 2006 OUTLOOK ... We began construction on a new world headquarters facility during fiscal year 2005. Estimated construction costs during fiscal year 2006 of $103.5 million will be financed from operating cash flows. Our Board of Directors approved an increase of the quarterly cash dividend from 22 cents to 25 cents per share, a 13.6% increase, effective with the quarterly dividend payment on October 3, 2005 to shareholders of record on September 12, 2005. A condensed consolidating statement of cash flows by segment for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2005 follows. Generally, interest is not charged on intercompany activities between segments. Detailed consolidated statements of cash flows are located in Item 8. (in 000s) Tax Mortgage Business Investment Consolidated Fiscal Year 2005 Services Services Services Services Corporate H&R Block Cash provided by (used in): Operations $ 528,990 $ 98,303 $ 44,657 $ (32,408 ) $ (125,749 ) $ (513,793 ) Investing (83,534 ) 99,906 (37,816 ) 7,618 (44,584 ) (58,410 ) Financing 3,482 (15,126 ) (23,223 ) (1,686 ) (391,362 ) (427,915 ) Net intercompany (448,912 ) (184,156 ) 13,725 19,965 599,378 Net intercompany activities are excluded from investing and financing activities within the segment cash flows. We believe that by excluding intercompany activities, the cash flows by segment more clearly depicts the cash generated and used by each segment. Had intercompany activities been included, those segments in a net lending situation would have been included in investing activities, and those in a net borrowing situation would have been included in financing activities. TAX SERVICES ... Tax Services has historically been our largest provider of annual operating cash flows. The seasonal 33 Table of Contents H&R BLOCK 2005 Form 10K nature of Tax Services generally results in a large positive operating cash flow in the fourth quarter. Tax Services generated $529.0 million in operating cash flows primarily related to net income, as cash is generally collected from clients at the time services are rendered. Prior year cash requirements for investing activities included $243.2 million paid to acquire former major franchisees. HSBC and its designated bank provide funding of all RALs offered pursuant to a contract that expires in June 2006. If HSBC and its designated bank do not continue to provide funding for RALs, we could seek other RAL lenders to continue offering RALs to our clients or consider alternative funding strategies. We believe that a number of suitable lenders would be available to replace HSBC should the need arise. We also believe that the RAL program is productive for the Company and a useful service for our customers. The RAL program is regularly reviewed both from a business perspective and to ensure compliance with applicable state and federal laws. It is our intention to continue to offer the RAL program in the foreseeable future. Loss of the RAL program could adversely affect our operating results. In addition to the loss of revenues and income directly attributable to the RAL program, the inability to offer RALs could indirectly result in the loss of retail tax clients and associated tax preparation revenues, unless we were able to take mitigating actions. Total revenues related to the RAL program (including revenues from participation interests) were $182.6 million for the year ended April 30, 2005, representing 4.1% of consolidated revenues and contributed $101.3 million to the segments pretax results. Revenues related to the RAL program totaled $174.2 million for the year ended April 30, 2004, representing 4.1% of consolidated revenues. Our international operations are generally self funded. Cash balances are held in Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom independently in local currencies. H&R Block Canada, Inc. (Block Canada) has a commercial paper program for up to $125.0 million (Canadian). At April 30, 2005, there was no commercial paper outstanding. The peak borrowing during fiscal year 2005 was $124.0 million (Canadian). MORTGAGE SERVICES ... This segment primarily generates cash as a result of the sale and securitization of mortgage loans and residual interests and as its residual interests mature. Mortgage Services provided $98.3 million in cash from operating activities primarily due to the sale of mortgage loans. This segment also generated $99.9 million in cash from investing activities primarily related to cash received from the maturity and sales of residual interests. We regularly sell loans as a source of liquidity. Loan sales in fiscal year 2005 were $31.0 billion compared with $23.2 billion in fiscal year 2004. Additionally, Block Financial Corporation (BFC) provides a line of credit of at least $150 million for working capital needs. At the end of fiscal year 2005 there was no outstanding balance on this facility. GAINS ON SALES ... Gains on sales of mortgage assets totaled $822.1 million, which was primarily recorded as operating activities. The percentage of cash proceeds we receive from our capital market transactions is calculated as follows: (in 000s) Restated Restated Year ended April 30, 2005 2004 2003 Cash proceeds: Whole loans sold by the Trusts $ 737,417 $ 741,233 $ 368,305 Residual cash flows from Beneficial interest in Trusts 193,639 167,705 103,294 Loans securitized 69,665 198,226 389,449 Sale of previously securitized residuals 15,396 40,689 93,307 Gain (loss) on derivative instruments 45,298 (2,578 ) (2,056 ) 1,061,415 1,145,275 952,299 Non cash: Retained mortgage servicing rights 137,510 84,274 60,078 Additions (reductions) to balance sheet (1) 15,885 11,490 (10,829 ) 153,395 95,764 49,249 Portion of gain on sale from capital market transactions $ 1,214,810 $ 1,241,039 $ 1,001,548 Other items included in gain on sale: Changes in beneficial interest in Trusts 36,281 37,918 74,987 Impairments to fair value of residual interests (12,235 ) (26,063 ) (54,111 ) Net change in fair value of derivative instruments 1,555 (9,379 ) (2,085 ) Direct origination and acquisition expenses, net (378,674 ) (278,785 ) (182,216 ) Loan sale repurchase reserves (39,662 ) (46,820 ) (21,295 ) Other 387 10,299 (392,735 ) (322,742 ) (174,421 ) Reported gains on sales of mortgage assets $ 822,075 $ 918,297 $ 827,127 % of gain on sale from capital market transactions received as cash (2) 87% 92% 95% (1) Includes residual interests and interest rate caps. (2) Cash proceeds divided by portion of gain on sale related to capital market transactions. 34 Table of Contents H&R BLOCK 2005 Form 10K WAREHOUSE FUNDING ... To finance our prime originations, we use a warehouse facility with capacity up to $25 million. This annual facility bears interest at one month LIBOR plus 140 to 200 basis points. As of April 30, 2005 and 2004, the balance outstanding under this facility was $4.4 million and $4.0 million, respectively, and is included in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other on the consolidated balance sheets. See discussion of our non prime warehouse facilities below in Off Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements. We believe the sources of liquidity available to the Mortgage Services segment are sufficient for its needs. Risks to the stability of these sources include, but are not limited to, adverse changes in the perception of the non prime industry, adverse changes in the regulation of non prime lending, changes in the rating criteria of non prime lending by third party rating agencies and, to a lesser degree, reduction in the availability of third parties that provide credit enhancement. Past performance of the securitizations will also impact the segments future participation in these markets. The off balance sheet warehouse facilities used by the Trusts are subject to annual renewal, each at a different time during the year, and any of the above events could lead to difficulty in renewing the lines. These risks are mitigated by a staggering of the renewal dates related to these warehouse lines and through the use of multiple lending institutions to secure these lines. BUSINESS SERVICES ... Business Services funding requirements are largely related to receivables for completed work and work in process. We provide funding sufficient to cover their working capital needs. Business Services also has future obligations and commitments, which are summarized in the tables below under Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments. This segment generated $44.7 million in operating cash flows primarily related to net income. Additionally, Business Services used $37.8 million in investing activities primarily related to contingent payments on prior acquisitions, and $23.2 million in financing activities as a result of payments on acquisition debt. INVESTMENT SERVICES ... Investment Services, through HRBFA, is subject to regulatory requirements intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker dealers. HRBFA is required to maintain minimum net capital as defined under Rule 15c3 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and complies with the alternative capital requirement, which requires a broker dealer to maintain net capital equal to the greater of $250,000 or 2% of the combined aggregate debit balances arising from customer transactions. The net capital rule also provides that equity capital may not be withdrawn or cash dividends paid if resulting net capital would be less than the greater of 5% of combined aggregate debit items or 120% of the minimum required net capital. At the end of fiscal year 2005, HRBFAs net capital of $121.2 million, which was 19.2% of aggregate debit items, exceeded its minimum required net capital of $12.6 million by $108.6 million. During fiscal year 2005 and 2004, we contributed additional capital of $27.0 million and $32.0 million, respectively, even though HRBFA was in excess of the minimum net capital requirement, and we may continue to do so in the future. In fiscal year 2005, Investment Services used $32.4 million in its operating activities primarily due to operating losses. To manage short term liquidity, BFC provides HRBFA a $300 million unsecured credit facility. At the end of fiscal year 2005 there was no outstanding balance on this facility. HRBFA has letters of credit with a financial institution with a credit limit of $125.0 million. There were no commitments outstanding on these letters of credit at any time during fiscal year 2005 or 2004. Liquidity needs relating to client trading and margin borrowing activities are met primarily through cash balances in client brokerage accounts and working capital. We believe these sources of funds will continue to be the primary sources of liquidity for Investment Services. Stock loans have historically been used as a secondary source of funding and could be used in the future, if warranted. Securities borrowed and securities loaned transactions are generally reported as collateralized financings. These transactions require us to deposit cash and or collateral with the lender. Securities loaned consist of securities owned by customers, which were purchased on margin. When loaning securities, we receive cash collateral approximately equal to the value of the securities loaned. The amount of cash collateral is adjusted, as required, for market fluctuations in the value of the securities loaned. Interest rates paid on the cash collateral fluctuate as short term interest rates change. To satisfy the margin deposit requirement of client option transactions with the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), Investment Services pledges customers margined securities. Pledged securities at the end of fiscal year 2005 totaled $44.6 million, an excess of $7.9 million over the margin requirement. Pledged securities at the end of fiscal year 2004 totaled $46.3 million, an excess of $7.9 million over the margin requirement. We believe the funding sources for Investment Services are stable. Liquidity risk within this segment is primarily limited to maintaining sufficient capital levels to obtain securities lending liquidity to support margin borrowing by customers. 35 Table of Contents H&R BLOCK 2005 Form 10K OFF BALANCE SHEET FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS We are party to various transactions with an off balance sheet component, including loan commitments and QSPEs, or Trusts. We have commitments to fund mortgage loans in our pipeline of $3.9 billion at April 30, 2005, which are subject to conditions and loan contract verification. There is no commitment on the part of the borrower to close on the mortgage loan at this stage of the lending process and external market forces impact the probability of these loan commitments being closed. Therefore, total commitments outstanding do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. If the loan commitments are exercised, they will be funded as described below. Our relationships with the Trusts serve to reduce our capital investment in our non prime mortgage operations. These arrangements are primarily used to sell mortgage loans, but a portion may also be used to sell servicing advances and finance residual interests. Additionally, these arrangements have freed up cash and short term borrowing capacity, improved liquidity and flexibility, and reduced balance sheet risk, while providing stability and access to liquidity in the secondary market for mortgage loans. Substantially all non prime mortgage loans we originate are sold daily to the Trusts. The Trusts purchase the loans from us using five warehouse facilities, arranged by us, totaling $9.0 billion. These facilities are subject to various Option One performance triggers, limits and financial covenants, including tangible net worth and leverage ratios. In addition, these facilities contain cross default features in which a default in one facility would trigger a default under the other facilities as well. These various facilities bear interest at one month LIBOR plus 50 to 400 basis points and expire on various dates during the year. In addition, some of the facilities provide for the payment of minimum usage fees. Subsequent to April 30, 2005, we increased the Trusts warehouse capacity by adding an additional $1.0 billion facility. This facility bears interest at one month LIBOR plus 45 to 345 basis points. When we sell loans to the Trusts, we remove the mortgage loans from our balance sheet and record the gain on the sale, cash and a beneficial interest in Trusts, which represents the ultimate expected outcome from the disposition of the loans. Our beneficial interest in Trusts totaled $215.4 million and $153.8 million at April 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Subsequently, the Trusts, as directed by their third party beneficial interest holders, either sell the loans directly to third party investors or back to us to pool the loans for securitization. The decision to complete a whole loan sale or a securitization is dependent on market conditions. For fiscal year 2005, the final disposition of loans sold to the Trusts was 92% whole loan sales and 8% securitizations. For fiscal year 2004, the final disposition was 76% whole loan sales and 24% securitizations. The current year shift to whole loan sales is due to the more favorable pricing in the whole loan market. Increased whole loan sale transactions result in cash being received earlier. Additionally, whole loan sales do not add residual interests to our balance sheet, and therefore, we do not retain balance sheet risk. If the Trusts sell the mortgage loans in a whole loan sale, we receive cash for our beneficial interest in Trusts. In a securitization transaction, the Trusts transfer the loans and the corresponding right to receive all payments on the loans to our consolidated special purpose entity, after which we transfer our beneficial interest in Trusts and the loans to a securitization trust. The securitization trust meets the definition of a QSPE and is therefore not consolidated. The securitization trust issues bonds, which are supported by the cash flows from the pooled loans, to third party investors. We retain an interest in the loans in the form of a residual interest and, therefore, usually assume the first risk of loss for credit losses in the loan pool. As the cash flows of the underlying loans and market conditions change, the value of our residual interests may also change, resulting in potential write ups or impairment of our residual interests. At the settlement of each securitization, we record cash received and our residual interests. Additionally, we reverse the beneficial interest in Trusts. These residual interests are classified as trading securities. See Item 8, note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for our methodology used in valuing our residual interests. To accelerate the cash flows from our residual interests, we securitize the majority of our residual interests in net interest margin (NIM) transactions. In a NIM transaction, the residual interests are transferred to another QSPE (NIM trust), which then issues bonds to third party investors. The proceeds from the bonds are returned to us as payment for the residual interests. The bonds are secured by the pooled residual interests and are obligations of the NIM trust. We retain a subordinated interest in the NIM trust, and receive cash flows on our residual interest generally after the NIM bonds issued to the third party investors are paid in full. At the settlement of each NIM transaction, we remove the residual interests sold from our consolidated balance sheet and record the cash received and the new residual interest retained. 36 Table of Contents H&R BLOCK 2005 Form 10K These residual interests are classified as available for sale securities. Residual interests retained from NIM securitizations may also be sold in a subsequent securitization or sale transaction. Loans totaling $6.7 billion and $3.2 billion were held by the Trusts as of April 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and were not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. In connection with the sale of mortgage loans, we provide certain representations and warranties allowing the purchaser the option of returning the purchased loans to us under certain conditions. We may recognize losses as a result of the repurchase of loans under these arrangements. We maintain reserves for the repurchase of loans based on historical trends. See Item 8, note 17 to our consolidated financial statements. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) intends to reissue the exposure draft, Qualifying Special Purpose Entities and Isolation of Transferred Assets, an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 140, during the third quarter of calendar year 2005. The purpose of the proposal is to provide more specific guidance on the accounting for transfers of financial assets to a QSPE. Provisions in the first exposure draft, as well as tentative decisions reached by the FASB during its deliberations, may require us to consolidate our current QSPEs (the Trusts) established in our Mortgage Services segment. As of April 30, 2005, the Trusts had both assets and liabilities of $6.7 billion. The provisions of the exposure draft are subject to FASB due process and are subject to change. We will continue to monitor the status of the exposure draft, and consider changes, if any, to current structures as a result of the proposed rules. COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUANCE We participate in the U.S. and Canadian commercial paper (CP) markets to meet daily cash needs and fund mortgage loans. CP is issued by BFC and Block Canada, wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company. The following chart provides the debt ratings for BFC as of April 30, 2005 and 2004: Short term Long term Fitch F1 A Moodys P2 A3 S&P A2 BBB+ The following chart provides the debt ratings for Block Canada as of April 30, 2005 and 2004: Short term Corporate Trend DBRS R 1 (low) A Stable Moodys P2 We use capital primarily to fund working capital requirements, pay dividends, repurchase our shares and acquire businesses. Commercial paper borrowings peaked at $2.1 billion in February 2005 related to funding of our participation interests in RALs. No CP was outstanding at April 30, 2005 or 2004. U.S. CP issuances are supported by unsecured committed lines of credit (CLOCs). During fiscal year 2005, we replaced our single $2.0 billion CLOC with two $1.0 billion CLOCs. The two CLOCs are from a consortium of thirty one banks. The first $1.0 billion CLOC is subject to annual renewal in August 2005, has a one year term out provision with a maturity date in August 2006 and has an annual facility fee of ten basis points per annum. The second $1.0 billion CLOC has a maturity date of August 2009 and has an annual facility fee of twelve basis points per annum. These lines are subject to various affirmative and negative covenants, including a minimum net worth covenant. An additional line of credit of $750.0 million was put into place for the period of January 26 to February 25, 2005 as an alternative to CP issuance during the peak RAL season. This line is subject to various covenants, substantially similar to the primary CLOCs. These CLOCs were undrawn at April 30, 2005. There are no rating contingencies under the CLOCs. The Canadian issuances are supported by a credit facility provided by one bank in an amount not to exceed $125.0 million (Canadian). The Canadian CLOC is subject to annual renewal in December 2005. This CLOC was undrawn at April 30, 2005. We believe the CP market to be stable. Risks to the stability of our CP market participation would be a short term rating downgrade, adverse changes in our financial performance, non renewal or termination of the CLOCs, adverse publicity and operational risk within the CP market. We believe if any of these events were to occur, the CLOCs, to the extent available, could be used for an orderly exit from the CP market, though at a higher cost to us. Additionally, we could turn to other sources of liquidity, including cash, debt issuance under the existing shelf registration and asset sales or securitizations. 37 Table of Contents H&R BLOCK 2005 Form 10K CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS A summary of our obligations to make future payments as of April 30, 2005 is as follows: (in 000s) Less Than After Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years 5 Years Debt $ 897,046 $ 45 $ 498,916 $ 91 $ 397,994 Long term obligation to government 213,360 106,680 106,680 Acquisition payments 38,022 25,159 12,863 Pension obligation assumed 15,929 2,625 4,545 3,698 5,061 Capital lease obligation 13,550 341 730 997 11,482 Operating leases 708,611 229,768 313,264 124,945 40,634 Total contractual cash obligations $ 1,886,518 $ 364,618 $ 936,998 $ 129,731 $ 455,171 In October 2004, we issued $400.0 million of 5.125% Senior Notes, due 2014. The Senior Notes are not redeemable by the bondholders prior to maturity. The net proceeds of this transaction were used to repay the $250.0 million in 63/4% Senior Notes, which were due November 1, 2004. The remaining proceeds were used for working capital, capital expenditures, repayment of other debt and other general corporate purposes. In April 2000, we issued $500.0 million of 81/2% Senior Notes, due 2007. The Senior Notes are not redeemable prior to maturity. The net proceeds of this transaction were used to repay a portion of the short term borrowings that initially funded the acquisition of OLDE. Future payments related to Business Services acquisitions and capital lease obligations are included in long term debt on our consolidated balance sheets. Our debt to total capital ratio was 32.4% at April 30, 2005, compared with 31.1% at April 30, 2004. As of April 30, 2005, we had $850.0 million remaining under our shelf registration available for additional debt issuance. In connection with our acquisition of the non attest assets of M&P in August 1999, we assumed certain pension liabilities related to M&Ps retired partners. We make payments in varying amounts on a monthly basis, which are included in other noncurrent liabilities. Operating leases, although requiring future cash payments, are not included in our consolidated balance sheets. A summary of our commitments as of April 30, 2005, which may or may not require future payments, expire as follows: (in 000s) Less Than After Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years 5 Years Commitments to fund mortgage loans $ 3,931,926 $ 3,931,926 $ $ $ Commitments to sell mortgage loans 8,707,000 8,707,000 Pledged securities 44,609 44,609 Commitment to fund M&P 75,000 75,000 Franchise Equity Lines of Credit 68,949 20,122 20,476 28,351 Mortgage loan repurchase obligations 41,233 41,233 Construction of new building 143,116 103,505 39,611 Other commercial commitments 8,219 5,221 2,500 458 40 Total commercial commitments $ 13,020,052 $ 12,928,616 $ 62,587 $ 28,809 $ 40 See discussion of commitments in Item 8, note 17 to our consolidated financial statements. REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT The U.S., various state, local, provincial and foreign governments and some self regulatory organizations have enacted statutes and ordinances, and or adopted rules and regulations, regulating aspects of our business. These aspects include, but are not limited to, commercial income tax return preparers, income tax courses, the electronic filing of income tax returns, the 38 Table of Contents H&R BLOCK 2005 Form 10K facilitation of RALs, loan originations and assistance in loan originations, mortgage lending, privacy, consumer protection, franchising, sales methods, brokers, broker dealers and various aspects of securities transactions, financial planners, investment advisors, accountants and the accounting practice. We seek to determine the applicability of such statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations (collectively, Laws) and comply with those Laws. From time to time in the ordinary course of business, we receive inquiries from governmental and self regulatory agencies regarding the applicability of Laws to our services and products. In response to past inquiries, we have agreed to comply with such Laws, convinced the authorities that such Laws were not applicable or that compliance already exists, and or modified our activities in the applicable jurisdiction to avoid the application of all or certain parts of such Laws. We believe that the past resolution of such inquiries and our ongoing compliance with Laws have not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. We cannot predict what effect future Laws, changes in interpretations of existing Laws, or the results of future regulator inquiries with respect to the applicability of Laws may have on our consolidated financial statements. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Item 8, note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements. RECONCILIATION OF NON GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION We report our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, we believe certain non GAAP performance measures and ratios used in managing the business may provide additional meaningful comparisons between current year results and prior periods, by excluding certain items that do not represent results from our basic operations. Reconciliations to GAAP financial measures are provided below. These non GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, not as an alternative for, our reported GAAP results.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK GENERAL INTEREST RATE RISK ... We have established a formal investment policy to help minimize the market risk exposure of our cash equivalents and available for sale securities, which are primarily affected by credit quality and movements in interest rates. These guidelines focus on managing liquidity and preserving principal and earnings. Most of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities are managed at the subsidiary level. Our cash equivalents are primarily held for liquidity purposes and are comprised of high quality, short term investments, including qualified money market funds. As of April 30, 2005, our non restricted cash and cash equivalents had an average maturity 39 Table of Contents H&R BLOCK 2005 Form 10K of less than three months with an average credit quality of AAA. With such a short maturity, our portfolios market value is relatively insensitive to interest rate changes. We hold investments in fixed income securities at our captive insurance subsidiary. See the table below for sensitivities to changes in interest rates. See additional discussion of interest rate risk included below in Mortgage Services and Investment Services. At April 30, 2005, no commercial paper was outstanding. For fiscal year 2005, the average issuance term was 29 days and the average outstanding balance was $388.2 million. As commercial paper and bank borrowings are seasonal, interest rate risk typically increases through our third fiscal quarter and declines to zero by fiscal year end. See Item 7, Financial Condition for additional information. Our current portion of long term debt and long term debt at April 30, 2005 consists primarily of fixed rate Senior Notes; therefore, a change in interest rates would have no impact on consolidated pretax earnings. See Item 8, note 10 to our consolidated financial statements. EQUITY PRICE RISK ... We have exposure to the equity markets in several ways. The largest exposures are through our deferred compensation plans and equity investments at our captive insurance subsidiary. Within the deferred compensation plans we have mismatches in asset and liability amounts and investment choices (both fixed income and equity). At April 30, 2005 and 2004, the impact of a 10% market value change in the combined equity assets held by our deferred compensation plans and our captive insurance subsidiary would be approximately $9.3 million and $8.9 million, respectively, assuming no offset for the liabilities. TAX SERVICES FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE RISK ... Our operations in international markets are exposed to movements in currency exchange rates. The currencies involved are the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar and the British pound. We translate revenues and expenses related to these operations at the average of exchange rates in effect during the period. Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing at the end of the year. Translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of other comprehensive income in stockholders equity. Translation of financial results into U.S. dollars does not presently materially affect, and has not historically materially affected, our consolidated financial results, although such changes do affect the year to year comparability of the operating results in U.S. dollars of our international businesses. We estimate a 10% change in foreign exchange rates by itself would impact consolidated pretax income in fiscal years 2005 and 2004 by approximately $1.3 million and cash balances at April 30, 2005 and 2004 by $4.7 million and $6.1 million, respectively. MORTGAGE SERVICES INTEREST RATE RISK PRIME ORIGINATIONS ... We regularly enter into rate lock commitments with our customers to fund prime mortgage loans within specified periods of time. The fair value of rate lock commitments is calculated based on the current market pricing of short sales of FNMA, FHLMC and GNMA mortgage backed securities and the coupon rates of the eligible loans. At April 30, 2005, we recorded an asset of $0.8 million related to rate lock commitments. We sell short FNMA, FHLMC and GNMA mortgage backed securities to reduce the risk related to our prime commitments to fund fixed rate prime loans. The position on certain, or all, of the fixed rate mortgage loans is closed approximately 10 15 days prior to standard Public Securities Association (PSA) settlement dates. At April 30, 2005 we recorded a liability of $0.8 million related to these instruments. To finance our prime originations, we use a warehouse facility with capacity up to $25 million, which bears interest at one month LIBOR plus 140 to 200 basis points. As of April 30, 2005, the balance outstanding under this facility was $4.4 million. INTEREST RATE RISK NON PRIME ORIGINATIONS ... Interest rate changes impact the value of the loans in our origination pipeline, the beneficial interest in Trusts and forward loan sale commitments. We are exposed to interest rate risk associated with loans in our origination pipeline, consisting of fixed and adjustable rate loans, which are generally sold through whole loan sales or securitizations. We have binding and non binding commitments to fund mortgage loans of $0.9 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, at April 30, 2005, subject to conditions and loan contract verification. Of these commitments, we estimate only $2.0 billion will likely be originated. As a result of whole loan sales to the Trusts, we remove the mortgage loans from our balance sheet and record the gain on sale, cash and a beneficial interest in Trusts, which represents the ultimate expected outcome from the disposition of the loans. See Item 7, Off Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements. At April 30, 2005, there were $6.7 billion of loans held in the Trusts and the value of our beneficial interest in Trusts was $215.4 million. Changes in interest rates and other market factors may result in a change in value of our beneficial interest in Trusts. We use forward loan sale commitments to reduce risk associated with loans in the pipeline. These commitments, which represent an obligation to sell a non prime loan at a specific price in the future, increase in value as interest rates rise and decrease as rates fall. At April 30, 2005, there were $8.7 billion in forward 40 Table of Contents H&R BLOCK 2005 Form 10K loan sale commitments, and most of them give us the option to under or over deliver by five to ten percent. Forward loan sale commitments for non prime loans are not considered derivative instruments and are therefore not recorded in our financial statements. Forward loan sale commitments lock in the execution price on the loans that will ultimately be delivered into a whole loan sale. With $8.7 billion of forward loan sale commitments at April 30, 2005 (and the option to adjust the commitment amount to between $7.8 billion and $9.6 billion), net of pipeline loans estimated at $2.0 billion and the anticipated sale of $6.7 billion in loans by the Trusts, we believe changes in interest rates will not have a material impact on the gains or losses we record on our commitments to fund and sell mortgage loans. We use interest rate swaps to reduce interest rate risk associated with non prime loans. We generally enter into interest rate swap arrangements related to existing loan applications with rate lock commitments and, beginning at the end of our second quarter, for rate lock commitments we expect to make in the next 30 days. Interest rate swaps represent an agreement to exchange interest rate payments, effectively converting our fixed financing costs into a floating rate. These contracts increase in value as rates rise and decrease in value as rates fall. At April 30, 2005, we had a liability of $1.3 million on our balance sheet related to interest rate swaps. See table below for sensitivities to changes in interest rates for swaps. DELIVERY RISK ... We have exposure to delivery risk in our non prime origination operations, which regularly enter into forward loan sale commitments prior to loans being originated. It is possible that we will be unable to originate the loans or that the loans originated will not meet the required characteristics of the forward loan sale commitments. Several remedies are available, although use of the remedies could reduce the execution price or the effectiveness of the forward loan sale commitment in reducing interest rate risk. RESIDUAL INTERESTS ... Relative to modeled assumptions, an increase or decrease in interest rates would impact the value of our residual interests and could affect accretion income related to our residual interests. Residual interests bear the interest rate risk embedded within the securitization due to an initial fixed rate period on the loans versus a floating rate funding cost. Residual interests also bear the on going risk that the floating interest rate earned on the mortgage loans is different from the floating interest rate on the bonds sold in the securitization. We enter into interest rate caps to mitigate interest rate risk associated with mortgage loans that will be securitized and residual interests that are classified as trading securities because they will be sold in a subsequent NIM transaction. The caps enhance the marketability of the securitization and NIM transactions. An interest rate cap represents a right to receive cash if interest rates rise above a contractual strike rate, its value therefore increases as interest rates rise. The interest rate used in our interest rate caps is based on LIBOR. At April 30, 2005 we recorded an asset totaling $12.5 million related to interest rate caps. See table below for sensitivities to changes in interest rates for residual interests and caps. See Item 8, note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional analysis of interest rate risk and other financial risks impacting residual interests. It is our policy to use derivative instruments only for the purpose of offsetting or reducing the risk of loss associated with a defined or quantified exposure. MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS ... Declining interest rates may cause increased refinancing activity, which reduces the life of the loans underlying the residual interests and MSRs, thereby reducing their fair value. The fair value of MSRs generally increases in a rising rate environment, although MSRs are recorded at the lower of cost or market value. Reductions in the fair value of these assets impact earnings through impairment charges. See Item 8, note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for further sensitivity analysis of other MSR valuation assumptions. INVESTMENT SERVICES INTEREST RATE RISK ... HRBFA holds interest bearing receivables from customers, brokers, dealers and clearing organizations, which consist primarily of amounts due on margin transactions and are generally short term in nature. We fund these short term assets with short term variable rate liabilities from customers, brokers and dealers, including stock loan activity. Although there may be differences in the timing of the re pricing related to these assets and liabilities, we believe we are not significantly exposed to interest rate risk in this area. As a result, any change in interest rates would not materially impact our consolidated earnings. Our fixed income trading portfolio is affected by changes in market rates and prices. The risk is the loss of income arising from adverse changes in the value of the trading portfolio. We value the trading portfolio at quoted market prices and the market value of our trading portfolio at April 30, 2005 was approximately $6.3 million, net of $4.8 million in securities sold short. See table below for sensitivities to changes in interest rates. With respect to our fixed income securities portfolio, we manage our market price risk exposure by limiting concentration risk, maintaining minimum credit quality and limiting inventory to anticipated retail demand and current market conditions. 41 Table of Contents H&R BLOCK 2005 Form 10K The sensitivities of certain financial instruments to changes in interest rates as of April 30, 2005 and 2004 are presented below. The following table represents hypothetical instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in interest rates and should not be relied on as an indicator of future expected results.
