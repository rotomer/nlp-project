ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS We are a diversified company with subsidiaries delivering tax, investment, mortgage and business services and products. We are the only major company offering a full range of software, online and in office tax preparation solutions, combined with personalized financial advice concerning retirement savings, home ownership and other opportunities to help clients build a better financial future. Our key strategic priorities can be summarized as follows: Tax Services expand access to our services through improved distribution of our digital offerings and expanding our network of retail offices, continue to improve the quality of service we provide to our clients. Mortgage Services sustain market share while focusing on our cost structure to lower our cost of origination, distinguish our service quality, minimize risk and volatility in performance and optimize value from secondary markets. 21 Business Services continue expansion of our national accounting, tax and consulting business, complete the integration of our American Express Tax and Business Services acquisition, build and manage brand awareness, build differentiated and value driven services and improve our client service culture. Investment Services attract and retain productive advisors, serve the broad consumer market through advisory relationships, integrate the Tax Services client base into this segment and work to align the segments cost structure with its revenues. On February 22, 2006, we determined it was appropriate to restate our previously issued consolidated financial statements, including financial statements for the three and six months ended July 31, 2005 and October 31, 2005, respectively, and financial statements for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2005 and 2004 and all related interim periods. We arrived at this conclusion during the course of our closing process for the quarter ended January 31, 2006. All prior year periods presented reflect the impact of the restatement described above. (in 000s, except per share amounts) Consolidated Results of Operations Year ended April 30, 2006 2005 2004 REVENUES Tax Services $ 2,451,806 $ 2,358,293 $ 2,191,177 Mortgage Services 1,247,138 1,246,018 1,323,709 Business Services 877,259 573,316 499,210 Investment Services 287,955 239,244 229,470 Corporate 8,643 3,148 4,314 $ 4,872,801 $ 4,420,019 $ 4,247,880 PRETAX INCOME (LOSS) Tax Services $ 589,766 $ 663,518 $ 638,493 Mortgage Services 321,616 496,093 688,523 Business Services 53,378 29,871 19,312 Investment Services (32,835 ) (75,370 ) (75,614 ) Corporate (104,532 ) (96,397 ) (107,739 ) 827,393 1,017,715 1,162,975 Income taxes 336,985 393,805 462,523 Net income before change in accounting principle 490,408 623,910 700,452 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle (6,359 ) Net income $ 490,408 $ 623,910 $ 694,093 Basic earnings per share $ 1.49 $ 1.88 $ 1.96 Diluted earnings per share 1.47 1.85 1.92 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES We consider the policies discussed below to be critical to securing an understanding of our financial statements, as they require the use of significant judgment and estimation in order to measure, at a specific point in time, matters that are inherently uncertain. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs. For all of these policies, we caution that future events rarely develop precisely as forecasted, and estimates routinely require adjustment and may require material adjustment. REVENUE RECOGNITION We have many different revenue sources, each governed by specific revenue recognition policies. Our revenue recognition policies can be found in Item 8, note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. Additional discussion of our recognition of gains on sales of mortgage assets follows. GAINS ON SALES OF MORTGAGE ASSETS We sell substantially all of the non prime mortgage loans we originate to the Trusts, which are qualifying special purpose entities (QSPEs), with servicing rights generally retained. Prime mortgage loans are sold in loan sales, servicing released, to third party buyers. Gains on sales of mortgage assets are recognized when control of the assets is surrendered (when loans are sold to the Trusts) and are based on the difference between cash proceeds and the allocated cost of the assets sold, including any guarantees or recourse obligations. Other components of gain on sales of mortgage loans include gains or losses on derivatives, loan sale repurchase reserves and direct origination and acquisition expenses. We determine the allocated cost of assets sold based on the relative fair values of cash proceeds, MSRs, any guarantee or recourse liabilities to be recorded at the date of sale and the beneficial interest in Trusts, which represents our residual interest in the ultimate expected outcome from the disposition of the loans by the Trusts. The relative fair value of the MSRs and the beneficial interest in Trust is determined using discounted cash flow models, which require various management assumptions, limited by the ultimate expected outcome from the disposition of the loans by the Trusts (see discussion below in Valuation of Residual Interests and Valuation of Mortgage Servicing Rights). The following is an example of a hypothetical gain on sale calculation: 22 (in 000s) Acquisition cost of underlying mortgage loans $ 1,000,000 Fair values: Net proceeds $ 995,000 Beneficial interest in Trusts 20,000 MSRs 7,000 $ 1,022,000 Computation of gain on sale: Net proceeds $ 995,000 Less allocated cost ($995,000 / $1,022,000 x $1,000,000) 973,581 Recorded gain on sale $ 21,419 Recorded beneficial interest in Trusts ($20,000 / $1,022,000 x $1,000,000) $ 19,570 Recorded value of MSRs ($7,000 / $1,022,000 x $1,000,000) $ 6,849 Variations in the assumptions we use affect the estimated fair values and the reported gains on sales. Gains on sales of mortgage loans totaled $575.4 million, $772.1 million and $915.6 million for fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. See discussion in Off Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements related to the disposition of the loans by the Trusts and subsequent securitization by the Company. VALUATION OF RESIDUAL INTERESTS We use discounted cash flow models to determine the estimated fair values of our residual interests. We develop our assumptions for expected credit losses, prepayment speeds, discount rates and interest rates based on historical experience and third party market sources. Variations in our assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair values, which may require us to record impairments or unrealized gains. In addition, variations will also affect the amount of residual interest accretion recorded on a monthly basis. Available for sale (AFS) residual interests valued at $159.1 million and $205.9 million were recorded as of April 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We recorded $35.3 million in net write ups in other comprehensive income and $34.1 million in impairments in the income statement related to these residual interests during fiscal year 2006 as actual performance differed from our assumptions. See Item 8, note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for our methodology used in valuing residual interests. See Item 8, note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for current assumptions and a sensitivity analysis of those assumptions. See Item 7A for sensitivity analysis related to interest rates. VALUATION OF MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS MSRs are carried at the lower of cost or fair value. We use discounted cash flow models to determine the estimated fair values of our MSRs. Fair values take into account the historical prepayment activity of the related loans and our estimates of the remaining future cash flows to be generated through servicing the underlying mortgage loans. Variations in our assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair values, which may require us to record impairments. Prepayment speeds are somewhat correlated with the movement of market interest rates. As market interest rates decline there is a corresponding increase in actual and expected borrower prepayments as customers refinance existing mortgages under more favorable interest rate terms. This in turn reduces the anticipated cash flows associated with servicing resulting in a potential reduction, or impairment, to the fair value of the capitalized MSR. Prepayment rates are estimated based on historical experience and third party market sources. Many non prime loans have a prepayment penalty in place for the first two to three years, which has the effect of making prepayment speeds more predictable, regardless of market interest rate movements. If actual prepayment rates prove to be higher than the estimate made by management, impairment of the MSRs could occur. MSRs valued at $272.5 million and $166.6 million were recorded as of April 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively. See Item 8, note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for our methodology used in stratifying and valuing MSRs. See Item 8, note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for current assumptions and a sensitivity analysis of those assumptions. VALUATION OF GOODWILL Our goodwill impairment analysis is based on a discounted cash flow approach and market comparables, when available. This analysis, at the reporting unit level, requires significant management judgment with respect to revenue and expense forecasts, anticipated changes in working capital, and the selection and application of an appropriate discount rate. Changes in the projections or assumptions could materially affect fair values. The use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted future operating cash flows and could effect our conclusions regarding the existence or amount of potential impairment. Our goodwill balance was $1.1 billion as of April 30, 2006 and $1.0 billion as of April 30, 2005. No goodwill impairments were identified during fiscal years 2006, 2005 or 2004. LITIGATION Our policy is to routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes related to legal matters, as well as ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of the reserves required, if any, for these contingencies is made after thoughtful analysis of each known issue and an analysis of historical experience in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, and related pronouncements. Therefore, we have recorded reserves related to certain legal matters for which we believe it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the range of such loss can be estimated. With respect to other matters, we have concluded that 23 a loss is only reasonably possible or remote and, therefore, no liability is recorded. INCOME TAXES We calculate our current and deferred tax provision for the fiscal year based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the applicable calendar year. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded in the appropriate periods when identified. We file a consolidated federal tax return on a calendar year basis, generally in the second fiscal quarter of the subsequent year. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We have considered taxable income in carry back periods, historical and forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which may result in proposed assessments. Our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. We believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters. However, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire. As a result, our effective tax rate may fluctuate on a quarterly basis. OTHER SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Other significant accounting policies, not involving the same level of judgment of uncertainty as those discussed above, are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements. These policies may require judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance. Certain of these matters are among topics currently under reexamination by accounting standard setters and regulators. Although specific conclusions reached by these standard setters may cause a material change in our accounting policies, outcomes cannot be predicted with confidence. Also see Item 8, note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, which discusses accounting policies we have selected when there are acceptable alternatives, and new or proposed accounting standards that may affect our financial reporting in the future. 24 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our business is divided into four reportable segments: Tax Services, Mortgage Services, Business Services and Investment Services. TAX SERVICES This segment primarily consists of our income tax preparation businesses retail, online and software. This segment includes our tax operations in the United States, Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom. Tax Services Operating Statistics (in 000s, except average fee) Year Ended April 30, 2006 2005(1) 2004(1) CLIENTS SERVED United States: Company owned operations 10,359 10,608 10,627 Franchise operations 5,373 5,428 5,460 15,732 16,036 16,087 Digital tax solutions (2) 3,721 3,017 3,234 19,453 19,053 19,321 International (3) 2,459 2,333 2,253 21,912 21,386 21,574 GROSS AVERAGE FEE PER CLIENT SERVED (4) Company owned operations $ 169.58 $ 158.19 $ 146.34 Franchise operations 143.52 135.98 127.91 $ 160.68 $ 150.67 $ 140.09 NET AVERAGE FEE PER CLIENT SERVED (5) Company owned operations $ 162.91 $ 153.53 $ 142.51 RALs(6) Company owned operations 2,542 2,667 2,713 Franchise operations 1,487 1,499 1,508 4,029 4,166 4,221 (1) Company owned and franchise data for fiscal years 2005 and 2004 have not been restated for franchise acquisitions. (2) Includes TaxCut federal units sold, online completed and paid federal returns, and state returns and e filings only when no payment was made for a federal return. (3) In the current year, the end of the Canadian tax season was extended from April 30 to May 1, 2006. Clients served in our international operations in fiscal year 2006 includes approximately 41,400 returns in both company owned and franchise offices which were accepted by the client on May 1, 2006. The revenues related to these returns will be recognized in fiscal year 2007. In the prior year, the end of the Canadian tax season was extended to May 2, 2005. Clients served in our international operations in fiscal year 2005 includes approximately 47,500 returns which were accepted by the client on May 1 and 2, 2005. The revenues related to these returns were recognized in fiscal year 2006. (4) Calculated as gross tax preparation and related fees divided by clients served (U.S. only). (5) Calculated as gross tax preparation and related fees, less discounts and coupons, divided by clients served (U.S. only). (6) Data is for tax season (January 1 April 30) only. Tax Services Financial Results (in 000s) Year Ended April 30, 2006 2005 2004 Service revenues: Tax preparation and related fees $ 1,793,325 $ 1,718,867 $ 1,589,439 Other services 204,968 193,163 172,517 1,998,293 1,912,030 1,761,956 Royalties 207,728 197,551 184,882 RAL participation fees 177,852 182,784 168,375 Other 67,933 65,928 75,964 Total revenues 2,451,806 2,358,293 2,191,177 Cost of services: Compensation and benefits 765,868 726,654 672,066 Occupancy 317,030 281,772 255,516 Supplies 52,894 47,703 40,792 Depreciation and amortization 44,846 54,579 48,808 Bad debt 31,927 33,046 27,328 Allocated shared services and other 102,711 103,560 92,137 1,315,276 1,247,314 1,136,647 Provision for RAL litigation 70,200 Other, selling, general and administrative 476,564 447,461 416,037 Total expenses 1,862,040 1,694,775 1,552,684 Pretax income $ 589,766 $ 663,518 $ 638,493 FISCAL 2006 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2005 Tax Services revenues increased $93.5 million, or 4.0%, compared to the prior year. We opened more than 750 new offices, 550 of which were part of the expansion of our company owned retail distribution network. This expansion contributed incremental revenues of $36.4 million and pretax losses of $8.5 million in fiscal year 2006. Tax preparation and related fees from our retail offices increased $74.5 million, or 4.3%, for fiscal year 2006. This increase is primarily due to an increase of 6.1% in the net average fee per U.S. client served, partially offset by a decrease of 2.3% in U.S. clients served in company owned offices. The decrease in clients served was partially due to a number of technology problems that severely hurt the start of our filing season coupled with increased competition due to competitors refund lending products. Our international operations contributed $18.1 million to the increase, resulting from a 5.4% increase in clients served. 25 Revenue from our digital business increased 8.2%, primarily due to a 23.3% increase in clients served, partially offset by planned reductions in unit prices. Royalty revenue increased $10.2 million, or 5.2%, due to a 5.5% increase in the gross average fee slightly offset by a 1.0% decline in clients served in franchise offices. Revenues earned during fiscal year 2006 in connection with RAL participations decreased $4.9 million, or 2.7%, from fiscal year 2005. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in the number of RALs, which resulted from increased competition for clients in the early months of the tax season. Total expenses increased $167.3 million, or 9.9%, primarily due to $70.2 million of legal reserves and related litigation fees recorded in the current year. During the current year we entered into two settlement agreements. The first was a settlement agreement regarding four separate RAL cases covering 22 states. We also entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs in another RAL case. See additional discussion below and in Item 8, note 17 to the consolidated financial statements. Cost of services for the current year increased $68.0 million, or 5.4%, from the prior year. Our real estate expansion efforts have contributed to a total increase of $43.5 million across all cost of services categories. Compensation and benefits increased $39.2 million, or 5.4%, primarily due to an increase in staff needed for our new offices and the addition of costs related to our small business initiatives in the current year. Occupancy expenses increased $35.3 million, or 12.5%, primarily as a result of higher rent expenses, due to a 9.5% increase in company owned offices under lease and a 7.3% increase in the average rent. Depreciation declined $9.7 million, or 17.8%, primarily due to decreased capital expenditures compared to the prior year. Other, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $29.1 million, or 6.5%, primarily due to a $31.5 million increase in corporate shared services, $20.7 million of which was related to our marketing efforts. We also incurred $7.5 million in additional corporate wages and $7.1 million in additional legal costs in the current year. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006, we revised our estimate for the provision for bad debt related to our participation interests in RALs. This change decreased our provision for bad debt $18.0 million during the fourth quarter of the current fiscal year. See additional discussion in Item 8, note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. The pretax income for fiscal year 2006 decreased $73.8 million, or 11.1%, from 2005, primarily due to the impact of the current year RAL litigation. FISCAL 2005 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2004 Tax Services revenues increased $167.1 million, or 7.6%, compared to fiscal year 2004. In the U.S., we opened a net 1,252 new offices, 609 of which were part of the expansion of our company owned retail distribution network. This expansion contributed incremental revenues of $24.9 million and pretax losses of $18.9 million in fiscal year 2005. Tax preparation and related fees increased $129.4 million, or 8.1%. This increase is primarily due to a 7.7% increase in the net average fee per U.S. client served, resulting from increases in our pricing and the complexity of returns prepared. Clients served in our U.S. company owned offices declined 0.2% from fiscal year 2004. Revenue from our digital business increased 7.9%, primarily due to price increases, partially offset by a 6.7% decrease in clients served. Other service revenues increased $20.6 million, or 12.0%, primarily as a result of additional revenues associated with RACs and Express IRAs. Royalty revenues increased $12.7 million, or 6.9%, primarily due to a 6.3% increase in the gross average fee per client served at our franchise offices. Revenues earned during fiscal year 2005 in connection with RAL participations increased $14.4 million, or 8.6%, over fiscal year 2004. This increase is primarily due to an increase in the dollar amount of loans in which we purchased participation interests, resulting from an increase in the fee charged by the lender, an increase in our clients average refund size and the maximum loan amount allowed by the lender. Cost of services for fiscal year 2005 increased $110.7 million, or 9.7%, over the prior year. Compensation and benefits increased $54.6 million primarily due to increased revenues and an increase in the number of tax professionals and support staff needed in new office locations. Stock based compensation related to our seasonal associates also increased $4.1 million. Occupancy expenses increased $26.3 million, or 10.3%, as a result of an 11.4% increase in U.S. company owned offices under lease, which also drove increases in depreciation and amortization and supply costs. Of the total increase in occupancy expenses, $10.7 million was due to our real estate expansion. Other cost of services increased $11.4 million primarily due to additional expenses associated with our POM guarantee and Express IRAs. Other, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $31.4 million over fiscal year 2004 primarily due to increased spending related to an $18.8 million increase in allocations from support departments and additional legal expenses of $10.2 million. 26 Pretax income of $663.5 million for fiscal year 2005 represents a 3.9% increase from the prior year. The segments operating margin declined 100 basis points to 28.1% in fiscal year 2005. RAL LITIGATION On December 21, 2005, we entered into a settlement agreement regarding litigation pertaining to our RAL programs entitled Deadra D. Cummins, et al. v. HR Block, Inc. et al.; Mitchell v. HR Block, Inc. et al.; Green v. HR Block, Inc. et al.; and Becker v. HR Block, Inc. (the Cummins Settlement Agreement). Pursuant to the Settlement Agreements terms, we will contribute a total of up to $62.5 million in cash for purposes of making payments to the settlement class, paying all attorneys fees and costs to class counsel, and covering service awards to the representative plaintiffs. In addition, we will pay costs for providing notice of the settlement to settlement class members. We increased existing reserves related to this matter, resulting in a pretax charge of $50.7 million in fiscal year 2006. On April 19, 2006, we entered into a settlement agreement, subject to final court approval, regarding litigation entitled Lynne A. Carnegie, et al. v. Household International, Inc., HR Block, Inc., et al. (the Carnegie Settlement Agreement). Pursuant to the Carnegie Settlement Agreement, we will contribute a total of $19.5 million in cash for purposes of making payments to the settlement class, paying all attorneys fees and costs to class counsel, incentive payment awards to plaintiff and all notice and administration costs. We recorded a reserve of $19.5 million related to this settlement in the third quarter of fiscal year 2006. We are named as a defendant in one other class action lawsuit and one state attorney general lawsuit alleging that we engaged in wrongdoing with respect to the RAL program. We believe we have strong defenses to the other lawsuits and will vigorously defend our position. Nevertheless, the amounts claimed in these lawsuits are, in some instances, very substantial, and there can be no assurances as to their ultimate outcome, or as to their impact on our financial statements. See additional discussion of RAL Litigation in Item 8, note 17 to the consolidated financial statements and in Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings. 27 MORTGAGE SERVICES This segment is primarily engaged in the origination of non prime mortgage loans through an independent broker network, the origination of non prime and prime mortgage loans through a retail office network, the sale and securitization of mortgage loans and residual interests, and the servicing of non prime loans.

Fiscal year 2006 excludes the impact of a restructuring charge. (2) Defined as gain on sale of mortgage loans (including gain or loss on derivatives, mortgage servicing rights and net of direct origination and acquisition expenses) divided by origination volume. (3) Defined as total premium received divided by total balance of loans delivered to third party investors or securitization vehicles (excluding mortgage servicing rights and the effect of loan origination expenses). FISCAL 2006 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2005 Mortgage Services revenues were essentially flat compared to the prior year, with higher loan servicing revenues and gains on derivatives offset by lower margins on mortgage loans sold and lower accretion. The following table summarizes the key drivers of loan origination volumes and related gains on sales of mortgage loans: 28 (dollars in 000s) Year Ended April 30, 2006 2005 Application process: Total number of applications 369,210 335,203 Number of sales associates (1) 2,814 3,526 Closing ratio (2) 60.3 % 58.3 % Originations: Total number of originations 222,749 195,392 WAC 7.87 % 7.36 % Average loan size (all loans) $ 183 $ 159 Total originations $ 40,779,763 $ 31,001,724 Direct origination and acquisition expenses, net $ 387,911 $ 378,674 Revenue (loan value): Net gain on sale gross margin (3) 1.76 % 2.64 % (1) Includes all direct sales and back office sales support associates. (2) Percentage of loans funded divided by total applications in the period. (3) Defined as gain on sale of mortgage loans (including gain or loss on derivatives, mortgage servicing rights and net of direct origination and acquisition expenses) divided by origination volume. Despite a 31.5% increase in loan origination volume, gains on sales of mortgage loans decreased $196.7 million, primarily as a result of moderating demand by loan buyers and rising two year swap rates. Market interest rates, based on the two year swap, increased from an average of 3.32% last year to 4.63% in the current year. However, our WAC increased only 51 basis points, up to 7.87% from 7.36% in the prior year. Due to competitive market conditions, we were unable to align our WAC with increases in market rates. As such, our loan sale premium declined 135 basis points, to 1.42% from 2.77% last year. In the current year, we also increased our loss reserves $11.6 million above our normal loss accrual, primarily related to repurchase activity related to early payment defaults, which reduced gains on sales of mortgage loans. The mortgage industry has seen an increase in early payment defaults over the past few months, and we have taken steps in reaction to our loss exposure. The initial value of MSRs we recorded in fiscal year 2006 increased to 61 basis points from 44 basis points in the prior year, which resulted in an increase of $113.0 million in gains on sales of mortgage loans. These increases were primarily due to higher origination volumes, average loan size and interest rates, coupled with updated valuation assumptions. During fiscal year 2006 we updated our assumptions used to value our MSRs. The assumptions were updated primarily to reflect lower servicing costs, in particular interest paid to bondholders on monthly loan prepayments, and higher discount rates. These changes in assumptions increased the weighted average value of MSRs recorded during fiscal year 2006 by approximately $37.0 million (9 basis points of total retained MSRs of 61 basis points) over the prior year. To mitigate the risk of short term changes in market interest rates related to our loan originations and beneficial interest in Trusts, we use various derivative financial instruments. During the current year, we recorded a net $141.2 million in gains, compared to $46.9 million in the prior year, related to our interest rate swaps and other derivative instruments. This increase was primarily due to rising short term interest rates and an increase in the average notional amount of swap arrangements to $8.4 billion in the current year, compared to $2.4 billion in fiscal year 2005. See Item 8, note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. In fiscal year 2006, we completed sales of available for sale residual interests and recorded a gain of $31.5 million. These sales accelerated cash flows from these residual interests, effectively realizing previously recorded unrealized gains included in other comprehensive income. We recorded a gain of $15.4 million in the prior year on a similar transaction. During fiscal year 2006, our available for sale residual interests performed better than expected in our internal valuation models, with lower credit losses than originally modeled, partially offset by higher than expected interest rates. We recorded favorable pretax mark to market adjustments, which increased the fair value of these residual interests $53.3 million during the year. These adjustments were recorded, net of write downs of $18.0 million and deferred taxes of $13.5 million, in other comprehensive income and will be accreted into income throughout the remaining life of the residual interests. Offsetting this increase were impairments of $34.1 million, which were recorded in gains on sales of mortgage assets. Future changes in interest rates or other assumptions, based on market conditions or actual loan pool performance, could cause additional adjustments to the fair value of these residual interests and could cause changes to the accretion of these residual interests in future periods. 29 The following table summarizes the key metrics related to our loan servicing business: (dollars in 000s) Year Ended April 30, 2006 2005 Average servicing portfolio: With related MSRs $ 56,521,595 $ 41,021,448 Without related MSRs 19,106,863 13,838,769 $ 75,628,458 $ 54,860,217 Ending servicing portfolio: With related MSRs $ 62,910,568 $ 47,543,982 Without related MSRs 10,471,509 20,450,482 $ 73,382,077 $ 67,994,464 Number of loans serviced 441,981 435,290 Average delinquency rate 5.16 % 4.85 % Weighted average FICO score 621 618 Weighted average interest rate (WAC) of portfolio 7.58 % 7.46 % Weighted average rate earned 0.38 % 0.36 % Carrying value of MSRs $ 272,472 $ 166,614 Loan servicing revenues increased $125.9 million, or 46.1%, compared to the prior year. The increase reflects a higher loan servicing portfolio resulting from our loan origination growth. The average servicing portfolio for the year increased $20.8 billion, or 37.9%, to $75.6 billion, even with lower volumes in our sub servicing business. The weighted average rate earned on our entire servicing portfolio was 38 basis points for fiscal year 2006, compared to 36 basis points in the prior year. Total expenses for the current year increased $175.6 million, or 23.4%, from the prior year. Cost of services increased $75.6 million, or 34.2%, mainly as a result of a higher average servicing portfolio during the current year and increased amortization of MSRs. Cost of other revenues increased $88.3 million over fiscal year 2005, and includes a $12.6 million restructuring charge associated with the closing of some of our branch offices. See additional discussion of the restructuring charge in Item 8, note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. Compensation and benefits increased $53.8 million primarily due to an increase in the average number of sales associates during the year to support higher loan volumes and the resulting increase in origination based incentives, coupled with $6.7 million in severance charges recorded as part of the restructuring. Occupancy expenses increased $7.8 million primarily due to $5.9 million in lease termination costs recorded as part of the restructuring. Other expenses increased $26.7 million primarily as a result of $20.1 million in additional interest expense related to mortgage loans held on our balance sheet and $5.0 million of additional depreciation and amortization of our newly implemented origination and servicing software. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $11.7 million primarily due to $15.3 million in additional marketing expenses, $5.1 million in additional occupancy costs and $3.2 million in higher allocated shared services. These increases were partially offset by a $15.7 million decline in compensation and benefits resulting from reductions in administrative and corporate headcount and lower bonus accruals. Pretax income decreased $174.5 million, or 35.2%, for fiscal year 2006. FISCAL 2005 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2004 Mortgage Services revenues decreased $77.7 million, or 5.9%, compared to fiscal year 2004. Revenues decreased primarily as a result of a decline in gains on sales of mortgage loans. Although origination volumes increased 33.3% over fiscal year 2004, gains on sales of mortgage loans declined $143.6 million as a result of increased price competition and poorer execution in the secondary market. As a result, our net margin declined to 1.12% from 2.22% in fiscal year 2004. The average market interest rate for a 2 year swap increased to 3.32% in fiscal year 2005 from 1.97% in 2004, while our WAC decreased to 7.36% from 7.39% for the same periods. Because our WAC did not increase as quickly as market rates, our gross margin declined 125 basis points from fiscal year 2004. During fiscal year 2005, we recorded $46.9 million in net gains, compared to a net loss of $12.0 million in 2004, related to derivative instruments. In fiscal year 2005, we completed a sale of available for sale residual interests and recorded a gain of $15.4 million. We recorded a gain of $40.7 million in the prior year on similar transactions. Impairments of available for sale residual interests in securitizations of $12.2 million were recognized during fiscal year 2005 compared with $26.1 million in the prior year. The impairments in fiscal year 2004 were due primarily to loan performance of older residuals and changes in assumptions to more closely align with the economic and interest rate environment. Total accretion of residual interests decreased $48.9 million from fiscal year 2004. This decrease is primarily due to the sale of previously securitized residual interests during fiscal year 2004, which eliminated future accretion on those residual interests. During fiscal year 2005, our available for sale residual interests continued to perform better than expected compared 30 to internal valuation models. We recorded favorable pretax mark to market adjustments, which increased the fair value of these residual interests $154.3 million during fiscal year 2005. These adjustments were recorded, net of write downs of $58.3 million and deferred taxes of $36.6 million, in other comprehensive income and will be accreted into income throughout the remaining life of these residual interests. Loan servicing revenues increased $61.3 million, or 29.0%, over fiscal year 2004. The increase reflects a higher average loan servicing portfolio. The average servicing portfolio for fiscal year 2005 increased 42.4%. Cost of services increased $27.8 million, or 14.4%, as a result of a higher average servicing portfolio, particularly loans with MSRs, which also resulted in an increase in MSR amortization. Cost of other revenues increased $66.2 million, or 22.8%, over fiscal year 2004. Compensation and benefits increased $33.8 million as a result of a 25.4% increase in the number of employees, reflecting resources needed to support higher loan production volumes. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $20.8 million, or 13.7%, due to $12.1 million in increased retail marketing expenses and $7.4 million in additional consulting expenses. Pretax income for fiscal year 2005 decreased $192.4 million, or 27.9%, from fiscal year 2004. BUSINESS SERVICES This segment offers middle market companies accounting, tax and business consulting services, wealth management, retirement resources, payroll services, corporate finance and financial process outsourcing.

This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of American Express Tax and Business Services, Inc., which increased accounting, tax and consulting revenues $251.3 million. The remaining $27.1 million increase in tax, accounting and consulting revenues was primarily driven by increases in the net billed rate per hour and chargeable hours. Capital markets revenues declined $8.4 million due to a 36.0% decline in the number of business valuation projects. Payroll, benefits and retirement services revenues increased $9.3 million primarily due to acquisitions completed during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2005. Other service revenues increased $21.3 million as a result of acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005 in our financial process outsourcing business and growth in wealth management services. Total expenses increased $280.4 million, or 51.6%, for fiscal year 2006 compared to the prior year. Cost of services increased $221.6 million, primarily due to a $160.7 million increase in compensation and benefits. Compensation and benefits increased $136.0 million due to the American Express Tax and Business Services, Inc. acquisition. In addition, baseline increases in the number of personnel and the average wage per employee, driven by marketplace competition for professional staff, also contributed to the increase. Occupancy expenses increased $32.2 million and other cost of services increased $28.7 million primarily due to acquisitions. 31 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $58.9 million primarily due to acquisitions and additional costs associated with our business development initiatives. Pretax income for the year ended April 30, 2006 was $53.4 million, compared to pretax income of $29.9 million in the prior year. FISCAL 2005 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2004 Business Services revenues for fiscal year 2005 increased $74.1 million, or 14.8%, from the prior year. This increase was primarily due to a $58.7 million increase in accounting, tax and consulting revenues resulting from an 11.5% increase in chargeable hours and a 7.3% increase in the net billed rate per hour. The increase in chargeable hours is primarily due to strong demand for our tax and accounting services as well as our consulting and risk management services. This demand stems from the current business environment and the emphasis placed on the accounting industry. Capital markets revenues declined $5.9 million as a result of an 11.2% decrease in the number of business valuation projects. Payroll, benefits and retirement services revenues increased as a result of three acquisitions completed during the last half of fiscal year 2005. Other service revenues increased $11.8 million due to the acquisition of our financial process outsourcing business in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004, coupled with overall growth in this business. Increases in reimbursable expenses and contractor revenues also contributed to higher revenues. Cost of services increased $62.1 million, or 20.0%, for fiscal year 2005 compared to the prior year. Compensation and benefits related to our services increased $54.3 million, primarily as a result of increases in the number of personnel and the average wage per employee. The increase in the average wage is being driven by marketplace competition for professional staff. Higher expenses are also attributable to investments we are making in early stage businesses within this segment. Pretax income for the year ended April 30, 2005 was $29.9 million compared to $19.3 million in fiscal year 2004. INVESTMENT SERVICES This segment is primarily engaged in offering advice based brokerage services and investment planning. Our integration of investment advice and new service offerings are allowing us to shift our emphasis from a transaction based client relationship to a more advice based focus.

Total production revenue increased $24.6 million, or 14.8%, over the prior year. Transactional revenue, which is based on sales of individual securities, increased $2.6 million, or 3.0%, from the prior year due primarily to a 6.1% increase in transactional trading volume, partially offset by a 2.4% decrease in average revenue per transactional trade. Annuitized revenue, which is based on sales of various fee based products, increased $21.9 million, or 28.4%, due to increased sales of annuities and insurance, wealth management accounts, mutual funds, and unit investment trusts (UITs). The shift in revenues from transactional to annuitized demonstrates our continued move toward an advice based focus. Annualized productivity averaged approximately $194,000 per advisor during the current year compared to $166,000 in the prior year. Increased productivity was due to higher production levels across all recruiting classes. Minimum production standards put into place during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005 resulted in 111 advisors increasing their production. These standards also resulted in 152 low producing advisors leaving the company. We expect average advisor productivity to continue increasing as we enforce minimum production standards, provide additional training to advisors and increase productivity levels of newly recruited advisors. Margin interest revenue increased $17.1 million, or 39.1%, from the prior year, as a result of higher interest rates earned, partially offset by a decline in average margin balances. Total expenses increased $2.6 million, or 0.8%. Cost of services increased $19.2 million, or 12.1%, primarily as a result of $18.7 million of additional compensation and benefits expenses resulting from higher production revenues. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $16.5 million, or 10.8%, primarily due to a $4.8 million decline in legal expenses, due in part to a favorable arbitration outcome. Current year results also improved due to reduced back office headcount relating to cost containment efforts and gains on the disposition of certain assets during the year. These decreases were partially offset by increased bonus accruals associated with the segments improved performance. The pretax loss for Investment Services for the year ended April 30, 2006 was $32.8 million compared to the prior year loss of $75.4 million. FISCAL 2005 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2004 Investment Services revenues, net of interest expense, for fiscal year 2005 increased $8.0 million, or 3.5%. The increase is primarily due to higher margin interest revenue. Production revenue increased $5.4 million, or 3.4% over fiscal year 2004. Transactional revenue decreased $11.0 million, or 11.1%, from the prior year due primarily to an 18.7% decline in transactional trading volume. This decline was partially offset by an increase in the average revenue per trade. Annuitized revenue increased $16.4 million, or 27.0%, due to increased sales of annuities, mutual funds and our fee based wealth management accounts. Annuitized revenues represent 46.6% of total production revenues for fiscal year 2005, compared to 38.0% in the prior year. Advisor productivity averaged approximately $166,000 in fiscal year 2005, essentially flat compared to the prior year. Other service revenue declined $6.4 million, or 18.0%, from fiscal year 2004 due to fewer fixed income underwriting offerings and Express IRA revenues now being recorded as part of Tax Services. Margin interest revenue increased $10.3 million, or 30.8%, from fiscal year 2004, which is primarily a result of higher interest rates earned, coupled with a 9.5% increase in average margin balances. Margin balances have increased from an average of $545.0 million in fiscal year 2004 to $597.0 million in fiscal year 2005. Cost of services increased $3.7 million, or 2.4%, primarily due to $7.6 million of additional compensation and benefits resulting from a higher average commission rate than fiscal year 2004 and other financial incentives for attracting new advisors. This increase was partially offset by declines in depreciation and other expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $4.1 million, or 2.8%, over fiscal year 2004 primarily as the result of $6.8 million in additional legal expenses, partially offset by gains of $4.6 million on the disposition of certain assets. The pretax loss for Investment Services for fiscal year 2005 was $75.4 million compared to a loss of $75.6 million in the prior year. 33 CORPORATE Corporate support departments, which provide services to our operating segments consist of marketing, information technology, facilities, human resources, executive, legal, finance, government relations and corporate communications. Support department costs are generally allocated to our operating segments. Financial results for our captive insurance, franchise financing and banking subsidiaries are also included below, as was our small business initiatives subsidiary in fiscal year 2004. Corporate Financial Results (in 000s) Year Ended April 30, 2006 2005 2004 Operating revenues $ 22,279 $ 13,592 $ 12,532 Eliminations (13,636 ) (10,444 ) (8,218 ) Total revenues 8,643 3,148 4,314 Corporate expenses: Interest expense 67,630 72,701 69,300 Other 65,484 51,262 50,476 133,114 123,963 119,776 Support departments: Marketing 137,065 117,303 110,507 Information technology 116,990 107,306 110,569 Finance 49,719 34,498 33,829 Other 122,232 107,562 78,593 426,006 366,669 333,498 Allocation of shared services (425,589 ) (366,742 ) (336,639 ) Other income, net 20,356 24,345 4,582 Pretax loss $ (104,532 ) $ (96,397 ) $ (107,739 ) FISCAL 2006 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2005 Corporate expenses increased $9.2 million primarily due to a $14.2 million increase in other expenses, offset by a $5.1 million decline in interest expense. Other expenses increased due to higher finance and information technology department expenses. Our consolidated interest expense, both operating and non operating, totaled $103.8 million for fiscal year 2006, an increase of $15.9 million over the prior year. Of the $103.8 million in total interest, $49.1 million related to debt incurred on previous acquisitions, with the remaining $54.7 million related to our operations recorded directly in our operating segments. Marketing department expenses increased $19.8 million, or 16.8%, due primarily to an increase in digital advertising efforts. Information technology department expenses increased $9.7 million primarily due to higher compensation and benefits associated with higher headcount. Finance department expenses increased $15.2 million, primarily due to additional consulting expenses and increases in compensation expenses. Other support department expenses increased $14.7 million primarily due to increases in stock based compensation expenses and legal department expenses, partially offset by a decrease in supply department expenses. Other income declined $4.0 million primarily as a result of $17.3 million in legal recoveries we received during the prior year, partially offset by other gains recorded in the current year. The pretax loss was $104.5 million, compared with last years loss of $96.4 million. Our effective tax rate for the year increased to 40.7% compared to 38.7% in the prior year. This increase is due to higher deferred tax valuation allowances and increases in reserves for uncertain tax positions. FISCAL 2005 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2004 Corporate expenses increased $4.2 million primarily due to higher interest expense, resulting from higher interest rates and higher average debt balances. Marketing department expenses increased $6.8 million, or 6.1%, primarily due to additional marketing efforts in fiscal year 2005. Other support department expenses increased $29.0 million, primarily due to $15.1 million of additional stock based compensation expenses, increases in the cost of employee insurance and supplies. Other income increased $19.8 million primarily as a result of $17.3 million in legal recoveries. The pretax loss was $96.4 million, compared with a loss of $107.7 million in fiscal year 2004. Our effective income tax rate for fiscal year 2005 decreased to 38.7% compared to 39.8% in fiscal year 2004. The decrease is due to tax benefits realized on net operating loss carryforwards. 34 FINANCIAL CONDITION CAPITAL RESOURCES LIQUIDITY BY SEGMENT Our sources of capital include cash from operations, issuances of common stock and debt. We use capital primarily to fund working capital, pay dividends, repurchase shares of our common stock and acquire businesses. CASH FROM OPERATIONS Operating cash flows totaled $585.7 million, $513.8 million and $852.5 million in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Operating cash flows in fiscal year 2006 increased from fiscal year 2005 primarily due to lower income tax payments, which totaled $270.5 million this year, compared to $437.4 million in fiscal year 2005, partially offset by higher MSR balances and increased mortgage loans held for sale. ISSUANCES OF COMMON STOCK We issue shares of our common stock in accordance with our stock based compensation plans out of our treasury shares. Proceeds from the issuance of common stock totaled $108.5 million, $136.1 million and $120.0 million in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. DEBT On October 26, 2004, we issued $400.0 million of 5.125% Senior Notes under our shelf registration statements. The proceeds from the notes were used to repay our $250.0 million in 63/4% Senior Notes, which were due on November 1, 2004. The remaining proceeds were used for working capital, capital expenditures, repayment of other debt and other general corporate purposes. DIVIDENDS We have consistently paid quarterly dividends. Dividends paid totaled $160.0 million, $143.0 million and $138.4 million in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. SHARE REPURCHASES On June 9, 2004, our Board of Directors approved an authorization to repurchase 15 million shares. This authorization is in addition to the authorization of 20 million shares on June 11, 2003. During fiscal year 2006, we repurchased 9.0 million shares pursuant to these authorizations at an aggregate price of $254.2 million or an average price of $28.18 per share. There were 10.5 million shares remaining under the 2004 authorization at the end of fiscal year 2006. We plan to continue to purchase shares on the open market in accordance with the existing authorizations, subject to various factors including the price of the stock, our ability to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility, securities laws restrictions, targeted capital levels and other investment opportunities available. ACQUISITIONS From time to time we acquire businesses that are viewed to be a good strategic fit to our organization. Total cash paid for acquisitions was $212.5 million, $37.6 million and $280.9 million during fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Acquisitions during fiscal year 2006 included American Express Tax and Business Services, Inc. Cash paid in fiscal year 2006 related to the acquisition of this business totaled $190.7 million. Significant acquisitions during fiscal year 2004 were the former major franchise territories we now operate as company owned. Cash paid in fiscal year 2004 related to the acquisition of these territories totaled $243.2 million. RESTRICTED CASH We hold certain cash balances that are restricted as to use. Cash and cash equivalents restricted totaled $394.1 million at fiscal year end. Investment Services held $369.0 million of this total segregated in a special reserve account for the exclusive benefit of customers pursuant to Rule 15c3 3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Restricted cash of $16.4 million at April 30, 2006 held by Business Services is related to funds held to pay payroll and related taxes on behalf of its customers. Restricted cash held by Mortgage Services totaled $8.4 million at April 30, 2006 for outstanding commitments to fund mortgage loans. FISCAL YEAR 2007 OUTLOOK We began construction on a new corporate headquarters facility during fiscal year 2005. Estimated remaining construction costs to be incurred during fiscal year 2007 of $63.9 million will be financed from operating cash flows. Our Board of Directors approved an increase of the quarterly cash dividend from 12.5 cents to 13.5 cents per share, an 8.0% increase, effective with the quarterly dividend payment on October 2, 2006 to shareholders of record on September 11, 2006. On June 7, 2006, our Board also approved an additional authorization to repurchase 20.0 million shares. We plan to refinance our $500.0 million in Senior Notes, which are due in April 2007. The initial capital contribution for the HR Block Bank will be $160.0 million, which we transferred on May 1, 2006, with an additional $10.0 million capital contribution planned during fiscal year 2007. HR Block Bank is required to maintain a minimum leverage capital to total asset ratio of 12% during its first three years of operations. 35 A condensed consolidating statement of cash flows by segment for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2006 follows. Generally, interest is not charged on intercompany activities between segments. Detailed consolidated statements of cash flows are located in Item 8. (in 000s) Mortgage Business Investment Consolidated Tax Services Services Services Services Corporate HR Block FISCAL YEAR 2006 Cash provided by (used in): Operations $ 596,025 $ (123,903 ) $ 31,258 $ 24,894 $ 57,412 $ 585,686 Investing (62,797 ) (309,302 ) (221,122 ) 12,615 (107,899 ) (688,505 ) Financing 14,173 (23,611 ) 14,538 (308,136 ) (303,036 ) Net intercompany (527,564 ) 422,418 233,744 (13,470 ) (115,128 ) Net intercompany activities are excluded from investing and financing activities within the segment cash flows. We believe that by excluding intercompany activities, the cash flows by segment more clearly depicts the cash generated and used by each segment. Had intercompany activities been included, those segments in a net lending situation would have been included in investing activities, and those in a net borrowing situation would have been included in financing activities. TAX SERVICES Tax Services has historically been our largest provider of annual operating cash flows. The seasonal nature of Tax Services generally results in a large positive operating cash flow in the fourth quarter. Tax Services generated $596.0 million in operating cash flows primarily related to net income, as cash is generally collected from clients at the time services are rendered. We also received a signing bonus from HSBC during the current year in connection with our new RAL participation agreement, which was recorded as deferred revenue at April 30, 2006. Since July 1996, we have been a party to agreements with HSBC and its predecessors to participate in RALs provided by a lending bank to HR Block tax clients. During fiscal year 2006, we signed a new agreement with HSBC under which HSBC and its designated bank will provide funding of all RALs offered through June 2011. If HSBC and its designated bank do not continue to provide funding for RALs, we could seek other RAL lenders to continue offering RALs to our clients or consider alternative funding strategies. We believe that a number of suitable lenders would be available to replace HSBC should the need arise. We also believe that the RAL program is productive for the Company and a useful service for our customers. The RAL program is regularly reviewed both from a business perspective and to ensure compliance with applicable state and federal laws. It is our intention to continue to offer the RAL program in the foreseeable future. Loss of the RAL program could adversely affect our operating results. In addition to the loss of revenues and income directly attributable to the RAL program, the inability to offer RALs could indirectly result in the loss of retail tax clients and associated tax preparation revenues, unless we were able to take mitigating actions. Total revenues related to the RAL program (including revenues from participation interests) were $179.3 million for the year ended April 30, 2006, representing 3.7% of consolidated revenues and contributed $106.5 million to the segments pretax results. Revenues related to the RAL program totaled $182.6 million for the year ended April 30, 2005, representing 4.1% of consolidated revenues and contributed $101.3 million to the segments pretax results. Our international operations are generally self funded. Cash balances are held in Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom independently in local currencies. HR Block Canada, Inc. (Block Canada) has a commercial paper program for up to $225.0 million (Canadian). At April 30, 2006, there was no commercial paper outstanding. The peak borrowing during fiscal year 2006 was $133.0 million (Canadian). MORTGAGE SERVICES This segment primarily generates cash as a result of the sale and securitization of mortgage loans and residual interests and as its residual interests mature. Mortgage Services used $123.9 million in cash from operating activities primarily due to higher MSR balances and mortgage loans held for sale. This segment also used $309.3 million in cash from investing activities primarily related to loans originated for transfer to the HR Block Bank, partially offset by cash received from the maturity and sales of available for sale residual interests. We regularly sell loans as a source of liquidity. Loan sales in fiscal year 2006 were $40.3 billion compared with $31.0 billion in fiscal year 2005. Additionally, Block Financial Corporation (BFC) provides a line of credit of at least $150 million for working capital needs. At the end of fiscal year 2006 there was $372.6 million outstanding on this facility. WAREHOUSE FUNDING. See discussion of our non prime warehouse facilities below in Off Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements. 36 To finance our prime mortgage loan originations, we use a warehouse facility with capacity up to $25 million. This annual facility bears interest at one month LIBOR plus 140 to 200 basis points. As of April 30, 2006 and 2005, the balance outstanding under this facility was $1.6 million and $4.4 million, respectively, and is included in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. We believe the sources of liquidity available to the Mortgage Services segment are sufficient for its needs. Risks to the stability of these sources include, but are not limited to, adverse changes in the perception of the non prime industry, adverse changes in the regulation of non prime lending, changes in the rating criteria of non prime lending by third party rating agencies and, to a lesser degree, reduction in the availability of third parties who provide credit enhancement. Past performance of the securitizations will also impact the segments future participation in these markets. The off balance sheet warehouse facilities used by the Trusts are subject to annual renewal, each at a different time during the year, and any of the above events could lead to difficulty in renewing the lines. These risks are mitigated by a staggering of the renewal dates related to these warehouse lines and through the use of multiple lending institutions to secure these lines. BUSINESS SERVICES Business Services funding requirements are largely related to receivables for completed work and work in process. We provide funding in the normal course of business sufficient to cover these working capital needs. Business Services also has future obligations and commitments, which are summarized in the tables below under Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments. This segment generated $31.3 million in operating cash flows primarily related to net income. Additionally, Business Services used $221.1 million in investing activities primarily related to the acquisition of American Express Tax and Business Services, Inc. and contingent payments on prior acquisitions, and $23.6 million in financing activities as a result of payments on acquisition debt. INVESTMENT SERVICES Investment Services, through HRBFA, is subject to regulatory requirements intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker dealers. HRBFA is required to maintain minimum net capital as defined under Rule 15c3 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and complies with the alternative capital requirement, which requires a broker dealer to maintain net capital equal to the greater of $1,000,000 or 2% of the combined aggregate debit balances arising from customer transactions. The net capital rule also provides that equity capital may not be withdrawn or cash dividends paid if resulting net capital would be less than the greater of 5% of combined aggregate debit items or 120% of the minimum required net capital. At the end of fiscal year 2006, HRBFAs net capital of $121.7 million, which was 22.9% of aggregate debit items, exceeded its minimum required net capital of $10.6 million by $111.1 million. During fiscal year 2006, HR Block Financial Corporation, HRBFAs direct corporate parent, contributed $5.0 million of additional capital to HRBFA. During fiscal year 2005, we contributed additional capital of $27.0 million. HRBFA was in excess of the minimum net capital requirement during fiscal years 2006 and 2005, but we may continue to contribute additional capital in the future. In fiscal year 2006, Investment Services provided $24.9 million from its operating activities primarily due to improved performance. To manage short term liquidity, BFC provides HRBFA a $300 million unsecured credit facility. At the end of fiscal year 2006 there was no outstanding balance on this facility. HRBFA has a secured letter of credit with an unaffiliated financial institution with a credit limit of $50.0 million. There were no borrowings on this letter of credit during fiscal years 2006 or 2005 and no outstanding balance at April 30, 2006 or 2005. Liquidity needs relating to client trading and margin borrowing activities are met primarily through cash balances in client brokerage accounts and working capital. We believe these sources of funds will continue to be the primary sources of liquidity for Investment Services. Stock loans have historically been used as a secondary source of funding and could be used in the future, if warranted. Securities borrowed and securities loaned transactions are generally reported as collateralized financings. These transactions require us to deposit cash and or collateral with the counterparty. Securities loaned consist of customers securities purchased on margin. We receive cash collateral approximately equal to the value of the securities loaned. The amount of cash collateral is adjusted, as required, for market fluctuations in the value of the securities loaned. Interest rates paid on the cash collateral fluctuate as short term interest rates change. To satisfy the margin deposit requirement of client option transactions with the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), HRBFA pledges customers margined securities. Pledged securities at the end of fiscal year 2006 totaled $53.0 million, an excess of $9.9 million over the margin requirement. Pledged securities at the end of fiscal year 2005 totaled $44.6 million, an excess of $7.9 million over the margin requirement. We believe the funding sources for Investment Services are stable. Liquidity risk within this segment is primarily limited to maintaining sufficient capital levels to obtain securities lending liquidity to support margin borrowing by customers. 37 OFF BALANCE SHEET FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS We are party to various transactions with an off balance sheet component, including loan commitments and QSPEs, or Trusts. We have commitments to fund mortgage loans of $4.0 billion and $4.2 billion at April 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which are subject to conditions and loan contract verification. There is no commitment on the part of the borrower to close on the mortgage loan at this stage of the lending process and external market forces impact the probability of these loan commitments being closed. Therefore, total commitments outstanding do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. If the loan commitments are exercised, they will be funded as described below. Our relationships with the Trusts serve to reduce our capital investment in our non prime mortgage operations. These arrangements are primarily used to sell mortgage loans, but a portion may also be used to sell servicing advances and finance residual interests. Additionally, these arrangements have freed up cash and short term borrowing capacity, improved liquidity and flexibility, and reduced balance sheet risk, while providing stability and access to liquidity in the secondary market for mortgage loans. Substantially all non prime mortgage loans we originate are sold daily to the Trusts. The Trusts purchase the loans from us using nine committed warehouse facilities, arranged by us, totaling $14.5 billion. These facilities are subject to various Option One performance triggers, limits and financial covenants, including tangible net worth and leverage ratios and may be subject to margin calls. In addition, these facilities contain cross default features in which a default in one facility would trigger a default under the other facilities as well. These various facilities bear interest at one month LIBOR plus 50 to 400 basis points and expire on various dates during the year. In addition, some of the facilities provide for the payment of minimum usage fees. Additional uncommitted facilities of $1.5 billion bring total capacity to $16.0 billion. When we sell loans to the Trusts, we remove the mortgage loans from our balance sheet and record the gain on the sale, cash, MSRs, recourse reserves and a beneficial interest in Trusts, which represents our residual interest in the ultimate expected outcome from the disposition of the loans by the Trusts. Our beneficial interest in Trusts totaled $188.0 million and $215.4 million at April 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Subsequently, the Trusts, in response to the exercise of a put option by the third party beneficial interest holders, either sell the loans directly to third party investors or back to us to pool the loans for securitization. The decision to complete a loan sale or a securitization is dependent on market conditions. For fiscal year 2006, the final disposition of loans sold by the Trusts was 77% loan sales and 23% securitizations. For fiscal year 2005, the final disposition of loans sold by the Trusts was 92% loan sales and 8% securitizations. The higher percentage of loan sale transactions versus securitizations is due to more favorable pricing in the loan sale market and also results in cash being received earlier. Additionally, loan sales do not add residual interests to our balance sheet, and therefore, we do not retain balance sheet risk. If the Trusts sell the mortgage loans in a loan sale, we receive cash for our beneficial interest in Trusts. In a securitization transaction, the Trusts transfer the loans and the corresponding right to receive all payments on the loans to our consolidated special purpose entity, after which we transfer our beneficial interest in Trusts and the loans to a securitization trust. The securitization trust meets the definition of a QSPE and is therefore not consolidated. The securitization trust issues bonds, which are supported by the cash flows from the pooled loans, to third party investors. We retain an interest in the loans in the form of a trading residual interest and, therefore, usually assume the first risk of loss for credit losses in the loan pool. As the cash flows of the underlying loans and market conditions change, the value of our trading residual interests may also change, resulting in potential write ups or impairment of these residual interests. At the settlement of each securitization, we record cash received and our residual interests. Additionally, we reverse the beneficial interest in Trusts. The resulting residual interests are classified as trading securities. See Item 8, note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for our methodology used in valuing our residual interests. To accelerate the cash receipts from our residual interests, we securitize the majority of our trading residual interests in net interest margin (NIM) transactions. In a NIM transaction, the trading residual interests are transferred to another QSPE (NIM trust), which then issues bonds to third party investors. The proceeds from the bonds are returned to us as payment for the trading residual interests. The bonds are secured by these pooled residual interests and are obligations of the NIM trust. We retain a subordinated interest in the NIM trust, and receive cash flows on our residual interest generally after the NIM bonds issued to the third party investors are paid in full. At the settlement of each NIM transaction, we remove the trading residual interests sold from our consolidated balance sheet and record the cash received and the new residual interest 38 retained. These new residual interests are classified as available for sale securities. Available for sale residual interests retained from NIM securitizations may also be sold in a subsequent securitization or sale transaction. In connection with the sale of mortgage loans, we provide certain representations and warranties allowing the purchaser the option of returning the purchased loans to us under certain conditions. We may recognize losses as a result of the repurchase of loans under these arrangements. We maintain reserves for the repurchase of loans based on historical trends. See Item 8, note 16 to our consolidated financial statements. Loans totaling $7.8 billion and $6.7 billion were held by the Trusts as of April 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and were not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. In August 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an exposure draft which amends Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. This exposure draft seeks to clarify the derecognition requirements for financial assets and the initial measurement of interests related to transferred financial assets that are held by a transferor. Our current off balance sheet warehouse facilities (the Trusts) in our Mortgage Services segment would be required to be consolidated in our financial statements based on the provisions of the exposure draft. We will continue to monitor the status of the exposure draft. The final standard for this exposure draft is scheduled to be issued in the first quarter of calendar year 2007. COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUANCE We participate in the U.S. and Canadian commercial paper (CP) markets to meet daily cash needs. CP is issued by BFC and Block Canada, wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company. The following chart provides the debt ratings for BFC as of April 30, 2006: Short term Long term Outlook Fitch F1 A Negative Moodys P2 A3 Stable SP A2 BBB Stable DBRS R 1 (low) A Stable The following chart provides the debt ratings for Block Canada as of April 30, 2006: Short term Long term Outlook DBRS R 1 (low) A Stable We use capital primarily to fund working capital requirements, pay dividends, repurchase our shares and acquire businesses. Commercial paper borrowings peaked at $2.3 billion in February 2006 related to funding of our participation interests in RALs. No CP was outstanding at April 30, 2006 or 2005. U.S. CP issuances are supported by $2.0 billion in unsecured committed lines of credit (CLOCs), which mature in August 2010 and have an annual facility fee of eight and one half basis points per annum. These lines are subject to various affirmative and negative covenants, including a minimum net worth covenant. We obtained an additional $900.0 million line of credit for the period of January 3 to February 24, 2006 to back up peak commercial paper issuance or use as an alternate source of funding for RAL participations. This line is subject to various covenants, substantially similar to the primary CLOCs. These facilities were undrawn at April 30, 2006. There are no rating contingencies under the CLOCs. The Canadian issuances are supported by a credit facility provided by one bank in an amount not to exceed $225.0 million (Canadian). The Canadian CLOC is subject to annual renewal in December 2006. This CLOC was undrawn at April 30, 2006. We believe the CP market to be stable. Risks to the stability of our CP market participation would be a short term rating downgrade, adverse changes in our financial performance, non renewal or termination of the CLOCs, adverse publicity and operational risk within the CP market. We believe if any of these events were to occur, the CLOCs, to the extent available, could be used for an orderly exit from the CP market, though at a higher cost to us. Additionally, we could turn to other sources of liquidity, including cash, debt issuance and asset sales or securitizations. 39 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS A summary of our obligations to make future payments as of April 30, 2006 is as follows: (in 000s) Total Less Than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Debt $ 897,426 $ 499,425 $ $ $ 398,001 Long term obligation to government 183,937 107,849 74,692 1,396 Retirement obligation assumed 14,264 2,426 4,176 3,196 4,466 Acquisition payments 13,895 7,210 6,458 91 136 Capital lease obligation 13,209 357 860 1,043 10,949 Operating leases 856,816 269,890 371,984 157,123 57,819 Total contractual cash obligations $ 1,979,547 $ 887,157 $ 458,170 $ 162,849 $ 471,371 In October 2004, we issued $400.0 million of 5.125% Senior Notes, due 2014. The Senior Notes are not redeemable by the bondholders prior to maturity. The net proceeds of this transaction were used to repay the $250.0 million in 63/4% Senior Notes, which were due November 1, 2004. The remaining proceeds were used for working capital, capital expenditures, repayment of other debt and other general corporate purposes. In April 2000, we issued $500.0 million of 81/2% Senior Notes, due 2007. The Senior Notes are not redeemable prior to maturity. The net proceeds of this transaction were used to repay a portion of the short term borrowings that initially funded the acquisition of OLDE Financial Corporation. We plan to refinance these Senior Notes when they come due. As of April 30, 2006, we had $850.0 million remaining under our shelf registration for additional debt issuances. As a result of our failure to file our Form 10 Q for the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2006 by the SECs prescribed due date, we will be unable to issue any debt securities under this shelf registration statement until April 2007. Future payments related to acquisitions and capital lease obligations are included in long term debt on our consolidated balance sheets. In connection with our acquisition of the non attest assets of MP in August 1999, we assumed certain retirement liabilities related to MPs partners. We make payments in varying amounts on a monthly basis, which are included in other noncurrent liabilities. Operating leases, although requiring future cash payments, are not included in our consolidated balance sheets. A summary of our commitments as of April 30, 2006, which may or may not require future payments, expire as follows: (in 000s) Total Less Than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Commitments to fund mortgage loans $ 4,032,045 $ 4,032,045 $ $ $ Commitments to sell mortgage loans 3,052,688 3,052,688 Franchise Equity Lines of Credit 75,909 18,860 29,958 27,091 Commitment to fund MP 75,000 75,000 Construction of new building 63,887 63,887 Pledged securities 53,026 53,026 Other commercial commitments 31,282 8,209 19,888 3,185 Total commercial commitments $ 7,383,837 $ 7,303,715 $ 49,846 $ 30,276 $ See discussion of commitments in Item 8, note 16 to our consolidated financial statements. REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT The U.S., various state, local, provincial and foreign governments and some self regulatory organizations have enacted statutes and ordinances, and or adopted rules and regulations, regulating aspects of our business. These aspects include, but are not limited to, commercial income tax return preparers, income tax courses, the electronic filing of income tax returns, the facilitation of RALs, loan originations and assistance in loan originations, mortgage lending, privacy, consumer protection, franchising, sales methods, brokers, broker dealers and various aspects of securities transactions, financial planners, investment advisors, accountants and the accounting practice. We seek to determine the applicability of such statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations (collectively, Laws) and comply with those Laws. From time to time in the ordinary course of business, we receive inquiries from governmental and self regulatory agencies regarding the applicability of Laws to our services and products. 40 In response to past inquiries, we have agreed to comply with such Laws, convinced the authorities that such Laws were not applicable or that compliance already exists, and or modified our activities in the applicable jurisdiction to avoid the application of all or certain parts of such Laws. We believe that the past resolution of such inquiries and our ongoing compliance with Laws have not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. We cannot predict what effect future Laws, changes in interpretations of existing Laws, or the results of future regulator inquiries with respect to the applicability of Laws may have on our consolidated financial statements. See additional discussion of legal matters in Item 3, Legal Proceedings and Item 8, note 17 to our consolidated financial statements. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Item 8, note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements. RECONCILIATION OF NON GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION We report our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, we believe certain non GAAP performance measures and ratios used in managing the business may provide additional meaningful comparisons between current year results and prior periods, by excluding certain items that do not represent results from our basic operations. Reconciliations to GAAP financial measures are provided below. These non GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, not as an alternative for, our reported GAAP results.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK GENERAL INTEREST RATE RISK We have a formal investment policy to help minimize the market risk exposure of our cash equivalents and available for sale securities, which are primarily affected by credit quality and movements in interest rates. These guidelines focus on managing liquidity and preserving principal and earnings. Most of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities are managed at the subsidiary level. Our cash equivalents are primarily held for liquidity purposes and are comprised of high quality, short term investments, including qualified money market funds. As of April 30, 2006, our non restricted cash and cash equivalents had an average maturity of less than three months with an average credit quality of AAA. With such a short maturity, our portfolios market value is relatively insensitive to interest rate changes. We hold investments in fixed income securities at our captive insurance subsidiary. See the table below for sensitivities to changes in interest rates. See additional discussion of interest rate risk included below in Mortgage Services and Investment Services. At April 30, 2006, no commercial paper was outstanding. For fiscal year 2006, the average issuance term was 33 days and the average outstanding balance was $558.4 million. As commercial paper and bank borrowings are seasonal, interest rate risk typically increases through our third fiscal quarter and declines to zero by fiscal year end. See Item 7, Financial Condition for additional information. Our current portion of long term debt and long term debt at April 30, 2006 consists primarily of fixed rate Senior Notes; therefore, a change in interest rates would have no impact on consolidated pretax earnings. See Item 8, note 9 to our consolidated financial statements. EQUITY PRICE RISK We have exposure to the equity markets in several ways. The largest exposure, though relatively small, is through our deferred compensation plans. Within the deferred compensation plans we have mismatches in asset and liability amounts and investment choices (both fixed income and equity). At April 30, 2006 and 2005, the impact of a 10% market value change in the combined equity assets held by our deferred compensation plans and other equity investments would be approximately $11.6 million and $9.3 million, respectively, assuming no offset for the liabilities. 41 TAX SERVICES FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE RISK Our operations in international markets are exposed to movements in currency exchange rates. The currencies involved are the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar and the British pound. We translate revenues and expenses related to these operations at the average of exchange rates in effect during the period. Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing at the end of the year. Translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of other comprehensive income in stockholders equity. Translation of financial results into U.S. dollars does not presently materially affect, and has not historically materially affected, our consolidated financial results, although such changes do affect the year to year comparability of the operating results in U.S. dollars of our international businesses. We estimate a 10% change in foreign exchange rates by itself would impact consolidated pretax income in fiscal years 2006 and 2005 by approximately $2.1 million and $1.3 million, respectively, and cash balances at April 30, 2006 and 2005 by $6.1 million and $4.7 million, respectively. MORTGAGE SERVICES INTEREST RATE RISK NON PRIME ORIGINATIONS Interest rate changes impact the value of the loans underlying our beneficial interest in Trusts, on our balance sheet or in our origination pipeline, as well as residual interests in securitizations and MSRs. As a result of loan sales to the Trusts, we remove the mortgage loans from our balance sheet and record the gain on sale, cash, MSRs, recourse reserves and a beneficial interest in Trusts, which represents our residual interest in the ultimate expected outcome from the disposition of the loans by the Trusts. See Item 7, Off Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements. At April 30, 2006, there were $7.8 billion of loans held in the Trusts and the value of our beneficial interest in Trusts was $188.0 million. At April 30, 2006, we had $236.4 million of mortgage loans held for sale and $407.5 million of mortgage loans held for investment on our balance sheet. Changes in interest rates and other market factors may result in a change in value of our beneficial interest in Trusts, mortgage loans held for sale and mortgage loans held for investment. We are exposed to interest rate risk associated with commitments to fund approved loan applications of $4.0 billion, subject to conditions and loan contract verification. In addition, we have interest rate risk related to $1.0 billion in new loan applications which have not yet been approved, and $3.0 billion of applications which we expect to receive prior to our next anticipated change in rates charged to borrowers. Of these amounts, we estimate only $5.1 billion will likely be originated. We use forward loan sale commitments, interest rate swaps and put options on Eurodollar futures to reduce our interest rate risk associated with non prime loans. Forward loan sale commitments represent an obligation to sell a non prime loan at a specific price in the future and increase in value as rates rise and decrease as rates fall. At April 30, 2006, there were $3.1 billion in forward loan sale commitments, and most of them give us the option to under or over deliver by five to ten percent. Forward loan sale commitments lock in the execution price on the loans that will be ultimately delivered into a loan sale. At April 30, 2006, we recorded an asset of $2.0 million reflecting the fair value of these instruments. Interest rate swaps represent an agreement to exchange interest rate payments, whereby we pay a fixed rate and receive a floating rate. Put options on Eurodollar futures represent the right to sell a Eurodollar futures contract at a specified price in the future. These swap and put option contracts increase in value as rates rise and decrease in value as rates fall. At April 30, 2006, the interest rate swaps and put options provided interest risk coverage of $9.9 billion. At April 30, 2006, we had assets recorded at fair values of $8.8 million and $3.3 million on our balance sheet related to interest rate swaps and put options, respectively. See table below for sensitivities to changes in interest rates. INTEREST RATE RISK PRIME ORIGINATIONS At April 30, 2006, we had commitments to fund prime mortgage loans totaling $83.2 million. We regularly enter into rate lock commitments with our customers to fund prime mortgage loans within specified periods of time. The fair value of rate lock commitments is calculated based on the current market pricing of short sales of FNMA, FHLMC and GNMA mortgage backed securities and the coupon rates of the eligible loans. At April 30, 2006, we recorded a liability at a fair value of $0.3 million related to rate lock commitments. We sell short FNMA, FHLMC and GNMA mortgage backed securities to reduce the risk related to our prime commitments to fund fixed rate prime loans. The position on certain, or all, of the fixed rate mortgage loans is closed approximately 10 15 days prior to standard Public Securities Association (PSA) settlement dates. At April 30, 2006 we recorded an asset of $0.8 million related to these instruments. To finance our prime originations, we use a warehouse facility with capacity up to $25 million, which bears interest at one month LIBOR plus 140 to 200 basis points. As of April 30, 2006, the balance outstanding under this facility was $1.6 million. 42 DELIVERY RISK We have exposure to delivery risk in our non prime origination operations, which regularly enter into forward loan sale commitments prior to loans being originated. It is possible that we will be unable to originate the loans or that the loans originated will not meet the required characteristics of the forward loan sale commitments. Several remedies are available, although use of the remedies could reduce the execution price or the effectiveness of the forward loan sale commitment in reducing interest rate risk. RESIDUAL INTERESTS Relative to modeled assumptions, an increase or decrease in interest rates would impact the value of our residual interests and could affect accretion income related to our residual interests. Residual interests bear the interest rate risk embedded within the securitization due to an initial fixed rate period on the loans versus a floating rate funding cost. Residual interests also bear the on going risk that the floating interest rate earned after the fixed period on the mortgage loans is different from the floating interest rate on the bonds sold in the securitization. We enter into interest rate caps and swaps to mitigate interest rate risk associated with mortgage loans that will be securitized and residual interests that are classified as trading securities because they will be sold in a subsequent NIM transaction. The caps and swaps enhance the marketability of the securitization and NIM transactions. An interest rate cap represents a right to receive cash if interest rates rise above a contractual strike rate, its value therefore increases as interest rates rise. The interest rate used in our interest rate caps and the floating rate used in swaps are based on LIBOR. At April 30, 2006 we had no assets or liabilities recorded related to interest rate caps. See table below for sensitivities to changes in interest rates for residual interests, caps and swaps. See Item 8, note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional analysis of interest rate risk and other financial risks impacting residual interests. It is our policy to use derivative instruments only for the purpose of offsetting or reducing the risk of loss associated with a defined or quantified exposure. MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS Declining interest rates may cause increased refinancing activity, which reduces the life of the loans underlying the residual interests and MSRs, thereby generally reducing their fair value. The fair value of MSRs generally increases in a rising rate environment, although MSRs are recorded at the lower of cost or market value. Reductions in the fair value of these assets impact earnings through impairment charges. See Item 8, note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further sensitivity analysis of other MSR valuation assumptions. INVESTMENT SERVICES INTEREST RATE RISK HRBFA holds interest bearing receivables from customers, brokers, dealers and clearing organizations, which consist primarily of amounts due on margin transactions and are generally short term in nature. We fund these short term assets with short term variable rate liabilities from customers, brokers and dealers, including stock loan activity. Although there may be differences in the timing of the re pricing related to these assets and liabilities, we believe we are not significantly exposed to interest rate risk in this area. As a result, any change in interest rates would not materially impact our consolidated earnings. Our fixed income trading portfolio is affected by changes in market rates and prices. The risk is the loss of income arising from adverse changes in the value of the trading portfolio. We value the trading portfolio at quoted market prices and the market value of our trading portfolio at April 30, 2006 was approximately $16.1 million, net of $0.5 million in securities sold short. See table below for sensitivities to changes in interest rates. With respect to our fixed income securities portfolio, we manage our market price risk exposure by limiting concentration risk, maintaining minimum credit quality and limiting inventory to anticipated retail demand and current market conditions. 43 The sensitivities of certain financial instruments to changes in interest rates as of April 30, 2006 and 2005 are presented below. The following table represents hypothetical instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in interest rates and should not be relied on as an indicator of future expected results.
