We are the only major company offering a full range of software, online and in office tax preparation solutions, combined with personalized financial advice concerning retirement savings, home ownership and other opportunities to help clients build a better financial future. Our key strategic priorities for each of our reportable segments can be summarized as follows: Tax Services expand access to our services through improved distribution of our digital offerings and continue to improve the quality of service we provide to our clients. Business Services continue expansion of our national accounting, tax and consulting business, build and manage brand awareness, build differentiated and value driven services and improve our client service culture. Consumer Financial Services integrate the Tax Services client base into this segment and serve the broad consumer market through advisory and banking relationships. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS On April 19, 2007, we entered into an agreement to sell OOMC. In conjunction with this plan, we also announced we would terminate the operations of HRBMC. During fiscal year 2007, we committed to a plan to sell and or completed the wind down of three smaller lines of business previously reported in our Business Services segment, as well as our tax operations in the United Kingdom previously reported in Tax Services. During fiscal year 2007, we met the criteria requiring us to present the related financial results of these businesses as discontinued operations and the assets and liabilities of all of the businesses being sold as held for sale in the consolidated financial statements. All periods presented have been reclassified to reflect our discontinued operations. See Item 1 and Item 8, note 20 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Tax Services Financial Results (in 000s) Year Ended April 30, 2007 2006 2005 Service revenues: Tax preparation fees $ 1,896,269 $ 1,791,624 $ 1,718,208 Other services 301,411 204,892 192,311 2,197,680 1,996,516 1,910,519 Other revenues: Royalties 220,136 207,728 197,551 Loan participation fees and related revenue 210,040 177,852 182,784 Other 58,002 67,655 65,854 Total revenues 2,685,858 2,449,751 2,356,708 Cost of services: Compensation and benefits 826,064 753,793 722,067 Occupancy 346,937 316,686 281,298 Supplies 58,013 52,857 47,600 Depreciation and amortization 42,043 44,825 54,505 Bad debt 25,228 31,820 33,020 Allocated shared services and other 189,595 118,342 121,958 1,487,880 1,318,323 1,260,448 Provision for RAL litigation 70,200 Cost of other revenues, selling, general and administrative 492,807 471,139 430,969 Total expenses 1,980,687 1,859,662 1,691,417 Pretax income $ 705,171 $ 590,089 $ 665,291 FISCAL 2007 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2006 Tax Services revenues increased $236.1 million, or 9.6%, compared to the prior year. We opened nearly 300 new company owned offices, 250 of which were part of the expansion of our retail distribution network. This expansion contributed incremental revenues of $22.3 million and pretax losses of $5.7 million in fiscal year 2007. Tax preparation fees from our retail offices increased $104.6 million, or 5.8%, for fiscal year 2007. This increase is primarily due to an increase of 5.9% in the net average fee per U.S. client served, while the number of U.S. clients served in company owned offices was essentially flat compared to last year. Our international operations contributed $9.6 million to the increase, resulting from a 4.5% increase in clients served. Other service revenue increased $96.5 million, or 47.1%, primarily due to $34.6 million in additional license fees earned from bank products, $25.9 million in additional revenues from our online tax preparation and e filing services and a $12.2 million increase in the recognition of deferred fee revenue from our POM guarantees. Additionally, this segment earned 26 Table of Contents customer fees in connection with an agreement with HRB Bank for our new HR Block Emerald Prepaid MasterCard program, under which, this segment shares in the revenues and expenses associated with the program. Royalty revenue increased $12.4 million, or 6.0%, due to a 7.6% increase in the net average fee and a 1.6% increase in clients served in franchise offices. Loan participation fees and related revenues increased $32.2 million, or 18.1%, from the prior year. This increase is primarily due to the introduction of the IMAL, an early season loan product, which increased our participation revenues $17.6 million. The remainder of the increase is primarily due to our new RAL participation agreement with HSBC. Other revenues decreased $9.7 million, or 14.3%, primarily due to a decline in revenues from supply sales to franchises, as our franchises now order directly from the supplier. Revenue from our digital business, which includes both service and product revenues, increased $29.2 million, or 21.9%, primarily due to a 19.4% increase in clients served. In fiscal year 2007, we implemented an aggressive plan to grow market share, although the required spending to achieve these results did impact our margin. Total expenses increased $121.0 million, or 6.5%, compared to the prior year. Cost of services increased $169.6 million, or 12.9%, from the prior year. Our real estate expansion efforts have contributed to a total increase of $28.0 million across all cost of services categories. Compensation and benefits increased $72.3 million, or 9.6%, primarily due to higher wages associated with increased revenues, costs associated with our earlier office openings and initiatives addressing operational readiness for the tax season. Occupancy expenses increased $30.3 million, or 9.6%, primarily as a result of higher rent expenses, due to a 5.9% increase in company owned offices under lease and a 3.9% increase in the average rent. Other cost of services increased $71.3 million, or 60.2%, primarily due to additional corporate shared services for information technology and other projects, and costs associated with the HR Block Emerald Prepaid MasterCard program, which this segment shares with HRB Bank. Cost of other revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $21.7 million, or 4.6%, primarily due to increases of $30.9 million and $26.0 million in bad debt on loan participations and marketing expenses, respectively. The higher bad debt expense is primarily due to an $18.0 million favorable adjustment to RAL bad debt recorded in the prior year and the addition of our IMAL product. These increases were partially offset by a $26.6 million reduction in corporate shared services and a $10.8 million decrease in legal expenses. In the prior year, we recorded $70.2 million, including legal fees, related to the settlement of RAL litigation. Pretax income for fiscal year 2007 increased $115.1 million, or 19.5%, from 2006, primarily due to higher revenues and the impact of the $70.2 million prior year RAL litigation charge. FISCAL 2006 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2005 Tax Services revenues increased $93.0 million, or 3.9%, compared to fiscal year 2005. We opened more than 750 new offices, 550 of which were part of the expansion of our company owned retail distribution network. This expansion contributed incremental revenues of $36.4 million and pretax losses of $8.5 million in fiscal year 2006. Tax preparation fees from our retail offices increased $73.4 million, or 4.3%, for fiscal year 2006. This increase is primarily due to an increase of 6.1% in the net average fee per U.S. client served, partially offset by a decrease of 2.3% in U.S. clients served in company owned offices. The decrease in clients served was partially due to a number of technology problems that severely hurt the start of our filing season, coupled with increased competition due to competitors refund lending products. Our international operations contributed $17.1 million to the increase, resulting from a 5.4% increase in clients served. Royalty revenue increased $10.2 million, or 5.2%, due to a 5.2% increase in the net average fee, slightly offset by a 1.0% decline in clients served in franchise offices. Loan participation fees and related revenues earned during fiscal year 2006 decreased $4.9 million, or 2.7%, from fiscal year 2005. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in the number of RALs, which resulted from increased competition for clients in the early months of the tax season. Revenue from our digital business increased 8.2%, primarily due to a 23.3% increase in clients served, partially offset by planned reductions in unit prices. Total expenses increased $168.2 million, or 9.9%, primarily due to a $70.2 million charge relating to the settlement of two RAL claims. See additional discussion below and in Item 8, note 19 to the consolidated financial statements. Cost of services for the fiscal year 2006 increased $57.9 million, or 4.6%, from fiscal year 2005. Our real estate expansion efforts have contributed to a total increase of $43.5 million across all cost of services categories. Compensation and benefits increased $31.7 million, or 4.4%, primarily due to an increase in staff needed for our new offices and the addition of costs related to our small business initiatives. Occupancy expenses increased $35.4 million, or 12.6%, primarily as a result of higher rent 27 Table of Contents expenses, due to a 9.5% increase in company owned offices under lease and a 7.3% increase in the average rent. Depreciation declined $9.7 million, or 17.8%, primarily due to decreased capital expenditures compared to fiscal year 2005. Cost of other revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $40.2 million, or 9.3%, primarily due to a $31.5 million increase in corporate shared services, $20.7 million of which was related to our marketing efforts. We also incurred $7.5 million in additional corporate wages and $7.1 million in additional legal costs in fiscal year 2006. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006, we revised our estimate for the provision for bad debt related to our participation interests in RALs, resulting in a decrease to our provision for bad debt of $18.0 million during fiscal year 2006. Pretax income for fiscal year 2006 decreased $75.2 million, or 11.3%, from 2005, primarily due to the impact of the RAL litigation. RAL LITIGATION On December 21, 2005, we entered into a settlement agreement regarding litigation pertaining to our RAL programs entitled Deadra D. Cummins, et al. v. HR Block, Inc. et al.; Mitchell v. HR Block, Inc. et al.; Green v. HR Block, Inc. et al.; and Becker v. HR Block, Inc. (the Cummins Settlement Agreement). Pursuant to the Cummins Settlement Agreements terms, we contributed a total of up to $62.5 million in cash for purposes of making payments to the settlement class, paying all attorneys fees and costs to class counsel, and covering service awards to the representative plaintiffs. In addition, we paid costs for providing notice of the settlement to settlement class members. Settlement of this matter resulted in a pretax charge of $50.7 million in fiscal year 2006. On April 19, 2006, we entered into a settlement agreement, subject to final court approval, regarding litigation entitled Lynne A. Carnegie, et al. v. Household International, Inc., HR Block, Inc., et al. (the Carnegie Settlement Agreement). Pursuant to the Carnegie Settlement Agreement, we contributed a total of $19.5 million in cash for purposes of making payments to the settlement class, paying all attorneys fees and costs to class counsel, incentive payment awards to plaintiff and all notice and administration costs. We recorded a $19.5 million pretax charge related to this settlement in the third quarter of fiscal year 2006. We are named as a defendant in one other class action lawsuit and one state attorney general lawsuit alleging that we engaged in wrongdoing with respect to the RAL program. We believe we have meritorious defenses to the other lawsuits and will vigorously defend our position. Nevertheless, the amounts claimed in these lawsuits are very substantial, and there can be no assurances as to their ultimate outcome, or as to their impact on our financial statements. See additional discussion of RAL Litigation in Item 3, Legal Proceedings and in Item 8, note 19 to the consolidated financial statements. BUSINESS SERVICES This segment offers middle market companies accounting, tax and business consulting services, wealth management and capital market services. The following discussion excludes the results of the three businesses reported in discontinued operations for all periods presented. Business Services Operating Statistics Year Ended April 30, 2007 2006 2005 ACCOUNTING, TAX AND BUSINESS CONSULTING Chargeable hours (000s) 5,075 4,357 2,898 Chargeable hours per person 1,373 1,385 1,430 Net billed rate per hour $ 148 $ 141 $ 133 Average margin per person $ 118,415 $ 114,755 $ 112,573 Business Services Financial Results (in 000s) Year Ended April 30, 2007 2006 2005 Service revenues: Accounting, tax and consulting $ 808,223 $ 704,338 $ 425,329 Capital markets 48,886 59,553 67,922 Other services 29,993 26,248 19,692 887,102 790,139 512,943 Other 45,259 37,994 34,242 Total revenues 932,361 828,133 547,185 Cost of services: Compensation and benefits 511,257 457,050 307,301 Occupancy 68,859 55,883 21,072 Other 69,941 60,101 53,218 650,057 573,034 381,591 Amortization of intangible assets 15,521 16,165 14,442 Cost of other revenues, selling, general and administrative 209,122 168,273 107,945 Total expenses 874,700 757,472 503,978 Pretax income $ 57,661 $ 70,661 $ 43,207 28 Table of Contents FISCAL 2007 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2006 Business Services revenues for fiscal year 2007 increased $104.2 million, or 12.6%, over the prior year. Accounting, tax and consulting revenues increased $103.9 million, or 14.7%, over the prior year. This increase resulted primarily from the acquisition of AmexTBS, which contributed $98.7 million in additional service revenues. This acquisition, coupled with an increase in our existing business, was partially offset by a decline in consulting revenue, resulting from a change in organizational structure between the businesses we acquired from AmexTBS and the attest firms that, while not affiliates of our company, also serve our clients. As a result, we no longer record the revenues and expenses associated with leasing employees in these offices to the attest firms. Capital markets revenues declined $10.7 million. Valuation and seminar revenues declined $23.2 million due to a 59.2% decline in the number of business valuation projects. This decrease was partially offset by a $12.6 million increase in underwriting revenues due to a 28.6% increase in transactions and a 32.2% increase in revenue per transaction. Other revenues increased primarily due to higher computer hardware and software sales. Total expenses increased $117.2 million, or 15.5%, compared to the prior year. Cost of services increased $77.0 million, due to increases in compensation and benefits and occupancy expenses. Compensation and benefits increased $54.2 million, or 11.9%, due to an increase in the number of personnel, primarily as a result of the AmexTBS acquisition, and an increase in the average wage per employee. Occupancy expenses increased $13.0 million due to higher rent expense resulting from office locations added with the AmexTBS acquisition in fiscal year 2006. These offices only contributed seven months of expense in the prior year, compared to twelve months in the current year. Cost of other revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $40.8 million, or 24.3%, due to seven months of expense from the AmexTBS acquisition in the prior year, compared to twelve months in the current year, $5.9 million of costs incurred related to international acquisitions that will not be completed and additional costs associated with our business development initiatives. Pretax income for the year ended April 30, 2007 of $57.7 million compares to $70.7 million in the prior year. The decline was primarily due to off season losses of AmexTBS. FISCAL 2006 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2005 Business Services revenues for fiscal year 2006 increased $280.9 million, or 51.3%, from fiscal year 2005. This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of AmexTBS, which increased accounting, tax and consulting revenues $251.3 million. The remaining $27.7 million increase in tax, accounting and consulting revenues was primarily driven by increases in the net billed rate per hour and chargeable hours. Capital markets revenues declined $8.4 million due to a 36.0% decline in the number of business valuation projects. Other service revenues increased $6.6 million as a result of growth in wealth management services. Total expenses increased $253.5 million, or 50.3%, for fiscal year 2006 compared to the prior year. Cost of services increased $191.4 million, primarily due to a $149.7 million increase in compensation and benefits. Compensation and benefits increased primarily due to the AmexTBS acquisition. In addition, baseline increases in the number of personnel and the average wage per employee, driven by marketplace competition for professional staff, also contributed to the increase. Occupancy expenses increased $34.8 million primarily due to acquisitions. Cost of other revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $60.3 million primarily due to acquisitions and additional costs associated with our business development initiatives. Pretax income for the year ended April 30, 2006 was $70.7 million, compared to $43.2 million in fiscal year 2005. 29 Table of Contents CONSUMER FINANCIAL SERVICES This segment is primarily engaged in offering brokerage services, along with investment planning and related financial advice through HRBFA and full service banking through HRB Bank. HRBFA and HRB Bank, our Block branded businesses, are focused on increasing client loyalty and retention by offering expanded financial and banking services to our retail tax clients. HRB Bank commenced operations May 1, 2006, therefore segment results for fiscal years 2006 and 2005 include only the operations of HRBFA and are not directly comparable to fiscal year 2007.

FISCAL 2007 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2006 Consumer Financial Services revenues, net of interest expense and provision for loan losses, for fiscal year 2007 increased $58.3 million, or 20.7%, over the prior year, primarily as a result of HRB Bank, which commenced operations May 1, 2006. Financial advisor production revenue, which consists primarily of fees earned on assets under administration and commissions on customer trades, increased $9.2 million, or 4.8%, over the prior year, due primarily to higher annuitized revenues. The following table summarizes the key drivers of production revenue: Year Ended April 30, 2007 2006 Client trades 907,075 974,625 Average revenue per trade $ 126.54 $ 119.11 Assets under administration (billions) $ 33.1 $ 31.8 Annualized productivity per advisor $ 216,000 $ 194,000 30 Table of Contents Other service revenues increased $36.4 million, due to revenues earned from our new HR Block Prepaid Emerald MasterCard program, coupled with positive sweep account rate variances and higher underwriting fees. 31 Table of Contents Net interest income on banking activities totaled $24.0 million for fiscal year 2007. The following table summarizes the key drivers of net interest revenue on banking activities: (dollars in 000s) Average Balance Average Rate Loans $ 746,387 6.80 % Investments 117,350 5.25 % Deposits 700,707 4.59 % Total expenses increased $5.7 million, or 1.8%. Cost of services increased $6.7 million, or 3.8%, primarily due to the expenses of HRB Bank, which opened May 1, 2006. Pretax income for Consumer Financial Services for fiscal year 2007 was $19.8 million compared to the prior year loss of $32.8 million. FISCAL 2006 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2005 Consumer Financial Services revenues, net of interest expense, increased $45.2 million, or 19.1% over fiscal year 2005. Financial advisor production revenue increased $24.6 million, or 14.8%, over fiscal year 2005, primarily due to additional annuitized revenue. Higher annuitized revenues resulted from increased sales of annuities and insurance, wealth management accounts, mutual funds, and unit investment trusts. Annualized productivity averaged approximately $194,000 per advisor during fiscal year 2006 compared to $166,000 in the prior year. Increased productivity was due to minimum production standards put into place during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005. Net interest income increased $13.6 million, or 33.4%, from the prior year, as a result of higher interest rates earned, partially offset by a decline in average margin balances. Total expenses increased $2.6 million, or 0.8%. Cost of services increased $19.2 million, or 12.1%, primarily as a result of $18.7 million of additional compensation and benefits expenses resulting from higher production revenues. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $16.5 million, or 14.2%, primarily due to a $4.8 million decline in legal expenses, due in part to a favorable arbitration outcome. Fiscal year 2006 results also improved due to reduced back office headcount relating to cost containment efforts and gains on the disposition of certain assets during the year. These decreases were partially offset by increased bonus accruals associated with the segments improved performance. The pretax loss for Consumer Financial Services for fiscal year 2006 was $32.8 million compared to a loss of $75.4 million in 2005. 32 Table of Contents DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Discontinued operations includes OOMC and HRBMC, mortgage businesses primarily engaged in the origination and acquisition of non prime and prime mortgage loans, the sale and securitization of mortgage loans and residual interests, and the servicing of non prime loans. These businesses were previously reported in our Mortgage Services segment in our Annual Report on Form 10 K for fiscal year 2006. Also included are the results of three smaller lines of business previously reported in our Business Services segment, as well as our tax operations in the United Kingdom previously reported in our Tax Services segment.

(4) Defined as total premium received divided by total balance of loans delivered to third party investors or securitization vehicles (excluding mortgage servicing rights and the effect of loan origination expenses). FISCAL 2007 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2006 Conditions in the non prime mortgage industry were challenging throughout fiscal year 2007, and particularly in our fourth quarter. Our mortgage operations, as well as the entire industry, were impacted by deteriorating conditions in the secondary market, where reduced investor demand for loan purchases, higher investor yield requirements and increased estimates for future losses reduced the value of non prime loans. Under these 33 Table of Contents conditions non prime originators generally reported significant increases in losses and many were unable to meet their financial obligations. During the fourth quarter we tightened our underwriting standards, which had the effect of reducing our loan origination volumes, but we expect will result in the origination of higher quality loans with better pricing in the secondary markets. The pretax loss of $1.2 billion includes losses of $50.2 million from our Business Services and Tax Services discontinued operations, with the remainder from our mortgage business. As discussed more fully below, mortgage results include $388.7 million in loss provisions and repurchase reserves, impairments of residual interests of $168.9 million and impairments of other assets totaling $345.8 million. If conditions in the industry, particularly in home appreciation, continue to decline, our future results would continue to be negatively impacted. The following table summarizes the key drivers of loan origination volumes and related gains on sales of mortgage loans: (dollars in 000s) Year Ended April 30, 2007 2006 Application process: Total number of applications 256,877 369,210 Number of sales associates (1) 1,683 2,814 Closing ratio (2) 49.7 % 60.3 % Originations: Total number of loans originated 127,556 222,749 WAC 8.60 % 7.87 % Average loan size $ 212 $ 183 Total volume of loans originated $ 27,073,467 $ 40,779,763 Direct origination and acquisition expenses, net $ 171,374 $ 387,911 Revenue (loan value): Net gain on sale gross margin (3) (1.10 %) 1.76 % (1) Includes all direct sales and back office sales support associates. (2) Percentage of loans funded divided by total applications in the period. (3) Defined as gain on sale of mortgage loans (including gain or loss on derivatives, mortgage servicing rights and net of direct origination and acquisition expenses) divided by origination volume. Gains on sales of mortgage assets decreased $1.2 billion from the prior year. This decrease resulted primarily from significantly lower origination volumes and loan sale premiums, increases in loan repurchase reserves and impairments of residual interests and losses on derivatives. During the fourth quarter, concerns about credit quality in the non prime industry resulted in lower demand for non prime loans and a higher yield requirement by investors that purchase the loans. As a result, during the quarter we originated mortgage loans that, by the time we sold them in the secondary market, were valued at less than par. Our fourth quarter net gain on sale gross margin was a negative 6.87% and a negative 1.10% for the full fiscal year. We sold 73% and 39% of our loans through securitizations in the fourth quarter and fiscal year, respectively. Additionally, our loan sale premium declined 148 basis points from 1.42% in fiscal year 2006, to a negative 0.06% in the current year. The disruption in the secondary market, coupled with declining credit quality and increasing early payment defaults, caused investors in our loans to become increasingly more likely to execute on early payment default provisions available to them in loan sale agreements. As a result, we experienced higher actual and expected loan repurchase activity. Additionally, after we repurchased the loans, we experienced higher severity of losses on those loans. We recorded total loss provisions of $388.7 million during fiscal year 2007 compared to $73.6 million in the prior year. The provision recorded in the current year consists of $238.8 million recorded on loans sold during the current year and $149.9 million related to loans sold in the prior year. Loss provisions as a percent of loan volumes increased 126 basis points over the prior year. See additional discussion of our reserves and repurchase obligations in Item 8, note 20 to our consolidated financial statements. During the current year, we recorded impairments of $168.9 million in gains on sales of mortgage assets due to higher expected credit losses resulting from the decline in performance of the underlying collateral. We also recorded unfavorable pretax mark to market adjustments in other comprehensive income, which decreased the fair value of our residual interests $32.4 million during the current year. These adjustments were recorded net of write ups of $18.6 million and deferred taxes of $5.3 million. We also recorded $7.0 million and $31.5 million in gains on the sale of residual interests for the years ended April 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. During the current year, we recorded a net $11.0 million in losses, compared to gains of $141.2 million in the prior year, related to our various derivative instruments. The decline for the current year was caused by market interest rates, based on the two year swap, declining 6 basis points compared to an increase of 131 basis points during the prior year. See Item 8, note 20 to the consolidated financial statements. The value of MSRs recorded in the current year increased to 64 basis points from 61 basis points in the prior year due to changes in our assumptions used to value MSRs, as well as an increase in average loan balances. However, this increase was offset by an overall decline in origination volumes, resulting in 34 Table of Contents a net decrease in gains on sales of mortgage loans of $78.3 million. See additional discussion of our MSR assumptions in Critical Accounting Policies and in Item 8, note 20 to the consolidated financial statements. Interest income decreased $78.7 million from the prior year. This decrease is primarily due to higher levels of non performing loans, lower accretion resulting from the sale of previously securitized residual interests and lower write ups to residual interest balances. The following table summarizes the key metrics related to our loan servicing business: (dollars in 000s) Year Ended April 30, 2007 2006 Average servicing portfolio: With related MSRs $ 63,870,378 $ 56,521,595 Without related MSRs 3,314,538 19,106,863 $ 67,184,916 $ 75,628,458 Ending servicing portfolio: With related MSRs $ 63,927,976 $ 62,910,568 Without related MSRs 3,069,073 10,471,509 $ 66,997,049 $ 73,382,077 Number of loans serviced 384,156 441,981 Average delinquency rate 9.77 % 5.16 % Weighted average FICO score 621 621 WAC of portfolio 8.08 % 7.58 % Carrying value of MSRs 253,067 272,472 Loan servicing revenues increased $34.4 million, or 8.6%, compared to the prior year. The increase reflects higher late fee income on delinquent loans. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in our average servicing portfolio, which decreased 11.2%, to $67.2 billion. The annualized rate earned on our entire servicing portfolio was 37 basis points for the current year, compared to 38 basis points in the prior year. Total expenses for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2007 increased $326.4 million, or 33.3%, over the prior year. Cost of services increased $28.5 million primarily as a result of higher amortization of MSRs, partially offset by reductions in compensation and occupancy expenses resulting from our mortgage restructuring activities. Cost of other revenues decreased $149.1 million, primarily due to our ongoing restructuring plans. As a result, compensation and benefits declined $116.7 million and other expenses declined $27.4 million. In conjunction with our agreement to sell OOMC, we recorded impairments during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007. The purchase price will be calculated as the fair value of the adjusted tangible net assets of OOMC (as defined by the agreement) at closing less $300.0 million. At April 30, 2007, we valued our assets and liabilities held for sale at estimated fair value at closing, less costs to sell, of $1.1 billion which resulted in an impairment charge of $345.8 million, including the full impairment of goodwill of $152.5 million. Because conditions may change during the period prior to closing, the adjusted tangible net assets of the business at the closing date may be significantly different than the estimated value we have reported as of April 30, 2007. Any changes could change the final impairment amount recorded at closing. See discussion of additional conditions of the sale in Item 1A, under Potential Sale Transaction. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $96.1 million due primarily to severance costs in connection with our ongoing restructuring plans, coupled with retention bonuses and higher consulting expenses. See additional discussion of the restructuring charge in Item 8, note 20 to the consolidated financial statements. The pretax loss for the year ended April 30, 2007 was $1.2 billion compared to income of $316.9 million in the prior year. The loss from discontinued operations for fiscal year 2007 of $808.0 million is net of tax benefits of $425.0 million, and includes income tax benefits related to OOMC totaling $374.6 million. Income taxes for discontinued operations also included one time benefits of $16.2 million related to permanent deductions for the tax basis of investments in two subsidiaries that were abandoned during the year. Assets of discontinued operations held for sale includes deferred tax assets of $393.6 million, net of the related valuation allowance, and deferred tax liabilities of $94.0 million as of April 30, 2007. In addition, we recorded a valuation allowance of $55.8 million, which primarily relates to deferred tax assets for capital losses and basis differences in certain state jurisdictions. Deferred tax assets of $183.2 million relate to certain residual assets. Although the tax position associated with these deferred tax assets is more likely than not of being sustained, there is a level of uncertainty associated with the amount of benefit. We believe the net deferred tax asset at April 30, 2007 is, more likely than not, realizable. FISCAL 2006 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2005 Revenues from discontinued operations increased $24.4 million, or 1.9%, over fiscal year 2005. Revenues increased as a result of higher loan servicing revenues and gains on derivatives, partially offset by lower margins on mortgage loans sold and lower accretion. Despite a 31.5% increase in loan origination volume, gains on sales of mortgage loans decreased $163.0 million, primarily as a result of moderating demand by loan buyers and rising two year swap rates. Market interest rates, based on the two year swap, increased from an average of 3.32% last year to 4.63% in the current year. However, our WAC increased only 51 basis points, up to 7.87% from 7.36% in the prior year. Due to competitive market conditions, we were unable to align our WAC with increases in market rates. Because of poor alignment of our WAC with market rates and increases in our funding costs, our loan sale premium declined 135 basis points, to 1.42% from 2.77% in the prior year. In fiscal year 2006, we also increased our loss reserves above our normal loss accrual, 35 Table of Contents primarily related to repurchase activity for loans sold related to early payment defaults, which reduced gains on sales of mortgage loans. The initial value of MSRs recorded in fiscal year 2006 increased to 61 basis points from 44 basis points in the prior year, which resulted in an increase of $113.0 million in gains on sales of mortgage loans. These increases were primarily due to higher origination volumes, average loan size and interest rates, coupled with updated valuation assumptions. During fiscal year 2006 we updated our assumptions used to value our MSRs. The assumptions were updated primarily to reflect lower servicing costs, in particular interest paid to bondholders on monthly loan prepayments, and higher discount rates. These changes in assumptions increased the weighted average value of MSRs recorded during fiscal year 2006 by approximately $37.0 million (9 basis points of total retained MSRs of 61 basis points) over the prior year. To mitigate the risk of short term changes in market interest rates related to our loan originations and beneficial interest in Trusts, we use interest rate swaps and forward loan sale commitments. We generally enter into interest rate swap arrangements related to existing loan applications with rate lock commitments and for rate lock commitments we expect to make in the next two to three weeks. During fiscal year 2006, we recorded a net $141.2 million in gains, compared to $46.9 million in the prior year, related to our interest rate swaps and other derivative instruments. This increase was primarily due to rising short term interest rates and an increase in the average notional amount of swap arrangements to $8.4 billion in fiscal year 2006, compared to $2.4 billion in fiscal year 2005. In fiscal year 2006, we completed sales of available for sale residual interests and recorded a gain of $31.5 million. These sales accelerated cash flows from these residual interests, effectively realizing previously recorded unrealized gains included in other comprehensive income. We recorded a gain of $15.4 million in the prior year on a similar transaction. During fiscal year 2006, our available for sale residual interests performed better than expected in our internal valuation models, with lower credit losses than originally modeled, partially offset by higher than expected interest rates. We recorded favorable pretax mark to market adjustments, which increased the fair value of these residual interests $53.3 million during the year. These adjustments were recorded, net of write downs of $18.0 million and deferred taxes of $13.5 million, in other comprehensive income and will be accreted into income throughout the remaining life of those residual interests. Offsetting this increase were impairments of $34.1 million, which were recorded in gains on sales of mortgage assets. Future changes in interest rates or other assumptions, based on market conditions or actual loan pool performance, could cause additional adjustments to the fair value of these residual interests and could cause changes to the accretion of these residual interests in future periods. Loan servicing revenues increased $125.9 million, or 46.1%, compared to the prior year. The increase reflects a higher loan servicing portfolio resulting from our loan origination growth. The average servicing portfolio for the year increased 37.9%, to $75.6 billion, even with lower volumes in our sub servicing business. The weighted average rate earned on our entire servicing portfolio was 38 basis points for fiscal year 2006, compared to 36 basis points in the prior year. Total expenses for fiscal year 2006 increased $197.6 million, or 25.2%, from the prior year. Cost of services increased $98.2 million, or 38.7%, mainly as a result of a higher average servicing portfolio during the current quarter year and increased amortization of MSRs. Cost of other revenues increased $88.3 million over fiscal year 2005, and includes a $12.6 million restructuring charge associated with the closing of some of our branch offices. Compensation and benefits increased $53.8 million primarily due to an increase in the average number of sales associates during the year to support higher loan volumes and the resulting increase in origination based incentives, coupled with $6.7 million in severance charges recorded as part of the restructuring. Occupancy expenses increased $7.8 million primarily due to $5.9 million in lease termination costs recorded as part of the restructuring. Other expenses increased $26.8 million primarily as a result of $20.1 million in additional interest expense related to mortgage loans held on our balance sheet and $5.0 million of additional depreciation and amortization of our origination and servicing software. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $11.0 million primarily due to $15.3 million in additional marketing expenses, $5.1 million in additional occupancy costs and $3.2 million in higher allocated shared services. These increases were partially offset by a $15.7 million decline in compensation and benefits resulting from reductions in administrative and corporate headcount and lower bonus accruals. Pretax income decreased $173.2 million, or 35.3%, for fiscal year 2006. 36 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES We consider the policies discussed below to be critical to understanding our financial statements, as they require the use of significant judgment and estimation in order to measure, at a specific point in time, matters that are inherently uncertain. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs. For all of these policies, we caution that future events rarely develop precisely as forecasted, and estimates routinely require adjustment and may require material adjustment. REVENUE RECOGNITION We have many different revenue sources, each governed by specific revenue recognition policies. Our revenue recognition policies can be found in Item 8, note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. Additional discussion of our recognition of gains on sales of mortgage assets follows. VALUATION OF MORTGAGE LOANS HELD FOR INVESTMENT Determining the allowance for credit losses for loans held for investment requires us to make estimates of losses that are highly uncertain and requires a high degree of judgment. We record an allowance representing our estimate of credit losses inherent in our portfolio of loans held for investment at the balance sheet date. The majority of our estimated credit loss is evaluated for mortgage loans on a pooled basis. We stratify the loan portfolio based on our view of risk associated with various elements of the pool and assign estimated loss rates based on those risks. Loss rates are based on historical experience, our assessment of economic and market conditions and loss rates of comparable financial institutions. We review non performing loans individually and record loss estimates typically based on the value of the underlying collateral. Changes in our estimates can affect our operating results. VALUATION OF GOODWILL We test goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change which would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. Our goodwill impairment analysis is based on a discounted cash flow approach and market comparables, when available. This analysis, at the reporting unit level, requires significant management judgment with respect to revenue and expense forecasts, anticipated changes in working capital, and the selection and application of an appropriate discount rate. Changes in the projections or assumptions could materially affect our estimate of reporting unit fair values. The use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted future operating cash flows and could effect our conclusions regarding the existence or amount of potential impairment. The goodwill balance in our continuing operations was $993.9 million as of April 30, 2007 and $941.3 million as of April 30, 2006. No goodwill impairments were identified in our continuing operations during fiscal years 2007, 2006 or 2005. In fiscal year 2007, we recorded $154.9 million in goodwill impairments related to the sale or wind down of businesses reported as discontinued operations. LITIGATION It is our policy to routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes related to legal matters, as well as ranges of probable losses. Assessing the likely outcome of pending litigation, including the amount of potential loss if any, is highly subjective. Our estimates may differ from actual results due to difficulties in predicting the outcome of jury trial, arbitration hearings, settlement discussions and related activity; predicting the outcome of class certification actions; and various other uncertainties. A determination of the amount of the reserves required, if any, for these contingencies is made after thoughtful analysis of each known issue and an analysis of historical experience in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, and related pronouncements. Therefore, we have recorded reserves related to certain legal matters for which we believe it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the range of such loss can be estimated. With respect to other matters, we have concluded that a loss is only reasonably possible or remote, or is not estimable and, therefore, no liability is recorded. INCOME TAXES We calculate our current and deferred tax provision for the fiscal year based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the applicable calendar year. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded in the appropriate periods when identified. We file a consolidated federal tax return on a calendar year basis, generally in the second fiscal quarter of the subsequent year. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We have considered taxable income in carry back periods, historical and forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be 37 Table of Contents realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which may result in proposed assessments. Our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly subjective and based on our best judgments. We believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters. However, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire. As a result, our effective tax rate may fluctuate on a quarterly basis. GAINS ON SALES OF MORTGAGE ASSETS We sell substantially all of the non prime mortgage loans we originate to the Trusts which are qualifying special purpose entities (QSPEs), with servicing rights generally retained. Prime mortgage loans are sold in loan sales, servicing released, to third party buyers. Gains or losses on sales of mortgage loans are recognized when control of the assets is surrendered (when loans are sold to third party buyers, including the Trusts) and are based on the difference between net proceeds received (cash proceeds less repurchase reserves) and the allocated cost of the assets sold. We determine the allocated cost of assets sold based on the relative fair values of net proceeds (i.e. the loans sold), retained MSRs and the beneficial interest in Trusts, which represents our residual interest in the ultimate expected outcome from the disposition of the loans by the Trusts. The following is an example of a hypothetical gain on sale calculation: (in 000s) Acquisition cost of underlying mortgage loans $ 1,000,000 Fair values: Net proceeds: Cash received $ 999,000 Less repurchase reserves (4,000 ) $ 995,000 Beneficial interest in Trusts 20,000 MSRs 7,000 $ 1,022,000 Computation of gain on sale: Net proceeds $ 995,000 Less allocated cost ($995,000 / $1,022,000 x $1,000,000) 973,581 Recorded gain on sale $ 21,419 Recorded beneficial interest in Trusts ($20,000 / $1,022,000 x $1,000,000) $ 19,570 Recorded value of MSRs ($7,000 / $1,022,000 x $1,000,000) $ 6,849 Recorded liability for repurchase reserves $ 4,000 Variations in the assumptions we use affect the estimated fair values and the reported net gains on sales. Gains on sales of mortgage loans totaled $102.0 million and $648.7 million for fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively. Our repurchase reserves relate to potential losses that could be incurred related to the repurchase of sold loans or indemnification of losses as a result of early payment defaults or breaches of other representations and warranties customary to the mortgage banking industry. Loans are repurchased due to a combination of factors, including delinquency and other violations of representations and warranties. In whole loan sale transactions, we guarantee the first payment to the purchaser. If this payment is not collected, it is referred to as an early payment default. For early payment default related losses, the amount of losses we expect to incur depends primarily on the frequency of early payment defaults, the rate at which defaulted loans subsequently become current on payments (cure rate), the propensity of the buyer of the loans to demand recourse under the loan sale agreement and the severity of loss incurred on loans which have been repurchased. The frequency of early payment defaults, cure rates and loss severity may vary depending on the creditworthiness of the borrower and economic factors such as home price appreciation and interest rates. To the extent actual losses related to repurchase activity are different from our estimates, the fair value of our repurchase reserves will increase or decrease. See Item 8, note 20 to our consolidated financial statements under Commitments and Contingencies. During the year ended April 30, 2007, we experienced higher early payment defaults, resulting in an increase in actual and expected loan repurchase activity. As a result, we recorded total loss provisions of $388.7 million during fiscal year 2007 compared to $73.6 million in the prior year. Loss provisions recorded in the current year consist of $238.8 million recorded on loans sold during the current year and $149.9 million related to loans sold in the prior year. At April 30, 2007, we assumed that substantially all loans that failed to make timely payments according to contractual early payment default provisions will be repurchased, and that approximately 5% of loans will be repurchased from sales that have not yet reached the contractual date upon which repurchases can be determined. Based on historical experience and review of current early payment default, cure rate and loss severity trends, we assumed an average 26% loss severity for loans on which we hold a first lien position. During fiscal year 2007, we increased our estimated loss severity for on balance sheet loans from an average of 15% to 26%. Based on our analysis as of April 30, 2007, we estimated our liability for repurchases to be $38.4 million. The sensitivity of the 38 Table of Contents repurchase reserve to 10% and 20% adverse changes in loss assumptions is $14.4 million and $28.8 million, respectively. VALUATION OF RESIDUAL INTERESTS We use discounted cash flow models to determine the estimated fair values of our residual interests. We develop our assumptions for expected credit losses, prepayment speeds, discount rates and interest rates based on historical experience. Variations in our assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair values, which may require us to record impairments or unrealized gains. In addition, variations will also affect the amount of residual interest accretion recorded on a monthly basis. We recorded $13.8 million in net write downs in other comprehensive income and $168.9 million in impairments in the income statement related to these residual interests during fiscal year 2007 as actual performance differed from our assumptions. See Item 8, note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for our methodology used in valuing residual interests. Available for sale (AFS) residual interests valued at $90.3 million and $159.1 million were recorded as of April 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Residual interests classified as trading securities totaled $72.7 million at April 30, 2007. We had no trading residual interests at April 30, 2006. See Item 8, note 20 to our consolidated financial statements for current assumptions and a sensitivity analysis of those assumptions. See Item 7A for additional sensitivity analysis related to interest rates. VALUATION OF MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS MSRs are recorded when we sell loans to third parties with the servicing of those loans retained. At the time of the loan sale, we determine and record on our balance sheet the allocated historical cost of the MSRs attributable to loans sold, as illustrated above. These MSRs are amortized over the estimated life of the underlying loans. MSRs are carried at the lower of cost or market (LOCOM). On a quarterly basis, MSRs are assessed to determine if our carrying value exceeds fair value. Fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow approach by stratifying the MSRs based on underlying loan characteristics, including the calendar year the loans are sold. To the extent fair value is less than carrying value we record an impairment charge and adjust the carrying value of the MSRs. A market price of our MSRs is not readily available because non prime MSRs are not actively traded in the marketplace. Therefore, the fair value of our MSRs is estimated using a discounted cash flow approach, using valuation methods and assumptions we believe incorporate assumptions used by market participants. Certain of these assumptions are subjective and require a high level of management judgment. MSR valuation assumptions are reviewed and approved by management on a quarterly basis. In determining the assumptions to be used to value MSRs, we review the historical performance of our MSRs, including back testing of the performance of certain individual assumptions (comparison of actual results to those expected). In addition, we periodically review third party valuations of certain of our MSRs and peer group MSR valuation surveys to assess the reasonableness of our valuation assumptions and resulting fair value estimates. Critical assumptions used in our discounted cash flow model include mortgage prepayment speeds, discount rates, costs to service and ancillary income. Variations in our assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair values. Changes to our assumptions are made when current trends and market data indicate that new trends have developed. Certain assumptions, such as ancillary interest income, may change from quarter to quarter as market conditions and projected interest rates change. Other assumptions, such as expected prepayment speeds, discount rates and costs of servicing may change less frequently as they are less sensitive to near term market conditions. Prepayment speeds may be affected by economic factors such as home price appreciation, market interest rates, the availability of other credit products to our borrowers and customer payment patterns. Prepayment speeds include the impact of all borrower prepayments including full payoffs, additional principal payments and the impact of loans paid off due to foreclosure liquidations. As market interest rates decline, prepayment speeds will generally increase as customers refinance existing mortgages under more favorable interest rate terms. As prepayment speeds increase, anticipated cash flows will generally decline resulting in a potential reduction, or impairment, to the fair value of the capitalized MSRs. Alternatively, an increase in market interest rates may cause a decrease in prepayment speeds, and an increase in fair value of MSRs. Many of our loans include prepayment penalties during the first two to three years. Prepayment penalties tend to lower prepayment speeds during the early life of our loans, regardless of market interest rate movements, therefore decreasing the sensitivity of expected prepayment speeds to changes in interest rates. Prepayment speeds are estimated based on historical experience. Changes are made as necessary to ensure such estimates reflect current market conditions specific to our individual MSR stratas. Discount rates are determined by reviewing market rates used by market participants. These rates may vary based on economic factors such as market perception of risk and changes in the risk free interest rates. Changes are made as necessary to ensure such estimates reflect current market conditions for MSR assets. Costs to service includes the cost of processing loan payments, making payments to bondholders, collecting delinquent accounts 39 Table of Contents and administrative foreclosure activities. Market trends and changes to underlying expenses are evaluated to determine if updates to assumptions are necessary. The economic factors affecting costs to service include unemployment rates, the housing market and the cost of labor. Higher unemployment rates may lead to higher delinquency and foreclosure rates resulting in higher costs to service loans. The housing market, including home price appreciation rates, impacts sale prices for homes in foreclosure and our borrowers ability to refinance or sell their properties in the event that they can no longer afford their homes, thus impacting delinquencies and foreclosures. Ancillary fees and income include late charges, non sufficient funds fees, collection fees and interest earning funds held in deposit. These fees could be impacted by state legislation efforts, customer behavior, fee waiver policies and industry trends. During the period from May 1, 2005 to April 30, 2007, assumptions used in valuing MSRs were updated. The significant changes and their impact, both in dollars and basis points of loans sold during the quarter of initial implementation, are outlined below beginning with the most recent changes. (dollars in 000s) Quarter Assumption Change Impact Implemented Discount rates 18% to 20% ($1,260) or April 30, 2007 (2) basis points Prepayment rates Further stratification $4,428 or January 31, 2007 of prepayment rates 8 basis points Ancillary fees Decreased average ($3,677) or July 31, 2006 number of days of (5) basis points interest collected related to prepayments Discount rate 15% to 18% ($2,555) or January 31, 2006 (3) basis points Costs to service Decreased the $12,893 or October 31, 2005 number of days of 11 basis points interest paid to investors During fiscal year 2007 we updated our assumptions related to loan prepayment rates to further stratify by vintage year, loan type, and loans with and without prepayment penalties. We also updated assumptions surrounding investor remittances during the current year, and increased the discount rate assumption used to determine the fair value of MSRs from 18% to 20% as a result of an analysis of third party data including rates used by other market participants. During fiscal year 2007, we also updated our assumption related to the average number of days of interest collected on funds received as a result of prepayments (Ancillary fees on the table above). We decreased the average number of days of interest collected following a review of the servicing portfolio data. While costs to service increase due to increases in delinquencies and foreclosures, this increase was offset by higher late fee income. During fiscal year 2006, we increased the discount rate assumption used to determine the fair value of MSRs from 15% to 18% as a result of an analysis of third party data including rates used by other market participants. During fiscal year 2006, we also updated our assumption for number of days of interest paid to investors (Costs to service on the table above) on monthly loan prepayments upon the completion of a review of the historical performance of the servicing portfolio. The cumulative net impact of the changes outlined above made during the period from May 1, 2006 to April 30, 2007 was an increase of approximately 1 basis point for MSRs initially recorded in fiscal year 2007 compared to the prior year. The updated assumptions outlined above are applied not only when we determine the allocated historical cost of MSRs, but are also used in our evaluation of the fair value of the MSR portfolio in conjunction with our impairment review. The changes in assumptions primarily impact the recognition of our initial MSR value through calculation of the gain on sale of mortgage assets. Because MSRs are recorded at LOCOM, we are unable to adjust our MSR portfolio value upward, thus have not recognized the positive impact of the assumption changes on the MSR portfolio as a whole. MSRs with a book value of $253.1 million are included in our consolidated balance sheet at April 30, 2007. While changes in any assumption could impact the value of our MSRs, the table below shows the significant drivers and the effect of a variation of a particular assumption on the fair value of our MSRs without changing any other assumptions. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities. Assumption % Impact on Fair Value Prepayments (including defaults): Adverse 10% (9 %) Adverse 20% (17 %) Discount rate: Adverse 10% (3 %) Adverse 20% (6 %) Ancillary fees and income: Adverse 10% (5 %) Adverse 20% (10 %) Costs to service: Adverse 10% (5 %) Adverse 20% (9 %) 40 Table of Contents VALUATION OF MORTGAGE LOANS HELD FOR SALE Determining the fair value of loans held for sale requires us to make estimates of losses that are highly uncertain and requires a high degree of judgment. Loans held for sale are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. We determine the fair value of loans based primarily on estimated market prices considering underlying loan defects, if any. Our estimates may vary depending on the creditworthiness of the borrower and economic factors such as home price appreciation and interest rates. Changes in our estimates can affect our operating results. OTHER SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Other significant accounting policies, not involving the same level of judgment or uncertainty as those discussed above, are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements. These policies may require judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance. Certain of these matters are among topics currently under reexamination by accounting standard setters and regulators. Although specific conclusions reached by these standard setters may cause a material change in our accounting policies, outcomes cannot be predicted with confidence. Also see Item 8, note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, which discusses accounting policies we have selected when there are acceptable alternatives, and new or proposed accounting standards that may affect our financial reporting in the future. FINANCIAL CONDITION CAPITAL RESOURCES LIQUIDITY Our sources of capital include cash from operations, issuances of common stock and debt. We use capital primarily to fund working capital, pay dividends, repurchase shares of our common stock and acquire businesses. CASH FROM OPERATIONS Cash used in operations totaled $584.7 million for fiscal year 2007, compared to cash provided of $594.1 million and $514.4 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Operating cash flows in fiscal year 2007 decreased from fiscal year 2006 primarily due to net losses and higher income tax payments. Income tax payments totaled $405.4 million this year, compared to $270.5 million in fiscal year 2006. ISSUANCES OF COMMON STOCK We issue shares of our common stock in accordance with our stock based compensation plans out of our treasury shares. Proceeds from the exercise of stock options totaled $25.7 million, $98.5 million and $129.3 million in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. DEBT In April 2007, we obtained a $500.0 million credit facility to provide funding for the $500.0 million of 81/2% Senior Notes which were due April 16, 2007. This facility matures on December 20, 2007. Commercial paper borrowings outstanding at April 30, 2007 totaled $1.0 billion and were primarily used to fund working capital needs. On October 26, 2004, we issued $400.0 million of 5.125% Senior Notes under our shelf registration statements. The proceeds from the notes were used to repay our $250.0 million in 63/4% Senior Notes, which were due on November 1, 2004. The remaining proceeds were used for working capital, capital expenditures, repayment of other debt and other general corporate purposes. DIVIDENDS We have consistently paid quarterly dividends. Dividends paid totaled $172.0 million, $160.0 million and $143.0 million in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Our Board of Directors approved an increase of the quarterly cash dividend from 13.5 cents to 14.25 cents per share, a 5.6% increase, effective with the quarterly dividend payment on October 1, 2007 to shareholders of record on September 10, 2007. SHARE REPURCHASES On June 7, 2006, our Board approved an authorization to repurchase 20.0 million shares. On June 9, 2004, our Board of Directors approved an authorization to repurchase 15 million shares. During fiscal year 2007, we repurchased 8.1 million shares pursuant to these authorizations at an aggregate price of $180.9 million or an average price of $22.22 per share. There were 22.4 million shares remaining under these authorizations at the end of fiscal year 2007. We purchase shares on the open market in accordance with existing authorizations, subject to various factors including the price of the stock, our ability to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility, securities laws restrictions, internally and regulatory targeted capital levels and other investment opportunities. Due to our efforts to meet our regulatory capital requirements, we do not expect to be able to repurchase shares until the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008. The significant losses in our mortgage operations during fiscal year 2007 and normal seasonal operating losses during the first eight months of fiscal year 2008 are expected to cause us to be non compliant with our capital requirements until the end of fiscal year 2008. See additional discussion of our regulatory capital requirements in Regulatory Environment. ACQUISITIONS From time to time we acquire businesses that we view to be a good strategic fit to our organization. Total cash paid for acquisitions was $57.6 million, 44 Table of Contents $210.1 million and $23.3 million during fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. RESTRICTED CASH We hold certain cash balances that are restricted as to use. Cash and cash equivalents restricted totaled $332.6 million at fiscal year end. Consumer Financial Services held $329.0 million of this total segregated in a special reserve account for the exclusive benefit of customers pursuant to Rule 15c3 3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. A condensed consolidating statement of cash flows by segment for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2007 follows. Generally, interest is not charged on intercompany activities between segments. Our consolidated statements of cash flows are located in Item 8. (in 000s) Consumer Business Financial Discontinued Consolidated Tax Services Services Services Corporate Operations HR Block Cash provided by (used in): Operations $ 415,509 $ 112,189 $ 2,751 $ (379,879 ) $ (735,294 ) $ (584,724 ) Investing (91,929 ) (19,500 ) (1,005,120 ) (57,189 ) 15,362 (1,158,376 ) Financing (11,109 ) (11,184 ) 1,298,768 662,215 52,421 1,991,111 Net intercompany (332,762 ) (71,492 ) (265,660 ) 2,403 667,511 Net intercompany activities are excluded from investing and financing activities within the segment cash flows. We believe that by excluding intercompany activities, the cash flows by segment more clearly depicts the cash generated and used by each segment. Had intercompany activities been included, those segments in a net lending situation would have been included in investing activities, and those in a net borrowing situation would have been included in financing activities. TAX SERVICES Tax Services has historically been our largest provider of annual operating cash flows. The seasonal nature of Tax Services generally results in a large positive operating cash flow in the fourth quarter. Tax Services generated $415.5 million in operating cash flows primarily related to net income, as cash is generally collected from clients at the time services are rendered. Cash used in investing activities of $91.9 million was for capital expenditures and business acquisitions. Our international operations are generally self funded. Cash balances are held in Canada and Australia independently in local currencies. HR Block Canada, Inc. (Block Canada) has a commercial paper program for up to $225.0 million (Canadian). At April 30, 2007, there was no commercial paper outstanding. The peak borrowing during fiscal year 2007 was $135.0 million (Canadian). BUSINESS SERVICES Business Services funding requirements are largely related to receivables for completed work and work in process and funding relating to acquired businesses. We provide funding in the normal course of business sufficient to cover these working capital needs. Business Services also has future obligations and commitments, which are summarized in Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments. This segment generated $112.2 million in operating cash flows primarily related to net income. Additionally, Business Services used $19.5 million in investing activities primarily related to capital expenditures, and $11.2 million in financing activities as a result of payments on acquisition debt. CONSUMER FINANCIAL SERVICES In fiscal year 2007, Consumer Financial Services used $1.0 billion in investing activities primarily due to the purchase of mortgage loans from OOMC. Cash provided by financing activities of $1.3 billion is due to customer deposits. To manage short term liquidity, Block Financial Corporation (BFC) provides HRBFA a $300.0 million unsecured credit facility. At the end of fiscal year 2007 there was no outstanding balance on this facility. HRBFA has two secured lines of credit with an unaffiliated financial institution with a total credit limit of $51.0 million. There were no borrowings on these lines of credit during fiscal years 2007 or 2006 and no outstanding balance at April 30, 2007 or 2006. Liquidity needs relating to client trading and margin borrowing activities are met primarily through cash balances in client brokerage accounts and working capital. Stock loans have historically been used as a secondary source of funding and could be used in the future, if warranted. Securities borrowed and securities loaned transactions are generally reported as collateralized financings. These transactions require us to deposit cash and or collateral with the counterparty. Securities loaned consist of customers securities purchased on margin. We receive cash collateral approximately equal to the value of the securities loaned. The amount of cash collateral is adjusted, as required, for market fluctuations in the value of the securities loaned. Interest rates paid on the cash collateral fluctuate as short term interest rates change. To satisfy the margin deposit requirement of client option transactions with the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), HRBFA pledges customers margined securities. Pledged securities at the end of fiscal year 2007 totaled $47.0 million, an excess of $11.5 million over the margin requirement. Pledged securities at the end of fiscal year 2006 totaled $53.0 million, an excess of $9.9 million over the margin requirement. HRB Banks current liquidity needs are generally met through deposits from banking clients. HRB Bank has access to 41 Table of Contents traditional funding sources such as deposits, federal funds purchased, and repurchase agreements. HRB Bank maintains a credit facility with the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB). At April 30, 2007, $179.0 million was drawn under this facility. See additional discussion of regulatory and capital requirements of HRB Bank and HRBFA in Regulatory Environment. We believe the funding sources for Consumer Financial Services are stable. Liquidity risk within this segment is primarily limited to maintaining sufficient capital levels to obtain securities lending liquidity to support margin borrowing by customers and maintaining sufficient capital levels at HRB Bank. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Our discontinued operations primarily generate cash as a result of the sale and securitization of mortgage loans and residual interests and as residual interests mature. Our discontinued operations used $735.3 million in cash from operating activities primarily due to operating losses. Our discontinued operations provided $15.4 million in cash from investing activities primarily related to cash received from the maturity and sales of AFS residual interests. Cash provided by financing activities of $52.4 million reflects an on balance sheet securitization during fiscal year 2007. We regularly sell loans as a source of liquidity. Loan sales in fiscal year 2007 were $27.5 billion compared with $40.3 billion in fiscal year 2006. Additionally, BFC provides a line of credit of at least $150 million for working capital needs. At the end of fiscal year 2007 there was $811.9 million outstanding on this facility. To finance our prime mortgage loan originations, HRBMC uses a warehouse facility with capacity up to $25.0 million. This annual facility bears interest at one month LIBOR plus 140 to 200 basis points. As of April 30, 2007 and 2006, the balance outstanding under this facility was $0.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively, and is included in current liabilities held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets. See discussion of our non prime warehouse facilities and waivers of certain covenants below in Off Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements. We believe the sources of liquidity available to our mortgage operations are sufficient for its needs. Risks to the stability of these sources include, but are not limited to, adverse changes in the perception of the non prime industry, adverse changes in the regulation of non prime lending, changes in the rating criteria of non prime lending by third party rating agencies and, to a lesser degree, reduction in the availability of third parties who provide credit enhancement. Past performance of the securitizations will also impact the segments future participation in these markets. The off balance sheet warehouse facilities used by the Trusts are subject to annual renewal, each at a different time during the year, and any of the above events could lead to difficulty in renewing the lines. OFF BALANCE SHEET FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS We are party to various transactions with an off balance sheet component, including loan commitments and QSPEs, or Trusts. We had commitments to fund mortgage loans of $2.4 billion and $4.0 billion at April 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively, which are subject to conditions and loan contract verification. There is no commitment on the part of the borrower to close on the mortgage loan at this stage of the lending process and external market forces impact the probability of these loan commitments being closed. Therefore, total commitments outstanding do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. If the loan commitments are exercised, they will be funded as described below. The Trusts reduce our capital investment in our non prime mortgage operations. These arrangements are primarily used to sell mortgage loans, but a portion may also be used to sell servicing advances and finance residual interests. Additionally, these arrangements free up cash and short term borrowing capacity, improve liquidity and flexibility, and reduce balance sheet risk, while providing stability and access to liquidity in the secondary market for mortgage loans. Substantially all non prime mortgage loans we originate are sold daily to the Trusts. Loans totaling $1.5 billion and $7.8 billion were held by the Trusts as of April 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and were not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. The Trusts purchase the loans from us using committed warehouse facilities, arranged by us, totaling $9.3 billion in the aggregate. These facilities are subject to various OOMC performance triggers, limits and financial covenants, including tangible net worth, income and leverage ratios and may be subject to margin calls. We hold an interest in the Trusts equal to the difference between the fair value of the assets and cash proceeds, adjusted for contractual advance rates, received from the Trusts. In addition to a margin call feature, loans sold to the Trust are subject to repurchase if certain criteria are not met, including loan default provisions. Unfavorable fluctuations in loan value are guaranteed up to 10% of the original fair value. These facilities also contain cross default features in which a default in one facility would trigger a default under the other 42 Table of Contents facilities as well. These various facilities bear interest at one month LIBOR plus 50 to 400 basis points and expire on various dates during the year. In addition, some of the facilities provide for the payment of minimum usage fees. Additional uncommitted facilities of $2.0 billion bring total capacity to $11.3 billion at April 30, 2007. As of April 30, 2007, OOMC did not meet the minimum net income financial covenant contained in certain of its committed warehouse facilities. This covenant requires OOMC to maintain a cumulative minimum net income of at least $1 for the four consecutive fiscal quarters ended April 30, 2007. On April 27, 2007, OOMC obtained waivers of the minimum net income financial covenants from all of the warehouse facility providers. These waivers extend through various dates as discussed below. Two waivers are subject to OOMC having a specified amount of total warehouse capacity. If we do not obtain extensions of facilities and waivers that expire before July 31, 2007 or expand existing capacity, we would be in violation of this warehouse capacity requirement. OOMC will not meet this financial covenant at July 31, 2007. We have, however, obtained waivers from a sufficient number of warehouse providers to allow OOMC to continue to fund loans using its off balance sheet financing facilities. At our current origination levels, we estimate we would only need waivers for between $3.0 billion and $4.0 billion of available capacity at any given time. However, the sale of OOMC is subject to various closing conditions, including that OOMC maintain at least $8.0 billion of total capacity in its warehouse facilities throughout the period to the closing date (of which at least $2.0 billion is to be in the form of unused capacity at the closing date). If OOMC cannot obtain extensions or the waivers, warehouse facility providers would have the right to terminate their future funding obligations under the applicable warehouse facilities, terminate OOMCs right to service the loans remaining in the applicable warehouse or request funding of the 10% guarantee. This termination could adversely impact OOMCs ability to fund new loans and our ability to complete the OOMC sales transaction. See Item 8, note 20 to our consolidated financial statements. Waivers of the minimum net income financial covenant obtained by OOMC on April 27, 2007 expire as follows: (in 000s) Expiration Date Amount July 30, 2007 $ 2,250,000 July 31, 2007 1,500,000 October 2, 2007 1,000,000 October 31, 2007 2,002,000 January 15, 2008 500,000 April 25, 2008 2,000,000 During fiscal year 2007, we amended our warehouse facility with Citigroup Global Markets Realty Corp (Citigroup) to split OOMCs existing warehouse financing arrangement with Citigroup into two separate warehouse facilities, one of which is an on balance sheet facility with capacity of $500.0 million and the other an off balance sheet facility. Loans totaling $52.7 million were held on the on balance sheet line at April 30, 2007, with the related loans and liability reported in assets and liabilities held for sale. When we sell loans to the Trusts, we remove the mortgage loans from our balance sheet and record the gain or loss on the sale, cash proceeds, MSRs, repurchase reserves and a beneficial interest in Trusts, which represents our residual interest in the ultimate expected outcome from the disposition of the loans by the Trusts. Our beneficial interest in Trusts totaled $41.1 million and $188.0 million at April 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Subsequently, the Trusts, in response to the exercise of a put option by the third party beneficial interest holders, either sell the loans directly to third party investors or back to us to pool the loans for securitization. The decision of the beneficial interest holders to complete a loan sale or a securitization is dependent on market conditions. For fiscal year 2007, the final disposition of loans sold by the Trusts was 61% loan sales and 39% securitizations. For fiscal year 2006, the final disposition of loans sold by the Trusts was 77% loan sales and 23% securitizations. The higher percentage of loan sale transactions versus securitizations is due to more favorable pricing in the loan sale market and also results in cash being received earlier. Loans sold through whole loan transactions will generally include first payment to the investor provisions that, in the past, have not been included in securitization transactions. The overall value of the transaction is analyzed when determining the disposal strategy. The loan sale market has improved since April 30, 2007 and, as a result, we have committed to several whole loan sale transactions. If the Trusts sell the mortgage loans in a loan sale, we receive cash for our beneficial interest in Trusts, but continue to maintain repurchase reserves. In a securitization transaction, the Trusts transfer the loans and the corresponding right to receive all payments on the loans to our consolidated special purpose entity, after which we transfer our beneficial interest in Trusts and the loans to a securitization trust. The securitization trust meets the definition of a QSPE and is therefore not consolidated. The securitization trust issues bonds, which are supported by the cash flows from the pooled loans, to third party investors. We retain an interest in the loans in the form of a trading residual interest and, therefore, usually assume the first risk of loss for 43 Table of Contents credit losses in the loan pool. As the cash flows of the underlying loans and market conditions change, the value of our trading residual interests may also change, resulting in potential write ups or impairment of these residual interests. At the settlement of each securitization, we record cash received and our residual interests. Additionally, we reverse the beneficial interest in Trusts. The resulting residual interests are classified as trading securities. See Item 8, note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for our methodology used in valuing our residual interests. To accelerate the cash receipts from our residual interests, we securitize the majority of our trading residual interests in net interest margin (NIM) transactions. In a NIM transaction, the trading residual interests are transferred to another QSPE (NIM trust), which then issues bonds to third party investors. The proceeds from the bonds are returned to us as payment for the trading residual interests. The bonds are secured by these pooled residual interests and are obligations of the NIM trust. We retain a subordinated interest in the NIM trust, and receive cash flows on our residual interest generally after the NIM bonds issued to the third party investors are paid in full. At the settlement of each NIM transaction, we remove the trading residual interests sold from our consolidated balance sheet and record the cash received and the new residual interest retained. These new residual interests are classified as available for sale securities. AFS residual interests retained from NIM securitizations may also be sold in a subsequent securitization or sale transaction. In connection with the sale of mortgage loans, we provide certain representations and warranties allowing the purchaser the option of returning the purchased loans to us under certain conditions. We may recognize losses as a result of the repurchase of loans under these arrangements. We maintain reserves for the repurchase of loans based on historical trends. See Item 8, note 20 to our consolidated financial statements. COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUANCE We participate in the U.S. and Canadian commercial paper (CP) markets to meet daily cash needs. CP is issued by BFC and Block Canada, wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company. The following chart provides the debt ratings for BFC as of April 30, 2007: Short term Long term Outlook Fitch F1 A Stable Moodys P2 A3 Negative SP A2 BBB Negative DBRS R 1 (low) A Stable The following chart provides the debt ratings for Block Canada as of April 30, 2007: Short term Long term Outlook DBRS R 1 (low) A Stable We use capital primarily to fund working capital requirements, pay dividends, repurchase our shares and acquire businesses. Commercial paper borrowings peaked at $2.0 billion in January 2007 related to working capital needs and funding of our participation interests in IMALs. As of April 30, 2007, outstanding CP totaled $1.0 billion. No CP was outstanding at April 30, 2006. U.S. CP issuances are supported by $2.0 billion in unsecured committed lines of credit (CLOCs), which mature in August 2010 and have an annual facility fee of eight and one half basis points per annum. These lines are subject to various affirmative and negative covenants, including a minimum net worth covenant. In addition, the CLOCs require that we reduce the aggregate outstanding principal amount of short term debt, as defined in the agreement, to $200.0 million or less for a minimum period of thirty consecutive days during the period from March 1 to June 30 of each year (the Cleandown Requirement). We obtained a waiver of the Cleandown Requirement for 2007. See Item 8, note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. We entered into a $3.0 billion line of credit agreement with HSBC Finance Corporation effective January 2, 2007 for use as a funding source for the purchase of RAL participations. This line was secured by our RAL participations. All borrowings on this facility were repaid as of April 30, 2007 and the facility is now closed. We entered into a $300.0 million committed line of credit agreement with BNP Paribas for the period January 2 through February 23, 2007 to cover our peak liquidity needs. Both the HSBC and BNP Paribas lines were subject to various covenants that were similar to our primary unsecured CLOCs. This facility expired in February 2007. These facilities were undrawn at April 30, 2007. There are no rating contingencies under the CLOCs. The Canadian issuances are supported by a credit facility provided by one bank in an amount not to exceed $225.0 million (Canadian). The Canadian CLOC is subject to annual renewal in November 2007. This CLOC was undrawn at April 30, 2007. We believe the CP market to be stable. Risks to the stability of our CP market participation would be a short term rating 44 Table of Contents downgrade, adverse changes in our financial performance, non renewal or termination of the CLOCs, adverse publicity and operational risk. We believe if any of these events were to occur, the CLOCs, to the extent available, could be used for an orderly exit from the CP market, though at a higher cost to us. Additionally, we could turn to other sources of liquidity, including cash, debt issuance and asset sales or securitizations. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS A summary of our obligations to make future payments as of April 30, 2007 is as follows: (in 000s) Total Less Than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Commercial paper and other short term borrowings $ 1,567,082 $ 1,567,082 $ $ $ Customer deposits 1,129,263 1,052,409 613 279 75,962 Debt 502,236 104,000 398,236 Media advertising purchase obligation 37,749 20,589 17,160 Acquisition payments 13,964 8,907 4,148 818 91 Retirement obligation assumed 12,861 2,177 4,463 4,037 2,184 Capital lease obligation 12,911 397 1,032 1,091 10,391 Operating leases 870,225 256,555 377,484 158,405 77,781 Total contractual cash obligations $ 4,146,291 $ 2,908,116 $ 508,900 $ 164,630 $ 564,645 Short term borrowings are used to finance temporary liquidity needs and various financial activities. Our short term borrowings at April 30, 2007 totaled $1.6 billion, and consisted of $1.0 billion in commercial paper, $500.0 million drawn on a new credit facility and $75.0 million in FHLB advances. In April 2007, we obtained a $500.0 million credit facility to provide funding for the $500.0 million of 81/2% Senior Notes which were due April 16, 2007. This facility matures on December 20, 2007. In October 2004, we issued $400.0 million of 5.125% Senior Notes, due 2014. The Senior Notes are not redeemable by the bondholders prior to maturity. The net proceeds of this transaction were used to repay the $250.0 million in 63/4% Senior Notes, which were due November 1, 2004. The remaining proceeds were used for working capital, capital expenditures, repayment of other debt and other general corporate purposes. As of April 30, 2007, we had $850.0 million remaining under our shelf registration for additional debt issuances. On November 1, 2006 we entered into an agreement to purchase $57.2 million in media advertising between November 1, 2006 and June 30, 2009. During the current year, we purchased $19.4 million in advertising for our retail tax business, leaving a remaining commitment of $37.7 million at April 30, 2007. In connection with our acquisition of the non attest assets of MP in August 1999, we assumed certain retirement liabilities related to MPs partners. We make payments in varying amounts on a monthly basis, which are included in other noncurrent liabilities. Operating leases, although requiring future cash payments, are not included in our consolidated balance sheets. A summary of our commitments as of April 30, 2007, which may or may not require future payments, expire as follows: (in 000s) Total Less Than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Commitments to fund mortgage loans $ 2,374,938 $ 2,374,938 $ $ $ Franchise Equity Lines of Credit 79,628 25,553 31,316 22,489 270 Commitment to fund MP 75,000 75,000 Pledged securities 47,048 47,048 Contingent acquisition payments 19,891 5,486 6,330 8,075 Other commercial commitments 5,653 1,724 3,447 482 Total commercial commitments $ 2,602,158 $ 2,529,749 $ 41,093 $ 31,046 $ 270 See discussion of commitments in Item 8, note 18 to our consolidated financial statements. REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT In March 2006, the OTS approved the federal savings bank charter of HRB Bank. HRB Bank commenced operations on May 1, 2006, at which time HR Block, Inc. became a savings and loan holding company. As a savings and loan holding company, HR Block, Inc. is subject to regulation by the OTS. Federal savings banks are subject to extensive regulation and examination by the OTS, their primary federal regulator, as well as the FDIC. In conjunction with HR Block, Inc.s application with the OTS for HRB Bank, we made commitments as part of our charter approval order (Master Commitment) which included, but were not limited to: (1) a three percent minimum ratio of adjusted tangible capital to adjusted total assets, as defined by the OTS; (2) maintain all 45 Table of Contents HRB Bank capital within HRB Bank in accordance with the submitted three year business plan; and (3) follow federal regulations surrounding intercompany transactions and approvals. We fell below the three percent minimum ratio at April 30, 2007. Normal seasonal operating losses are also expected to cause us to be in non compliance until the end of fiscal year 2008. We notified the OTS of our failure to meet this requirement, and of our expectations for fiscal year 2008. We submitted a preliminary revised capital plan to the OTS that provides for us to regain compliance with the three percent minimum capital requirement by April 30, 2008. The preliminary revised capital plan contemplates that we will meet the minimum capital requirement primarily through earnings generated by our normal business operations in fiscal year 2008. On May 29, 2007, the OTS issued a Supervisory Directive, in which the OTS granted approval of our preliminary revised capital plan. Included in the Supervisory Directive were additional conditions that we will be required to meet in addition to the Master Commitment. The significant additional conditions included in the Supervisory Directive are as follows: (1) requires HRB Bank to extend its compliance with a minimum 12.0% leverage ratio through fiscal year 2012; (2) requires HR Block, Inc. to comply with the Master Commitment at all times, except as provided herein, and at no time may we have capital lower than projected in the preliminary revised capital plan for the period May 2007 through April 2009; (3) institutes reporting requirements to the OTS quarterly and monthly by the Board of Directors and management, respectively; and (4) requires HRB Banks Board of Directors to have an independent chairperson and at least the same number of outside directors as inside directors. We plan to submit our formal plan with approval from our Board of Directors to the OTS by July 31, 2007. The OTS is aware that the primary difference between our preliminary revised capital plan and the final plan to be submitted is the beginning capital levels as of April 30, 2007, as our fiscal year results were not final at the time the preliminary revised capital plan was submitted to the OTS, and they have indicated that the final plan submitted must meet the three percent requirement by April 30, 2008 to be approved. Failure to meet the conditions under our charter approval order and the Supervisory Directive could result in the OTS taking further regulatory actions, such as a supervisory agreement, cease and desist orders and civil monetary penalties. At this time, the financial impact, if any, of additional regulatory actions cannot be determined. If we are not in a position to cure deficiencies, a resulting failure could impair our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock, acquire businesses and pay dividends. Achievement of the capital plan depends on future events and circumstances, the outcome of which cannot be assured. Nevertheless, at this time we believe that we will meet all of the OTS provisions agreed to by July 31, 2007. See additional discussion related to this requirement in Item 1A, under Regulatory Environment Banking. All savings associations are subject to the capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. HRB Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of HRB Banks assets, liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. HRB Banks capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. See Item 8, note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of regulatory capital requirements and classifications. HRB Bank is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of HR Block, Inc. and its customer deposits are insured by the FDIC. If an insured institution fails, claims for administrative expenses of the receiver and for deposits in U.S. branches (including claims of the FDIC as subrogee of the failed institution) have priority over the claims of general unsecured creditors. In addition, the FDIC has authority to require HR Block, Inc. to reimburse it for losses it incurs in connection with the failure of HRB Bank or with the FDICs provision of assistance to a banking subsidiary that is in danger of failure. HRBFA is subject to regulatory requirements intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker dealers. HRBFA is required to maintain minimum net capital as defined under Rule 15c3 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and complies with the alternative capital requirement, which requires HRBFA to maintain net capital equal to the greater of $1.0 million or 2% of the combined aggregate debit balances arising from customer transactions. The net capital rule also provides that equity capital may not be withdrawn or cash dividends paid if resulting net capital would be less than the greater of 5% of combined aggregate debit items or 120% of the minimum required net capital. At the end of fiscal year 2007, HRBFAs net capital of $122.0 million, which was 27.8% of aggregate debit items, exceeded its minimum required net capital of $8.8 million by $113.2 million. During fiscal year 2007, HRBFA paid a dividend of $20.0 million to BFC, its direct corporate parent. HRBFA was in excess of the minimum net capital requirement during fiscal years 2007 and 2006. During 46 Table of Contents fiscal year 2006, we contributed additional capital of $5.0 million to HRBFA. The U.S., various state, local, provincial and foreign governments and some self regulatory organizations have enacted statutes and ordinances, and or adopted rules and regulations, regulating aspects of our business. These aspects include, but are not limited to, commercial income tax return preparers, income tax courses, the electronic filing of income tax returns, the facilitation of RALs, loan originations and assistance in loan originations, mortgage lending, privacy, consumer protection, franchising, sales methods, brokers, broker dealers and various aspects of securities transactions, financial planners, investment advisers, banking, accountants and the accounting practice. We seek to determine the applicability of such statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations (collectively, Laws) and comply with those Laws. From time to time in the ordinary course of business, we receive inquiries from governmental and self regulatory agencies regarding the applicability of Laws to our services and products. In response to past inquiries, we have agreed to comply with such Laws, convinced the authorities that such Laws were not applicable or that compliance already exists, and or modified our activities in the applicable jurisdiction to avoid the application of all or certain parts of such Laws. We believe that the past resolution of such inquiries and our ongoing compliance with Laws have not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. We cannot predict what effect future Laws, changes in interpretations of existing Laws, or the results of future regulator inquiries with respect to the applicability of Laws may have on our consolidated financial statements. See additional discussion of legal matters in Item 3, Legal Proceedings and Item 8, note 19 to our consolidated financial statements.

RECONCILIATION OF NON GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION We report our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, we believe certain non GAAP performance measures and ratios used in managing the business may provide additional meaningful comparisons between current year results and prior periods, by excluding certain items that do not represent results from our basic operations. Reconciliations to GAAP financial measures are provided below. These non GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, not as an alternative for, our reported GAAP results.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK GENERAL INTEREST RATE RISK We have a formal investment policy to help minimize the market risk exposure of our cash equivalents and AFS securities, which are primarily affected by credit quality and movements in interest rates. These guidelines focus on managing liquidity and preserving principal and earnings. Most of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities are managed at the subsidiary level. Our cash equivalents are primarily held for liquidity purposes and are comprised of high quality, short term investments, including qualified money market funds. As of April 30, 2007, our non restricted cash and cash equivalents had an average maturity of less than three months with an average credit quality of AAA. With such a short maturity, our portfolios market value is relatively insensitive to interest rate changes. We hold investments in fixed income securities at our captive insurance subsidiary. See the table below for sensitivities to changes in interest rates. See additional discussion of interest rate risk included below in Consumer Financial Services and Discontinued Operations. Our short term borrowings at April 30, 2007 totaled $1.6 billion, and consisted of $1.0 billion in commercial paper, $500.0 million drawn on a new credit facility and $75.0 million in FHLB advances. For fiscal year 2007, the average issuance 49 Table of Contents term of our commercial paper was 45 days and the average outstanding balance was $1.0 billion. As commercial paper and bank borrowings are generally seasonal, interest rate risk typically increases through our third fiscal quarter and declines to zero by fiscal year end. However, at April 30, 2007, $1.0 billion in commercial paper was outstanding due to working capital needs, primarily due to operating losses in our mortgage operations. In April 2007, we obtained a $500.0 million credit facility to provide funding for the $500.0 million of 81/2% Senior Notes which were due April 16, 2007. The facility, which was fully drawn at closing, matures on December 20, 2007. While the market value of short term borrowings is relatively insensitive to interest rate changes, interest expense on short term borrowings will increase and decrease with changes in the underlying short term interest rates. See Item 7, Financial Condition for additional information. Our long term debt at April 30, 2007 consists primarily of fixed rate Senior Notes; therefore, a change in interest rates would have no impact on consolidated pretax earnings. See Item 8, note 10 to our consolidated financial statements. EQUITY PRICE RISK We have exposure to the equity markets in several ways. The largest exposure, though relatively small, is through our deferred compensation plans. Within the deferred compensation plans we have mismatches in asset and liability amounts and investment choices (both fixed income and equity). At April 30, 2007 and 2006, the impact of a 10% market value change in the combined equity assets held by our deferred compensation plans and other equity investments would be approximately $12.5 million and $11.6 million, respectively, assuming no offset for the liabilities. TAX SERVICES FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE RISK Our operations in international markets are exposed to movements in currency exchange rates. The currencies involved are the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar. We translate revenues and expenses related to these operations at the average of exchange rates in effect during the period. Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing at the end of the year. Translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of other comprehensive income in stockholders equity. Translation of financial results into U.S. dollars does not presently materially affect, and has not historically materially affected, our consolidated financial results, although such changes do affect the year to year comparability of the operating results in U.S. dollars of our international businesses. We estimate a 10% change in foreign exchange rates by itself would impact consolidated pretax income in fiscal years 2007 and 2006 by approximately $2.5 million and $2.1 million, respectively, and cash balances at April 30, 2007 and 2006 by $5.9 million and $6.1 million, respectively. CONSUMER FINANCIAL SERVICES INTEREST RATE RISK BANKING At April 30, 2007, approximately 91% of HRB Banks total assets were residential mortgage loans, with 23% of these fixed rate and 77% adjustable rate. These loans are sensitive to changes in interest rates, as well as expected prepayment levels. As interest rates increase, fixed rate residential mortgages tend to exhibit lower prepayments. The opposite is true in a falling rate environment. When mortgage loans prepay, mortgage origination costs are written off. Depending on the timing of the prepayment, the write offs of mortgage origination costs may result in lower than anticipated yields. At April 30, 2007, HRB Banks other investments consisted primarily of mortgage backed securities and FHLB stock. See table below for sensitivity analysis of our mortgage backed securities. HRB Banks liabilities consist primarily of transactional deposit relationships, such as prepaid debit card accounts and checking accounts. Other liabilities include money market accounts, certificates of deposit, and collateralized borrowings from the FHLB. Money market accounts re price as interest rates change. Certificates of deposit re price over time, depending on maturities. FHLB advances generally have fixed rates ranging from one day through multiple years. Under criteria published by the OTS, HRB Banks overall interest rate risk exposure at April 30, 2007 was characterized as minimal. We actively manage our interest rate risk positions. As interest rates change, we will adjust our strategy and mix of assets and liabilities to optimize our position. INTEREST RATE RISK BROKER DEALER HRBFA holds interest bearing receivables from customers, brokers, dealers and clearing organizations, which consist primarily of amounts due on margin transactions and are generally short term in nature. We fund these short term assets with short term variable rate liabilities from customers, brokers and dealers, including stock loan activity. Although there may be differences in the timing of the re pricing related to these assets and liabilities, we believe we are not significantly exposed to interest rate risk in this area. As a result, any change in interest rates would not materially impact our consolidated earnings. Our fixed income trading portfolio is affected by changes in market rates and prices. The risk is the loss of income arising from adverse changes in the value of the trading portfolio. We value the trading portfolio at quoted market prices and the 50 Table of Contents market value of our trading portfolio at April 30, 2007 was approximately $11.0 million, net of $0.2 million in securities sold short. See table below for sensitivities to changes in interest rates. With respect to our fixed income securities portfolio, we manage our market price risk exposure by limiting concentration risk, maintaining minimum credit quality and limiting inventory to anticipated retail demand and current market conditions. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS INTEREST RATE RISK AND CREDIT SPREADS NON PRIME ORIGINATIONS Interest rate changes and credit spreads impact the value of the loans underlying our beneficial interest in Trusts, on our balance sheet or in our origination pipeline, as well as residual interests in securitizations and MSRs. As a result of loan sales to the Trusts, we remove the mortgage loans from our balance sheet and record the gain or loss on sale, cash proceeds, MSRs, repurchase reserves and a beneficial interest in Trusts, which represents our residual interest in the ultimate expected outcome from the disposition of the loans by the Trusts. See Item 7, Off Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements. At April 30, 2007, there were $1.5 billion of loans held in the Trusts and the value of our beneficial interest in Trusts was $41.1 million. At April 30, 2007, we had $222.8 million of mortgage loans held for sale on our balance sheet. Approximately half of these loans were repurchased from whole loan investors or the Trusts. Changes in interest rates and other market factors including credit spreads may result in a change in value of our beneficial interest in Trusts and mortgage loans held for sale. We are impacted by changes in the market impacting loan sale prices including interest rates, credit spreads and other factors. We are exposed to interest rate risk and credit spreads associated with commitments to fund approved loan applications of $2.4 billion, subject to conditions and loan contract verification. In addition, we have interest rate risk related to $169.9 million in new loan applications which have not yet been approved, and $425.0 million of applications which we expect to receive prior to our next anticipated change in rates charged to borrowers. Of these amounts, we estimate only $1.6 billion will likely be originated. We use forward loan sale commitments, interest rate swaps and put options on Eurodollar futures to reduce our interest rate risk associated with our commitment to fund non prime loans. In addition, forward loan sale commitments reduce our exposure to credit spreads. Changes in credit spread are derived from investor demand and competition for available funds. Investor demand can be impacted by sector performance and loan collateral performance. Sector performance factors include the stability of the industry and individual competitors. Uncertainty regarding the ability of the industry as a whole to meet repurchase obligations could impact credit spread demands by investors. Loan collateral performance or anticipated performance can be driven by actual performance of the collateral or by market related factors impacting the industry as a whole. Interest rate risk is managed through the use of forward loan sale commitments, interest rate swaps and put options on Eurodollar futures. Credit spread risk can be reduced using forward loan sale commitments. However, locking into these commitments eliminates the potential for price adjustments. Forward loan sale commitments represent our obligation to sell a non prime loan at a specific price in the future and increase in value as rates rise and decrease as rates fall. The Trusts may fulfill these obligations in response to the exercise of a put option by the third party beneficial interest holders. At April 30, 2007, we had no forward loan sale commitments. Forward loan sale commitments lock in the execution price on the loans that will be ultimately delivered into a loan sale. Interest rate swaps represent an agreement to exchange interest rate payments, whereby we pay a fixed rate and receive a floating rate. Put options on Eurodollar futures represent the right to sell a Eurodollar futures contract at a specified price in the future. These swap and put option contracts increase in value as rates rise and decrease in value as rates fall. At April 30, 2007, the interest rate swaps and put options provided interest risk coverage of $3.1 billion. At April 30, 2007, we recorded $10.8 million in assets and $37.1 million in liabilities on our balance sheet related to changes in fair value of interest rate swaps and put options, respectively. See table below for sensitivities to changes in interest rates. INTEREST RATE RISK PRIME ORIGINATIONS At April 30, 2007, we had commitments to fund prime mortgage loans totaling $66.4 million. We regularly enter into rate lock commitments with our customers to fund prime mortgage loans within specified periods of time. The fair value of rate lock commitments is calculated based on the current market pricing of short sales of FNMA, FHLMC and GNMA mortgage backed securities and the coupon rates of the eligible loans. At April 30, 2007, we recorded a liability with a fair value of $1.0 million related to rate lock commitments. We sell short FNMA, FHLMC and GNMA mortgage backed securities to reduce the risk related to our prime commitments to fund fixed rate prime loans. The position on certain, or all, of the fixed rate mortgage loans is closed approximately 10 15 days prior to standard Public Securities Association (PSA) 51 Table of Contents settlement dates. At April 30, 2007 we recorded an asset of $0.1 million related to these instruments. To finance our prime originations, we use a warehouse facility with capacity up to $25.0 million, which bears interest at one month LIBOR plus 140 to 200 basis points. As of April 30, 2007, the balance outstanding under this facility was $0.4 million. RESIDUAL INTERESTS Relative to modeled assumptions, an increase or decrease in interest rates would impact the value of our residual interests and could affect accretion income related to our residual interests. Residual interests bear the interest rate risk embedded within the securitization due to an initial fixed rate period on the loans versus a floating rate funding cost. Residual interests also bear the ongoing risk that the floating interest rate earned after the fixed period on the mortgage loans is different from the floating interest rate on the bonds sold in the securitization. We enter into interest rate caps and swaps to mitigate interest rate risk associated with mortgage loans that will be securitized and residual interests that are classified as trading securities because they will be sold in a subsequent NIM transaction. The caps and swaps enhance the marketability of the securitization and NIM transactions. An interest rate cap represents a right to receive cash if interest rates rise above a contractual strike rate, its value therefore increases as interest rates rise. The interest rate used in our interest rate caps and the floating rate used in swaps are based on LIBOR. At April 30, 2007 we had no assets or liabilities recorded related to interest rate caps. See table below for sensitivities to changes in interest rates for residual interests and swaps. See Item 8, note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for additional analysis of interest rate risk and other financial risks impacting residual interests. It is our policy to use derivative instruments only for the purpose of offsetting or reducing the risk of loss associated with a defined or quantified exposure. MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS Declining interest rates may cause increased refinancing activity, which reduces the life of the loans underlying the residual interests and MSRs, thereby generally reducing their fair value. The fair value of MSRs generally increases in a rising rate environment, although MSRs are recorded at the lower of cost or market value. Reductions in the fair value of these assets impact earnings through impairment charges based on individual risk stratas. See Item 7, Critical Accounting Policies and Item 8, note 20 to our consolidated financial statements for further sensitivity analysis of other MSR valuation assumptions. The sensitivities of certain financial instruments to changes in interest rates as of April 30, 2007 and 2006 are presented below. The following table represents hypothetical instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in interest rates and should not be relied on as an indicator of future expected results.
