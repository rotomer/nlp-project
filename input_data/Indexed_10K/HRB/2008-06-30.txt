ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our company has subsidiaries that provide tax, investment, retail banking and business services and products. We are the only major company offering a full range of software, online and in office tax preparation solutions, combined with personalized financial advice concerning retirement savings, home ownership and other opportunities to help clients build a better financial future. CORPORATE COST REDUCTION PROGRAM. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2008, we announced the implementation of a program we expect will reduce corporate staff and overhead expenses by approximately $110 million per year. As a result of this initiative, we recorded a pretax charge for severance related benefits of $19.5 million during fiscal year 2008. Of the total severance charge, $11.3 million was recorded in our corporate operations, while $3.1 million, $2.4 million and $2.7 million was recorded in our Tax Services, Business Services and Consumer Financial Services segments, respectively. We expect these actions will result in reduced compensation expense of approximately $50 million per year. In addition, we are seeking to eliminate approximately $60 million of non compensation overhead expenses such as consulting, marketing, travel and entertainment. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS RECENT DEVELOPMENTS. Effective November 2006, our Board of Directors approved a plan to exit the mortgage business operated through our subsidiary, OOMC, and we began reporting that business as discontinued operations. During our third fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2008, OOMC ceased all loan origination activities, and initiated a plan to sell its servicing operations. On April 30, 2008, OOMC sold its loan servicing assets to an affiliate of WL Ross pursuant to a previously announced agreement dated March 17, 2008. After repayment of debt outstanding under OOMCs servicing advance facility totaling $986.2 million, OOMC realized net cash proceeds of $212.5 million from WL Ross and $19.9 million previously held in escrow pursuant to the servicing advance facility, for a total of $232.4 million at closing. OOMC also retained a receivable relating to certain servicing assets of $117.4 million. During fiscal year 2007, we also committed to a plan to sell two smaller lines of business and completed the wind down of one other line of business, all of which were previously reported in our Business Services segment. The two businesses held for sale were sold during fiscal year 2008. Additionally, during fiscal year 2007, we completed the wind down of our tax operations in the United Kingdom, which were previously reported in Tax Services. At April 30, 2008, we met the criteria requiring us to present the related financial results of these businesses as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements. All periods presented reflect our discontinued operations. See Item 8, note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Tax preparation fees from our retail offices increased $200.0 million, or 10.5%, for fiscal year 2008. This increase is primarily due to an increase of 5.2% in the net average fee per U.S. client served, and a 3.5% increase in the number of U.S. clients served in company owned offices. Our international operations contributed $33.2 million to the increase, resulting from a 6.1% increase in clients served. Our fiscal year 2008 results benefited from the Stimulus Act, which provided tax rebates to certain low and middle income taxpayers. Under the Stimulus Act, eligible taxpayers were not required to apply for a rebate, but qualified automatically based on the filing of a 2007 Federal income tax return. As a result, we experienced a significant increase in volume due to taxpayers who were not otherwise required to file a return, but filed only to become eligible for a rebate. We offered lower fees to these taxpayers and, although this volume increased fiscal 2008 revenues, we do not believe it had a material impact to profitability during the year. Excluding estimated filings directly attributable to the Stimulus Act, U.S. clients served in company owned offices during fiscal year 2008 were 10.5 million at an average fee of $183.04. Tax preparation fees from Stimulus Act filers totaled $5.6 million and, exclusive of these fees, revenues from tax preparation services increased $194.4 million, or 10.3%, over fiscal year 2007. Other service revenue increased $62.2 million, or 20.6%, primarily due to $23.9 million in additional license fees earned from bank products and $16.2 million in additional revenues from our online tax preparation and e filing services. Additionally, this segment earned $15.1 million in additional customer fees based on an agreement with HRB Bank for our HR Block Emerald Prepaid MasterCard program, under which, this segment shares in the revenues and expenses associated with the program. Royalty revenue increased $17.9 million, or 8.1%, due to a 4.4% increase in clients served in franchise offices and a 2.5% increase in the net average fee. Excluding estimated filings directly attributable to the Stimulus Act, U.S. clients served in franchise offices during fiscal year 2008 were 5.6 million at an average fee of $157.11. Loan participation fees and related revenues decreased $19.8 million, or 9.4%, from the prior year. This decrease is primarily due to participation fees earned on IMALs in the prior year. IMALs were not offered during fiscal year 2008. This decrease was offset by an increase in other revenues related to the Emerald Advance. Other revenues increased $42.6 million, or 73.5%, primarily due to $24.1 million in fees earned in connection with the Emerald Advance loan program, also under a revenue and expense sharing agreement with HRB Bank. Additionally, $16.2 million of the increase is due to sales of commercial tax preparation software, TaxWorks, which was acquired in February 2007. 25 Table of Contents Total expenses increased $222.1 million, or 11.2%, compared to the prior year. Cost of services increased $117.4 million, or 7.9%, from the prior year. Compensation and benefits increased $63.9 million, or 7.7%, primarily as a result of a 6.5% increase in commission based wages resulting from a corresponding increase in tax returns prepared and net average charge. Occupancy expenses increased $29.4 million, or 8.5%, primarily as a result of higher rent expenses, due to a 2.8% increase in company owned offices under lease and a 3.4% increase in the average rent. Bad debt expense increased $17.0 million due to increased settlement product withholdings and increased delinquency rates. Other cost of services increased $14.1 million, or 7.4%, primarily due to additional corporate shared services for information technology and other projects and costs associated with the HR Block Emerald Prepaid MasterCard program, which this segment shares with HRB Bank. Cost of other revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $104.6 million, or 21.2%. This increase was primarily due to $58.1 million of incremental bad debt expense related to RALs and our new Emerald Advance program. Approximately $14.2 million of the increase in bad debt expense was due to the elimination of third party cross collect practices, whereby banks no longer collect amounts due from clients on our behalf, and an additional $12.0 million resulted from changes in IRS taxpayer fraud detection practices. The remaining increase is primarily due to an incremental $31.5 million in bad debt expense related to our new Emerald Advance loan program, which replaced last years IMAL. This increase is primarily due to the participation rate on IMALs, which was 26%, while Emerald Advances are funded by HRB Bank with nearly 100% participation by this segment in loans outstanding at April 30, 2008. We also saw increases of $23.3 million, $10.6 million and $9.8 million in corporate wages, amortization of intangibles and legal expenses, respectively. Pretax income for fiscal year 2008 increased $80.7 million, or 11.4%, from 2007. FISCAL 2007 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2006 Tax Services revenues increased $236.1 million, or 9.6%, compared to fiscal year 2006. We opened nearly 300 new company owned offices, 250 of which were part of the expansion of our retail distribution network. This expansion contributed incremental revenues of $22.3 million and pretax losses of $5.7 million in fiscal year 2007. Tax preparation fees from our retail offices increased $104.6 million, or 5.8%, for fiscal year 2007. This increase is primarily due to an increase of 5.9% in the net average fee per U.S. client served, while the number of U.S. clients served in company owned offices was essentially flat compared to fiscal year 2006. Our international operations contributed $9.6 million to the increase, resulting from a 4.5% increase in clients served. Other service revenue increased $96.5 million, or 47.1%, primarily due to $34.6 million in additional license fees earned from bank products, $25.9 million in additional revenues from our online tax preparation and e filing services and a $12.2 million increase in the recognition of deferred fee revenue from our POM guarantees. Additionally, this segment earned customer fees in connection with an agreement with HRB Bank for our new HR Block Emerald Prepaid MasterCard program, under which, this segment shares in the revenues and expenses associated with the program. Royalty revenue increased $12.4 million, or 6.0%, due to a 7.6% increase in the net average fee and a 1.7% increase in clients served in franchise offices. Loan participation fees and related revenues increased $32.2 million, or 18.1%, from fiscal year 2006. This increase is primarily due to the introduction of the IMAL, which increased our participation revenues $17.6 million. The remainder of the increase is primarily due to our new RAL participation agreement with HSBC. Other revenues decreased $9.7 million, or 14.3%, primarily due to a decline in revenues from supply sales to franchises, as our franchises now order directly from the supplier. Revenue from our digital business, which includes both service and product revenues, increased $29.2 million, or 21.9%, primarily due to a 19.4% increase in clients served. In fiscal year 2007, we implemented an aggressive plan to grow market share, although the required spending to achieve these results did impact our margin. Total expenses increased $121.0 million, or 6.5%, compared to fiscal year 2006. Cost of services increased $169.6 million, or 12.9%, from fiscal year 2006. Our real estate expansion efforts have contributed to a total increase of $28.0 million across all cost of services categories. Compensation and benefits increased $72.3 million, or 9.6%, primarily due to higher wages associated with increased revenues, costs associated with our earlier office openings and initiatives addressing operational readiness for the tax season. Occupancy expenses increased $30.3 million, or 9.6%, primarily as a result of higher rent expenses, due to a 5.9% increase in company owned offices under lease and a 3.9% increase in the average rent. Other cost of services increased $71.3 million, or 60.2%, primarily due to additional corporate shared services for 26 Table of Contents information technology and other projects, and costs associated with the HR Block Emerald Prepaid MasterCard program, which this segment shares with HRB Bank. Cost of other revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $21.7 million, or 4.6%, primarily due to increases of $30.9 million and $26.0 million in bad debt on loan participations and marketing expenses, respectively. The higher bad debt expense is primarily due to an $18.0 million favorable adjustment to RAL bad debt recorded in fiscal year 2006 and the addition of our IMAL product. These increases were partially offset by a $26.6 million reduction in corporate shared services and a $10.8 million decrease in legal expenses. In fiscal year 2006, we recorded $70.2 million, including legal fees, related to the settlement of RAL litigation. Pretax income for fiscal year 2007 increased $115.1 million, or 19.5%, from 2006, primarily due to higher revenues and the impact of the $70.2 million prior year RAL litigation charge. BUSINESS SERVICES This segment offers accounting, tax and business consulting services, wealth management and capital market services to middle market companies. The following discussion excludes the results of the three businesses reported in discontinued operations for all periods presented. Business Services Operating Statistics Year ended April 30, 2008 2007 2006 ACCOUNTING, TAX AND BUSINESS CONSULTING: Chargeable hours (000s) 4,971 5,075 4,357 Chargeable hours per person 1,423 1,373 1,385 Net billed rate per hour $ 147 $ 148 $ 141 Average margin per person $ 120,638 $ 118,415 $ 114,755 Business Services Operating Results (in 000s) Year ended April 30, 2008 2007 2006 Tax services $ 442,521 $ 408,857 $ 340,185 Business consulting 223,971 198,265 170,964 Accounting services 57,399 65,372 59,568 Capital markets 51,144 48,886 59,553 Leased employee revenue 25,100 83,244 72,436 Reimbursed expenses 18,654 13,436 20,346 Other 122,897 114,301 105,081 Total revenues 941,686 932,361 828,133 Compensation and benefits 507,275 511,257 457,050 Occupancy 74,841 68,859 55,883 Other 93,994 96,303 79,691 Cost of revenues 676,110 676,419 592,624 Amortization of intangible assets 14,439 15,521 16,165 Selling, general and administrative 162,340 182,760 148,683 Total expenses 852,889 874,700 757,472 Pretax income $ 88,797 $ 57,661 $ 70,661 FISCAL 2008 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2007 Business Services revenues for fiscal year 2008 increased $9.3 million, or 1.0%, over the prior year. Tax services revenues increased $33.7 million, or 8.2%, over the prior year. Business consulting revenues increased $25.7 million, or 13.0%, over the prior year. These increases resulted primarily from both an increase in the number of client service professionals as well as an improvement in productivity per professional. Capital markets revenues increased $2.3 million, primarily due to a $12.6 million increase in underwriting revenues due to a 37.4% increase in revenue per transaction. Valuation and seminar revenues declined $10.4 million due to a 70.3% decline in the number of business valuation projects as a result of the wind down of this service line. Leased employee revenue decreased primarily due to a change in organizational structure between the businesses we acquired from American Express Tax and Business Services, Inc. (AmexTBS) and the Attest Firms that, while not affiliates of our company, also serve our clients. Employees we previously leased to the 27 Table of Contents Attest Firms have now been transferred to the separate attest practices. As a result, we no longer record the revenues and expenses associated with leasing these employees, which resulted in a reduction of $58.1 million to current year revenues, and a similar reduction in compensation and benefits. Total expenses decreased $21.8 million, or 2.5%, for fiscal year 2008 compared to the prior year. Compensation and benefits decreased due to the change in organizational structure with AmexTBS as discussed above, which was almost entirely offset by additional compensation resulting from increases in the number of personnel and the average wage per employee. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $20.4 million, or 11.2%, primarily due to decreases of $12.4 million and $4.6 million in external consulting and legal fees, respectively. During fiscal year 2007, additional consulting fees were incurred related to our marketing initiatives, and additional legal expenses were incurred related to international acquisitions that were ultimately not completed. Pretax income for the year ended April 30, 2008 of $88.8 million compares to $57.7 million in the prior year. FISCAL 2007 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2006 Business Services revenues for fiscal year 2007 increased $104.2 million, or 12.6%, over fiscal year 2006. Accounting, tax and consulting revenues increased $101.8 million, or 17.8%, over fiscal year 2006. This increase resulted primarily from the acquisition of AmexTBS, which contributed $98.7 million in additional service revenues. Capital markets revenues declined $10.7 million. Valuation and seminar revenues declined $23.2 million due to a 59.2% decline in the number of business valuation projects. This decrease was partially offset by a $12.6 million increase in underwriting revenues due to a 28.6% increase in transactions and a 32.2% increase in revenue per transaction. Other revenues increased primarily due to revenues earned on wealth management services. Total expenses increased $117.2 million, or 15.5%, compared to fiscal year 2006. Compensation and benefits increased $54.2 million, or 11.9%, due to an increase in the number of personnel, primarily as a result of the AmexTBS acquisition and an increase in the average wage per employee. Occupancy expenses increased $13.0 million due to higher rent expense resulting from office locations added with the AmexTBS acquisition in fiscal year 2006. These offices only contributed seven months of expense in fiscal year 2006, compared to twelve months in fiscal year 2007. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $34.1 million, or 22.9%, due to seven months of expense from the AmexTBS acquisition in fiscal year 2006, compared to twelve months in fiscal year 2007. Additionally, we incurred $5.9 million of costs incurred related to international acquisitions that were not completed and additional costs associated with our business development initiatives. Pretax income for the year ended April 30, 2007 of $57.7 million compares to $70.7 million in fiscal year 2006. The decline was primarily due to off season losses of AmexTBS reported in fiscal year 2007, but not in 2006. CONSUMER FINANCIAL SERVICES This segment is engaged in offering brokerage services, along with investment planning and related financial advice through HRBFA and retail banking through HRB Bank. HRBFA offers traditional brokerage services, as well as annuities, insurance, fee based accounts, online account access, equity research and focus lists, model portfolios, asset allocation strategies, and other investment tools and information. HRB Bank offers traditional banking services including checking and savings accounts, lines of credit, individual retirement accounts, certificates of deposit and prepaid debit card accounts. HRB Bank operates through a single stand alone branch office and provides services primarily to clients of the Tax Services segment. HRBFA utilizes HRB Bank for certain FDIC insured deposits for its clients. HRB Bank offers the HR Block Prepaid Emerald MasterCard and Emerald Advance lines of credit through our Tax Services segment. HRB Bank also historically purchased loans from OOMC and HRBMC, in addition to prime loan purchases from third party sellers. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, HRB Bank stopped purchasing loans from OOMC and HRBMC, and does not intend to purchase mortgage loans from third parties for the foreseeable future. HRB Bank commenced operations May 1, 2006; therefore, segment results for fiscal year 2006 include only the operations of HRBFA and are not directly comparable to fiscal years 2008 and 2007. 28 Table of Contents Consumer Financial Services Operating Statistics Year ended April 30, 2008 2007 2006 Broker dealer: Traditional brokerage accounts (1) 373,905 386,902 418,162 New traditional brokerage accounts funded by tax clients 14,009 13,920 17,072 Cross service revenue as a percent of total production revenue (2) 18.5 % 16.3 % 16.1 % Average assets per traditional brokerage accounts $ 85,746 $ 85,518 $ 75,222 Average margin balances (millions) $ 378 $ 404 $ 539 Average customer payable balances (millions) $ 531 $ 613 $ 782 Number of advisors 984 918 958 Banking: Efficiency ratio (3) 53 % 37 % N/A Net interest margin (4) 5.54 % 2.77 % N/A Pretax return on average assets (5) 0.80 % 2.60 % N/A Total assets (thousands) $ 1,078 $ 1,501 N/A Mortgage loans held for investment: Delinquency rate 11.71 % 3.86 % N/A Loans purchased from affiliates (thousands): Purchased from affiliates $ 56,341 $ 1,192,734 N/A Repurchased by affiliates (193,648 ) (11,236 ) N/A $ (137,307 ) $ 1,181,498 N/A (1) Includes only accounts with a positive balance.

FISCAL 2008 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2007 Consumer Financial Services revenues, net of interest expense and provision for loan loss reserves, for fiscal year 2008 increased $24.3 million, or 7.2%, over the prior year. The increase was due to increases at HRB Bank of $13.5 million and HRBFA of $10.8 million. Financial advisor production revenue was up $20.2 million, or 10.1%, from the prior year primarily due to higher annualized production per advisor driven by an increase in fee based account revenue and annuity transactions. The following table summarizes the key drivers of production revenue: Year ended April 30, 2008 2007 Client trades 969,364 907,075 Average revenue per trade $ 120.22 $ 126.54 Ending balance of assets under administration (billions) $ 32.1 $ 33.1 Annualized productivity per advisor $ 233,000 $ 216,000 Other service revenues increased $20.6 million, primarily due to increases in fees received in connection with the HR Block Prepaid Emerald MasterCard program of $19.2 million. Net interest income on margin lending activities declined $10.0 million, or 19.1%, due to declining interest rates and balances. In fiscal year 2008, the Federal Funds rate was reduced by a total of 325 basis points. As this rate is reduced, we reduce the rates on margin and other asset balances, and therefore, net interest income is reduced. We expect the impact of the current year rate reductions on fiscal year 2009 full year results to be a reduction in net interest income of approximately $14 million. In addition to the decline of interest income from margin lending activities, we also expect to see a year over year decline in interest earned on sweep accounts of approximately $8 million. Net interest income on banking activities increased $30.4 million from the prior year due to interest income received on our new Emerald Advance loan products and an increase in average mortgage loans held for investment, partially offset by an increase in average deposits. The following table summarizes the key drivers of net interest revenue on banking activities: (dollars in 000s) Average Balance Average Rate Earned (Paid) Year ended April 30, 2008 2007 2008 2007 Mortgage loans held for investment $ 1,169,644 $ 746,387 6.40 % 6.80 % Emerald Advance lines of credit 63,743 36.00 % % Other investments 196,262 117,350 3.64 % 5.25 % Deposits 1,094,161 700,707 (3.92 %) (4.59 %) Although the interest rate target on Federal Funds decreased during the third quarter, the impact to HRB Banks net interest margin was minimal. On an annualized basis, the rate decrease should have a positive impact to net interest margin, although we expect our average deposits to decline in fiscal year 2009. 30 Table of Contents Detail of our mortgage loans held for investment and the related allowance at April 30, 2008 and 2007 is as follows: (dollars in 000s) Year ended April 30, 2008 2007 Outstanding Loan Loss %30 Days Outstanding Loan Loss %30 Days Principal Balance Allowance Past Due Principal Balance Allowance Past Due Purchased from OOMC and affiliates $ 734,658 $ 44,180 16.30 % $ 1,010,028 $ 3,341 4.70 % Purchased from third parties 269,982 1,221 1.90 % 340,864 107 0.50 % Total mortgage loans held for investment $ 1,004,640 $ 45,401 11.71 % $ 1,350,892 $ 3,448 3.86 % We recorded a provision for loan losses on our mortgage loans held for investment of $42.0 million during the current year, compared to $3.6 million in the prior year. Our loan loss provision increased significantly during the current year as a result of declining collateral values due to declining residential home prices, and increasing delinquencies occurring in our portfolio. Our loan loss reserve as a percent of mortgage loans was 4.49%, or $45.4 million, at April 30, 2008, compared to 0.25%, or $3.4 million, at April 30, 2007. Mortgage loans held for investment includes loans originated by OOMC and affiliates and purchased by HRB Bank. Those loans have experienced higher rates of delinquency than other loans in our portfolio and expose us to a higher risk of potential credit loss. Residential real estate markets are experiencing significant declines in property values and mortgage default rates are increasing. If adverse market trends continue, including trends within our portfolio specifically, we may be required to record additional loan loss provisions, and those losses may be significant. Total expenses rose $34.0 million, or 10.6%, from the prior year. Compensation and benefits increased $23.3 million, or 17.1%, primarily due to higher commission and bonus payouts resulting from improved production revenue and a higher number of recently recruited advisors. Other cost of services increased $9.3 million, or 33.8%, primarily due to additional expenses associated with the HR Block Prepaid Emerald MasterCard program. Amortization of intangible assets decreased $15.3 million, or 41.7%, as the related intangible assets were fully amortized in November 2007. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $16.1 million, or 17.3%, primarily due to expenses associated with the Emerald Advance lines of credit, coupled with gains on the disposition of certain assets recorded in the prior year. Pretax income for fiscal year 2008 was $10.1 million compared to prior year income of $19.8 million. FISCAL 2007 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2006 Consumer Financial Services revenues, net of interest expense and provision for loan losses, for fiscal year 2007 increased $58.3 million, or 20.7%, over fiscal year 2006, primarily as a result of HRB Bank, which commenced operations May 1, 2006 and contributed $38.3 million. HRBFA revenues increased $20.0 million over fiscal year 2006. Financial advisor production revenue, which consists primarily of fees earned on assets under administration and commissions on customer trades, increased $9.2 million, or 4.8%, over fiscal year 2006 due primarily to higher annuitized revenues. The following table summarizes the key drivers of production revenue: Year ended April 30, 2007 2006 Client trades 907,075 974,625 Average revenue per trade $ 126.54 $ 119.11 Ending balance of assets under administration (billions) $ 33.1 $ 31.8 Annualized productivity per advisor $ 216,000 $ 194,000 Other service revenues increased $36.4 million due to revenues earned from our HR Block Prepaid Emerald MasterCard program, coupled with positive sweep account rate variances and higher underwriting fees. 31 Table of Contents Net interest income on banking activities totaled $24.0 million for fiscal year 2007. The following table summarizes the key drivers of net interest income on banking activities for fiscal year 2007: (dollars in 000s) Average Balance Average Rate Earned (Paid) Mortgage loans held for investment $ 746,387 6.80 % Other investments $ 117,350 5.25 % Deposits $ 700,707 (4.59 )% Total expenses increased $5.7 million, or 1.8%. Cost of services increased $7.1 million, or 3.8%, primarily due to the expenses of HRB Bank, which opened May 1, 2006. Pretax income for Consumer Financial Services for fiscal year 2007 was $19.8 million compared to the fiscal year 2006 loss of $32.8 million. HRB Bank contributed pretax earnings of $23.1 million in fiscal year 2007, while HRBFA improved its pretax loss to $3.3 million compared to $32.8 million in fiscal year 2006. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Discontinued operations includes OOMC and its subsidiary, HRBMC, mortgage businesses historically engaged in the origination and acquisition of non prime and prime mortgage loans, the sale and securitization of mortgage loans and residual interests, and the servicing of non prime loans. Also included are the results of three smaller lines of business previously reported in our Business Services segment. Our tax operations in the United Kingdom previously reported in our Tax Services segment were included in fiscal years 2007 and 2006. Operating results presented below are net of eliminations of intercompany activities. On April 30, 2008, OOMC sold its loan servicing assets to an affiliate of WL Ross pursuant to a previously announced agreement dated March 17, 2008. At January 31, 2008 we had an impairment relating to the estimated loss upon disposition of OOMC equal to $304.9 million, including $193.4 million recorded in fiscal year 2007. OOMC incurred an actual loss upon sale of the servicing assets of $233.3 million. Impairments were reversed in the fourth quarter, resulting in net impairments for fiscal year 2008 totaling $39.9 million. As OOMC is a wholly owned subsidiary, earnings and losses recognized at OOMC are reflected in our consolidated financial statements. See additional discussion in Item 8, note 19. The sale is subject to certain post closing adjustments.

In January 2008, OOMC funded its last loan. On April 30, 2008, OOMC sold its loan servicing activities. The pretax loss of $1.2 billion for fiscal year 2008 includes losses of $15.0 million from our Business Services discontinued operations, with the remainder from OOMCs mortgage business. As discussed more fully below, mortgage results include $582.4 million in loss provisions and repurchase reserves, impairments of residual interests of $137.8 million, and restructuring charges of $119.2 million, including costs to cease origination activities. During the first eight months of fiscal year 2008, concerns about credit quality in the non prime mortgage industry resulted in lower demand for non prime loans and a higher yield requirement by investors that purchase the loans. As a result, mortgage loans originated during this period were valued at less than par by the time they were sold in the secondary market. Loans sales from January to April 2008 consisted primarily of loans repurchased due to contractual obligations. OOMC recorded total loss provisions relating to the repurchase and disposition of loans previously sold or securitized of $582.4 million during the current year compared to $388.7 million in the prior year. OOMC repurchased mortgage loans totaling $515.4 million and $990.0 million during fiscal years 2008 and 2007, respectively. In addition, during fiscal year 2008 OOMC experienced a higher severity of losses on repurchased loans. Based on historical experience, OOMC assumed an average 62% loss severity at April 30, 2008, compared to 26% at April 30, 2007. Given that loan originations ceased in January 2008, and that obligations under early payment default provisions only relate to defaults involving the first monthly payment due to the purchaser, OOMCs continuing risk of loss related to first payment defaults has diminished. However, repurchase obligations relating to representation and warranty breaches are not subject to a stated term and, therefore, may continue for the foreseeable future. OOMC recorded loss provisions totaling $202.9 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008, resulting in a liability as of April 30, 2008 of $243.1 million relating to estimated potential losses arising from future claims of representation and warranty breaches. To the extent that valid claim volumes in the future exceed current estimates, or the value of mortgage loans and residential home prices decline further, future losses may be greater than amounts currently provided and those differences may be significant. See additional discussion of OOMCs mortgage loan repurchase obligation in Critical Accounting Policies and in Item 8, note 17 to our consolidated financial statements. During the current year, the disruption in the secondary market also impacted OOMCs residual interests. OOMC recorded impairments of residual interests of $137.8 million due to higher expected credit losses resulting from the decline in performance of the underlying collateral and an increase in the discount rate assumption. As of April 30, 2008, substantially all residual interests from originations prior to January 33 Table of Contents 2007 were written down to zero value. Residual interests at April 30, 2008 have a current carrying value of $16.7 million. Loan servicing revenues decreased $79.5 million, or 18.3%, compared to the prior year. The decrease reflects a decline in the average servicing portfolio throughout the year, which decreased 15.9%, to $60.0 billion. The decline in the average servicing portfolio is the result of a decline in the subservicing portfolio, coupled with significantly lower origination volumes, due to our decision to exit the origination business. OOMC sold its servicing portfolio as of April 30, 2008. Total expenses for fiscal year 2008 decreased $554.9 million, or 42.4%, from the prior year. Cost of services decreased $112.7 million primarily due to lower amortization of mortgage servicing rights (MSRs). Cost of other revenues decreased $91.7 million, primarily due to the termination of origination activities. As a result, compensation and benefits declined due to lower staffing levels, although this reduction was partially offset by increased interest expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses were flat compared to the prior year, as restructuring and termination activities recorded in the current year were offset by lower operating expenses resulting from prior year restructuring activities. The loss from discontinued operations for the current year of $763.1 million is net of tax benefits of $412.8 million, and primarily includes income tax benefits related to OOMC. FISCAL 2007 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2006 Conditions in the non prime mortgage industry were challenging throughout fiscal year 2007, and particularly in our fourth quarter. OOMCs mortgage operations, as well as the entire industry, were impacted by deteriorating conditions in the secondary market, where reduced investor demand for loan purchases, higher investor yield requirements and increased estimates for future losses reduced the value of non prime loans. Under these conditions, non prime originators generally reported significant increases in losses and many were unable to meet their financial obligations. The pretax loss for fiscal year 2007 was $1.2 billion compared to income of $316.9 million in fiscal year 2006. The pretax loss of $1.2 billion includes losses of $50.2 million from our Business Services and Tax Services discontinued operations, with the remainder from our mortgage business. Mortgage results include $388.7 million in loss provisions and repurchase reserves, impairments of residual interests of $168.9 million and impairments of other assets totaling $345.8 million. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES We consider the policies discussed below to be critical to understanding our financial statements, as they require the use of significant judgment and estimation in order to measure, at a specific point in time, matters that are inherently uncertain. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs. For all of these policies, we caution that future events rarely develop precisely as forecasted and estimates routinely require adjustment and may require material adjustment. VALUATION OF MORTGAGE LOANS HELD FOR INVESTMENT We record an allowance representing our estimate of credit losses inherent in the portfolio of loans held for investment by HRB Bank at the balance sheet date. The majority of this estimated credit loss is evaluated for mortgage loans on a pooled basis. We stratify the loan portfolio based on our view of risk associated with various elements of the pool and assign estimated loss rates based on those risks. Loss rates are based primarily on historical experience and our assessment of economic and market conditions. We review non performing loans, including loans meeting the definition of troubled debt restructurings, individually and record loss estimates typically based on the value of the underlying collateral. Because of imprecision and uncertainty inherent in developing estimates of future credit losses, in particular during periods of rapidly declining collateral values or increasing delinquency rates, our estimation process during fiscal year 2008 included development of ranges of possible outcomes. Ranges were developed by stressing initial estimates of both the rate at which loans in HRB Banks portfolio will become delinquent (frequency) and the amount of loss HRB Bank will ultimately realize upon occurrence of a liquidation of collateral (severity). Stressing of frequency and severity assumptions is intended to model deterioration in credit quality that is difficult to predict during declining economic conditions. Future deterioration in credit quality may exceed our modeled assumptions. The loan loss reserve as a percent of mortgage loans held for investment was 4.49% at April 30, 2008, compared to 0.25% at April 30, 2007. The loan loss provision increased significantly during the current year as a result of declining collateral values due to lower residential home prices, increasing delinquencies occurring in our portfolio during fiscal year 2008, and modeled expectations for future deterioration in the portfolio. The residential mortgage industry has experienced significant adverse trends for an extended 34 Table of Contents period. If adverse trends continue for a sustained period or at rates worse than modeled by us, HRB Bank may be required to record additional loan loss provisions, and those losses may be significant. Determining the allowance for credit losses for loans held for investment requires us to make estimates of losses that are highly uncertain and requires a high degree of judgment. If our underlying assumptions prove to be inaccurate, the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses. If our estimates understate probable losses inherent in the portfolio, this would result in additional expense. An additional 10% adverse change in our assumptions related to frequency and severity would result in additional losses of $2.7 million and $2.4 million, respectively. MORTGAGE LOAN REPURCHASE OBLIGATION OOMC records a liability relating to potential losses that could be incurred upon fulfillment of its obligation to repurchase previously sold loans in connection with early payment defaults or breaches of other representations and warranties. Mortgage loans OOMC originated were generally sold in the secondary market in the form of a whole loan sale or mortgage backed security. In whole loan sale transactions, OOMC generally guarantees the first payment to the purchaser. If this payment is not collected, it is referred to as an early payment default. In the event of an early payment default, purchasers of OOMCs loans have the right to require that OOMC repurchase the loan. OOMC has incurred significant losses historically in connection with early payment default obligations, in particular during fiscal year 2007 and the first three quarters of the fiscal year 2008. Given that loan originations ceased in January 2008, we do not expect continuing risk of loss related to first payment defaults. Accordingly, OOMC has no liability recorded at April 30, 2008 relating to early payment defaults. OOMC is also obligated to repurchase loans sold or securitized in the event of a breach of representations and warranties it made to purchasers or insurers of such loans, or otherwise indemnify certain third parties for losses incurred by them. OOMC records a liability for contingent losses relating to representation and warranty claims by estimating loan repurchase volumes and indemnification obligations for both known claims and projections of expected future claims. Projections of future claims are based on an analysis that includes a combination of reviewing historical repurchase trends, developing loss expectations on loans sold or securitized, and predicting the level at which previously originated loans may be subject to valid claims regarding representation and warranty breaches. For loans actually repurchased, OOMC incurs losses for the difference between the principal amount of the loan (together with accrued interest) and the value realized upon resale of the loan or liquidation of the property securing the loan. OOMC typically estimates the amount of future loss based on current market values of loans OOMC recently sold or received bids for. The loss severity assumption increased during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008, from 50% to 62%. Based on an analysis as of April 30, 2008, OOMC estimated its liability for loan repurchase and indemnification obligations pertaining to claims of breach of representation and warranties to be $243.1 million. To the extent that valid claim volumes in the future exceed current estimates, or the value of mortgage loans and residential home prices decline, future losses may be greater than these estimates and those differences may be significant. See Item 8, note 17 to our consolidated financial statements. LITIGATION It is our policy to routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes related to legal matters, as well as ranges of probable losses. Assessing the likely outcome of pending litigation, including the amount of potential loss, if any, is highly subjective. Our estimates may differ from actual results due to difficulties in predicting the outcome of jury trial, arbitration hearings, settlement discussions and related activity, predicting the outcome of class certification actions and various other uncertainties. A determination of the amount of the reserves required, if any, for these contingencies is made after thoughtful analysis of each known issue and an analysis of historical experience in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, and related pronouncements. Therefore, we have recorded reserves related to certain legal matters for which we believe it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the range of such loss can be estimated. With respect to other matters, we have concluded that a loss is only reasonably possible or remote, or is not estimable and, therefore, no liability is recorded. VALUATION OF GOODWILL We test goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change which would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. Our goodwill impairment analysis is based on a discounted cash flow approach, and market comparables when available. This analysis, at the reporting 35 Table of Contents unit level, requires significant management judgment with respect to revenue and expense forecasts, anticipated changes in working capital and the selection and application of an appropriate discount rate. Changes in projections or assumptions could materially affect our estimate of reporting unit fair values. The use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted future operating cash flows and could affect our conclusions regarding the existence or amount of potential impairment. Finally, strategic changes in our outlook regarding reporting units or intangible assets may alter our valuation approach and could result in changes to our conclusions regarding impairment. The goodwill balance in our continuing operations was $1.0 billion as of April 30, 2008, and $993.9 million as of April 30, 2007. During fiscal year 2008, we recorded $5.7 million of goodwill impairments within our Tax Services segment. There were no goodwill impairments in our continuing operations during fiscal years 2007 or 2006. In fiscal year 2007, we recorded $154.9 million in goodwill impairments related to the sale or wind down of businesses reported as discontinued operations. INCOME TAXES We account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, as further interpreted by FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. We calculate our current and deferred tax provision for the fiscal year based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the applicable calendar year. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded in the appropriate periods when identified. We file a consolidated federal tax return on a calendar year basis, generally in the second fiscal quarter of the subsequent year. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Our gross deferred tax asset at April 30, 2008 was $523.8 million and was reduced by a valuation allowance totaling $36.9 million. We have considered taxable income in carry back periods, historical and forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. In the event we were to determine we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination. Likewise, if we later determine it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance. The income tax laws of jurisdictions in which we operate are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and applicable government taxing authorities. Income tax returns filed by us are based on our interpretation of these rules. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which may result in proposed assessments, including assessments of interest and or penalties. Our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly subjective and based on our best judgments. We believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters. However, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved, or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire. As a result, our effective tax rate may fluctuate on a quarterly basis. Net unrecognized tax benefits that would impact our effective tax rate totaled $119.6 million at April 30, 2008. REVENUE RECOGNITION We have many different revenue sources, each governed by specific revenue recognition policies. Our revenue recognition policies can be found in Item 8, note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. OTHER SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Other significant accounting policies, not involving the same level of judgment or uncertainty as those discussed above are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements. These policies may require judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance. Certain of these matters are among topics currently under reexamination by accounting standard setters and regulators. Although specific conclusions reached by these standard setters may cause a material change in our accounting policies, outcomes cannot be predicted with confidence. Also see Item 8, note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, which discusses accounting policies we have selected when there are acceptable alternatives, and new or proposed accounting standards that may affect our financial reporting in the future. 36 Table of Contents FINANCIAL CONDITION CAPITAL RESOURCES LIQUIDITY Our sources of capital include cash from operations, issuances of common stock and debt. We use capital primarily to fund working capital, pay dividends, repurchase treasury shares and acquire businesses. Given the likely availability of a number of liquidity options, we believe, that in the absence of any unexpected developments, our existing sources of capital at April 30, 2008 are sufficient to meet our operating needs. CASH FROM OPERATIONS Cash provided by operations totaled $215.8 million for fiscal year 2008, compared to cash used in operations of $584.7 million in 2007 and cash provided of $594.1 million in 2006. Operating cash flows in fiscal year 2008 increased from fiscal year 2007 primarily due to lower net losses and lower income tax payments. We received net refunds of income tax payments of $238.8 million in the current year, compared to income tax payments made of $405.4 million in fiscal year 2007. ISSUANCES OF COMMON STOCK We issue shares of our common stock in accordance with our stock based compensation plans out of our treasury shares. Proceeds from the exercise of stock options totaled $23.3 million, $25.7 million and $98.5 million in fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. DEBT In April 2007, we obtained a $500.0 million credit facility to provide funding for the $500.0 million of 81/2% Senior Notes which were due April 16, 2007. This facility was amended on December 20, 2007 to extend the term of the facility. Under the amended facility, $250.0 million matured on February 29, 2008 and $250.0 million matured on April 30, 2008. At April 30, 2008 there was no outstanding balance under this facility, as the facility was repaid in full in February 2008, primarily from the proceeds of Senior Notes as discussed below. On January 11, 2008, we issued $600.0 million of 7.875% Senior Notes under our shelf registration. The Senior Notes are due January 15, 2013, and are not redeemable by the bondholders prior to maturity. The net proceeds of this transaction were used to repay the $500.0 million facility discussed above, with the remaining proceeds used for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of April 30, 2008, we had $250.0 million remaining under our shelf registration for additional debt issuances. We had no commercial paper outstanding at April 30, 2008, compared to $1.0 billion at April 30, 2007. During fiscal year 2008, we borrowed under our CLOCs as an alternative to commercial paper issuance to support off season working capital requirements primarily in our Tax Services and Business Services segments and operating losses from our mortgage businesses. We had no balance outstanding under our CLOCs at April 30, 2008. However, we do expect to borrow on the CLOCs during fiscal year 2009 to fund our off season working capital requirements. See additional discussion in Borrowings and note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. We entered into a committed line of credit agreement with HSBC Finance Corporation effective January 10, 2008 for use as a funding source for the purchase of RAL participations. This line provides funding totaling $3.0 billion through March 30, 2008 and $120.0 million thereafter through June 30, 2008. This line is subject to various covenants that are similar to our CLOCs, and is secured by our RAL participations. All borrowings on this facility were repaid as of April 30, 2008, and the facility is now closed. DIVIDENDS We have consistently paid quarterly dividends. Dividends paid totaled $183.6 million, $172.0 million and $160.0 million in fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Our Board of Directors approved an increase of the quarterly cash dividend from 14.25 cents to 15 cents per share, a 5.3% increase, effective with the quarterly dividend payment on October 1, 2008. SHARE REPURCHASES On June 7, 2006, our Board approved an authorization to repurchase 20.0 million shares. On June 9, 2004, our Board of Directors approved an authorization to repurchase 15 million shares. There were 22.4 million shares remaining under these authorizations at the end of fiscal year 2008. We did not repurchase shares during fiscal year 2008. During fiscal year 2007, we repurchased 8.1 million shares at an aggregate price of $180.9 million or an average price of $22.22 per share. In June 2008, our Board of Directors rescinded the previous authorizations to repurchase shares of our common stock, and approved an authorization to purchase up to $2.0 billion of our common stock over the next four years. ACQUISITIONS Total cash paid for acquisitions was $24.9 million, $57.6 million and $210.1 million during fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. RESTRICTED CASH We hold certain cash balances that are restricted as to use. Cash and cash equivalents restricted totaled $219.0 million at fiscal year end. HRBFA held $212.0 million of this total segregated in a special reserve account for the exclusive benefit of customers pursuant to Rule 15c3 3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 37 Table of Contents SEGMENT CASH FLOWS A condensed consolidating statement of cash flows by segment for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2008, follows. Generally, interest is not charged on intercompany activities between segments. Our consolidated statements of cash flows are located in Item 8. (in 000s) Consumer Tax Business Financial Discontinued Consolidated Services Services Services Corporate (1) Operations HR Block Cash provided by (used in): Operations $ 591,271 $ 133,169 $ 82,762 $ 30,680 $ (622,095 ) $ 215,787 Investing (53,924 ) (31,766 ) 217,753 (31,970 ) 1,047,196 1,147,289 Financing (28,588 ) (15,867 ) (404,889 ) (1,054,837 ) (53,888 ) (1,558,069 ) Net intercompany (469,152 ) (96,459 ) 15,462 921,362 (371,213 ) (1) Income tax payments, net of refunds of $317.8 million received during fiscal year 2008, are included in Corporate. TAX SERVICES Tax Services has historically been our largest provider of annual operating cash flows. The seasonal nature of Tax Services generally results in a large positive operating cash flow in the fourth quarter. Tax Services generated $591.3 million in operating cash flows primarily related to net income, as cash is generally collected from clients at the time services are rendered. Cash used in investing activities of $53.9 million was for capital expenditures and business acquisitions. Our international operations have historically been self funded. However, HR Block Canada, Inc. (Block Canada) utilized intercompany borrowings to fund its CashBack program and working capital requirements in the current year. Block Canada previously used commercial paper borrowings to fund this program. Cash balances are held in Canada and Australia independently in local currencies. BUSINESS SERVICES Business Services funding requirements are largely related to receivables for completed work and work in process and funding relating to acquired businesses. We have provided funding in the normal course of business sufficient to cover these working capital needs. Business Services also has future obligations and commitments, which are summarized in Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments. This segment generated $133.2 million in operating cash flows primarily related to net income. Additionally, Business Services used $31.8 million in investing activities primarily related to capital expenditures and $15.9 million in financing activities because of payments on acquisition debt. CONSUMER FINANCIAL SERVICES In fiscal year 2008, Consumer Financial Services provided $217.8 million in investing activities primarily due to principal payments received on mortgage loans held for investment. Cash used in financing activities of $404.9 million is primarily due to customer deposits. To manage short term liquidity, Block Financial LLC (BFC) provides HRBFA a $250.0 million unsecured credit facility. At the end of fiscal year 2008, there was no outstanding balance on this facility. HRBFA has two lines of credit with an unaffiliated financial institution with a total credit limit of $51.0 million. There was no outstanding balance on these lines at April 30, 2008 or 2007, and there were no borrowings on these lines of credit during fiscal years 2008 or 2007. Liquidity needs relating to client trading and margin borrowing activities are met primarily through cash balances in client brokerage accounts and working capital. Stock loans have historically been used as a secondary source of funding and could be used in the future, if warranted. Securities borrowed and securities loaned transactions are generally reported as collateralized financings. These transactions require us to deposit cash and or collateral with the counterparty. Securities loaned consist of securities customers purchased on margin. We receive cash collateral approximately equal to the value of the securities loaned. The amount of cash collateral is adjusted, as required, for market fluctuations in the value of the securities loaned. Interest rates paid on the cash collateral fluctuate as short term interest rates change. To satisfy the margin deposit requirement of client option transactions with the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), HRBFA pledges customers margined securities. Pledged securities at the end of fiscal year 2008 totaled $47.2 million, an excess of $9.6 million over the margin requirement. Pledged securities at the end of fiscal year 2007 totaled $47.0 million, an excess of $11.5 million over the margin requirement. During fiscal year 2008, HRBFA paid dividends of $63.6 million to BFC, its direct corporate parent. HRB Banks current liquidity needs are generally met through deposits from banking clients. HRB Bank has access to traditional funding sources such as deposits, federal funds purchased and repurchase 38 Table of Contents agreements. HRB Bank maintains a credit facility with the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB). At April 30, 2008, $129.0 million was drawn under this facility. BFC made an additional capital contribution to HRB Bank of $107.1 million during fiscal year 2008. This contribution was provided for HRB Bank to meet its capital requirements due to seasonal fluctuations in the size of its balance sheet. Also during fiscal year 2008, we submitted an application to the OTS requesting that HRB Bank be allowed to pay dividends to BFC in an amount that will not exceed the capital necessary to continuously maintain HRB Banks required 12.0% leverage ratio. The OTS approved our application on February 29, 2008. HRB Bank paid a dividend of $150.0 million to BFC in April 2008. See additional discussion of regulatory and capital requirements of HRB Bank and HRBFA in Regulatory Environment. We believe the funding sources for Consumer Financial Services are stable. Liquidity risk within this segment is primarily limited to maintaining sufficient capital levels to obtain securities lending liquidity to support margin borrowing by customers and maintaining sufficient capital levels at HRB Bank. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Discontinued operations used $622.1 million in cash from operating activities primarily due to losses during fiscal year 2008. Operating cash flows of discontinued operations in the table above includes the net loss from discontinued operations of $763.1 million. Cash provided by investing activities of $1.0 billion reflects gross proceeds from the sale of servicing assets completed April 30, 2008. Sale proceeds utilized to repay debt outstanding under our servicing advance facility are presented net of related borrowings in financing activities. Ongoing liquidity needs of OOMC relate primarily to continuing loan repurchase obligations. Historically, BFC provided OOMC a line of credit of at least $150.0 million for working capital needs. In connection with the sale of OOMCs servicing assets, this line of credit was terminated. OOMC utilized a $1.2 billion facility to fund servicing advances (the Servicing Advance Facility), in which the servicing advances are collateral for the facility. This on balance sheet facility was repaid in full with the proceeds from the sale of servicing assets on April 30, 2008. OOMC received $19.9 million from the Servicing Advance Facility, previously held in escrow, upon repayment. OFF BALANCE SHEET FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS During fiscal year 2008, OOMC was party to various transactions with an off balance sheet component, including loan commitments and QSPEs. However, in connection with the cessation of all loan origination activities, OOMC terminated all remaining on and off balance sheet warehouse facilities during the third quarter of fiscal year 2008. BORROWINGS The following chart provides the debt ratings for BFC: April 30, 2008 April 30, 2007 Short term Long term Outlook Short term Long term Outlook Fitch (1) F3 BBB Negative F1 A Stable Moodys P2 Baa1 Negative P2 A3 Negative SP (2) A3 BBB Negative A2 BBB Negative DBRS (3) R 2 (high) BBB (high) Negative R 1 (low) A Stable (1) Short term rating of F2 and outlook of Stable effective May 14, 2008. (2) Placed on CreditWatch Positive effective May 2, 2008. (3) Outlook of Stable effective May 5, 2008. We use capital primarily to fund working capital requirements, pay dividends, repurchase treasury shares and acquire businesses. Market conditions and credit rating downgrades negatively impacted our ability to issue commercial paper in fiscal year 2008. As an alternative to commercial paper issuance, we borrowed under our CLOCs in fiscal year 2008 to support off season working capital requirements in our Tax Services and Business Services segments and operating losses from our mortgage businesses. At April 30, 2008, we maintained $2.0 billion in revolving credit facilities to support issuance of commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. These CLOCs, and borrowings thereunder, have a maturity date of August 2010 and an annual facility fee in a range of six to fifteen basis points per annum, based on our credit ratings. We had no balance outstanding as of April 30, 2008. The CLOCs, among other things, require we maintain at least $650.0 million of net worth on the last day of any fiscal quarter. We had 39 Table of Contents net worth of $987.8 million at April 30, 2008. There are no rating contingencies affecting the availability of the CLOCs. On January 11, 2008, we issued $600.0 million of 7.875% Senior Notes under our shelf registration. The Senior Notes are due January 15, 2013, and are not redeemable by the bondholders prior to maturity. The net proceeds of this transaction were used to repay a $500.0 million facility, with the remaining proceeds used for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of April 30, 2008, we had $250.0 million remaining under our shelf registration for additional debt issuances. We entered into a committed line of credit agreement with HSBC Finance Corporation effective January 10, 2008 for use as a funding source for the purchase of RAL participations. This line provides funding totaling $3.0 billion through March 30, 2008 and $120.0 million thereafter through June 30, 2008. This line is subject to various covenants that are similar to our CLOCs, and is secured by our RAL participations. All borrowings on this facility were repaid as of April 30, 2008, and the facility is now closed. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2008, borrowing needs in our Canadian operations were funded by corporate borrowings in the U.S. To mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate risk, we used forward foreign exchange contracts. We do not enter into forward contracts for speculative purposes. In estimating the fair value of derivative positions, we utilize quoted market prices, if available, or quotes obtained from external sources. There were no forward contracts outstanding as of April 30, 2008. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS A summary of our obligations to make future payments as of April 30, 2008, is as follows: (in 000s) Total Less Than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Long term debt (including interest) $ 1,457,877 $ 171,795 $ 135,591 $ 721,224 $ 429,267 Customer deposits 785,624 630,060 9,074 6,557 139,933 Acquisition payments 28,398 6,728 3,246 18,424 Short term borrowings 25,000 25,000 Media advertising purchase obligation 19,043 19,043 Capital lease obligations 12,514 513 1,052 1,247 9,702 Operating leases 854,956 265,130 364,333 144,022 81,471 Total contractual cash obligations $ 3,183,412 $ 1,118,269 $ 513,296 $ 891,474 $ 660,373 We adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48) on May 1, 2007. At April 30, 2008, the liability recorded for uncertain tax positions, excluding related interest and penalties, totaled $137.6 million. This liability represents an estimate of tax positions we have taken in our tax returns that may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Amounts we expect to pay in the next twelve months of $11.5 million are included in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. The remaining amount is included in other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Because the ultimate amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty, the estimated FIN 48 liability has been excluded from the table above. See Item 8, note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. A summary of our commitments as of April 30, 2008, which may or may not require future payments, expire as follows: (in 000s) Total Less Than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Franchise Equity Lines of Credit $ 79,134 $ 33,859 $ 26,488 $ 18,787 $ Commitment to fund MP 125,000 125,000 Pledged securities 47,225 47,225 Contingent acquisition payments 24,288 4,454 8,205 11,215 414 Other commercial commitments 4,070 1,865 2,205 Total commercial commitments $ 279,717 $ 212,403 $ 36,898 $ 30,002 $ 414 See discussion of contractual obligations and commitments in Item 8, within the notes to our consolidated financial statements. REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT In March 2006, the OTS approved the federal savings bank charter of HRB Bank. HRB Bank commenced operations on May 1, 2006, at which time HR Block, Inc. became a savings and loan holding company. As a 40 Table of Contents savings and loan holding company, HR Block, Inc. is subject to regulation by the OTS. Federal savings banks are subject to extensive regulation and examination by the OTS, their primary federal regulator, as well as the FDIC. In conjunction with HR Block, Inc.s application with the OTS for HRB Bank, HR Block, Inc. made commitments as part of our charter approval order (Master Commitment) which included, but were not limited to: (1) HR Block, Inc. to maintain a three percent minimum ratio of adjusted tangible capital to adjusted total assets, as defined by the OTS; (2) maintain all HRB Bank capital within HRB Bank in accordance with the submitted three year business plan; and (3) follow federal regulations surrounding intercompany transactions and approvals. Effective April 30, 2008, the three percent minimum ratio of adjusted tangible capital to adjusted total assets requirement was eliminated, and a Supervisory Directive relating to prior non compliance with this requirement was rescinded. All savings associations are subject to the capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. HRB Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of HRB Banks assets, liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. HRB Banks capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. As of March 31, 2008, our most recent Thrift Financial Report (TFR) filing with the OTS, HRB bank was a well capitalized institution under the prompt corrective action provisions of the FDIC. See Item 8, note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of regulatory capital requirements and classifications. HRB Bank is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of HR Block, Inc. and its customer deposits are insured by the FDIC. If an insured institution fails, claims for administrative expenses of the receiver and for deposits in U.S. branches (including claims of the FDIC as subrogee of the failed institution) have priority over the claims of general unsecured creditors. In addition, the FDIC has authority to require HR Block, Inc. to reimburse it for losses it incurs in connection with the failure of HRB Bank or with the FDICs provision of assistance to a banking subsidiary that is in danger of failure. HRBFA is subject to regulatory requirements intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker dealers. HRBFA is required to maintain minimum net capital as defined under Rule 15c3 1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and complies with the alternative capital requirement, which requires HRBFA to maintain net capital equal to the greater of $1.0 million or 2% of the combined aggregate debit balances arising from customer transactions. The net capital rule also provides that equity capital may not be withdrawn or cash dividends paid if resulting net capital would be less than the greater of 5% of combined aggregate debit items or 120% of the minimum required net capital. At April 30, 2008, HRBFAs net capital of $70.4 million, which was 15.5% of aggregate debit items, exceeded its minimum required net capital of $9.1 million by $61.3 million. During fiscal year 2008, HRBFA paid dividends of $63.6 million to BFC, its direct corporate parent. HRBFA was in excess of the minimum net capital requirement during fiscal years 2008 and 2007. The U.S., various state, local, provincial and foreign governments and some self regulatory organizations have enacted statutes and ordinances, and or adopted rules and regulations, regulating aspects of our business. These aspects include, but are not limited to, commercial income tax return preparers, income tax courses, the electronic filing of income tax returns, the facilitation of RALs, loan originations and assistance in loan originations, mortgage lending, privacy, consumer protection, franchising, sales methods, brokers, broker dealers and various aspects of securities transactions, financial planners, investment advisers, banking, accountants and the accounting practice. We seek to determine the applicability of such statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations (collectively, Laws) and comply with those Laws. From time to time in the ordinary course of business, we receive inquiries from governmental and self regulatory agencies regarding the applicability of Laws to our services and products. In response to past inquiries, we have agreed to comply with such Laws, convinced the authorities that such Laws were not applicable or that compliance already exists and or modified our activities in the applicable jurisdiction to avoid the application of all or certain parts of such Laws. We believe the past resolution of such inquiries and our ongoing compliance with Laws has not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. We cannot predict what effect future Laws, changes in interpretations of existing Laws or the results of future regulator inquiries with respect to the applicability of Laws may have on our consolidated financial statements. See additional discussion of legal matters in Item 3, Legal Proceedings and Item 8, note 18 to our consolidated financial statements. 41 Table of Contents STATISTICAL DISCLOSURE BY BANK HOLDING COMPANIES This section presents information required by the SECs Industry Guide 3, Statistical Disclosure by Bank Holding Companies.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Item 8, note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements. RECONCILIATION OF NON GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION We report our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, we believe certain non GAAP performance measures and ratios used in managing the business may provide additional meaningful comparisons between current year results and prior periods by excluding certain items that do not represent results from our basic operations. Reconciliations to GAAP financial measures are provided below. These non GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, not as an alternative for, our reported GAAP results.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK GENERAL INTEREST RATE RISK We have a formal investment policy that strives to minimize the market risk exposure of our cash equivalents and available for sale (AFS) securities, which are primarily affected by credit quality and movements in interest rates. These guidelines focus on managing liquidity and preserving principal and earnings. Most of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities are managed at the subsidiary level. 44 Table of Contents Our cash equivalents are primarily held for liquidity purposes and are comprised of high quality, short term investments, including qualified money market funds. Because our non restricted cash and cash equivalents have a relatively short maturity, our portfolios market value is relatively insensitive to interest rate changes. We hold investments in fixed income securities at our captive insurance subsidiary. See the table below for sensitivities to changes in interest rates. See additional discussion of interest rate risk included below in Consumer Financial Services and Discontinued Operations. As our short term borrowings are generally seasonal, interest rate risk typically increases through our third fiscal quarter and declines to zero by fiscal year end. While the market value of short term borrowings is relatively insensitive to interest rate changes, interest expense on short term borrowings will increase and decrease with changes in the underlying short term interest rates. See Item 7, Financial Condition for additional information. Our long term debt at April 30, 2008, consists primarily of fixed rate Senior Notes; therefore, a change in interest rates would have no impact on consolidated pretax earnings. See Item 8, note 9 to our consolidated financial statements. EQUITY PRICE RISK We have exposure to the equity markets in several ways. The largest exposure, though relatively small, is through our deferred compensation plans. Within the deferred compensation plans, we have mismatches in asset and liability amounts and investment choices (both fixed income and equity). At April 30, 2008 and 2007, the impact of a 10% market value change in the combined equity assets held by our deferred compensation plans and other equity investments would be approximately $12.2 million and $12.5 million, respectively, assuming no offset for the liabilities. TAX SERVICES FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE RISK Our operations in international markets are exposed to movements in currency exchange rates. The currencies involved are the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar. We translate revenues and expenses related to these operations at the average of exchange rates in effect during the period. Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing at the end of the year. Translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of other comprehensive income in stockholders equity. Translation of financial results into U.S. dollars does not presently materially affect and has not historically materially affected our consolidated financial results, although such changes do affect the year to year comparability of the operating results in U.S. dollars of our international businesses. We estimate a 10% change in foreign exchange rates by itself would impact consolidated pretax income in fiscal years 2008 and 2007 by approximately $3.2 million and $2.5 million, respectively, and cash balances at April 30, 2008 and 2007 by $4.0 million and $5.9 million, respectively. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2008, borrowing needs in our Canadian operations were funded by corporate borrowings in the U.S. To mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate risk, we used forward foreign exchange contracts. We do not enter into forward contracts for speculative purposes. In estimating the fair value of derivative positions, we utilized quoted market prices, if available, or quotes obtained from external sources. When foreign currency financial instruments are outstanding, exposure to market risk on these instruments results from fluctuations in currency rates during the periods in which the contracts are outstanding. The counterparties to our currency exchange contracts consist of major financial institutions, each of which is rated investment grade. We are exposed to credit risk to the extent of potential non performance by counterparties on financial instruments. Any potential credit exposure does not exceed the fair value. We believe the risk of incurring losses due to credit risk is remote. At April 30, 2008 we had no forward exchange contracts outstanding. CONSUMER FINANCIAL SERVICES INTEREST RATE RISK BANKING At April 30, 2008, approximately 93% of HRB Banks total assets were residential mortgage loans with 29% of these fixed rate loans and 71% adjustable rate loans. These loans are sensitive to changes in interest rates as well as expected prepayment levels. As interest rates increase, fixed rate residential mortgages tend to exhibit lower prepayments. The opposite is true in a falling rate environment. When mortgage loans prepay, mortgage origination costs are written off. Depending on the timing of the prepayment, the write offs of mortgage origination costs may result in lower than anticipated yields. At April 30, 2008, HRB Banks other investments consisted primarily of mortgage backed securities and FHLB stock. See table below for sensitivity analysis of our mortgage backed securities. HRB Banks liabilities consist primarily of transactional deposit relationships, such as prepaid debit card accounts and checking accounts. Other liabilities include money market accounts, certificates of deposit and 45 Table of Contents collateralized borrowings from the FHLB. Money market accounts re price as interest rates change. Certificates of deposit re price over time depending on maturities. FHLB advances generally have fixed rates ranging from one day through multiple years. Under criteria published by the OTS, HRB Banks overall interest rate risk exposure at April 30, 2008, was characterized as minimal. We actively manage our interest rate risk positions. As interest rates change, we will adjust our strategy and mix of assets and liabilities to optimize our position. INTEREST RATE RISK BROKER DEALER HRBFA holds interest bearing receivables from customers, brokers and dealers, which consist of amounts due on margin and stock borrow transactions and are generally short term in nature. We fund these short term assets with short term variable rate liabilities from customers, brokers and dealers, including stock loan activity. As interest rates decline, our yields on these interest bearing receivables are negatively impacted, but are partially offset by reduced expenses related to the short term variable rate liabilities. Rate declines also negatively impact spreads received on customer sweep account balances. Interest rate increases have an opposite effect on these revenues and expenses. Our fixed income trading portfolio is affected by changes in market rates and prices. The risk is the loss of income arising from adverse changes in the value of the trading portfolio. We value the trading portfolio at quoted market prices and the market value of our trading portfolio at April 30, 2008, was approximately $8.8 million, net of $0.2 million in securities sold short. Fixed income securities totaling $1.6 million at April 30, 2008 have returns linked to the equity market, and are therefore discussed above in Equity Price Risk. See table below for sensitivities to changes in interest rates of our other fixed income securities. With respect to our fixed income securities portfolio, we manage our market price risk exposure by limiting concentration risk, maintaining minimum credit quality and limiting inventory to anticipated retail demand and current market conditions. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS RESIDUAL INTERESTS Relative to modeling assumptions, an increase or decrease in interest rates would affect the value of OOMCs residual interests and could affect accretion income related to these residual interests. Residual interests bear the interest rate risk embedded within the securitization due to an initial fixed rate period on the loans versus a floating rate funding cost. Residual interests also bear the ongoing risk the floating interest rate earned after the fixed period on the mortgage loans is different from the floating interest rate on the bonds sold in the securitization. See table below for sensitivities to changes in interest rates for residual interests 46 Table of Contents SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS The sensitivities of certain financial instruments to changes in interest rates as of April 30, 2008 and 2007 are presented below. The following table represents hypothetical instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in interest rates and should not be relied on as an indicator of future expected results. The impact of a change in interest rates on other factors, such as delinquency and prepayment rates, is not included in the analysis below.
