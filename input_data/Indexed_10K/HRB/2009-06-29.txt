ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our subsidiaries provide tax preparation, retail banking and various business advisory and consulting services. We are the only major company offering a full range of software, online and in office tax preparation solutions to individual tax clients. OVERVIEW A summary of our fiscal year 2009 results is as follows: Revenues for the fiscal year were $4.1 billion, essentially flat compared with prior year results. Diluted earnings per share of our continuing operations increased 12.5% from the prior year to $1.53, primarily due to cost containment measures implemented across all our segments. Tax returns prepared in the U.S. declined 3.2% from the prior year due to a decline in overall IRS filings and a weak economy, which we believe resulted in clients seeking lower cost alternatives. Increases in net average fee per tax return prepared of 7.2% resulted primarily from higher return complexity. Tax Services segment revenues increased 1.5% over the prior year. Segment pretax income increased $108.0 million, or 13.7%, due primarily to cost containment measures resulting in a year over year increase to pretax margin of 320 basis points to 29.5%. Revenues and margins also benefitted from the November 2008 acquisition of our last major franchise operator. Business Services pretax income increased 8.2% over the prior year, as lower than expected revenues were offset by cost containment measures. Consumer Financial Services reported a pretax loss of $14.5 million compared to income of $11.5 million in the prior year, due primarily to increases in loan loss provisions. Our brokerage advisor business previously conducted through HRBFA was sold to Ameriprise effective November 1, 2008 and results for that business have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.

Tax preparation fees from our retail offices increased $59.0 million, or 2.8%, for fiscal year 2009. This increase is primarily due to an increase of 6.8% in the net average fee per U.S. tax return prepared in company owned offices, offset by a 2.8% decrease in the number of U.S. tax returns prepared in those offices. Tax return volume was positively affected by the November 2008 acquisition of our last major independent franchise operator, which resulted in an increase of 470,000 tax returns prepared in company owned offices. See Item 8, note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on this acquisition. Excluding operating results attributable to the acquired franchise operator, tax returns prepared in company owned offices decreased 7.3% from the prior year and tax preparation fees decreased $32.9 million. Increases in our net average fee are due primarily to increased tax return complexity. In addition, planned pricing increases of approximately 1% and lower discounts contributed to an increase in net average fee. We believe that declines during the year in tax return volume were attributable to a decline of approximately 6% in IRS tax filings overall, and difficult economic conditions which resulted in clients seeking lower cost tax preparation alternatives. Tax returns prepared in our international operations grew 5.1%, and the related tax preparation revenues increased 8.9% in local currencies. However, unfavorable exchange rates caused these revenues in U.S. dollars to decline $9.5 million, or 5.6%, from the prior year. Other service revenue increased $3.6 million, or 1.0%, primarily due to $10.7 million in additional license fees earned from bank products, mainly RACs, coupled with additional revenues from online tax preparation. We also earned an incremental $6.6 million in connection with an agreement with HRB Bank for the HR Block Emerald Prepaid MasterCard program, under which, this segment shares in the revenues and expenses associated with the program. These increases were partially offset by a $10.6 million decline in e filing revenues, as a result of the elimination of separate e filing fees related to our TaxCut software product. Royalty revenue increased $17.6 million, or 7.4%, primarily due to a 7.2% increase in the net average fee and an increase in royalty rates at sub franchises of the acquired franchise operator. Loan participation fees and related revenues decreased $47.5 million, or 25.0%, from the prior year. This decrease is primarily due to a 24.6% decline in RAL volume, mainly as a result of many clients choosing lower cost alternatives such as RACs rather than a loan. In addition, stricter credit criteria were required by our third party loan originator. Other revenues increased $11.9 million, or 11.8%, primarily due to $22.7 million in incremental fees earned in connection with the Emerald Advance loan program, also under a revenue and expense sharing agreement with HRB Bank. This increase was partially offset by a decline in software revenues. Total expenses decreased $63.5 million, or 2.9%, compared with the prior year, due primarily to lower tax return volumes, lower bad debt on loan products and planned cost reduction initiatives. Cost of services decreased $19.3 million, or 1.2%, from the prior year almost exclusively as a result of a decrease in commission based wages resulting from a corresponding decrease in tax returns prepared. Cost of other revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $44.2 million, or 7.4%. This decrease was due, in part, to a $17.1 million decline in bad debt expense due to lower RAL volumes and the impact of loss provisions in the prior year which did not repeat in fiscal year 2009, partially offset by an increase in Emerald Advance loan volumes. We also saw a decline of $32.4 million in allocated corporate and support department costs due to cost reduction efforts, offset by a planned increase of $43.0 million in marketing costs. During fiscal year 2009 we sold certain company owned offices to franchisees, recognizing a net gain of $14.9 million, which is included above as a reduction to cost of other revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses. Pretax income for fiscal year 2009 increased $108.0 million, or 13.7%, from 2008. As a result of cost reduction initiatives and the acquisition of our last major franchise operator, pretax margin for the segment increased from 26.3% in fiscal year 2008, to 29.5% in fiscal year 2009, in excess of our stated minimum goal to achieve a 200 basis point margin improvement. FISCAL 2008 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2007 Tax Services revenues increased $302.8 million, or 11.3%, compared to fiscal year 2007. Tax preparation fees from our retail offices increased $200.0 million, or 10.5%, for fiscal year 2008. This increase was primarily due to an increase of 6.5% in the net average fee per U.S. tax return prepared in company owned offices, and a 1.9% increase in the number of U.S. tax returns prepared in those offices. Our international operations contributed $33.2 million to the increase, resulting from a 6.1% increase in tax returns prepared. Other service revenue increased $62.2 million, or 20.6%, primarily due to $23.9 million in additional license fees earned from bank products and $16.2 million in additional revenues from our online tax preparation and e filing HR BLOCK 2009 Form 10K 19 Table of Contents services. This segment also earned $15.1 million in additional customer fees based on an agreement with HRB Bank for the HR Block Emerald Prepaid MasterCard program. Royalty revenue increased $17.9 million, or 8.1%, due to a 2.1% increase in tax returns prepared in franchise offices and a 4.4% increase in the net average fee. Loan participation fees and related revenues decreased $19.8 million, or 9.4%, from fiscal year 2007. This decrease was primarily due to participation fees earned on Instant Money Advance Loans (IMALs) in fiscal year 2007. IMALs were not offered during fiscal year 2008. This decrease was offset by an increase in other revenues related to Emerald Advance lines of credit. Other revenues increased $42.6 million, or 73.5%, primarily due to $24.1 million in fees earned in connection with the Emerald Advance loan program, also under a revenue and expense sharing agreement with HRB Bank. Additionally, $16.2 million of the increase was due to sales of commercial tax preparation software, TaxWorks, which was acquired in February 2007. Total expenses increased $222.1 million, or 11.2%, compared to fiscal year 2007. Cost of services increased $117.4 million, or 7.9%, from fiscal year 2007. Compensation and benefits increased $63.9 million, or 7.7%, primarily as a result of a 6.5% increase in commission based wages resulting from a corresponding increase in tax returns prepared and net average charge. Occupancy expenses increased $29.4 million, or 8.5%, primarily as a result of higher rent expenses, due to a 2.8% increase in company owned offices under lease and a 3.4% increase in the average rent. Bad debt expense increased $17.0 million due to increased settlement product withholdings and increased delinquency rates. Other cost of services increased $14.1 million, or 7.4%, primarily due to additional support department costs for information technology and other projects and costs associated with the HR Block Emerald Prepaid MasterCard program, which this segment shares with HRB Bank. Cost of other revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $104.6 million, or 21.2%. This increase was primarily due to $58.1 million of incremental bad debt expense related to RALs and our new Emerald Advance program. Approximately $14.2 million of the increase in bad debt expense was due to the elimination of third party cross collect practices, whereby banks no longer collect amounts due from clients on our behalf, and an additional $12.0 million resulted from changes in IRS taxpayer fraud detection practices. The remaining increase was primarily due to an incremental $31.5 million in bad debt expense related to the Emerald Advance loan program, which replaced the IMAL. This increase was primarily due to the participation rate on IMALs, which was 26%, while Emerald Advances are funded by HRB Bank with nearly 100% participation by this segment in loans outstanding at April 30, 2008. We also saw increases of $23.3 million, $10.6 million and $9.8 million in corporate wages, amortization of intangibles and legal expenses, respectively. Pretax income for fiscal year 2008 increased $80.7 million, or 11.4%, from 2007. 20 HR BLOCK 2009 Form 10K Table of Contents BUSINESS SERVICES This segment offers accounting, tax and business consulting services, wealth management and capital market services to middle market companies.

Revenues from core tax, consulting and accounting services increased $25.0 million, or 3.4%, over the prior year. Tax services revenues increased $15.9 million, or 3.6%, over the prior year due to increases in net billed rate per hour. Business consulting revenues increased $12.2 million, or 5.2%, over the prior year primarily due to a large one time financial institutions engagement. Weak economic conditions in the current year severely reduced investment and transaction activity. As a result, capital markets revenues decreased $32.9 million, or 64.4%, from the prior year primarily due to a 57.4% decline in the number of transactions closed. Leased employee revenue decreased due to a change in organizational structure between the businesses we acquired from American Express Tax and Business Services, Inc. (AmexTBS) and the Attest Firms that, while not affiliates of our company, also serve our clients. Employees we previously leased to the Attest Firms were transferred to the separate attest practices over the last two fiscal years. As a result, we no longer record the revenues and expenses associated with leasing these employees, which resulted in a reduction of $25.0 million to current year revenues, and a similar reduction in compensation and benefits. Other revenue declined $12.1 million, or 11.0%, primarily due to a decrease in outside contractor services provided to our clients. Total expenses decreased $51.2 million, or 6.0%, compared to the prior year. Compensation and benefits decreased $14.4 million, primarily due to the change in organizational structure with AmexTBS and fewer capital markets commissions resulting from the decline in transactions, as discussed above. These decreases were partially offset by severance costs incurred in the current year. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $36.7 million, or 22.6%, primarily due to declines in external consulting fees, allocated corporate and support department costs and travel and entertainment expenses. Pretax income for the year ended April 30, 2009 of $96.1 million compares to $88.8 million in the prior year. Pretax margin for the segment increased from 9.4% in fiscal year 2008, to 10.7% in fiscal year 2009, below our stated HR BLOCK 2009 Form 10K 21 Table of Contents goal to achieve a 12.0% pretax margin primarily due to poor results in our capital markets business and lower than expected revenue growth in our core businesses. FISCAL 2008 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2007 Business Services revenues for fiscal year 2008 increased $9.3 million, or 1.0%, over fiscal year 2007. Tax services revenues increased $33.7 million, or 8.2% and business consulting revenues increased $31.6 million, or 15.4%, over fiscal year 2007. These increases resulted primarily from both an increase in the number of client service professionals as well as an improvement in productivity per professional. Capital markets revenues increased $2.3 million, primarily due to a $12.6 million increase in underwriting revenues due to a 37.4% increase in revenue per transaction. Valuation and seminar revenues declined $10.4 million due to a 70.3% decline in the number of business valuation projects as a result of the wind down of this service line. Leased employee revenue decreased due to the change in organizational structure with AmexTBS as discussed above, which resulted in a reduction of $58.1 million to fiscal year 2008 revenues, and a similar reduction in compensation and benefits. Total expenses decreased $21.8 million, or 2.5%, for fiscal year 2008 compared to 2007. Compensation and benefits decreased due to the change in organizational structure with AmexTBS as discussed above, which was almost entirely offset by additional compensation resulting from increases in the number of personnel and the average wage per employee. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $20.4 million, or 11.2%, primarily due to decreases in external consulting and legal fees. During fiscal year 2007, additional consulting fees were incurred related to our marketing initiatives, and additional legal expenses were incurred related to international acquisitions that were ultimately not completed. Pretax income for the year ended April 30, 2008 of $88.8 million compares to $57.7 million in fiscal year 2007.

Net interest income increased $18.8 million, or 34.7%, over the prior year. Interest income earned from our Emerald Advance loan program increased $22.9 million as a result of higher volumes. Interest expense on deposits declined $28.8 million due to lower interest rates and lower average balances. Interest income on mortgage loans held for investment declined $28.5 million due to lower balances and an increase in non accrual loans from $110.8 million at April 30, 2008 to $222.4 million at April 30, 2009.

Details of our mortgage loans held for investment and the related allowance at April 30, 2009 and 2008 are as follows: (dollars in 000s) Outstanding Loan Loss % 30 Days Principal Balance Allowance Past Due Average FICO As of April 30, 2009: Purchased from SCC $ 531,233 $ 78,067 28.74% 639 All other 290,604 6,006 4.44% 715 $ 821,837 $ 84,073 20.23% 666 As of April 30, 2008: Purchased from SCC $ 683,889 $ 43,769 17.53% 664 All other 320,751 1,632 2.07% 721 $ 1,004,640 $ 45,401 11.71% 682 Mortgage loans held for investment include loans originated by our affiliate, SCC, and purchased by HRB Bank totaling $531.2 million, or approximately 65% of the total loan portfolio at April 30, 2009. Loans originated by and purchased from SCC have characteristics which are representative of Alt A loans loans to customers who have credit ratings above sub prime, but may not conform to government sponsored standards. As such, we have experienced higher rates of delinquency and have greater exposure to loss with respect to this segment of our loan portfolio. Cumulative losses on our original loan portfolio purchased from SCC and retained for investment, including losses on loans now classified as other real estate, totaled approximately 14% at April 30, 2009. Our remaining loan portfolio totaled $290.6 million and is characteristic of a prime loan portfolio, and we believe subject to a lower loss exposure. We recorded a provision for loan losses on our mortgage loans held for investment of $63.9 million during the current year, compared to $42.0 million in the prior year. Our loan loss provision increased primarily as a result of continued declines in residential home prices, particularly in certain states where we have a higher concentration of loans. In addition, loan loss reserves increased due to higher projected delinquencies and higher reserves on modified loans. Our allowance for loan losses as a percent of mortgage loans was 10.23%, or $84.1 million, at April 30, 2009, compared to 4.49%, or $45.4 million, at April 30, 2008. This allowance represents our best estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet dates. Residential real estate markets are experiencing significant declines in property values and mortgage default rates are increasing. If adverse market trends continue, including trends within our portfolio specifically, we may be required to record additional loan loss provisions, and those losses may be significant. Other revenue increased $10.0 million, or 25.2%, primarily due to incremental fees earned related to our HR Block Prepaid Emerald MasterCard program. Non interest expenses increased $32.9 million, or 81.6%, from the prior year, primarily related higher expenses from the HR Block Prepaid Emerald MasterCard and Emerald Advance line of credit programs, reflecting higher volumes. The revenues and expenses from these programs are shared with the Tax Services segment. The pretax loss for fiscal year 2009 was $14.5 million compared to prior year income of $11.5 million, primarily due to a $21.9 million increase in provision for loan losses. FISCAL 2008 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2007 Consumer Financial Services revenues, net of interest expense and provision for loan loss reserves, for fiscal year 2008 increased $11.2 million, or 27.7%, over fiscal year 2007. 24 HR BLOCK 2009 Form 10K Table of Contents Net interest income increased $30.4 million due to interest income received on our Emerald Advance loan products and an increase in average mortgage loans held for investment, partially offset by an increase in average deposits. The following table summarizes the key drivers of net interest income: (dollars in 000s) Average Balance Average Rate Earned (Paid) Year Ended April 30, 2008 2007 2008 2007 Mortgage loans held for investment, net $ 1,157,360 $ 746,387 6.40% 6.80% Emerald Advance lines of credit 68,932 32.31% % Investments 196,262 117,350 3.64% 5.25% Deposits, interest bearing 904,836 596,104 (4.74%) (5.39%) Detail of our mortgage loans held for investment and the related allowance at April 30, 2008 and 2007 is as follows: (dollars in 000s) Outstanding Loan Loss % 30 Days Principal Balance Allowance Past Due Average FICO As of April 30, 2008: Purchased from SCC $ 683,889 $ 43,769 17.53% 664 All other 320,751 1,632 2.07% 721 $ 1,004,640 $ 45,401 11.71% 682 As of April 30, 2007: Purchased from SCC $ 1,010,028 $ 3,341 4.70% 710 All other 340,864 107 0.50% 731 $ 1,350,892 $ 3,448 3.86% 719 We recorded a provision for loan losses on our mortgage loans held for investment of $42.0 million during fiscal year 2008, compared to $3.6 million in 2007. Our loan loss provision increased significantly during 2008 as a result of declining collateral values due to declining residential home prices and increasing delinquencies occurring in our portfolio. Our loan loss reserve as a percent of mortgage loans was 4.49%, or $45.4 million, at April 30, 2008, compared to 0.25%, or $3.4 million, at April 30, 2007. Other revenues increased $19.2 million, primarily due to increases in fees received in connection with the HR Block Prepaid Emerald MasterCard program. Non interest expenses increased $22.8 million from the prior year, primarily due to additional expenses associated with the HR Block Prepaid Emerald MasterCard program and the Emerald Advance lines of credit. Pretax income for fiscal year 2008 was $11.5 million compared to prior year income of $23.1 million. CORPORATE, ELIMINATIONS AND INCOME TAXES ON CONTINUING OPERATIONS FISCAL 2009 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2008 The pretax loss recorded in our corporate operations for fiscal year 2009 was $136.0 million compared to $151.0 million in the prior year. The decreased loss was primarily due to severance related costs of $11.3 million recorded in the prior year, coupled with benefits in the current year resulting from the cost reduction program implemented in fiscal year 2008. Our effective tax rate for continuing operations was 38.9% for fiscal year 2009 compared to 39.3% in the prior year. FISCAL 2008 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2007 The pretax loss recorded in our corporate operations for fiscal year 2008 was $151.0 million compared to $158.7 million in 2007. The decreased loss was primarily due to a decline in interest expense, which resulted from increased allocation of interest expense to our discontinued mortgage operations. Our effective tax rate for continuing operations was 39.3% for fiscal year 2008 compared to 41.1% in 2007. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in our state effective rates and releases of valuation allowances. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Effective November 1, 2008, we sold HRBFA to Ameriprise. HRBFA and its direct corporate parent are presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. Our discontinued operations also include our former mortgage loan origination and servicing business, as well as three smaller lines of business previously reported in our Business Services segment. HR BLOCK 2009 Form 10K 25 Table of Contents FISCAL 2009 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2008 The pretax loss of our discontinued operations for fiscal year 2009 was $47.6 million compared to a loss of $1.2 billion in the prior year. The loss from discontinued operations for the prior year period included significant losses from our former mortgage loan businesses, including losses relating to loan repurchase obligations of $582.4 million and impairments of residual interests of $137.8 million. Net of applicable tax benefits, the loss from discontinued operations for fiscal year 2009 was $27.4 million compared to a loss of $754.6 million in the prior year. Our effective tax rate for discontinued operations was 42.5% and 35.3% for the fiscal years 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our effective tax rate increased primarily due to a tax benefit recorded in conjunction with the sale of HRBFA. FISCAL 2008 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2007 The pretax loss of our discontinued operations for fiscal year 2008 was $1.2 billion, which was essentially flat compared to fiscal year 2007. The loss from discontinued operations for both periods included significant losses from our former mortgage loans businesses. Our effective tax rate for discontinued operations was 35.3% and 34.4% for the fiscal years 2008 and 2007, respectively. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES We consider the policies discussed below to be critical to understanding our financial statements, as they require the use of significant judgment and estimation in order to measure, at a specific point in time, matters that are inherently uncertain. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs. We have reviewed and discussed each of these policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. For all of these policies, we caution that future events rarely develop precisely as forecasted and estimates routinely require adjustment and may require material adjustment. ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES The principal amount of mortgage loans held for investment totaled $821.8 million at April 30, 2009. We are exposed to the risk that borrowers may not repay amounts owed to us when they become contractually due. We record an allowance representing our estimate of credit losses inherent in the portfolio of loans held for investment at the balance sheet date. Determination of our allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting policy because loss provisions can be material to our operating results, projections of loan delinquencies and related matters are inherently subjective, and actual losses are impacted by factors outside of our control including economic conditions, unemployment rates and residential home prices. We record a loan loss allowance for loans less than 60 days past due on a pooled basis. The aggregate principal balance of these loans totaled $518.0 million at April 30, 2009, and the portion of our allowance for loan losses allocated to these loans totaled $18.8 million. In estimating our loan loss allowance for these loans, we stratify the loan portfolio based on our view of risk associated with various elements of the pool and assign estimated loss rates based on those risks. Loss rates are based primarily on historical experience and our assessment of economic and market conditions. Loss rates consider both the rate at which loans will become delinquent (frequency) and the amount of loss that will ultimately be realized upon occurrence of a liquidation of collateral (severity). Frequency rates are based primarily on historical migration analysis of loans to delinquent status. Severity rates are based primarily on recent broker quotes or appraisals of collateral. Because of imprecision and uncertainty inherent in developing estimates of future credit losses, in particular during periods of rapidly declining collateral values or increasing delinquency rates, our estimation process during fiscal year 2009 included development of ranges of possible outcomes. Ranges were developed by stressing initial estimates of both frequency and severity rates. Stressing of frequency and severity assumptions is intended to model deterioration in credit quality that is difficult to predict during declining economic conditions. Future deterioration in credit quality may exceed our modeled assumptions. Mortgage loans held for investment include loans originated by our affiliate, SCC, and purchased by HRB Bank. We have greater exposure to loss with respect to this segment of our loan portfolio as a result of historically higher delinquency rates. Therefore, we assign higher frequency rate assumptions to SCC originated loans compared with loans originated by other third party banks as we consider estimates of future losses. At April 30, 2009 our weighted average frequency assumption was 10.6% for SCC originated loans compared to 1.3% for remaining loans in the portfolio. Loans 60 days past due are considered impaired and are reviewed individually. We record loss estimates typically based on the value of the underlying collateral. Our specific loan loss allowance for these impaired loans reflected an average loss severity of approximately 38.5% at April 30, 2009. The aggregate principal balance of loans 60 days past due or more totaled $143.1 million at April 30, 2009, and the portion of our allowance for loan losses allocated to these loans totaled $55.2 million. 26 HR BLOCK 2009 Form 10K Table of Contents Modified loans that meet the definition of a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) are also considered impaired and are reviewed individually. We record impairment equal to the difference between the principal balance of the loan and the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate. However, if we assess that foreclosure of a modified loan is probable, we record impairment based on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral. The aggregate principal balance of TDR loans totaled $160.7 million at April 30, 2009, and the portion of our allowance for loan losses allocated to these loans totaled $10.1 million. The loan loss allowance as a percent of mortgage loans held for investment was 10.23% at April 30, 2009, compared to 4.49% at April 30, 2008. The loan loss provision increased significantly during the current year primarily as a result of declining collateral values due to lower residential home prices and modeled expectations for future loan delinquencies in the portfolio. The residential mortgage industry has experienced significant adverse trends for an extended period. If adverse trends continue for a sustained period or at rates worse than modeled by us, we may be required to record additional loan loss provisions, and those losses may be significant. Determining the allowance for credit losses for loans held for investment requires us to make estimates of losses that are highly uncertain and requires a high degree of judgment. If our underlying assumptions prove to be inaccurate, the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses. Our mortgage loan portfolio is a static pool, as we are no longer originating or purchasing new mortgage loans, and we believe that factor over time will limit variability in our loss estimates. Our allowance at April 30, 2009 currently assumes that loans in the principal amount of approximately $280 million will become delinquent and that we will incur losses on delinquent loans at an approximate loss severity of 40%. We have estimated that future delinquencies where a loss is probable as of April 30, 2009, may be as high as $315 million and that loss severity rates may be subject to variability up to 200 basis points. We have estimated the high end of a range of possible outcomes to be approximately $20 million greater than presently recorded. MORTGAGE LOAN REPURCHASE OBLIGATION SCC is obligated to repurchase loans sold or securitized in the event of a breach of representations and warranties it made to purchasers or insurers of such loans, or otherwise indemnify certain third parties for losses incurred by them. SCC records a liability for contingent losses relating to representation and warranty claims by estimating loan repurchase volumes and indemnification obligations for both known claims and projections of expected future claims. Projections of future claims are based on an analysis that includes a combination of reviewing historical repurchase trends, developing loss expectations on loans sold or securitized, and predicting the level at which previously originated loans may be subject to valid claims regarding representation and warranty breaches. Based on an analysis as of April 30, 2009, SCC estimated its liability for loan repurchase and indemnification obligations pertaining to claims of breach of representation and warranties to be $206.6 million. Actual losses charged against this reserve during fiscal year 2009 totaled $44.2 million. To the extent that valid claim volumes in the future exceed current estimates, or the value of mortgage loans and residential home prices decline, future losses may be greater than our current estimates and those differences may be significant. See Item 8, note 17 to our consolidated financial statements. LITIGATION It is our policy to routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes related to legal matters, as well as ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of the reserves required, if any, for these contingencies is made after analysis of each known issue and an analysis of historical experience in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, and related pronouncements. Therefore, we have recorded reserves related to certain legal matters for which we believe it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the range of such loss can be estimated. With respect to other matters, we have concluded that a loss is only reasonably possible or remote, or is not estimable and, therefore, no liability is recorded. Assessing the likely outcome of pending litigation, including the amount of potential loss, if any, is highly subjective. Our judgments regarding likelihood of loss and our estimates of probable loss amounts may differ from actual results due to difficulties in predicting the outcome of jury trials, arbitration hearings, settlement discussions and related activity, predicting the outcome of class certification actions and various other uncertainties. Due to the number of claims which are periodically asserted against us, and the magnitude of damages sought in those claims, actual losses in the future may significantly exceed our current estimates. VALUATION OF GOODWILL The evaluation of goodwill for impairment is a critical accounting estimate due both to the magnitude of our goodwill balances, and the judgment involved in determining the fair value of our reporting units. Goodwill balances in our continuing operations totaled $850.2 million as of April 30, 2009 and $831.3 million as of April 30, 2008. We test goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change which would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. Our goodwill impairment analysis is based on a discounted cash flow approach and market HR BLOCK 2009 Form 10K 27 Table of Contents comparables. This analysis, at the reporting unit level, requires significant management judgment with respect to revenue and expense forecasts, anticipated changes in working capital and the selection and application of an appropriate discount rate. Changes in projections or assumptions could materially affect our estimate of reporting unit fair values. The use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted future operating cash flows and could affect our conclusions regarding the existence or amount of potential impairment. Finally, strategic changes in our outlook regarding reporting units or intangible assets may alter our valuation approach and could result in changes to our conclusions regarding impairment. Estimates of fair value for certain of our reporting units exceed the corresponding carrying value by a significant margin. In certain instances, however, the excess of estimated fair value over carrying value is not significant. Future estimates of fair value may be adversely impacted by declining economic conditions. In addition, if future operating results of our reporting units are below our current modeled expectations, fair value estimates may decline. Any of these factors could result in future impairments, and those impairments could be significant. In assessing potential goodwill impairment of our RSM reporting unit, we estimate fair value based on an assumption that the collaboration between RSM and MP under their alternative practice structure arrangement will continue. Were MP to exit the alternative practice structure, or the collaboration between these two businesses otherwise cease, we believe our fair value estimates could be lower than presently assumed. In addition, adverse business results for MP could also negatively impact our fair value estimates for RSM. Goodwill balances for RSM totaled $402.6 million at April 30, 2009. Changes in our future assessment of fair value for this reporting unit could result in an impairment of goodwill and such impairment could be significant. We recorded goodwill impairments within our Tax Services segment of $2.2 million and $5.7 million during fiscal years 2009 and 2008, respectively. There was no goodwill impairment in our continuing operations during fiscal year 2007, however, we recorded $154.9 million in goodwill impairments in discontinued operations related to the sale and wind down of our mortgage operations. INCOME TAXES We account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109), as further interpreted by FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). We calculate our current and deferred tax provision for the fiscal year based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the applicable calendar year. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded in the appropriate periods when identified. We file a consolidated federal tax return on a calendar year basis, generally in the second fiscal quarter of the subsequent year. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We have considered taxable income in carry back periods, historical and forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. Determination of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets requires that we make judgments about future matters that are not certain, including projections of future taxable income and evaluating potential tax planning strategies. To the extent that actual results differ from our current assumptions, the valuation allowance will increase or decrease. In the event we were to determine we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination. Likewise, if we later determine it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance. The income tax laws of jurisdictions in which we operate are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and applicable government taxing authorities. Income tax returns filed by us are based on our interpretation of these rules. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which may result in proposed assessments, including assessments of interest and or penalties. Our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly subjective and based on our best judgments. Actual results may differ from our current judgments due to a variety of factors, including changes in law, interpretations of law by taxing authorities that differ from our assessments, changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate and results of routine tax examinations. We believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters. However, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved, or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire. As a result, our effective tax rate may fluctuate on a quarterly basis. REVENUE RECOGNITION We have many different revenue sources, each governed by specific revenue recognition policies. Our revenue recognition policies can be found in Item 8, note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. 28 HR BLOCK 2009 Form 10K Table of Contents OTHER SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Other significant accounting policies, not involving the same level of judgment or uncertainty as those discussed above are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements. These policies may require judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance. Certain of these matters are among topics currently under reexamination by accounting standard setters and regulators. Although specific conclusions reached by these standard setters may cause a material change in our accounting policies, outcomes cannot be predicted with confidence. See Item 8, note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, which discusses accounting policies we have selected when there are acceptable alternatives and new or proposed accounting standards that may affect our financial reporting in the future. FINANCIAL CONDITION CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Our sources of capital include cash from operations, issuances of common stock and debt. We use capital primarily to fund working capital, pay dividends, repurchase treasury shares and acquire businesses. Our operations are highly seasonal and therefore generally require the use of cash to fund operating losses during the period May through mid January. Given the likely availability of a number of liquidity options discussed herein, including borrowing capacity under our CLOCs, we believe, that in the absence of any unexpected developments, our existing sources of capital at April 30, 2009 are sufficient to meet our operating needs. CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES Cash provided by operations totaled $1.0 billion for fiscal year 2009, compared to cash provided by operations of $258.8 million in 2008 and cash used in operations of $557.0 million in 2007. Operating cash flows in fiscal year 2009 increased from fiscal year 2008 primarily due to net income of $485.7 million in the current year compared to a net loss of $308.6 million in the prior year. Restricted Cash. We hold certain cash balances that are restricted as to use. Cash and cash equivalents restricted totaled $51.7 million at April 30, 2009, and primarily consisted of cash held by our captive insurance subsidiary that will be used to pay claims. CASH FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES Cash provided by investing activities totaled $5.6 million for fiscal year 2009, compared to $1.1 billion in fiscal year 2008 and $1.2 billion used in fiscal year 2007. Acquisitions and Sales. Total cash paid for acquisitions was $293.8 million, $24.9 million and $57.6 million during fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. On November 3, 2008, we acquired the assets and franchise rights of our last major independent franchise operator for an aggregate purchase price of $279.2 million. See Item 8, note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. Total cash received from sales of discontinued operations totaled $304.0 million and $1.1 billion during fiscal years 2009 and 2008, respectively. Mortgage Loans Held for Investment. We received net proceeds of $91.3 million and $207.6 million on our mortgage loans held for investment in fiscal years 2009 and 2008, respectively. We used $954.3 million for originating and purchasing mortgage loans held for investment in fiscal year 2007. CASH FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES Cash used in financing activities totaled $40.2 million for fiscal year 2009, compared to $1.6 billion in fiscal year 2008 and cash provided of $2.0 billion in fiscal year 2007. Changes from prior year amounts are primarily the result of significant borrowings in fiscal year 2007, which were then repaid in fiscal year 2008. Debt. We borrow under our CLOCs to support working capital requirements primarily arising from off season operating losses in our Tax Services and Business Services segments, pay dividends, repurchase treasury shares and acquire businesses. We had no balance outstanding under our CLOCs at April 30, 2009, 2008 or 2007. See additional discussion below in Borrowings. We may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and or exchanges for equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. Issuances of Common Stock. In October 2008, we sold 8.3 million shares of our common stock, without par value, at a price of $17.50 per share in a registered direct offering through subscription agreements with selected institutional investors. We received net proceeds of $141.4 million, after deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses. The purpose of the equity offering was to ensure we maintained adequate equity levels, as a condition of our CLOCs, during our off season. Proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. Proceeds from the issuance of common stock in accordance with our stock based compensation plans totaled $71.6 million, $23.3 million and $25.7 million in fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Dividends. We have consistently paid quarterly dividends. Dividends paid totaled $198.7 million, $183.6 million and $172.0 million in fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. HR BLOCK 2009 Form 10K 29 Table of Contents Share Repurchases. In June 2008, our Board of Directors rescinded the previous authorizations to repurchase shares of our common stock and approved an authorization to purchase up to $2.0 billion of our common stock through June 2012. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009, we repurchased 5.6 million shares pursuant to this authorization at an aggregate price of $98.7 million, or an average price of $17.53 per share. There was $1.9 billion remaining under this authorization at April 30, 2009. Customer Deposits. Customer deposits provided $64.4 million in the current year compared to $345.4 million used in fiscal year 2008 and $1.1 billion provided in fiscal year 2007. These deposits are held by HRB Bank, which is included in the Consumer Financial Services segment. SEGMENT CASH FLOWS A condensed consolidating statement of cash flows by segment for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2009, follows. Generally, interest is not charged on intercompany activities between segments. Our consolidated statements of cash flows are located in Item 8. (in 000s) Consumer Tax Business Financial Discontinued Consolidated Services Services Services Corporate(1) Operations HR Block Cash provided by (used in): Operations $ 531,151 $ 62,213 $ 62,419 $ 298,460 $ 70,196 $ 1,024,439 Investing (313,981 ) (24,691 ) 104,760 (15,594 ) 255,066 5,560 Financing (7,678 ) (2,786 ) 41,037 (75,589 ) 4,783 (40,233 ) Net intercompany (199,582 ) (44,567 ) 19,663 554,531 (330,045 ) (1) Income tax payments, net of refunds of $158.9 million received during fiscal year 2009, are included in Corporate operating cash flows. Tax Services. Tax Services has historically been our largest provider of annual operating cash flows. The seasonal nature of Tax Services generally results in a large positive operating cash flow in the fiscal fourth quarter. Tax Services generated $531.2 million in operating cash flows primarily related to net income, as cash is generally collected from clients at the time services are rendered. Cash used in investing activities of $314.0 million was primarily for business acquisitions and capital expenditures. Our international operations are generally self funded. However, HR Block Canada, Inc. (Block Canada) utilized intercompany borrowings to fund its CashBack program and working capital requirements during the last two fiscal years. Cash balances are held in Canada and Australia independently in local currencies. Business Services. Business Services funding requirements are largely related to receivables for completed work and work in process and funding relating to acquired businesses. We have provided funding in the normal course of business sufficient to cover these working capital needs. Business Services also has future obligations and commitments, which are summarized in Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments. This segment generated $62.2 million in operating cash flows primarily related to net income. Additionally, Business Services used $24.7 million in investing activities primarily related to capital expenditures. Consumer Financial Services. In fiscal year 2009, Consumer Financial Services provided $104.8 million in investing activities primarily due to principal payments received on mortgage loans held for investment. Cash provided by financing activities of $41.0 million is primarily due to changes in customer deposits net of payments on Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) borrowings. HRB Banks current liquidity needs are generally met through deposits from banking clients. HRB Bank has access to traditional funding sources such as deposits, federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements. HRB Bank maintains a credit facility with the FHLB. At April 30, 2009, $100.0 million was drawn under this facility. Block Financial LLC (BFC) made additional capital contributions to HRB Bank of $245.0 million during fiscal year 2009. These contributions were provided for HRB Bank to meet its capital requirements due to seasonal fluctuations in the size of its balance sheet. Also during fiscal year 2009, we submitted an application to the OTS requesting that HRB Bank be allowed to pay dividends to BFC in an amount that would not exceed the capital necessary to continuously maintain HRB Banks required 12.0% leverage ratio. The OTS approved our application on January 12, 2009. HRB Bank paid dividends of $235.0 million to BFC in fiscal year 2009. See additional discussion of regulatory and capital requirements of HRB Bank in Regulatory Environment. We believe the funding sources for Consumer Financial Services are stable. Liquidity risk within this segment is primarily limited to maintaining sufficient capital levels at HRB Bank. Discontinued Operations. Discontinued operations provided $255.1 million in cash from investing activities primarily due to proceeds received from the sale of HRBFA. 30 HR BLOCK 2009 Form 10K Table of Contents BORROWINGS The following chart provides the debt ratings for BFC: April 30, April 30, 2009 2008 Short term Long term Outlook Short term Long term Outlook Moodys P 2 Baa1 Stable P 2 Baa1 Negative SP A 2 BBB Positive A 3 BBB Negative Fitch F2 BBB Stable F3 BBB Negative DBRS R 2 (high ) BBB (high ) Positive R 2 (high ) BBB (high ) Negative At April 30, 2009, we maintained $2.0 billion in revolving credit facilities to support commercial paper issuance and for general corporate purposes. These CLOCs, and any outstanding borrowings thereunder, have a maturity date of August 2010, bear interest in a range of LIBOR plus 14 to 45 basis points per annum and an annual facility fee in a range of 6 to 15 basis points per annum, based on our credit ratings. These lines are subject to various affirmative and negative covenants, including (1) a minimum net worth covenant requiring us to maintain at least $650.0 million of net worth on the last day of any fiscal quarter, (2) limits on our indebtedness and (3) a requirement that we reduce the aggregate outstanding principal amount of short term debt, as defined in the agreement, to $200.0 million or less for a minimum period of thirty consecutive days during the period from March 1 to June 30 of each year (the Clean down requirement). At April 30, 2009, we were in compliance with these covenants and had net worth of $1.4 billion. There was no balance outstanding on this facility at April 30, 2009. Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB (Lehman) is a participating lender in our $2.0 billion CLOCs, with a $50.0 million credit commitment. In September 2008, Lehmans parent company declared bankruptcy. Since then, Lehman has not honored any funding requests under these facilities, thereby effectively reducing our available liquidity under our CLOCs to $1.95 billion. We do not expect this change to have a material impact on our liquidity or consolidated financial statements. On January 11, 2008, we issued $600.0 million of 7.875% Senior Notes under our shelf registration. The Senior Notes are due January 15, 2013 and are not redeemable by the bondholders prior to maturity. The net proceeds of this transaction were used to repay a $500.0 million facility, with the remaining proceeds used for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of April 30, 2009, we had $250.0 million remaining under our shelf registration for additional debt issuances. We entered into a committed line of credit agreement with HSBC Finance Corporation effective January 14, 2009 for use as a funding source for the purchase of RAL participations. This line provided funding totaling $2.5 billion through March 30, 2009 and $120.0 million thereafter through June 30, 2009. This line is subject to various covenants that are similar to our CLOCs and is secured by our RAL participations. All borrowings on this facility were repaid as of April 30, 2009 and the facility is now closed. During fiscal year 2009, borrowing needs in our Canadian operations were funded by corporate borrowings in the U.S. To mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate risk, we used foreign exchange forward contracts. We do not enter into forward contracts for speculative purposes. In estimating the fair value of derivative positions, we utilize quoted market prices, if available, or quotes obtained from external sources. There were no forward contracts outstanding as of April 30, 2009. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS A summary of our obligations to make future payments as of April 30, 2009, is as follows: (in 000s) Less Than Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Long term debt (including interest) $ 1,286,214 $ 67,750 $ 135,500 $ 674,008 $ 408,956 Customer deposits 854,888 442,683 17,649 8,698 385,858 FHLB borrowings 100,000 25,000 75,000 Acquisition payments 30,658 8,263 22,258 91 46 Media advertising purchase obligation 45,768 11,442 22,884 11,442 Capital lease obligations 12,001 519 1,091 1,411 8,980 Operating leases 762,298 248,712 315,263 118,859 79,464 Total contractual cash obligations $ 3,091,827 $ 804,369 $ 589,645 $ 814,509 $ 883,304 The amount of liabilities recorded in connection with FIN 48 that we expect to pay within twelve months is $15.1 million at April 30, 2009 and is included in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. The remaining amount is included in other noncurrent liabilities on our HR BLOCK 2009 Form 10K 31 Table of Contents consolidated balance sheet. Because the ultimate amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty, the estimated FIN 48 liability has been excluded from the table above.

REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT HRB Bank is a federal savings bank and HR Block, Inc. is a savings and loan holding company. As a result, each is subject to regulation by the OTS. Federal savings banks are subject to extensive regulation and examination by the OTS, their primary federal regulator, as well as the FDIC. In conjunction with HR Block, Inc.s application with the OTS for HRB Bank, HR Block, Inc. made commitments as part of our charter approval order (Master Commitment) which included, but were not limited to: (1) HR Block, Inc. to maintain a three percent minimum ratio of adjusted tangible capital to adjusted total assets, as defined by the OTS; (2) maintain all HRB Bank capital within HRB Bank in accordance with the submitted three year business plan; and (3) follow federal regulations surrounding intercompany transactions and approvals. Effective April 30, 2008, the three percent minimum ratio of adjusted tangible capital to adjusted total assets requirement was eliminated and a Supervisory Directive relating to prior non compliance with this requirement was rescinded. All savings associations are subject to the capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. HRB Bank must meet specific capital guidelines involving quantitative measures of HRB Banks assets, liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. HRB Banks capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. As of March 31, 2009, our most recent Thrift Financial Report (TFR) filing with the OTS, HRB bank was a well capitalized institution under the prompt corrective action provisions of the FDIC. See Item 8, note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of regulatory capital requirements and classifications. HRB Bank is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of HR Block, Inc. and its customer deposits are insured by the FDIC. If an insured institution fails, claims for administrative expenses of the receiver and for deposits in U.S. branches (including claims of the FDIC as subrogee of the failed institution) have priority over the claims of general unsecured creditors. In addition, the FDIC has authority to require HR Block, Inc. to reimburse it for losses it incurs in connection with the failure of HRB Bank or with the FDICs provision of assistance to a banking subsidiary that is in danger of failure. HR Block, Inc. is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiary, HRB Bank. Various federal and state statutory provisions and regulations limit the amount of dividends HRB Bank may pay without regulatory approval. The OTS has authority to prohibit HRB Bank from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their business. The payment of dividends, depending on the financial condition of the bank, could be deemed an unsafe or unsound practice. The ability of HRB Bank to pay dividends in the future is currently, and could be further, influenced by bank regulatory policies and capital guidelines. The U.S., various state, local, provincial and foreign governments and some self regulatory organizations have enacted statutes and ordinances, and or adopted rules and regulations, regulating aspects of our business. These aspects include, but are not limited to, commercial income tax return preparers, income tax courses, the electronic filing of income tax returns, the facilitation of RALs, loan originations and assistance in loan originations, mortgage lending, privacy, consumer protection, franchising, sales methods, banking, accountants and the accounting practice. We seek to determine the applicability of such statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations (collectively, Laws) and comply with those Laws. From time to time in the ordinary course of business, we receive inquiries from governmental and self regulatory agencies regarding the applicability of Laws to our services and products. In response to past inquiries, we have agreed to comply with such Laws, convinced the authorities that such Laws were not applicable or that 32 HR BLOCK 2009 Form 10K Table of Contents compliance already exists and or modified our activities in the applicable jurisdiction to avoid the application of all or certain parts of such Laws. We believe the past resolution of such inquiries and our ongoing compliance with Laws has not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. We cannot predict what effect future Laws, changes in interpretations of existing Laws or the results of future regulator inquiries with respect to the applicability of Laws may have on our consolidated financial statements. See additional discussion of legal matters in Item 3, Legal Proceedings and Item 8, note 18 to our consolidated financial statements. FUTURE LEGISLATION In light of current conditions in the U.S. and global financial markets and the U.S. and global economy, regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry. Proposals that could substantially intensify the regulation of the financial services industry are expected to be introduced in the U.S. Congress, in state legislatures and from applicable regulatory authorities. These proposals may change banking statutes and regulation and our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, these proposals could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions and other financial institutions. We cannot predict whether any of these proposals will be enacted and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any impending regulations, would have on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

RECONCILIATION OF NON GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION We report our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, we believe certain non GAAP performance measures and ratios used in managing the business may provide additional meaningful comparisons between current year results and prior periods. Reconciliations to GAAP financial measures for common banking ratios are provided below. These non GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, not as an alternative for, our reported GAAP results.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK GENERAL INTEREST RATE RISK We have a formal investment policy that strives to minimize the market risk exposure of our cash equivalents and available for sale (AFS) securities, which are primarily affected by credit quality and movements in interest rates. These guidelines focus on managing liquidity and preserving principal and earnings. Our cash equivalents are primarily held for liquidity purposes and are comprised of high quality, short term investments, including qualified money market funds. Because our cash and cash equivalents have a relatively short maturity, our portfolios market value is relatively insensitive to interest rate changes. See additional discussion of interest rate risk included below in Consumer Financial Services. As our short term borrowings are generally seasonal, interest rate risk typically increases through our third fiscal quarter and declines to zero by fiscal year end. While the market value of short term borrowings is relatively insensitive to interest rate changes, interest expense on short term borrowings will increase and decrease with changes in the underlying short term interest rates. See Item 7, Financial Condition for additional information. Our long term debt at April 30, 2009, consists primarily of fixed rate Senior Notes; therefore, a change in interest rates would have no impact on consolidated pretax earnings. See Item 8, note 9 to our consolidated financial statements. EQUITY PRICE RISK We have limited exposure to the equity markets. Our primary exposure is through our deferred compensation plans. Within the deferred compensation plans, we have mismatches in asset and liability amounts and investment choices (both fixed income and equity). At April 30, 2009 and 2008, the impact of a 10% market value change in the combined equity assets held by our deferred compensation plans and other equity investments would be approximately $7.3 million and $12.2 million, respectively, assuming no offset for the liabilities. TAX SERVICES FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE RISK Our operations in international markets are exposed to movements in currency exchange rates. The currencies involved are the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar. We translate revenues and expenses related to these operations at the average of exchange rates in effect during the period. Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing at the end of the year. Translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of other comprehensive income in stockholders equity. Translation of financial results into U.S. dollars does not presently materially affect and has not historically materially affected our consolidated financial results, although such changes do affect the year to year comparability of the operating results in U.S. dollars of our international businesses. We estimate a 10% change in foreign exchange rates by itself would impact consolidated net income in fiscal years 2009 and 2008 by 36 HR BLOCK 2009 Form 10K Table of Contents approximately $3.0 million and $3.2 million, respectively, and cash balances at April 30, 2009 and 2008 by $5.4 million and $4.0 million, respectively. During fiscal year 2009, borrowing needs in our Canadian operations were funded by corporate borrowings in the U.S. To mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate risk, we used forward foreign exchange contracts. We do not enter into forward contracts for speculative purposes. In estimating the fair value of derivative positions, we utilized quoted market prices, if available, or quotes obtained from external sources. When foreign currency financial instruments are outstanding, exposure to market risk on these instruments results from fluctuations in currency rates during the periods in which the contracts are outstanding. The counterparties to our currency exchange contracts consist of major financial institutions, each of which is rated investment grade. We are exposed to credit risk to the extent of potential non performance by counterparties on financial instruments. Any potential credit exposure does not exceed the fair value. We believe the risk of incurring losses due to credit risk is remote. At April 30, 2009 we had no forward exchange contracts outstanding. CONSUMER FINANCIAL SERVICES INTEREST RATE RISK At April 30, 2009, approximately 67% of HRB Banks total assets were residential mortgage loans with 35% of these fixed rate loans and 65% adjustable rate loans. These loans are sensitive to changes in interest rates as well as expected prepayment levels. As interest rates increase, fixed rate residential mortgages tend to exhibit lower prepayments. The opposite is true in a falling rate environment. When mortgage loans prepay, mortgage origination costs are written off. Depending on the timing of the prepayment, the write offs of mortgage origination costs may result in lower than anticipated yields. At April 30, 2009, HRB Banks other investments consisted primarily of mortgage backed securities and FHLB stock. See table below for sensitivity analysis of our mortgage backed securities. HRB Banks liabilities consist primarily of transactional deposit relationships, such as prepaid debit card accounts and checking accounts. Other liabilities include money market accounts, certificates of deposit and collateralized borrowings from the FHLB. Money market accounts re price as interest rates change. Certificates of deposit re price over time depending on maturities. FHLB advances generally have fixed rates ranging from one day through multiple years. Under criteria published by the OTS, HRB Banks overall interest rate risk exposure at March 31, 2009, the most recent date an evaluation was completed, was characterized as minimal. We actively manage our interest rate risk positions. As interest rates change, we will adjust our strategy and mix of assets and liabilities to optimize our position. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS The sensitivities of certain financial instruments to changes in interest rates as of April 30, 2009 and 2008 are presented below. The following table represents hypothetical instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in interest rates and should not be relied on as an indicator of future expected results. The impact of a change in interest rates on other factors, such as delinquency and prepayment rates, is not included in the analysis below.
