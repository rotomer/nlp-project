ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our subsidiaries provide tax preparation, retail banking and various business advisory and consulting services. We are the only major company offering a full range of software, online and in office tax preparation solutions to individual tax clients. Effective May 1, 2009, we realigned certain segments of our business to reflect a new management reporting structure. The operations of HRB Bank, which was previously reported as the Consumer Financial Services segment, have now been reclassified, with activities that support our retail tax network included in the Tax Services segment, and the net interest margin and gains and losses relating to our portfolio of mortgage loans held for investment and related assets included in the corporate segment. Presentation of prior period results reflects the new segment reporting structure. HR BLOCK 2010 Form 10K 17 Table of Contents OVERVIEW A summary of our fiscal year 2010 results is as follows: Revenues for the fiscal year were $3.9 billion, down 5.1% from prior year results. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 4.6% from the prior year to $1.46. U.S. tax returns prepared by us declined 4.3% from the prior year primarily due to a decline in overall IRS filings and lower employment levels. Lower employment levels disproportionately impacted our key client segments where fourth quarter 2009 unemployment levels ranged from 15 30%, far in excess of national unemployment levels. Revenues in our Tax Services segment decreased 5.0% from the prior year. Pretax income for this segment decreased $59.7 million, or 6.4%, due primarily to the decline in tax returns prepared. Pretax income for the Business Services segment decreased 38.9% from the prior year, due to lower than expected revenues, a $15.0 million goodwill impairment charge, and a $14.5 million increase in expenses related to arbitration proceedings and other litigation.

Tax preparation fees decreased $162.8 million, or 7.6%, due to a 10.3% decrease in U.S. retail tax returns prepared in company owned offices, partially offset by a 0.6% increase in the net average fee per U.S. retail tax return. Adjusting for the effect of company owned offices sold to franchisees during fiscal year 2010, the HR BLOCK 2010 Form 10K 19 Table of Contents decline in tax returns prepared in company owned offices was 6.7% from fiscal 2009 to 2010. The 6.7% decrease in U.S. retail tax returns prepared in company owned offices is primarily due to the following factors: Tax returns filed with the IRS declined 1.7%. Lower employment levels disproportionately impacted our key client segments. Fourth quarter 2009 unemployment levels ranged from 15 30%, far in excess of national unemployment levels for key client segments. We closed certain under performing offices and exited offices serving clients in Wal Mart locations. We believe that tax returns prepared declined by approximately 1% (net of client retention through other office locations) as a result of these office closures. Royalties increased $20.0 million, or 7.8%, due to the conversion of 267 company owned offices into franchises, partially offset by a decline in tax returns prepared in existing franchise offices. Interest income on Emerald Advance lines of credit decreased $13.1 million, or 14.4%. This decline was primarily a result of lower loan volumes due to these lines of credit only being offered to prior year tax clients in fiscal year 2010, while being offered to both prior and new clients in fiscal year 2009. Other revenue decreased $10.8 million, or 3.4%, primarily due to a $12.5 million decline in license fees earned from bank products, mainly RACs, and a decrease in software revenues. Total expenses decreased $97.1 million, or 4.4%, compared to the prior year. Total compensation and benefits decreased $41.1 million, or 3.9%, primarily as a result of lower commission based wages due to the decline in the number of tax returns prepared. Bad debt expense decreased $7.3 million, or 6.5%, primarily as a result of lower Emerald Advance lines of credit and RAL volumes, and more restrictive underwriting criteria. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $13.9 million, or 17.5%, primarily as a result of amortization of intangible assets, related to the November 2008 acquisition of our last major independent franchise operator. Other expenses decreased $31.4 million, or 10.7%, primarily as a result of lower legal expenses. During fiscal year 2010 we recognized gains of $49.1 million on the sale of certain company owned offices to franchisees, compared to $14.9 million in the prior year. We do not expect these gains to continue at a similar level during fiscal year 2011. Pretax income for fiscal year 2010 decreased $59.7 million, or 6.4%, from 2009. As a result of the declines in revenues, pretax margin for the segment decreased from 29.6% in fiscal year 2009, to 29.2% in fiscal year 2010. FISCAL 2009 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2008 Tax Services revenues increased $71.4 million, or 2.3%, compared to fiscal year 2008. Tax preparation fees from our retail offices increased $58.6 million, or 2.8%, for fiscal year 2009. This increase is primarily due to an increase of 6.8% in the net average fee per U.S. tax return prepared in company owned offices, offset by a 2.8% decrease in the number of U.S. tax returns prepared in those offices. Tax return volume was positively affected by the November 2008 acquisition of our last major independent franchise operator, which resulted in an increase of 470,000 tax returns prepared in company owned offices. See Item 8, note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on this acquisition. Excluding operating results attributable to the acquired franchise operator, tax returns prepared in company owned offices decreased 7.3% from fiscal year 2008 and tax preparation fees decreased $32.9 million. Increases in our net average fee were due primarily to increased tax return complexity. In addition, planned pricing increases of approximately 1% and lower discounts contributed to an increase in net average fee. We believe that declines during the year in tax return volume were attributable to a decline of approximately 6% in IRS tax filings overall, and difficult economic conditions which resulted in clients seeking lower cost tax preparation alternatives. Tax returns prepared in our international operations grew 5.1%, and the related tax preparation revenues increased 8.9% in local currencies. However, unfavorable exchange rates caused these revenues in U.S. dollars to decline $9.5 million, or 5.6%, from fiscal year 2008. Royalty revenue increased $17.6 million, or 7.4%, primarily due to a 7.2% increase in the net average fee and an increase in royalty rates at sub franchises of the acquired franchise operator. Loan participation fees and related revenues decreased $50.4 million, or 26.5%, from fiscal year 2008. This decrease is primarily due to a 24.6% decline in RAL volume, mainly as a result of many clients choosing lower cost alternatives such as RACs rather than a loan. In addition, stricter credit criteria were required by our third party loan originator. Fees from Emerald Card activities and interest income on Emerald Advance increased $19.6 million and $45.7 million, respectively, both primarily as a result of higher volumes. Other revenues decreased $17.3 million, or 5.2%, primarily due to a $10.6 million decline in e filing revenues, as a result of the elimination of separate e filing fees related to our tax preparation software and a decline in software revenues. These declines were partially offset by $10.7 million in additional license fees earned from bank products, mainly RACs. 20 HR BLOCK 2010 Form 10K Table of Contents Total expenses decreased $29.9 million, or 1.3%, compared with fiscal year 2008, due primarily to lower tax return volumes, lower bad debt on loan products and planned cost reduction initiatives. Compensation and benefits decreased $39.7 million, or 3.7%, from fiscal year 2008 as a result of a decrease in commission based wages resulting from a corresponding decrease in tax returns prepared. Marketing and advertising increased $46.6 million, or 25.9%, primarily due to a planned increase in marketing costs. Bad debt expense decreased $17.6 million, or 13.6%, primarily due to lower RAL volumes and the impact of loss provisions in fiscal year 2008 which did not repeat in fiscal year 2009. During fiscal year 2009 we sold certain company owned offices to franchisees, recognizing a net gain of $14.9 million. Pretax income for fiscal year 2009 increased $101.3 million, or 12.3%, from 2008. As a result of cost reduction initiatives and the acquisition of our last major franchise operator, pretax margin for the segment increased from 27.0% in fiscal year 2008, to 29.6% in fiscal year 2009. BUSINESS SERVICES This segment offers tax and consulting services, wealth management and capital market services to middle market companies.

Revenues from core tax, consulting and accounting services decreased $21.3 million, or 2.8%, from the prior year. Tax and accounting services revenues decreased $29.3 million and $5.2 million, respectively, primarily due to decreases in chargeable hours and pressures on billable rates. Business consulting revenues increased $13.2 million, or 5.3%, over the prior year primarily due to a large engagement in our operational consulting practice. Continued weak economic conditions in recent years have severely reduced investment and transaction activity. As a result, revenues from our capital markets business have been declining severely, including a decline in revenues of $6.4 million, or 34.9%, from fiscal year 2009. As noted below, we recorded an impairment of goodwill associated with this business during fiscal year 2010. Other revenue declined $12.8 million, or 13.1%, primarily due to lower management fee revenues and interest income received from MP. Total expenses were essentially flat compared to the prior year. Compensation and benefits decreased $14.0 million, or 2.4%, primarily due to headcount reductions driven by reduced client demand. Marketing and advertising costs decreased $4.8 million, or 20.3%, primarily due to fewer sponsorships and lower advertising costs. Other expenses increased $21.5 million primarily due to a $15.0 million impairment of goodwill at RSM EquiCo, Inc. (RSM EquiCo), as discussed in Item 8, note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, and increased legal expenses. Pretax income for the year ended April 30, 2010 of $58.7 million compares to $96.1 million in the prior year. Pretax margin for the segment decreased from 10.7% in fiscal year 2009, to 6.8% in fiscal year 2010, primarily due to poor results in our capital markets business and a reduction of revenue in our core businesses. FISCAL 2009 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2008 Business Services revenues for fiscal year 2009 decreased $43.9 million, or 4.7%, from fiscal year 2008, primarily due to declines in capital markets, leased employee revenues and outside contractor services. HR BLOCK 2010 Form 10K 21 Table of Contents Revenues from core tax, consulting and accounting services increased $25.0 million, or 3.4%, over fiscal year 2008. Tax services revenues increased $15.9 million, or 3.6%, due to increases in net billed rate per hour. Business consulting revenues increased $12.2 million, or 5.2%, primarily due to a large one time financial institutions engagement. Weak economic conditions in fiscal year 2009 severely reduced investment and transaction activity. As a result, capital markets revenues decreased $32.9 million, or 64.4%, from fiscal year 2008 primarily due to a 57.4% decline in the number of transactions closed. Leased employee revenue decreased due to a change in organizational structure between the businesses we acquired from American Express Tax and Business Services, Inc. (AmexTBS) and the Attest Firms that, while not affiliates of our company, also serve our clients. Employees we previously leased to the Attest Firms were transferred to the separate attest practices in fiscal years 2008 and 2007. As a result, we no longer record the revenues and expenses associated with leasing these employees, which resulted in a reduction of $25.0 million to fiscal year 2009 revenues, and a similar reduction in compensation and benefits. Other revenue declined $12.0 million, or 11.0%, primarily due to a decrease in outside contractor services provided to our clients. Total expenses decreased $51.2 million, or 6.0%, compared to fiscal year 2008. Other expenses decreased $45.2 million, or 30.2%, primarily due to declines in external consulting fees, allocated corporate and support department costs and travel and entertainment expenses. Pretax income for the year ended April 30, 2009 of $96.1 million compares to $88.8 million in fiscal year 2008. Pretax margin for the segment increased from 9.4% in fiscal year 2008, to 10.7% in fiscal year 2009. CORPORATE, ELIMINATIONS AND INCOME TAXES ON CONTINUING OPERATIONS Corporate operating losses include interest income from U.S. passive investments, interest expense on borrowings, net interest margin and gains or losses relating to mortgage loans held for investment, real estate owned, residual interests in securitizations and other corporate expenses, principally related to finance, legal and other support departments. Corporate Operating Results (in 000s) Year Ended April 30, 2010 2009 2008 Interest income on mortgage loans held for investment $ 31,877 $ 46,396 $ 74,895 Other 6,854 7,295 9,388 Total revenues 38,731 53,691 84,283 Interest expense 79,929 92,945 92,923 Provision for loan losses 47,750 63,897 42,004 Compensation and benefits 53,607 48,973 115,479 Other, net (614 ) 31,651 13,324 Total expense 180,672 237,466 263,730 Pretax loss $ (141,941 ) $ (183,775 ) $ (179,447 ) FISCAL YEAR 2010 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR 2009 Interest income earned on mortgage loans held for investment for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2010 decreased $14.5 million, or 31.3%, from the prior year, primarily as a result of non performing loans. Interest expense decreased $13.0 million, or 14.0%, due to lower funding costs related to our mortgage loan portfolio and lower corporate borrowings. Our provision for loan losses decreased $16.1 million from the prior year. See related discussion below under Mortgage Loans Held for Investment. Other expenses declined $32.3 million primarily due to gains of $9.0 million on residual interests in the current year, compared to impairments of $3.1 million recorded in the prior year. Additionally, we transferred liabilities relating to previously retained insurance risk to a third party, and recorded a gain of $9.5 million in fiscal year 2010. Income Taxes on Continuing Operations Our effective tax rate for continuing operations was 37.6% for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2010, compared to 38.9% in the prior year. Our effective tax rates declined from the prior year due to a reduction in our valuation allowance related to tax planning strategies and favorable tax benefits related to investment gains on our corporate owned life insurance investments. Mortgage Loans Held for Investment Mortgage loans held for investment at April 30, 2010 totaled $595.4 million. The portfolio includes loans originated by SCC, and purchased by HRB Bank which constituted approximately 64% of the total loan portfolio at April 30, 2010. We have experienced higher rates of delinquency and have greater exposure to loss with respect to this segment of our loan portfolio. Our remaining loan portfolio totaled $249.0 million and is more characteristic of a prime loan portfolio, and we believe subject to a lower loss exposure. 22 HR BLOCK 2010 Form 10K Table of Contents Detail of our mortgage loans held for investment and the related allowance, excluding unamortized deferred fees and costs of $5.3 million and $7.1 million at April 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively, is as follows: (dollars in 000s) Outstanding Loan Loss Allowance % 30+ Days Principal Balance Amount % of Principal Past Due As of April 30, 2010: Purchased from SCC $ 434,644 $ 82,793 19.1% 37.8% All other 249,040 10,742 4.3% 8.9% $ 683,684 $ 93,535 13.7% 27.3% As of April 30, 2009: Purchased from SCC $ 531,233 $ 78,067 14.7% 28.7% All other 290,604 6,006 2.1% 4.4% $ 821,837 $ 84,073 10.2% 20.2% We recorded a provision for loan loss of $47.8 million during fiscal year 2010, compared to $63.9 million in the prior year. Our allowance for loan losses as a percent of mortgage loans was 13.7%, or $93.5 million, at April 30, 2010, compared to 10.2%, or $84.1 million, at April 30, 2009. This allowance represents our best estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet dates. FISCAL YEAR 2009 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR 2008 Interest income earned on mortgage loans held for investment for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2009 decreased $28.5 million, or 38.1%, from fiscal year 2008, primarily as a result of non performing loans. Our provision for loan losses increased $21.9 million from fiscal year 2008 primarily due to declines in residential home prices and higher projected delinquencies. Compensation and benefits decreased $66.5 million, or 57.6%, primarily due to severance related costs recorded in fiscal year 2008, coupled with benefits in fiscal year 2009 resulting from the staff reductions. Other expenses increased $18.3 million primarily due to an $11.9 million write down of REO property during fiscal year 2009. Income Taxes on Continuing Operations Our effective tax rate for continuing operations was 38.9% for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2009, compared to 39.3% in fiscal year 2008. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Effective November 1, 2008, we sold HR Block Financial Advisors, Inc. (HRBFA) to Ameriprise Financial, Inc. HRBFA and its direct corporate parent are presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. Our discontinued operations also include our former mortgage loan origination and servicing business, as well as three smaller lines of business previously reported in our Business Services segment. FISCAL 2010 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009 The net loss from discontinued operations for fiscal year 2010 was $9.7 million compared to a net loss of $27.4 million in the prior year. The decline in losses was due to a loss on the disposition of HRBFA totaling $12.2 million in fiscal year 2009 compared with a gain of $6.2 million in fiscal year 2010 relating to post disposition purchase price adjustments. FISCAL 2009 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2008 The pretax loss of our discontinued operations for fiscal year 2009 was $47.6 million compared to a loss of $1.2 billion in the prior year. The loss from discontinued operations for fiscal year 2008 included significant losses from our former mortgage loan businesses, including losses relating to loan repurchase obligations of $582.4 million and impairments of residual interests of $137.8 million. Net of applicable tax benefits, the loss from discontinued operations for fiscal year 2009 was $27.4 million compared to a loss of $754.6 million in fiscal year 2008. Our effective tax rate for discontinued operations was 42.5% and 35.3% for the fiscal years 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our effective tax rate increased primarily due to a tax benefit recorded in conjunction with the sale of HRBFA. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We consider the estimates discussed below to be critical to understanding our financial statements, as they require the use of significant judgment and estimation in order to measure, at a specific point in time, matters that are inherently uncertain. Specific risks for these critical accounting estimates are described in the following paragraphs. We have reviewed and discussed each of these estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board HR BLOCK 2010 Form 10K 23 Table of Contents of Directors. For all of these estimates, we caution that future events rarely develop precisely as forecasted and estimates routinely require adjustment and may require material adjustment. ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES The principal amount of mortgage loans held for investment totaled $683.7 million at April 30, 2010. We are exposed to the risk that borrowers may not repay amounts owed to us when they become contractually due. We record an allowance representing our estimate of credit losses inherent in the portfolio of loans held for investment at the balance sheet date. Determination of our allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because loss provisions can be material to our operating results, projections of loan delinquencies and related matters are inherently subjective, and actual losses are impacted by factors outside of our control including economic conditions, unemployment rates and residential home prices. We record a loan loss allowance for loans less than 60 days past due on a pooled basis. The aggregate principal balance of these loans totaled $372.7 million at April 30, 2010, and the portion of our allowance for loan losses allocated to these loans totaled $16.2 million. In estimating our loan loss allowance for these loans, we stratify the loan portfolio based on our view of risk associated with various elements of the pool and assign estimated loss rates based on those risks. Loss rates are based primarily on historical experience and our assessment of economic and market conditions. Loss rates consider both the rate at which loans will become delinquent (frequency) and the amount of loss that will ultimately be realized upon occurrence of a liquidation of collateral (severity). Frequency rates are based primarily on historical migration analysis of loans to delinquent status. Severity rates are based primarily on recent broker quotes or appraisals of collateral. Because of imprecision and uncertainty inherent in developing estimates of future credit losses, in particular during periods of rapidly declining collateral values or increasing delinquency rates, our estimation process includes development of ranges of possible outcomes. Ranges were developed by stressing initial estimates of both frequency and severity rates. Stressing of frequency and severity assumptions is intended to model deterioration in credit quality that is difficult to predict during declining economic conditions. Future deterioration in credit quality may exceed our modeled assumptions. Mortgage loans held for investment include loans originated by our affiliate, SCC, and purchased by HRB Bank. We have greater exposure to loss with respect to this segment of our loan portfolio as a result of historically higher delinquency rates. Therefore, we assign higher frequency rate assumptions to SCC originated loans compared with loans originated by other third party banks as we consider estimates of future losses. At April 30, 2010 our weighted average frequency assumption was 15% for SCC originated loans compared to 4% for remaining loans in the portfolio. Loans 60 days past due are considered impaired and are reviewed individually. We record loss estimates typically based on the value of the underlying collateral. Our specific loan loss allowance for these impaired loans reflected an average loss severity of approximately 41% at April 30, 2010. The aggregate principal balance of impaired loans totaled $165.9 million at April 30, 2010, and the portion of our allowance for loan losses allocated to these loans totaled $68.7 million. Modified loans that meet the definition of a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) are also considered impaired and are reviewed individually. We record impairment equal to the difference between the principal balance of the loan and the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate. However, if we assess that foreclosure of a modified loan is probable, we record impairment based on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral. The aggregate principal balance of TDR loans totaled $145.0 million at April 30, 2010, and the portion of our allowance for loan losses allocated to these loans totaled $8.9 million. The loan loss allowance as a percent of mortgage loans held for investment was 13.7% at April 30, 2010, compared to 10.2% at April 30, 2009. The percentage increased significantly during the current year primarily as a result of declining collateral values due to lower residential home prices and modeled expectations for future loan delinquencies in the portfolio. The residential mortgage industry has experienced significant adverse trends for an extended period. If adverse trends continue for a sustained period or at rates worse than modeled by us, we may be required to record additional loan loss provisions, and those losses may be significant. Determining the allowance for loan losses for loans held for investment requires us to make estimates of losses that are highly uncertain and requires a high degree of judgment. If our underlying assumptions prove to be inaccurate, the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses. Our mortgage loan portfolio is a static pool, as we are no longer originating or purchasing new mortgage loans, and we believe that factor, over time, will limit variability in our loss estimates. MORTGAGE LOAN REPURCHASE OBLIGATION SCC is obligated to repurchase loans sold or securitized in the event of a breach of representations and warranties it made to purchasers or insurers of such loans, or otherwise indemnify certain third parties for losses incurred by them. SCC records a liability for contingent losses relating to representation and warranty claims by estimating loan repurchase volumes and indemnification obligations for both known claims and projections of expected future claims. Projections of future claims are 24 HR BLOCK 2010 Form 10K Table of Contents based on an analysis that includes a combination of reviewing historical repurchase trends, developing loss expectations on loans sold or securitized, and predicting the level at which previously originated loans may be subject to valid claims regarding representation and warranty breaches. Based on an analysis as of April 30, 2010, SCC estimated its liability for loan repurchase and indemnification obligations pertaining to claims of breach of representation and warranties to be $188.2 million. Actual losses charged against this reserve during fiscal year 2010 totaled $18.4 million. To the extent that valid claim volumes in the future exceed current estimates, or the value of mortgage loans and residential home prices decline, future losses may be greater than our current estimates and those differences may be significant. See Item 8, note 16 to our consolidated financial statements. LITIGATION It is our policy to routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes related to legal matters, as well as ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of the reserves required, if any, for these contingencies is made after analysis of each known issue and an analysis of historical experience. Therefore, we have recorded reserves related to certain legal matters for which we believe it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the range of such loss can be estimated. With respect to other matters, we have concluded that a loss is only reasonably possible or remote, or is not estimable and, therefore, no liability is recorded. Assessing the likely outcome of pending litigation, including the amount of potential loss, if any, is highly subjective. Our judgments regarding likelihood of loss and our estimates of probable loss amounts may differ from actual results due to difficulties in predicting the outcome of jury trials, arbitration hearings, settlement discussions and related activity, predicting the outcome of class certification actions and various other uncertainties. Due to the number of claims which are periodically asserted against us, and the magnitude of damages sought in those claims, actual losses in the future may significantly exceed our current estimates. VALUATION OF GOODWILL The evaluation of goodwill for impairment is a critical accounting estimate due both to the magnitude of our goodwill balances, and the judgment involved in determining the fair value of our reporting units. Goodwill balances totaled $840.4 million as of April 30, 2010 and $850.2 million as of April 30, 2009. We test goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change which would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. Our goodwill impairment analysis is based on a discounted cash flow approach and market comparables. This analysis, at the reporting unit level, requires significant management judgment with respect to revenue and expense forecasts, anticipated changes in working capital and the selection and application of an appropriate discount rate. Changes in projections or assumptions could materially affect our estimate of reporting unit fair values. The use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted future operating cash flows and could affect our conclusions regarding the existence or amount of potential impairment. Finally, strategic changes in our outlook regarding reporting units or intangible assets may alter our valuation approach and could result in changes to our conclusions regarding impairment. Estimates of fair value for certain of our reporting units exceed the corresponding carrying value by a significant margin. In certain instances, however, the excess of estimated fair value over carrying value is not significant. Future estimates of fair value may be adversely impacted by declining economic conditions. In addition, if future operating results of our reporting units are below our current modeled expectations, fair value estimates may decline. Any of these factors could result in future impairments, and those impairments could be significant. In assessing potential goodwill impairment of our RSM reporting unit, we estimate fair value based on an assumption that the collaboration between RSM and MP under their alternative practice structure arrangement will continue. Were MP to exit the alternative practice structure, or the collaboration between these two businesses otherwise cease, we believe our fair value estimates could be lower than presently assumed. In addition, adverse business results for MP could also negatively impact our fair value estimates for RSM. Goodwill balances for RSM totaled $374.5 million at April 30, 2010. In fiscal year 2010, the estimated fair value of our RSM reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 30%. We recorded a goodwill impairment of $15.0 million related to our RSM EquiCo reporting unit within our Business Services segment in the third quarter of fiscal year 2010, leaving a remaining goodwill balance of $14.3 million. Operating results for this reporting unit have been declining and continued poor results could result in further impairment. We have a separate reporting unit within our Tax Services segment with a goodwill balance totaling $28.6 million at April 30, 2010. Operating activities of the business consist principally of the development and sale of commercial tax preparation software. The estimated fair value of this reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 8% at April 30, 2010. See Item 8, note 8 to our consolidated financial statements. INCOME TAXES Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach under U.S. GAAP. HR BLOCK 2010 Form 10K 25 Table of Contents We calculate our current and deferred tax provision for the fiscal year based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the applicable calendar year. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded in the appropriate periods when identified. We file a consolidated federal tax return on a calendar year basis, generally in the second fiscal quarter of the subsequent year. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We have considered taxable income in carry back periods, historical and forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. Determination of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets requires that we make judgments about future matters that are not certain, including projections of future taxable income and evaluating potential tax planning strategies. To the extent that actual results differ from our current assumptions, the valuation allowance will increase or decrease. In the event we were to determine we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination. Likewise, if we later determine it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance. The income tax laws of jurisdictions in which we operate are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and applicable government taxing authorities. Income tax returns filed by us are based on our interpretation of these rules. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which may result in proposed assessments, including assessments of interest and or penalties. Our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly subjective and based on our best judgments. Actual results may differ from our current judgments due to a variety of factors, including changes in law, interpretations of law by taxing authorities that differ from our assessments, changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate and results of routine tax examinations. We believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters. However, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved, or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire. As a result, our effective tax rate may fluctuate on a quarterly basis. REVENUE RECOGNITION We have many different revenue sources, each governed by specific revenue recognition policies. Our revenue recognition policies can be found in Item 8, note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. OTHER SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Other significant accounting estimates, not involving the same level of judgment or uncertainty as those discussed above are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements. These estimates may require judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance. Certain of these matters are among topics currently under reexamination by accounting standard setters and regulators. Although specific conclusions reached by these standard setters may cause a material change in our accounting estimates, outcomes cannot be predicted with confidence. See Item 8, note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, which discusses accounting estimates we have selected when there are acceptable alternatives and new or proposed accounting standards that may affect our financial reporting in the future. FINANCIAL CONDITION CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Our sources of capital include cash from operations, cash from customer deposits, issuances of common stock and debt. We use capital primarily to fund working capital, pay dividends, repurchase treasury shares and acquire businesses. Our operations are highly seasonal and therefore generally require the use of cash to fund operating losses during the period May through mid January. Given the likely availability of a number of liquidity options discussed herein, including borrowing capacity under our CLOC, we believe, that in the absence of any unexpected developments, our existing sources of capital at April 30, 2010 are sufficient to meet our operating needs. These comments should be read in conjunction with the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included in Item 8. (in 000s) Year Ended April 30, 2010 2009 2008 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 587,469 $ 1,024,439 $ 258,760 Investing activities 31,353 5,560 1,147,289 Financing activities (481,118 ) (40,233 ) (1,558,069 ) Effect of exchange rates on cash 11,678 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 149,382 $ 989,766 $ (152,020 ) 26 HR BLOCK 2010 Form 10K Table of Contents CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES Cash provided by operations decreased $437.0 million from fiscal year 2009 primarily due to income tax payments of $359.6 million in the current year, compared to refunds received in the prior year. Restricted Cash. We hold certain cash balances that are restricted as to use. Cash and cash equivalents restricted totaled $34.4 million at April 30, 2010, and primarily consisted of cash held by our captive insurance subsidiary that will be used to pay claims. CASH FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES Changes in cash provided by investing activities primarily relate to the following: Mortgage Loans Held for Investment. We received net proceeds of $72.8 million, $91.3 million and $207.6 million on our mortgage loans held for investment in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Purchases of Property and Equipment. Total cash paid for property and equipment was $90.5 million, $97.9 million and $101.6 million for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Business Acquisitions. Total cash paid for acquisitions was $10.5 million, $293.8 million and $24.9 million during fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In November 2008, we acquired our last major independent franchise operator for an aggregate purchase price of $279.2 million. Sales of Businesses. In fiscal year 2010, we sold 267 tax offices to franchisees for proceeds of $65.7 million. In fiscal year 2009, we sold certain tax offices to franchisees for proceeds of $16.9 million. The majority of these sales were financed through Franchise Equity Lines of Credit (FELCs). The increase in the lines of credit is also included in investing activities. Discontinued Operations. In fiscal year 2009, we sold our financial advisor business for proceeds of $304.0 million. In fiscal year 2008, we sold our former mortgage loan origination and servicing business, as well as three smaller lines of business previously reported in our Business Services segment, for cash proceeds of $1.1 billion. CASH FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES Changes in cash used in financing activities primarily relate to the following: Short Term Borrowings. We had no short term borrowings outstanding at April 30, 2010. Customer Banking Deposits. Customer banking deposits provided $17.5 million in the current year compared to $64.4 million provided in fiscal year 2009 and $345.4 million used in fiscal year 2008. These deposits are held by HRB Bank Dividends. We have consistently paid quarterly dividends. Dividends paid totaled $200.9 million, $198.7 million and $183.6 million in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Repurchase and Retirement of Common Stock. During fiscal year 2010, we purchased and immediately retired 12.8 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $250.0 million. We may continue to repurchase and retire common stock or retire treasury stock in the future. In June 2008, our Board of Directors rescinded the previous authorizations to repurchase shares of our common stock and approved an authorization to purchase up to $2.0 billion of our common stock through June 2012. There was $1.7 billion remaining under this authorization at April 30, 2010. Issuances of Common Stock. In October 2008, we sold 8.3 million shares of our common stock, without par value, at a price of $17.50 per share in a registered direct offering through subscription agreements with selected institutional investors. We received net proceeds of $141.4 million, after deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses. The purpose of the equity offering was to ensure we maintained adequate equity levels, as a condition of our CLOC, during our off season. Proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. Proceeds from the issuance of common stock in accordance with our stock based compensation plans totaled $16.7 million, $71.6 million, and $23.3 million in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. HRB BANK Block Financial LLC (BFC) typically makes capital contributions to HRB Bank to help it meet its capital requirements. BFC made capital contributions to HRB Bank of $235.0 million during fiscal year 2010 and $245.0 million during fiscal year 2009. Historically, capital contributions by BFC have been repaid as a return of capital by HRB Bank as capital requirements decline. A return of capital or dividend paid by HRB Bank must be approved by the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS). Although the OTS has approved such payments in the past, there is no assurance that they will continue to do so in the future, in particular if they determine that higher capital levels at HRB Bank are necessary due to non performing asset levels. In addition, BFC may elect to maintain higher capital levels at HRB Bank. At April 30, 2010, HRB Bank had cash balances of $701.0 million. Distribution of those cash balances would be subject to OTS approval and are therefore not currently available for general corporate purposes. HRB Bank received approval from the OTS on May 17, 2010 to pay a non cash dividend by June 30, 2010 to BFC of REO. See additional discussion of regulatory and capital requirements of HRB Bank in Regulatory Environment. HR BLOCK 2010 Form 10K 27 Table of Contents BORROWINGS We continually monitor our funding requirements and execute strategies to manage our overall asset and liability profile. The following chart provides the debt ratings for BFC as of April 30, 2010 and 2009: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys P 2 Baa1 Stable SP A 2 BBB Positive DBRS R 2 (high ) BBB (high ) Positive On March 4, 2010, we entered into a new CLOC agreement to support commercial paper issuances, general corporate purposes or for working capital needs, and terminated the previous CLOCs. The new facility provides funding up to $1.7 billion and matures July 31, 2013. The new facility bears interest at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 1.30% to 2.80% or PRIME plus .30% to 1.80% (depending on the type of borrowing) and includes an annual facility fee of .20% to .70% of the committed amounts, based on our credit ratings. Covenants in the new facility are substantially similar to those in the previous CLOCs including: (1) maintenance of a minimum net worth of $650.0 million on the last day of any fiscal quarter; and (2) reduction of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of short term debt, as defined in the agreement, to $200.0 million or less for thirty consecutive days during the period March 1 to June 30 of each year (Clean down requirement). At April 30, 2010, we were in compliance with these covenants and had net worth of $1.4 billion. There was no balance outstanding on this facility at April 30, 2010. As of April 30, 2010, we had $250.0 million remaining under our shelf registration for additional debt issuances. Effective January 12, 2010, we entered into a $2.5 billion committed line of credit agreement with HSBC Bank USA, National Association (HSBC) for the purchase of RAL participations. This line was available up to its facility limit through March 30, 2010 and then only up to $120.0 million thereafter through June 30, 2010. The line is subject to covenants similar to those in the CLOC, but secured by the RAL participation interests. All borrowings on this facility were repaid as of April 30, 2010 and the facility is now closed. During fiscal year 2010, borrowing needs in our Canadian operations were funded by corporate borrowings in the U.S. To mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate risk, we used foreign exchange forward contracts. We do not enter into forward contracts for speculative purposes. In estimating the fair value of derivative positions, we utilize quoted market prices, if available, or quotes obtained from external sources. There were no forward contracts outstanding as of April 30, 2010. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS A summary of our obligations to make future payments as of April 30, 2010, is as follows: (in 000s) Less Than Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Long term debt (including interest) $ 1,218,824 $ 67,750 $ 721,383 $ 429,691 $ Customer deposits 874,218 492,313 18,558 3,106 360,241 FHLB borrowings 75,000 50,000 25,000 Retirement plan contribution 60,000 60,000 Acquisition payments 28,701 3,157 25,455 89 Media advertising purchase obligation 26,548 13,274 13,274 Capital lease obligations 11,526 531 1,293 1,477 8,225 Operating leases 791,206 246,061 332,119 144,278 68,748 Total contractual cash obligations $ 3,086,023 $ 933,086 $ 1,137,082 $ 578,641 $ 437,214 The amount of liabilities recorded in connection with unrecognized tax positions that we reasonably expect to pay within twelve months is $74.5 million at April 30, 2010 and is included in accrued income taxes on our consolidated balance sheet. The remaining amount is included in other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Because the ultimate amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty, the estimated unrecognized tax position liability has been excluded from the table above. See Item 8, note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 28 HR BLOCK 2010 Form 10K Table of Contents A summary of our commitments as of April 30, 2010, which may or may not require future payments, are as follows: (in 000s) Less Than Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Franchise Equity Lines of Credit $ 36,806 $ 21,819 $ 9,242 $ 5,745 $ Contingent acquisition payments 20,697 5,365 14,391 941 Other commercial commitments 482 482 Total commercial commitments $ 57,985 $ 27,666 $ 23,633 $ 6,686 $ See discussion of contractual obligations and commitments in Item 8, within the notes to our consolidated financial statements. REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT HRB Bank is a federal savings bank and HR Block, Inc. is a savings and loan holding company. As a result, each is subject to regulation by the OTS. Federal savings banks are subject to extensive regulation and examination by the OTS, their primary federal regulator, as well as the FDIC. All savings associations are subject to the capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. HRB Bank must meet specific capital guidelines involving quantitative measures of HRB Banks assets, liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. HRB Banks capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. As of March 31, 2010, our most recent Thrift Financial Report (TFR) filing with the OTS, HRB bank was a well capitalized institution under the prompt corrective action provisions of the FDIC. See Item 8, note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of regulatory capital requirements and classifications. HRB Bank is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of HR Block, Inc. and its customer deposits are insured by the FDIC. If an insured institution fails, claims for administrative expenses of the receiver and for deposits in U.S. branches (including claims of the FDIC as subrogee of the failed institution) have priority over the claims of general unsecured creditors. In addition, the FDIC has authority to require HR Block, Inc. to reimburse it for losses it incurs in connection with the failure of HRB Bank or with the FDICs provision of assistance to a banking subsidiary that is in danger of failure. HR Block, Inc. is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiary, HRB Bank. Various federal and state statutory provisions and regulations limit the amount of dividends HRB Bank may pay without regulatory approval. The OTS has authority to prohibit HRB Bank from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their business. The payment of dividends, depending on the financial condition of the bank, could be deemed an unsafe or unsound practice. The ability of HRB Bank to pay dividends in the future is currently, and could be further, influenced by bank regulatory policies and capital guidelines. The U.S., various state, local, provincial and foreign governments and some self regulatory organizations have enacted statutes and ordinances, and or adopted rules and regulations, regulating aspects of our business. These aspects include, but are not limited to, commercial income tax return preparers, income tax courses, the electronic filing of income tax returns, the facilitation of RALs, loan originations and assistance in loan originations, mortgage lending, privacy, consumer protection, franchising, sales methods, banking, accountants and the accounting practice. We seek to determine the applicability of such statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations (collectively, Laws) and comply with those Laws. From time to time in the ordinary course of business, we receive inquiries from governmental and self regulatory agencies regarding the applicability of Laws to our services and products. In response to past inquiries, we have agreed to comply with such Laws, convinced the authorities that such Laws were not applicable or that compliance already exists and or modified our activities in the applicable jurisdiction to avoid the application of all or certain parts of such Laws. We believe the past resolution of such inquiries and our ongoing compliance with Laws has not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. We cannot predict what effect future Laws, changes in interpretations of existing Laws or the results of future regulator inquiries with respect to the applicability of Laws may have on our consolidated financial statements. See additional discussion of legal matters in Item 3, Legal Proceedings and Item 8, note 18 to our consolidated financial statements. FUTURE LEGISLATION In light of current conditions in the U.S. and global financial markets and the U.S. and global economy, regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry. Proposals that could substantially intensify the regulation of the financial services industry are expected to be introduced in the U.S. Congress, in state legislatures and from applicable regulatory authorities. These proposals may change banking statutes and regulation and our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, these proposals could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible HR BLOCK 2010 Form 10K 29 Table of Contents activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions and other financial institutions. We cannot predict whether any of these proposals will be enacted and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any impending regulations, would have on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Item 8, note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements. 32 HR BLOCK 2010 Form 10K Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK INTEREST RATE RISK GENERAL We have a formal investment policy that strives to minimize the market risk exposure of our cash equivalents and available for sale (AFS) securities, which are primarily affected by credit quality and movements in interest rates. These guidelines focus on managing liquidity and preserving principal and earnings. Our cash equivalents are primarily held for liquidity purposes and are comprised of high quality, short term investments, including qualified money market funds. Because our cash and cash equivalents have a relatively short maturity, our portfolios market value is relatively insensitive to interest rate changes. As our short term borrowings are generally seasonal, interest rate risk typically increases through our third fiscal quarter and declines to zero by fiscal year end. While the market value of short term borrowings is relatively insensitive to interest rate changes, interest expense on short term borrowings will increase and decrease with changes in the underlying short term interest rates. Our long term debt at April 30, 2010, consists primarily of fixed rate Senior Notes; therefore, a change in interest rates would have no impact on consolidated pretax earnings. See Item 8, note 10 to our consolidated financial statements. HRB BANK At April 30, 2010, approximately 42% of HRB Banks total assets were residential mortgage loans with 40% of these fixed rate loans and 60% adjustable rate loans. These loans are sensitive to changes in interest rates as well as expected prepayment levels. As interest rates increase, fixed rate residential mortgages tend to exhibit lower prepayments. The opposite is true in a falling rate environment. When mortgage loans prepay, mortgage origination costs are written off. Depending on the timing of the prepayment, the write offs of mortgage origination costs may result in lower than anticipated yields. At April 30, 2010, HRB Banks other investments consisted primarily of mortgage backed securities and FHLB stock. See table below for sensitivity analysis of our mortgage backed securities. HRB Banks liabilities consist primarily of transactional deposit relationships, such as prepaid debit card accounts and checking accounts. Other liabilities include money market accounts, certificates of deposit and collateralized borrowings from the FHLB. Money market accounts re price as interest rates change. Certificates of deposit re price over time depending on maturities. FHLB advances generally have fixed rates ranging from one day through multiple years. Under criteria published by the OTS, HRB Banks overall interest rate risk exposure at March 31, 2010, the most recent date an evaluation was completed, was characterized as minimal. We actively manage our interest rate risk positions. As interest rates change, we will adjust our strategy and mix of assets and liabilities to optimize our position. EQUITY PRICE RISK We have limited exposure to the equity markets. Our primary exposure is through our deferred compensation plans. Within the deferred compensation plans, we have mismatches in asset and liability amounts and investment choices (both fixed income and equity). At April 30, 2010 and 2009, the impact of a 10% market value change in the combined equity assets held by our deferred compensation plans and other equity investments would be approximately $9.7 million and $7.3 million, respectively, assuming no offset for the liabilities. FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE RISK Our operations in international markets are exposed to movements in currency exchange rates. The currencies involved are the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar. We translate revenues and expenses related to these operations at the average of exchange rates in effect during the period. Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing at the end of the year. Translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of other comprehensive income in stockholders equity. Translation of financial results into U.S. dollars does not presently materially affect and has not historically materially affected our consolidated financial results, although such changes do affect the year to year comparability of the operating results in U.S. dollars of our international businesses. We estimate a 10% change in foreign exchange rates by itself would impact consolidated net income in fiscal years 2010 and 2009 by approximately $5.1 million and $3.0 million, respectively, and cash balances at April 30, 2010 and 2009 by $7.1 million and $5.4 million, respectively. During fiscal year 2010, borrowing needs in our Canadian operations were funded by corporate borrowings in the U.S. To mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate risk, we used forward foreign exchange contracts. We do not enter into forward contracts for speculative purposes. In estimating the fair value of derivative positions, we utilized quoted market prices, if available, or quotes obtained from external sources. When foreign currency financial instruments are outstanding, exposure to market risk on these instruments results from fluctuations in HR BLOCK 2010 Form 10K 33 Table of Contents currency rates during the periods in which the contracts are outstanding. The counterparties to our currency exchange contracts consist of major financial institutions, each of which is rated investment grade. We are exposed to credit risk to the extent of potential non performance by counterparties on financial instruments. Any potential credit exposure does not exceed the fair value. We believe the risk of incurring losses due to credit risk is remote. At April 30, 2010 we had no forward exchange contracts outstanding. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS The sensitivities of certain financial instruments to changes in interest rates as of April 30, 2010 and 2009 are presented below. The following table represents hypothetical instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in interest rates and should not be relied on as an indicator of future expected results. The impact of a change in interest rates on other factors, such as delinquency and prepayment rates, is not included in the analysis below.
