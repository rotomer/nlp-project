ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our subsidiaries provide tax preparation, retail banking and various business advisory and consulting services. We are the only major company offering a full range of software, online and in office tax preparation solutions to individual tax clients. OVERVIEW A summary of our fiscal year 2011 results is as follows: Revenues for the fiscal year were $3.8 billion, down 2.6% from prior year results. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 7.5% from the prior year to $1.35. U.S. tax returns prepared by us increased 6.5% from the prior year primarily due to strong results in our retail offices related to a free Federal 1040 EZ offer during the first half of the season as well as improved results during the second half. Online results also improved due to enhancements to our client interface and improved traffic to our website. Revenues in our Tax Services segment decreased 2.1% from the prior year, primarily due to the sale of 280 company owned offices to franchisees and a decline in revenues from RAL participations, which were partially offset by higher RAC fees. Pretax income for the Tax Services segment decreased $99.9 million, or 11.5%, due primarily to a $34.3 million increase in bad debt expense, goodwill impairment of $22.7 million and litigation charges of $15.0 million. Pretax income for the Business Services segment decreased $9.7 million, or 16.5%, primarily due to lower revenues and higher litigation expenses, partially offset by a goodwill impairment charge recorded in the prior year.

Tax preparation fees decreased $77.1 million, or 3.9%, due primarily to the sale of company owned offices to franchisees and the loss of certain clients as a result of not having a RAL offering in our tax offices this year. Although we believe we gained clients through the free Federal EZ filing we began offering this year, that increase did not have a significant impact on our revenues. Royalties increased $28.6 million, or 10.4%, primarily due to the conversion of 280 company owned offices into franchises. Fees earned on RACs increased $94.1 million, or 107.5%, primarily due to an increase in the number of RACs issued as a portion of our clients chose to receive their refunds via RAC, as an alternative to a RAL. RALs were historically offered to our clients by HSBC. In December 2010, HSBC terminated its contract with us based on restrictions placed on HSBC by its regulator and, therefore, RALs were not offered this tax season. Current year revenues of $17.2 million include the recognition of net deferred fees from HSBC. This compares with revenues resulting from loans participations and related fees in the prior year of $146.2 million. Interest income earned on EAs increased $16.4 million, or 21.1%, over the prior year primarily due to an increase in loan volume, which resulted from offering the product to a wider client base. Other revenue increased $14.9 million, or 6.9%, primarily due to an increase in online revenues. Total expenses increased $37.0 million, or 1.8%, compared to the prior year. Compensation and benefits decreased $12.7 million, or 1.3%, primarily due to lower commission based wages due to conversions to franchise offices, reduced headcount and related payroll taxes. This decline was partially offset by severance costs and related payroll taxes of $27.4 million. Occupancy costs declined $25.6 million, or 6.2%, due to office closures and cost saving initiatives. Bad debt expense increased $34.3 million, or 32.8%, primarily due to increased volumes on EAs, as well as a decline in tax returns prepared for those clients. During the current year, we recorded a $22.7 million impairment of goodwill in our RedGear reporting unit, as discussed in Item 8, note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. Other expenses increased $15.7 million, or 6.0%, primarily due to incremental litigation expenses recorded in the current year. Pretax income for fiscal year 2011 decreased $99.9 million, or 11.5%, from 2010. As a result of the declines in revenues and higher expenses, primarily bad debt expense and goodwill impairment, pretax margin for the segment decreased to 26.4% from 29.2% in fiscal year 2010. FISCAL 2010 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009 Tax Services revenues decreased $156.8 million, or 5.0%, compared to fiscal year 2009. Tax preparation fees decreased $162.8 million, or 7.6%, due to a 10.3% decrease in U.S. retail tax returns prepared in company owned offices, partially offset by a 0.6% increase in the net average fee per U.S. retail tax return. Adjusting for the effect of company owned offices sold to franchisees during fiscal year 2010, the decline in tax returns prepared in company owned offices was 6.7% from fiscal 2009 to 2010. The 6.7% decrease in U.S. retail tax returns prepared in company owned offices is primarily due to the following factors: Tax returns filed with the IRS declined 1.7%. Lower employment levels disproportionately impacted our key client segments. Fourth quarter 2009 unemployment levels ranged from 15 30%, far in excess of national unemployment levels for key client segments. We closed certain under performing offices and exited offices serving clients in Wal Mart locations. We believe that tax returns prepared declined by approximately 1% (net of client retention through other office locations) as a result of these office closures. Royalties increased $20.0 million, or 7.8%, due to the conversion of 267 company owned offices into franchises, partially offset by a decline in tax returns prepared in existing franchise offices. Interest income on EAs decreased $13.1 million, or 14.4%. This decline was primarily a result of lower loan volumes due to these lines of credit only being offered to prior year tax clients in fiscal year 2010, while being offered to both prior and new clients in fiscal year 2009. Total expenses decreased $97.1 million, or 4.4%, compared to fiscal year 2009. Total compensation and benefits decreased $41.1 million, or 3.9%, primarily as a result of lower commission based wages due to the decline in the number of tax returns prepared. Bad debt expense decreased $7.3 million, or 6.5%, primarily as a result of lower EA and RAL volumes, and more restrictive underwriting criteria. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $13.9 million, or 17.5%, primarily as a result of amortization of intangible assets, related to the November 2008 acquisition of our last major independent franchise operator. Other expenses decreased $31.4 million, or 10.7%, primarily as a result of lower legal expenses. During fiscal year 2010 we recognized gains of $49.1 million on the sale of certain company owned offices to franchisees, compared to $14.9 million in fiscal year 2009. Pretax income for fiscal year 2010 decreased $59.7 million, or 6.4%, from 2009. As a result of the declines in revenues, pretax margin for the segment decreased from 29.6% in fiscal year 2009, to 29.2% in fiscal year 2010. 20 HR BLOCK 2011 Form 10K Table of Contents BUSINESS SERVICES This segment consists of RSM McGladrey, Inc.

Tax services revenues increased primarily as a result of the acquisition of Caturano, as discussed in Item 8, note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Business consulting revenues declined $17.2 million, or 6.6%, primarily due to a decline in services performed on a large multi year engagement in our consulting practice. Other revenues declined $12.8 million, or 20.4%, primarily as a result of a reduction in management fees received related to the new administrative services agreement with MP, as discussed in Item 8, note 17 to the consolidated financial statements. Total expenses decreased $20.8 million, or 2.6%, from the prior year. Compensation and benefits decreased $22.1 million, or 3.8%, primarily due to a reduction of costs directly related to the large multi year consulting engagement discussed above and reduced spend on employee insurance benefits. Litigation expenses increased $19.3 million, or 96.9%, over the prior year. Other expenses declined $16.9 million, or 16.0%, primarily due to an impairment of goodwill recorded in the prior year. Pretax income for the year ended April 30, 2011 of $49.0 million compares to $58.7 million in the prior year. Pretax margin for the segment decreased to 5.9% from 6.8% in fiscal year 2010, primarily due to litigation costs. FISCAL 2010 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009 Business Services revenues for fiscal year 2010 decreased $37.5 million, or 4.2%, from fiscal year 2009. Revenues from core tax, consulting and accounting services decreased $21.4 million, or 2.7%, from fiscal year 2009. Tax and accounting services revenues decreased $30.3 million and $4.8 million, respectively, primarily due to decreases in chargeable hours and pressures on billable rates. Business consulting revenues increased $13.6 million, or 5.5%, primarily due to a large engagement in our operational consulting practice. Continued weak economic conditions in recent years have severely reduced investment and transaction activity. As a result, revenues from our capital markets business have been declining severely, including a decline of $6.4 million, or 34.9%, from fiscal year 2009. As noted below, we recorded an impairment of goodwill associated with this business during fiscal year 2010. Other revenue declined $12.7 million, or 16.8%, primarily due to lower management fee revenues and interest income received from MP. Total expenses were essentially flat compared to fiscal year 2009. Compensation and benefits decreased $14.0 million, or 2.4%, primarily due to headcount reductions driven by reduced client demand. Marketing and advertising costs decreased $4.8 million, or 20.3%, primarily due to fewer sponsorships and lower advertising costs. Litigation expenses increased $13.3 million from fiscal year 2009. Other expenses increased $8.3 million primarily due to a $15.0 million impairment of goodwill at RSM EquiCo, as discussed in Item 8, note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. HR BLOCK 2011 Form 10K 21 Table of Contents Pretax income for the year ended April 30, 2010 of $58.7 million compares to $96.1 million in fiscal year 2009. Pretax margin for the segment decreased from 10.7% in fiscal year 2009, to 6.8% in fiscal year 2010, primarily due to poor results in our capital markets business and a reduction of revenue in our core businesses. CORPORATE, ELIMINATIONS AND INCOME TAXES ON CONTINUING OPERATIONS Corporate operating losses include interest income from U.S. passive investments, interest expense on borrowings, net interest margin and gains or losses relating to mortgage loans held for investment, real estate owned, residual interests in securitizations and other corporate expenses, principally related to finance, legal and other support departments. Corporate Operating Results (in 000s) Year Ended April 30, 2011 2010 2009 Interest income on mortgage loans held for investment $ 24,693 $ 31,877 $ 46,396 Other 7,448 6,854 7,295 Total revenues 32,141 38,731 53,691 Interest expense 84,288 79,929 92,945 Provision for loan losses 35,567 47,750 63,897 Compensation and benefits 49,463 53,607 48,973 Other, net 2,299 (614 ) 31,651 Total expense 171,617 180,672 237,466 Pretax loss $ (139,476 ) $ (141,941 ) $ (183,775 ) FISCAL YEAR 2011 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR 2010 Interest income earned on mortgage loans held for investment decreased $7.2 million, or 22.5%, from the prior year, primarily as a result of declining rates and non performing loans. Our provision for loan losses decreased $12.2 million, or 25.5%, from the prior year as a result of the continued run off of our portfolio. Income Taxes on Continuing Operations Our effective tax rate for continuing operations was 38.1% for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2011, compared to 37.6% in the prior year. This increase resulted from a decline in gains from investments in company owned life insurance assets which are not subject to tax, an increase in the state effective tax rate and other favorable net discrete adjustments booked in the current year compared to unfavorable adjustments recorded in the prior year. FISCAL YEAR 2010 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR 2009 Interest income earned on mortgage loans held for investment for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2010 decreased $14.5 million, or 31.3%, from fiscal year 2009, primarily as a result of non performing loans. Interest expense decreased $13.0 million, or 14.0%, due to lower funding costs related to our mortgage loan portfolio and lower corporate borrowings. Our provision for loan losses decreased $16.1 million from fiscal year 2009. Other expenses declined $32.3 million primarily due to gains of $9.0 million on residual interests in fiscal year 2010, compared to impairments of $3.1 million recorded in fiscal year 2009. Additionally, we transferred liabilities relating to previously retained insurance risk to a third party, and recorded a gain of $9.5 million in fiscal year 2010. Income Taxes on Continuing Operations Our effective tax rate for continuing operations was 37.6% for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2010, compared to 38.9% in fiscal year 2009. Our effective tax rates declined from fiscal year 2009 due to a reduction in our valuation allowance related to tax planning strategies and favorable tax benefits related to investment gains on our corporate owned life insurance investments. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Sand Canyon Corporation (SCC, previously known as Option One Mortgage Corporation) ceased originating mortgage loans in December of 2007 and, in April 2008, sold its servicing assets and discontinued its remaining operations. The sale of servicing assets did not include the sale of any mortgage loans. SCC retained contingent liabilities that arose from the operations of SCC prior to its disposal, including certain mortgage loan repurchase obligations, contingent liabilities associated with litigation and related claims, lease commitments, and employee termination benefits. SCC also retained residual interests in certain mortgage loan securitization transactions prior to cessation of its origination business. The net loss from discontinued operations totaled $13.3 million, $9.7 million and $27.4 million for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In connection with the securitization and sale of mortgage loans, SCC made certain representations and warranties. In the event that there is a breach of a representation and warranty and such breach materially and adversely affects the value of a mortgage loan, SCC may be obligated to repurchase a loan or otherwise indemnify certain parties for losses incurred as a result of loan liquidation. 22 HR BLOCK 2011 Form 10K Table of Contents SCC has recorded a liability for estimated contingent losses related to representation and warranty claims as of April 30, 2011, of $126.3 million, which represents SCCs best estimate of the probable loss that may occur. Losses on valid claims totaled $12.2 million, $18.2 million and $36.4 million for fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. These amounts were recorded as reductions of our loan repurchase liability. During the current year, payments totaling $49.8 million were made under an indemnity agreement dated April 2008 with a specific counterparty in exchange for a full and complete release of such partys ability to assert representation and warranty claims. These payments were also recorded as a reduction in our loan repurchase liability. The indemnity agreement was given as part of obtaining the counterpartys consent to SCCs sale of its mortgage servicing business in 2008. We have no remaining payment obligations under this indemnity agreement. While SCC uses the best information available to it in estimating its liability, assessing the likelihood that claims will be asserted in the future and estimating probable losses is inherently difficult and requires considerable management judgment. Although net losses on settled claims since May 1, 2008 have been within initial loss estimates, to the extent that the volume of asserted claims, the level of valid claims, the counterparties asserting claims, the nature of claims, or the value of residential home prices differ in the future from current estimates, future losses may be greater than the current estimates and those differences may be significant. See additional discussion in Item 8, note 18 to the consolidated financial statements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We consider the estimates discussed below to be critical to understanding our financial statements, as they require the use of significant judgment and estimation in order to measure, at a specific point in time, matters that are inherently uncertain. Specific risks for these critical accounting estimates are described in the following paragraphs. We have reviewed and discussed each of these estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. For all of these estimates, we caution that future events rarely develop precisely as forecasted and estimates routinely require adjustment and may require material adjustment. See Item 8, note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, which discusses accounting estimates we have selected when there are acceptable alternatives and new or proposed accounting standards that may affect our financial reporting in the future. ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES The principal amount of mortgage loans held for investment totaled $573.0 million at April 30, 2011. We are exposed to the risk that borrowers may not repay amounts owed to us when they become contractually due. We record an allowance representing our estimate of credit losses inherent in the portfolio of loans held for investment at the balance sheet date. Determination of our allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because loss provisions can be material to our operating results, projections of loan delinquencies and related matters are inherently subjective, and actual losses are impacted by factors outside of our control including economic conditions, unemployment rates and residential home prices. We record a loan loss allowance for loans less than 60 days past due on a pooled basis. The aggregate principal balance of these loans totaled $304.3 million at April 30, 2011, and the portion of our allowance for loan losses allocated to these loans totaled $11.2 million. In estimating our loan loss allowance for these loans, we stratify the loan portfolio based on our view of risk associated with various elements of the pool and assign estimated loss rates based on those risks. Loss rates are based primarily on historical experience and our assessment of economic and market conditions. Loss rates consider both the rate at which loans will become delinquent (frequency) and the amount of loss that will ultimately be realized upon occurrence of a liquidation of collateral (severity). Frequency rates are based primarily on historical migration analysis of loans to delinquent status. Severity rates are based primarily on recent broker quotes or appraisals of collateral. Because of imprecision and uncertainty inherent in developing estimates of future credit losses, in particular during periods of rapidly declining collateral values or increasing delinquency rates, our estimation process includes development of ranges of possible outcomes. Ranges were developed by stressing initial estimates of both frequency and severity rates. Stressing of frequency and severity assumptions is intended to model deterioration in credit quality that is difficult to predict during declining economic conditions. Future deterioration in credit quality may exceed our modeled assumptions. Mortgage loans held for investment include loans originated by our affiliate, SCC, and purchased by HRB Bank. We have greater exposure to loss with respect to this segment of our loan portfolio as a result of historically higher delinquency rates. Therefore, we assign higher frequency rate assumptions to SCC originated loans compared with loans originated by other third party banks as we consider estimates of future losses. At April 30, 2011 our weighted average frequency assumption was 9.4% for SCC originated loans compared to 2.8% for remaining loans in the portfolio. Loans 60 days past due are considered impaired and are reviewed individually. We record loss estimates typically based on the value of the underlying collateral. Our specific loan loss allowance for these impaired loans reflected an average loss severity of 43% at April 30, 2011. The aggregate principal balance of impaired loans HR BLOCK 2011 Form 10K 23 Table of Contents totaled $162.3 million at April 30, 2011, and the portion of our allowance for loan losses allocated to these loans totaled $69.8 million. Modified loans that meet the definition of a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) are also considered impaired and are reviewed individually. We record impairment equal to the difference between the principal balance of the loan and the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate. However, if we assess that foreclosure of a modified loan is probable, we record impairment based on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral. The aggregate principal balance of TDR loans totaled $106.3 million at April 30, 2011, and the portion of our allowance for loan losses allocated to these loans totaled $11.1 million. The loan loss allowance as a percent of mortgage loans held for investment was 16.1% at April 30, 2011, compared to 13.7% at April 30, 2010. The increase during the current year is primarily as a result of declining collateral values due to lower residential home prices and modeled expectations for future loan delinquencies in the portfolio. The residential mortgage industry has experienced significant adverse trends for an extended period. If adverse trends continue for a sustained period or at rates worse than modeled by us, we may be required to record additional loan loss provisions, and those losses may be significant. Determining the allowance for loan losses for loans held for investment requires us to make estimates of losses that are highly uncertain and requires a high degree of judgment. If our underlying assumptions prove to be inaccurate, the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses. Our mortgage loan portfolio is a static pool, as we are no longer originating or purchasing new mortgage loans, and we believe that factor, over time, will limit variability in our loss estimates. MORTGAGE LOAN REPURCHASE OBLIGATION In connection with the securitization and sale of loans, SCC made certain representations and warranties, including, but not limited to, representations relating to matters such as ownership of the loan, validity of lien securing the loan, and the loans compliance with SCCs underwriting criteria. Representations and warranties in whole loan sale transactions to institutional investors included a knowledge qualifier which limits SCC liability for borrower fraud to those instances where SCC had knowledge of the fraud at the time the loans were sold. In the event that there is a breach of a representation and warranty and such breach materially and adversely affects the value of a mortgage loan, SCC may be obligated to repurchase a loan or otherwise indemnify certain parties for losses incurred as a result of loan liquidation. Generally, these representations and warranties are not subject to a stated term, but would be subject to statutes of limitation applicable to the contractual provisions. SCC estimates losses relating to representation and warranty claims by estimating loan repurchase and indemnification obligations on both known claims and projections of future claims. Projections of future claims are based on an analysis that includes a combination of reviewing repurchase demands and actual defaults and loss severities, inquiries from various third parties, the terms and provisions of related agreements and the historical rate of repurchase and indemnification obligations related to breaches of representations and warranties. SCCs methodology for calculating this liability considers the likelihood that individual counterparties will assert future claims. SCC recorded a liability for estimated contingent losses related to representation and warranty claims of $126.3 million as of April 30, 2011. Actual losses charged against this reserve during fiscal year 2011 totaled $61.9 million, which included payments totaling $49.8 million made under an indemnity agreement dated April 2008 with a specific counterparty in exchange for a full and complete release of such partys ability to assert representation and warranty claims. The recorded liability represents SCCs estimate of losses from future claims where assertion of a claim and a related contingent loss are both deemed probable. Because the rate at which future claims may be deemed valid and actual loss severity rates may differ significantly from historical experience, SCC is not able to estimate reasonably possible loss outcomes in excess of its current accrual. A 1% increase in both assumed validity rates and loss severities would result in losses beyond SCCs accrual of approximately $16 million. This sensitivity is hypothetical and is intended to provide an indication of the impact of a change in key assumptions on the representations and warranties liability. In reality, changes in one assumption may result in changes in other assumptions, which may or may not counteract the sensitivity. While SCC uses the best information available to it in estimating its liability, assessing the likelihood that claims will be asserted in the future and estimating probable losses are inherently difficult to estimate and require considerable management judgment. Although net losses on settled claims since May 1, 2008 have been within initial loss estimates, to the extent that the volume of asserted claims, the level of valid claims, the counterparties asserting claims, the nature of claims, or the value of residential home prices differ in the future from current estimates, future losses may be greater than the current estimates and those differences may be significant. See Item 8, note 18 to our consolidated financial statements. LITIGATION It is our policy to routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes related to legal matters, as well as ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of the reserves required, if any, 24 HR BLOCK 2011 Form 10K Table of Contents for these contingencies is made after analysis of each known issue and an analysis of historical experience. Therefore, we have recorded reserves related to certain legal matters for which we believe it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the range of such loss can be estimated. With respect to other matters, we have concluded that a loss is only reasonably possible or remote, or is not estimable and, therefore, no liability is recorded. Assessing the likely outcome of pending litigation, including the amount of potential loss, if any, is highly subjective. Our judgments regarding likelihood of loss and our estimates of probable loss amounts may differ from actual results due to difficulties in predicting the outcome of jury trials, arbitration hearings, settlement discussions and related activity, predicting the outcome of class certification actions and various other uncertainties. Due to the number of claims which are periodically asserted against us, and the magnitude of damages sought in those claims, actual losses in the future may significantly exceed our current estimates. See Item 8, note 19 to our consolidated financial statements. VALUATION OF GOODWILL The evaluation of goodwill for impairment is a critical accounting estimate due both to the magnitude of our goodwill balances, and the judgment involved in determining the fair value of our reporting units. Goodwill balances totaled $846.2 million as of April 30, 2011 and $840.4 million as of April 30, 2010. We test goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change which would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. Our goodwill impairment analysis is based on a discounted cash flow approach and market comparables. This analysis, at the reporting unit level, requires significant management judgment with respect to revenue and expense forecasts, anticipated changes in working capital and the selection and application of an appropriate discount rate. Changes in projections or assumptions could materially affect our estimate of reporting unit fair values. The use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted future operating cash flows and could affect our conclusions regarding the existence or amount of potential impairment. Finally, strategic changes in our outlook regarding reporting units or intangible assets may alter our valuation approach and could result in changes to our conclusions regarding impairment. Future estimates of fair value may be adversely impacted by declining economic conditions. In addition, if future operating results of our reporting units are below our current modeled expectations, fair value estimates may decline. Any of these factors could result in future impairments, and those impairments could be significant. We recorded a goodwill impairment of $22.7 million related to our RedGear reporting unit within our Tax Services segment in the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, leaving a remaining goodwill balance of approximately $14 million. Revenues for this reporting unit have been below our estimates. Poor results in future years could result in further impairment. We recorded a goodwill impairment of $15.0 million related to our RSM EquiCo reporting unit within our Business Services segment in the third quarter of fiscal year 2010, leaving a remaining goodwill balance of $14.3 million. Continued poor results for this reporting unit could result in further impairment. See Item 8, note 9 to our consolidated financial statements. INCOME TAXES Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach under U.S. GAAP. We calculate our current and deferred tax provision for the fiscal year based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the applicable calendar year. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded in the appropriate periods when identified. We file a consolidated federal tax return on a calendar year basis, generally in the second fiscal quarter of the subsequent year. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We have considered taxable income in carry back periods, historical and forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. Determination of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets requires that we make judgments about future matters that are not certain, including projections of future taxable income and evaluating potential tax planning strategies. To the extent that actual results differ from our current assumptions, the valuation allowance will increase or decrease. In the event we were to determine we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination. Likewise, if we later determine it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance. The income tax laws of jurisdictions in which we operate are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and applicable government taxing authorities. Income tax returns filed by us are based on our interpretation of these rules. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which may result in proposed assessments, including assessments of interest and or penalties. Our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly subjective and based on our best judgments. Actual results may differ from our current judgments due to a variety of factors, including changes HR BLOCK 2011 Form 10K 25 Table of Contents in law, interpretations of law by taxing authorities that differ from our assessments, changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate and results of routine tax examinations. We believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters. However, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved, or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire. As a result, our effective tax rate may fluctuate on a quarterly basis. REVENUE RECOGNITION We have many different revenue sources, each governed by specific revenue recognition policies. Our revenue recognition policies can be found in Item 8, note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. FINANCIAL CONDITION CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Our sources of capital include cash from operations, cash from customer deposits, issuances of common stock and debt. We use capital primarily to fund working capital, pay dividends, repurchase treasury shares and acquire businesses. Our operations are highly seasonal and therefore generally require the use of cash to fund operating losses during the period May through mid January. Given the likely availability of a number of liquidity options discussed herein, including borrowing capacity under our CLOC, we believe, that in the absence of any unexpected developments, our existing sources of capital at April 30, 2011 are sufficient to meet our operating needs. These comments should be read in conjunction with the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included in Item 8. (in 000s) Year Ended April 30, 2011 2010 2009 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 512,503 $ 587,469 $ 1,024,439 Investing activities (110,157 ) 31,353 5,560 Financing activities (534,391 ) (481,118 ) (40,233 ) Effect of exchange rates on cash 5,844 11,678 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (126,201 ) $ 149,382 $ 989,766 CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES Cash provided by operations, which consists primarily of cash received from customers, decreased $75.0 million from fiscal year 2010. Cash payments for representation and warranty obligations of our discontinued mortgage business totaled $61.9 million in fiscal year 2011, compared to $18.4 million in fiscal year 2010 and $36.5 million in fiscal year 2009. Restricted Cash. We hold certain cash balances that are restricted as to use. Cash and cash equivalents restricted totaled $48.4 million at April 30, 2011, and primarily consisted of cash held by our captive insurance subsidiary that will be used to pay claims. CASH FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES Changes in cash provided by investing activities primarily relate to the following: Purchases of Available for Sale Securities. During fiscal year 2011, HRB Bank purchased $138.8 million in mortgage backed securities for regulatory purposes. See additional discussion in Item 8, note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. Mortgage Loans Held for Investment. We received net proceeds of $58.5 million, $72.8 million and $91.3 million on our mortgage loans held for investment in fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Purchases of Property and Equipment. Total cash paid for property and equipment was $63.0 million, $90.5 million and $97.9 million for fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Business Acquisitions. Total cash paid for acquisitions was $54.2 million, $10.5 million and $293.8 million during fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In July 2010 our Business Services segment acquired Caturano, a Boston based accounting firm, and cash used in investing activities includes payments totaling $32.6 million related to this acquisition. See additional discussion in Item 8, note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. In November 2008, we acquired our last major independent franchise operator for an aggregate purchase price of $279.2 million. In October 2010, we signed a definitive merger agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of 2SS Holdings, Inc. (2SS), developer of TaxACT digital tax preparation solutions, for $287.5 million in cash. Completion of the transaction is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval. In May 2011, the United States Department of Justice (the DOJ) filed a civil antitrust lawsuit to block our proposed acquisition of 2SS. On June 21, 2011, the parties to the merger agreement signed an amendment to the merger agreement, which is discussed in Item 9B. There are no assurances that the DOJs lawsuit will be resolved in our favor or that the transaction will be consummated. 26 HR BLOCK 2011 Form 10K Table of Contents If the closing conditions are satisfied and this acquisition is consummated, we expect this acquisition will be funded by excess available liquidity from cash on hand or short term borrowings. Sales of Businesses. In fiscal year 2011, we sold 280 tax offices to franchisees for proceeds of $65.6 million. In fiscal year 2010, we sold 267 tax offices to franchisees for proceeds of $65.7 million. In fiscal year 2009, we sold certain tax offices to franchisees for proceeds of $16.9 million. The majority of these sales were financed through loans we made to our franchisees. Loans Made to Franchisees. Loans made to franchisees totaled $92.5 million and $89.7 million for fiscal years 2011 and 2010, respectively. We received payments from franchisees totaling $57.6 million and $40.7 million, respectively. These amounts include both the financing of sales of tax offices and franchisee draws under our Franchise Equity Lines of Credit (FELCs). Discontinued Operations. In fiscal year 2009, we sold our financial advisor business for proceeds of $304.0 million. CASH FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES Changes in cash used in financing activities primarily relate to the following: Short Term Borrowings. We use commercial paper borrowings to fund our off season losses and cover our seasonal working capital needs, however we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of April 30, 2011 or 2010. Our commercial paper borrowings peaked at $674.7 million in the current year. We had other short term borrowings in prior years to fund our participation interests in RALs. FHLB Borrowings. HRB Bank obtains borrowings from the FHLB in accordance with regulatory and capital requirements. During fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, we had net repayments of $50.0 million, $25.0 million and $29.0 million, respectively. Customer Banking Deposits. Customer banking deposits used $11.4 million in the current year compared to $17.5 million provided in fiscal year 2010 and $64.4 million in fiscal year 2009. These deposits are held by HRB Bank Dividends. We have consistently paid quarterly dividends. Dividends paid totaled $186.8 million, $200.9 million and $198.7 million in fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Repurchase and Retirement of Common Stock. During fiscal year 2011, we purchased and immediately retired 19.0 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $279.9 million. During fiscal year 2010, we purchased and immediately retired 12.8 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $250.0 million. We may continue to repurchase and retire common stock or retire treasury stock in the future. In June 2008, our Board of Directors rescinded the previous authorizations to repurchase shares of our common stock and approved an authorization to purchase up to $2.0 billion of our common stock through June 2012. There was $1.4 billion remaining under this authorization at April 30, 2011. Issuances of Common Stock. In October 2008, we sold 8.3 million shares of our common stock, without par value, at a price of $17.50 per share in a registered direct offering through subscription agreements with selected institutional investors. We received net proceeds of $141.4 million, after deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses. The purpose of the equity offering was to ensure we maintained adequate equity levels, as a condition of our CLOC, during our off season. Proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. Proceeds from the issuance of common stock in accordance with our stock based compensation plans totaled $0.4 million, $16.7 million and $71.6 million in fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. HRB BANK Block Financial LLC (BFC) typically makes capital contributions to HRB Bank to help it meet its capital requirements. BFC made capital contributions to HRB Bank of $235.0 million during fiscal years 2011 and 2010, and $245.0 million in fiscal year 2009. Historically, capital contributions by BFC have been repaid as a return of capital by HRB Bank as capital requirements decline. A return of capital or dividend paid by HRB Bank must be approved by the OTS. Although the OTS has approved such payments in the past, there is no assurance that they will continue to do so in the future, in particular if they determine that higher capital levels at HRB Bank are necessary due to non performing asset levels. In addition, BFC may elect to maintain higher capital levels at HRB Bank. HRB Bank paid dividends and returned of capital of $262.5 million during fiscal year 2011, comprised of $37.5 million in REO properties and loans and $225.0 million in cash. At April 30, 2011, HRB Bank had cash balances of $615.1 million. Distribution of those cash balances would be subject to OTS approval and are therefore not currently available for general corporate purposes. HR BLOCK 2011 Form 10K 27 Table of Contents See additional discussion of regulatory and capital requirements of HRB Bank in Regulatory Environment below. BORROWINGS We continually monitor our funding requirements and execute strategies to manage our overall asset and liability profile. The following chart provides the debt ratings for BFC as of April 30, 2011 and 2010: As of April 30, 2011 April 30, 2010 Short term Long term Outlook Short term Long term Outlook Moodys P 2 Baa2 Negative P 2 Baa1 Stable SP A 2 BBB Negative A 2 BBB Positive DBRS R 2 (high ) BBB (high ) Stable R 2 (high ) BBB (high ) Positive At April 30, 2011, we maintained a CLOC agreement to support commercial paper issuances, general corporate purposes or for working capital needs. This facility provides funding up to $1.7 billion and matures July 31, 2013. This facility bears interest at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 1.30% to 2.80% or PRIME plus 0.30% to 1.80% (depending on the type of borrowing) and includes an annual facility fee of 0.20% to 0.70% of the committed amounts, based on our credit ratings. Covenants in this facility include: (1) maintenance of a minimum net worth of $650.0 million on the last day of any fiscal quarter; and (2) reduction of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of short term debt, as defined in the agreement, to $200.0 million or less for thirty consecutive days during the period March 1 to June 30 of each year (Clean down requirement). At April 30, 2011, we were in compliance with these covenants and had net worth of $1.4 billion. We had no balance outstanding under the CLOCs at April 30, 2011. During fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, borrowing needs in our Canadian operations were funded by corporate borrowings in the U.S. To mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate risk, we used foreign exchange forward contracts. We do not enter into forward contracts for speculative purposes. In estimating the fair value of derivative positions, we utilize quoted market prices, if available, or quotes obtained from external sources. There were no forward contracts outstanding as of April 30, 2011. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS A summary of our obligations to make future payments as of April 30, 2011, is as follows: (in 000s) Total Less Than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Long term debt (including interest) $ 1,151,434 $ 67,750 $ 674,257 $ 409,427 $ Customer deposits 863,898 511,010 11,656 22 341,210 FHLB borrowings 25,000 25,000 Retirement plan contribution 50,000 10,000 20,000 20,000 Acquisition payments 43,273 2,880 31,376 2,909 6,108 Contingent acquisition payments 11,000 8,652 2,318 30 Media advertising purchase obligation 9,498 6,665 2,833 Capital lease obligations 10,953 557 1,411 1,545 7,440 Operating leases 735,048 238,167 309,107 120,080 67,694 Total contractual cash obligations $ 2,900,104 $ 870,681 $ 1,052,958 $ 554,013 $ 422,452 The amount of liabilities recorded in connection with unrecognized tax positions that we reasonably expect to pay within twelve months is $16.6 million at April 30, 2011 and is included in accrued income taxes on our consolidated balance sheet. The remaining amount is included in other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Because the ultimate amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty, the estimated unrecognized tax position liability has been excluded from the table above. See Item 8, note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. See discussion of contractual obligations and commitments in Item 8, within the notes to our consolidated financial statements. 28 HR BLOCK 2011 Form 10K Table of Contents REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT HRB Bank is a federal savings bank and HR Block, Inc. is a savings and loan holding company. As a result, each is subject to regulation by the OTS. Federal savings banks are subject to extensive regulation and examination by the OTS, their primary federal regulator, as well as the FDIC. All savings associations are subject to the capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. HRB Bank must meet specific capital guidelines involving quantitative measures of HRB Banks assets, liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. HRB Banks capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. As of March 31, 2011, our most recent Thrift Financial Report (TFR) filing with the OTS, HRB bank was a well capitalized institution under the prompt corrective action provisions of the FDIC. See Item 8, note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of regulatory capital requirements and classifications. HRB Bank is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of HR Block, Inc. and its customer deposits are insured by the FDIC. If an insured institution fails, claims for administrative expenses of the receiver and for deposits in U.S. branches (including claims of the FDIC as subrogee of the failed institution) have priority over the claims of general unsecured creditors. In addition, the FDIC has authority to require HR Block, Inc. to reimburse it for losses it incurs in connection with the failure of HRB Bank or with the FDICs provision of assistance to a banking subsidiary that is in danger of failure. HR Block, Inc. is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiary, HRB Bank. Various federal and state statutory provisions and regulations limit the amount of dividends HRB Bank may pay without regulatory approval. The OTS has authority to prohibit HRB Bank from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their business. The payment of dividends, depending on the financial condition of the bank, could be deemed an unsafe or unsound practice. The ability of HRB Bank to pay dividends in the future is currently, and could be further, influenced by bank regulatory policies and capital guidelines. The U.S., various state, local, provincial and foreign governments and some self regulatory organizations have enacted statutes and ordinances, and or adopted rules and regulations, regulating aspects of our business. These aspects include, but are not limited to, commercial income tax return preparers, income tax courses, the electronic filing of income tax returns, the offering of RACs, the facilitation of RALs, loan originations and assistance in loan originations, mortgage lending, privacy, consumer protection, franchising, sales methods, banking, accountants and the accounting practice. We seek to determine the applicability of such statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations (collectively, Laws) and comply with those Laws. From time to time in the ordinary course of business, we receive inquiries from governmental and self regulatory agencies regarding the applicability of Laws to our services and products. In response to past inquiries, we have agreed to comply with such Laws, convinced the authorities that such Laws were not applicable or that compliance already exists and or modified our activities in the applicable jurisdiction to avoid the application of all or certain parts of such Laws. We believe the past resolution of such inquiries and our ongoing compliance with Laws has not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. We cannot predict what effect future Laws, changes in interpretations of existing Laws or the results of future regulator inquiries with respect to the applicability of Laws may have on our consolidated financial statements. See additional discussion of legal matters in Item 3, Legal Proceedings and Item 8, note 19 to our consolidated financial statements.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Item 8, note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK INTEREST RATE RISK GENERAL We have a formal investment policy that strives to minimize the market risk exposure of our cash equivalents and available for sale (AFS) securities, which are primarily affected by credit quality and movements in interest rates. These guidelines focus on managing liquidity and preserving principal and earnings. Our cash equivalents are primarily held for liquidity purposes and are comprised of high quality, short term investments, including qualified money market funds. Because our cash and cash equivalents have a relatively short maturity, our portfolios market value is relatively insensitive to interest rate changes. As our short term borrowings are generally seasonal, interest rate risk typically increases through our third fiscal quarter and declines to zero by fiscal year end. While the market value of short term borrowings is relatively insensitive to interest rate changes, interest expense on short term borrowings will increase and decrease with changes in the underlying short term interest rates. Our long term debt at April 30, 2011, consists primarily of fixed rate Senior Notes; therefore, a change in interest rates would have no impact on consolidated pretax earnings. See Item 8, note 11 to our consolidated financial statements. HRB BANK At April 30, 2011, residential mortgage loans held for investment consisted of 42% fixed rate loans and 58% adjustable rate loans. These loans are sensitive to changes in interest rates as well as expected prepayment levels. As interest rates increase, fixed rate residential mortgages tend to exhibit lower 32 HR BLOCK 2011 Form 10K Table of Contents prepayments. The opposite is true in a falling rate environment. When mortgage loans prepay, mortgage origination costs are written off. Depending on the timing of the prepayment, the write offs of mortgage origination costs may result in lower than anticipated yields. At April 30, 2011, HRB Banks other investments consisted primarily of mortgage backed securities and FHLB stock. See table below for sensitivity analysis of our mortgage backed securities. HRB Banks liabilities consist primarily of transactional deposit relationships, such as prepaid debit card accounts and checking accounts. Other liabilities include money market accounts, certificates of deposit and collateralized borrowings from the FHLB. Money market accounts re price as interest rates change. Certificates of deposit re price over time depending on maturities. FHLB advances generally have fixed rates ranging from one day through multiple years. Under criteria published by the OTS, HRB Banks overall interest rate risk exposure at March 31, 2011, the most recent date an evaluation was completed, was characterized as minimal. We actively manage our interest rate risk positions. As interest rates change, we will adjust our strategy and mix of assets and liabilities to optimize our position. EQUITY PRICE RISK We have limited exposure to the equity markets. Our primary exposure is through our deferred compensation plans. Within the deferred compensation plans, we have mismatches in asset and liability amounts and investment choices (both fixed income and equity). At April 30, 2011 and 2010, the impact of a 10% market value change in the combined equity assets held by our deferred compensation plans and other equity investments would be $10.9 million and $9.7 million, respectively, assuming no offset for the liabilities. FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE RISK Our operations in international markets are exposed to movements in currency exchange rates. The currencies involved are the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar. We translate revenues and expenses related to these operations at the average of exchange rates in effect during the period. Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing at the end of the year. Translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of other comprehensive income in stockholders equity. Translation of financial results into U.S. dollars does not presently materially affect and has not historically materially affected our consolidated financial results, although such changes do affect the year to year comparability of the operating results in U.S. dollars of our international businesses. We estimate a 10% change in foreign exchange rates by itself would impact consolidated net income in fiscal years 2011 and 2010 by $3.7 million and $5.1 million, respectively, and cash balances at April 30, 2011 and 2010 by $7.6 million and $7.1 million, respectively. During fiscal year 2011, borrowing needs in our Canadian operations were funded by corporate borrowings in the U.S. To mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate risk, we used forward foreign exchange contracts. We do not enter into forward contracts for speculative purposes. In estimating the fair value of derivative positions, we utilized quoted market prices, if available, or quotes obtained from external sources. When foreign currency financial instruments are outstanding, exposure to market risk on these instruments results from fluctuations in currency rates during the periods in which the contracts are outstanding. The counterparties to our currency exchange contracts consist of major financial institutions, each of which is rated investment grade. We are exposed to credit risk to the extent of potential non performance by counterparties on financial instruments. Any potential credit exposure does not exceed the fair value. We believe the risk of incurring losses due to credit risk is remote. At April 30, 2011 we had no forward exchange contracts outstanding. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS The sensitivities of certain financial instruments to changes in interest rates as of April 30, 2011 and 2010 are presented below. The following table represents hypothetical instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in interest rates and should not be relied on as an indicator of future expected results. The impact of a change in interest rates on other factors, such as delinquency and prepayment rates, is not included in the analysis below.
