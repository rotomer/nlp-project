ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our subsidiaries provide tax preparation and retail banking services. We are the only major company offering a full range of software, online and in office tax preparation solutions to individual tax clients. OVERVIEW A summary of our fiscal year 2012 results is as follows: Revenues for the fiscal year were $2.9 billion, down 1.7% from prior year results, primarily due to a promotional offering on RACs, coupled with lower interest income on EAs. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 8.7% from the prior year to $1.16. U.S. tax returns prepared by us increased 4.2% from the prior year primarily due to strong results in our online offering. Pretax income for the Tax Services segment decreased $63.5 million, or 8.3%, due primarily to the decline in RAC revenues, a $35.7 million increase in marketing expense and increases in litigation and other expenses, partially offset by a $71.0 million decline in bad debt expense. In fiscal year 2012, we sold RSM and also sold RSM EquiCo, Inc.s subsidiary, McGladrey Capital Markets LLC (MCM). As of April 30, 2012, the results of operations of these businesses are presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements. All periods presented have been reclassified to reflect our discontinued operations. See additional information in Item 8, note 20 to the consolidated financial statements. In April 2012, we announced a strategic realignment which eliminated approximately 350 positions and closed approximately 200 underperforming company owned offices. We recorded $31.2 million in severance costs and $5.5 million in lease termination costs and impairment charges.

Tax preparation fees increased $23.5 million, or 1.2% primarily due to an increase in tax returns prepared in our international operations and favorable exchange rates. Return volume and pricing in U.S. company owned offices were relatively unchanged from the prior year. Royalties increased $4.4 million, or 1.4%, primarily due to a 1.9% increase in returns prepared in franchise offices. Fees earned on RACs decreased $49.3 million, or 27.1%, due to a promotional offering, whereby clients were eligible to receive a RAC at no charge through February 4, if they elected to have their refund direct deposited onto an Emerald Card. Emerald Card fees increased $13.7 million, or 15.1%, primarily due to higher transaction volumes resulting from an increase of approximately 24% in prepaid debit cards issued. Interest income earned on EAs decreased $34.6 million, or 36.7%, as a result of lower EA volumes principally resulting from changes in underwriting criteria in the current year. Prior to fiscal year 2011, RALs were offered to our clients by a third party. In the prior year, we recognized the final contractual fees related to RALs totaling $17.2 million. Other revenue increased $12.5 million, or 5.8%, primarily due to an increase in online tax preparation revenues. Total expenses increased $13.5 million, or 0.6%, compared to the prior year. Benefits and other compensation increased $8.8 million, or 5.0%, over the prior year primarily due to incremental severance costs. Marketing and advertising increased $35.7 million, or 14.7%, as we expanded our marketing efforts, primarily in television and online. Bad debt expense decreased $71.0 million, or 51.0%, primarily as a result of lower EA volumes in the current year and with better collection rates in the current year. Other expenses increased $31.4 million, or 12.8%, primarily due to incremental litigation expenses recorded in the current year. Gains on the sale of tax offices declined $28.5 million, as we sold 83 offices in the current year compared to 280 in the prior year. Pretax income for fiscal year 2012 decreased $63.5 million, or 8.3%, from 2011. The pretax margin for the segment decreased to 24.6% from 26.4% in fiscal year 2011. 20 H&R BLOCK 2012 Form 10K Table of Contents FISCAL 2011 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2010 Tax Services revenues decreased $62.9 million, or 2.1%, compared to the prior year. Tax preparation fees decreased $61.0 million, or 3.1%, due primarily to the sale of company owned offices to franchisees and the loss of certain clients as a result of not having a RAL offering in our tax offices in fiscal year 2011. Although we gained clients through the free Federal EZ filing we began offering during fiscal year 2011, that increase did not have a significant impact on our revenues. Royalties increased $28.6 million, or 10.4%, primarily due to the conversion of 280 company owned offices into franchises. Fees earned on RACs increased $94.1 million, or 107.5%, primarily due to an increase in the number of RACs issued as a portion of our clients chose to receive their refunds via RAC, as an alternative to a RAL. RALs were historically offered to our clients by HSBC Holdings plc (HSBC). In December 2010, HSBC terminated its contract with us based on restrictions placed on HSBC by its regulator and, therefore, RALs were not offered during the 2011 tax season. Revenues of $17.2 million include the recognition of net deferred fees from HSBC. This compares with revenues resulting from loans participations and related fees in fiscal year 2010 of $146.2 million. Interest income earned on EAs increased $16.4 million, or 21.1%, over fiscal year 2010 primarily due to an increase in loan volume, which resulted from offering the product to a wider client base. Total expenses increased $37.0 million, or 1.8%, compared to fiscal year 2010. Compensation and benefits decreased $8.5 million, or 0.8%, primarily due to lower commission based wages due to conversions to franchise offices, reduced headcount and related payroll taxes. This decline was partially offset by severance costs and related payroll taxes of $27.4 million. Occupancy costs declined $25.6 million, or 6.2%, due to office closures and cost saving initiatives. Bad debt expense increased $34.3 million, or 32.8%, primarily due to increased volumes on EAs, as well as a decline in tax returns prepared for those clients. During fiscal year 2011, we recorded a $22.7 million impairment of goodwill in an ancillary reporting unit, as discussed in Item 8, note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. Other expenses increased $11.5 million, or 4.9%, primarily due to incremental litigation expenses recorded in fiscal year 2011. Pretax income for fiscal year 2011 decreased $99.9 million, or 11.5%, from 2010. As a result of the declines in revenues and higher expenses, primarily bad debt expense and goodwill impairment, pretax margin for the segment decreased to 26.4% from 29.2% in fiscal year 2010. CORPORATE, ELIMINATIONS AND INCOME TAXES ON CONTINUING OPERATIONS Corporate operating losses include net interest margin and gains or losses relating to mortgage loans held for investment, real estate owned and residual interests in securitizations, along with interest expense on borrowings and other corporate expenses. Corporate Operating Results (in 000s) Year ended April 30, 2012 2011 2010 Interest income on mortgage loans held for investment $ 20,322 $ 24,693 $ 31,877 Other 11,071 7,926 7,706 Total revenues 31,393 32,619 39,583 Interest expense 83,658 84,288 79,929 Provision for loan losses 24,075 35,567 47,750 Other, net 51,592 52,559 55,852 Total expense 159,325 172,414 183,531 Pretax loss $ (127,932 ) $ (139,795 ) $ (143,948 ) FISCAL YEAR 2012 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR 2011 Interest income earned on mortgage loans held for investment decreased $4.4 million, or 17.7%, from the prior year, primarily as a result of declining rates and non performing loans. Our provision for loan losses decreased $11.5 million, or 32.3%, from the prior year as a result of the continued run off of our portfolio. Income Taxes on Continuing Operations Our effective tax rate for continuing operations in fiscal year 2012 was 39.9% compared to 37.5% in the prior year. The higher effective tax rate was primarily due to increased tax expense related to changes in the value of investments held within company owned life insurance (COLI) policies. A portion of the increase related to COLI resulted from the decision to surrender COLI policies no longer required to support our deferred H&R BLOCK 2012 Form 10K 21 Table of Contents compensation liabilities. This decision triggered a one time tax expense related to prior period gains. In addition to the impact of COLI, changes in tax items including valuation allowances, income tax reserves and other discrete tax adjustments caused a small net increase to tax expense. FISCAL YEAR 2011 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR 2010 Interest income earned on mortgage loans held for investment decreased $7.2 million, or 22.5%, from the prior year, primarily as a result of declining rates and non performing loans. Our provision for loan losses decreased $12.2 million, or 25.5%, from the prior year as a result of the continued run off of our portfolio. Income Taxes on Continuing Operations Our effective tax rate from continuing operations was 37.5% for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2011, compared to 37.1% in the prior year. The increase resulted from a decline in gains from investments in company owned life insurance assets which were not subject to tax and an increase in the state effective tax rate offset by other favorable net discrete adjustments recorded in fiscal year 2011 compared to net unfavorable adjustments recorded in fiscal year 2010. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Our discontinued operations include the results of RSM and related businesses, which were previously reported in our Business Services segment, and our discontinued mortgage operations. Discontinued Operations Operating Results (in 000s) Year ended April 30, 2012 2011 2010 Revenues $ 417,168 $ 828,725 $ 859,869 Pretax income (loss) from operations: RSM and related businesses $ 14,441 $ 48,021 $ 59,492 Mortgage (59,702 ) (20,644 ) (16,449 ) (45,261 ) 27,377 43,043 Income taxes (benefit) (13,329 ) 13,814 18,924 Net income (loss) from operations (31,932 ) 13,563 24,119 Pretax loss on sales of businesses (109,719 ) Income tax benefit (61,615 ) Net loss on sales of businesses (48,104 ) Net income (loss) from discontinued operations $ (80,036 ) $ 13,563 $ 24,119 FISCAL YEAR 2012 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR 2011 The net loss from our discontinued operations totaled $80.0 million compared to income of $13.6 million for the prior year. The loss on the sale of RSM and related businesses includes a $99.7 million goodwill impairment recorded in the first quarter related to the sales of RSM and MCM. Additionally, the prior year includes twelve months of RSM operating results while the current year includes only seven months. The loss related to the mortgage business increased due to a settlement of approximately $28 million to the SEC accrued during the current year, coupled with $20.0 million in incremental loss provisions related to an increase in SCCs estimated contingent losses for representation and warranty claims. Income Taxes The sale of RSM resulted in a pretax financial statement loss, but produced a gain for tax purposes. The tax gain resulted primarily from larger amortization deductions taken for tax purposes than for financial statement purposes. A portion of the gain from the sale of intangible assets is capital in nature and was offset by utilization of capital loss carry forwards, resulting in an incremental tax benefit reported for financial statement purposes. FISCAL YEAR 2011 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR 2010 Net income from our discontinued operations fell to $13.6 million in fiscal year 2011, from $24.1 million for fiscal year 2010, primarily due to lower revenues and higher litigation expenses in our RSM business and higher expenses from our discontinued mortgage business. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate for discontinued operations was 50.5% for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2011, compared to 44.0% in the prior year. This increase resulted from the impact of permanent tax items and increased state tax rates. 22 H&R BLOCK 2012 Form 10K Table of Contents REPRESENTATION AND WARRANTY CLAIMS SCC has accrued a liability for estimated contingent losses related to representation and warranty claims as of April 30, 2012 of $130.0 million, which represents SCCs estimate of the probable loss that may occur. Losses on claims reviewed and deemed to be valid totaled $16.2 million, $12.2 million and $18.2 million for fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. These amounts were recorded as reductions of SCCs accrued representation and warranty liability. During the second and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2012, SCC observed an increase in third party activity. As a result of this third party activity, SCCs estimate of probable claims increased from its prior expectations, resulting in additional loss provisions of approximately $56 million. These loss provisions were partially offset by changes in assumptions, including a decrease in the rate at which claims have been found to be valid, corresponding to recent trends in reviewed claims, and a decrease in expected future claims related to net interest margin (NIM) bonds that had matured, resulting in a net recorded loss provision in discontinued operations of $20.0 million. See additional discussion in Item 1A, Risk Factors, Critical Accounting Estimates below and in Item 8, note 18 to the consolidated financial statements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We consider the estimates discussed below to be critical to understanding our financial statements, as they require the use of significant judgment and estimation in order to measure, at a specific point in time, matters that are inherently uncertain. Specific risks for these critical accounting estimates are described in the following paragraphs. We have reviewed and discussed each of these estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. For all of these estimates, we caution that future events rarely develop precisely as forecasted and estimates routinely require adjustment and may require material adjustment. See Item 8, note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, which discusses accounting estimates we have selected when there are acceptable alternatives and new or proposed accounting standards that may affect our financial reporting in the future. MORTGAGE LOAN REPRESENTATION AND WARRANTY CLAIMS In connection with the sale of loans and or RMBSs, SCC made certain representations and warranties. These representations and warranties varied based on the nature of the transaction and the buyers or insurers requirements, but generally pertained to the ownership of the loan, the validity of the lien securing the loan, borrower fraud, the loans compliance with the criteria for inclusion in the transaction, including compliance with SCCs underwriting standards or loan criteria established by the buyer, ability to deliver required documentation, and compliance with applicable laws. Representations and warranties related to borrower fraud in whole loan sale transactions to institutional investors, which represented approximately 68% of the disposal of loans originated in calendar years 2005, 2006 and 2007, included a knowledge qualifier limiting SCCs liability to those instances where SCC had knowledge of the fraud at the time the loans were sold. Representations and warranties made in other sale transactions did not include a knowledge qualifier as to borrower fraud. In the event that there is a breach of a representation and warranty and such breach materially and adversely affects the value of a mortgage loan or a securitization insurers or certificate holders interest in the mortgage loan, SCC may be obligated to repurchase the loan or may otherwise indemnify certain parties for losses, referred to as representation and warranty claims. The amount of claims received varies from period to period, and these variances have been and are expected to continue to fluctuate substantially. Although there is no certainty regarding future claims volume, SCC may continue to experience an increase in representation and warranty claims as a result of volatility in mortgage delinquency rates, housing prices and expected expiration of applicable statutes of limitations and developments in securities litigation and other proceedings to which SCC is not a party. SCC accrues a liability for contingent losses relating to representation and warranty claims by estimating probable losses for those claims, both known and projected, based on, among other things, historical validity and severity rates. Projections of future claims are based on an analysis that includes a review of the terms and provisions of applicable agreements, the historical experience under representation and warranty claims and third party activity, which includes inquiries from various third parties. SCCs methodology for calculating this liability also includes an assessment of the probability that individual counterparties (private label securitization trustees on behalf of certificate holders, monoline insurers and whole loan purchasers) will assert future claims. This accrued liability is included in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, and represents SCCs estimate of losses from future representation and H&R BLOCK 2012 Form 10K 23 Table of Contents warranty claims where assertion of a claim and a related contingent loss are both determined to be probable and reasonably estimable. Because, among other things, the rate at which future claims may be determined to be valid and actual loss severity rates may differ significantly from historical experience, SCC is not able to estimate reasonably possible loss outcomes in excess of its current accrual. A 1% increase in both assumed validity rates and loss severities would result in losses beyond SCCs accrual of approximately $31 million. This sensitivity is hypothetical and is intended to provide an indication of the impact of a change in key assumptions on the representation and warranty claims liability. In reality, changes in one assumption may result in changes in other assumptions, which could affect the sensitivity and the amount of losses. While SCC uses what it believes to be the best information available to it in estimating its liability, assessing the likelihood that claims will be asserted in the future and estimating probable losses are inherently subjective and require considerable management judgment. To the extent that the volume of asserted claims, the level of valid claims, the counterparties asserting claims, the nature and severity of claims, remedies claimed, or the value of residential home prices, among other factors, differ in the future from current estimates, future losses may differ from the current estimates and those differences may be significant. See Item 8, note 18 to the consolidated financial statements. LITIGATION AND RELATED CONTINGENCIES It is our policy to routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes related to legal matters, as well as ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of the liability required to be accrued, if any, for these contingencies is made after analysis of each known issue and an analysis of historical experience. Therefore, we have accrued liabilities related to certain legal matters for which we believe it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the range of such loss can be reasonably estimated. With respect to other matters, we have concluded that a loss is only reasonably possible or remote, or is not reasonably estimable and, therefore, no liability is accrued. Assessing the likely outcome of pending litigation, including the amount of potential loss, if any, is highly subjective. Our judgments on whether a loss is probable, reasonably possible or remote and our estimates of probable loss amounts may differ from actual results due to difficulties in predicting the outcome of jury trials, arbitration hearings, settlement discussions and related activity, predicting the outcome of class certification actions and numerous other uncertainties. Due to the number of claims which are periodically asserted against us, and the magnitude of damages sought in those claims, actual losses in the future may significantly differ from our current estimates. We are subject to threatened litigation claims and indemnification claims, which are described in Item 8, note 19 to the consolidated financial statements. ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES The principal amount of mortgage loans held for investment totaled $429.3 million at April 30, 2012. We are exposed to the risk that borrowers may not repay amounts owed to us when they become contractually due. We record an allowance representing our estimate of probable credit losses in the portfolio of loans held for investment at the balance sheet date. Determination of our allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because loss provisions can be material to our operating results, projections of loan delinquencies and related matters are inherently subjective, and actual losses are impacted by factors outside of our control including economic conditions, unemployment rates and residential home prices. We record a loan loss allowance for loans less than 60 days past due on a pooled basis. The aggregate principal balance of these loans totaled $248.8 million at April 30, 2012, and the portion of our allowance for loan losses allocated to these loans totaled $9.2 million. In estimating our loan loss allowance for these loans, we stratify the loan portfolio based on our view of risk associated with various elements of the pool and assign estimated loss rates based on those risks. Loss rates are based primarily on historical experience and our assessment of economic and market conditions. Loss rates consider both the rate at which loans will become delinquent (frequency) and the amount of loss that will ultimately be realized upon occurrence of a liquidation of collateral (severity). Frequency rates are based primarily on historical migration analysis of loans to delinquent status. Severity rates are based primarily on recent broker quotes or appraisals of collateral. Because of imprecision and uncertainty inherent in developing estimates of future credit losses, in particular during periods of rapidly declining collateral values or increasing delinquency rates, our estimation process includes development of ranges of possible outcomes. Ranges were developed by stressing initial estimates of both frequency and severity rates. Stressing of frequency and severity assumptions is intended to model deterioration in credit quality that is difficult to predict during declining economic conditions. Future deterioration in credit quality may exceed our modeled assumptions. Mortgage loans held for investment include loans originated by our affiliate, SCC, and purchased by HRB Bank. We have greater exposure to loss with respect to this segment of our loan portfolio as a result of 24 H&R BLOCK 2012 Form 10K Table of Contents historically higher delinquency rates. Therefore, we assign higher frequency rate assumptions to SCC originated loans compared with loans originated by other third party banks as we consider estimates of future losses. At April 30, 2012 our weighted average frequency assumption was 11% for SCC originated loans compared to 2% for remaining loans in the portfolio. We consider loans 60 days past due impaired and review them individually. We record loss estimates typically based on the value of the underlying collateral. For loans over 60 days past due but less than 180 days past due or otherwise impaired, we record a loan loss allowance. Our loan loss allowance for these impaired loans reflected an average loss severity of 36% at April 30, 2012. The aggregate principal balance of these impaired loans totaled $108.6 million at April 30, 2012, and the portion of our allowance for loan losses allocated to these loans totaled $9.6 million. For loans 180 days or more past due, we charge off the loans to the value of the collateral less costs to sell. Loans more than 180 days past due were partially charged off at a severity rate of 46%. Modified loans that meet the definition of a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) are also considered impaired and are reviewed individually. We record impairment equal to the difference between the principal balance of the loan and the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate. However, if we assess that foreclosure of a modified loan is probable, we record impairment based on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral. The aggregate principal balance of TDR loans totaled $71.9 million at April 30, 2012, and the portion of our allowance for loan losses allocated to these loans totaled $7.8 million. Charge offs increased during the current year primarily due to a change whereby we now charge off loans 180 days past due, rather than record a specific loan loss allowance for those loans. This change had no income statement impact, but reduced the principal amount of loans outstanding and reduced the related allowance. This was a result of our change in regulators from the OTS to the OCC. The residential mortgage industry has experienced significant adverse trends for an extended period. If adverse trends continue for a sustained period or at rates worse than modeled by us, we may be required to record additional loan loss provisions, and those losses may be significant. Determining the allowance for loan losses for loans held for investment requires us to make estimates of losses that are highly uncertain and requires a high degree of judgment. If our underlying assumptions prove to be inaccurate, the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses. Our mortgage loan portfolio is a static pool, as we are no longer originating or purchasing new mortgage loans, and we believe that factor, over time, will limit variability in our loss estimates. VALUATION OF GOODWILL The evaluation of goodwill for impairment is a critical accounting estimate due both to the magnitude of our goodwill balances and the judgment involved in determining the fair value of our reporting units. Goodwill balances totaled $427.6 million as of April 30, 2012 and $434.2 million as of April 30, 2011. We test goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change which would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. Our goodwill impairment analysis is based on a discounted cash flow (DCF) approach and market comparables. DCF analyses are based on the current revenue and expense forecasts and estimated long term growth estimates for each reporting unit. Future cash flows are discounted based on a market comparable weighted average cost of capital rate for each reporting unit, adjusted for market and other risks where appropriate. In addition, we analyze any difference between the sum of the fair values of the reporting units and our total market capitalization for reasonableness. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, a second step is performed in which the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is compared to the carrying value of the goodwill. The implied fair value of the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value, the difference is recognized as an impairment charge. Based on our assessment performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012, the fair value of the goodwill within our reporting units substantially exceeded its carrying value. Changes to our estimates and assumptions associated with the reporting units could materially affect the determination of fair value and could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our financial position and results of operations. H&R BLOCK 2012 Form 10K 25 Table of Contents This analysis, at the reporting unit level, requires significant management judgment with respect to revenue and expense forecasts, anticipated changes in working capital and the selection and application of an appropriate discount rate. Changes in projections or assumptions could materially affect our estimate of reporting unit fair values. The use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted future operating cash flows and could affect our conclusions regarding the existence or amount of potential impairment. Finally, strategic changes in our outlook regarding reporting units or intangible assets may alter our valuation approach and could result in changes to our conclusions regarding impairment. Future estimates of fair value may be adversely impacted by declining economic conditions. In addition, if future operating results of our reporting units are below our current modeled expectations, fair value estimates may decline. Any of these factors could result in future impairments, and those impairments could be significant. In fiscal year 2012, we discontinued service under our ExpressTax brand and closed approximately 200 underperforming company owned offices as a result of our strategic realignment announced in April 2012. As a result, we recorded an impairment of goodwill, which totaled $7.4 million, in our Tax Services segment. We recorded a goodwill impairment of $22.7 million related to our RedGear reporting unit within our Tax Services segment in fiscal year 2011. See Item 8, note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. INCOME TAXES Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We calculate our current and deferred tax provision for the fiscal year based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the applicable calendar year. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded in the appropriate periods when identified. We file a consolidated federal tax return on a calendar year basis, generally in the second fiscal quarter of the subsequent year. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We have considered taxable income in carry back periods, historical and forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. Determination of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets requires that we make judgments about future matters that are not certain, including projections of future taxable income and evaluating potential tax planning strategies. To the extent that actual results differ from our current assumptions, the valuation allowance will increase or decrease. In the event we determine that we could not realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination. Likewise, if we later determine it is more likely than not that we could realize the deferred tax assets, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance. The income tax laws of jurisdictions in which we operate are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and applicable government taxing authorities. Income tax returns filed by us are based on our interpretation of these rules. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which may result in proposed assessments, including assessments of interest and or penalties. Our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly subjective and based on our best judgments. Actual results may differ from our current judgments due to a variety of factors, including changes in law, interpretations of law by taxing authorities that differ from our assessments, changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate and results of routine tax examinations. We believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters. However, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved, or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire. As a result, our effective tax rate may fluctuate on a quarterly basis. REVENUE RECOGNITION We have many different revenue sources, each governed by specific revenue recognition policies. Our revenue recognition policies can be found in Item 8, note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. FINANCIAL CONDITION CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Our sources of capital include cash from operations, cash from customer deposits, issuances of common stock and debt. We use capital primarily to fund working capital, 26 H&R BLOCK 2012 Form 10K Table of Contents pay dividends, repurchase treasury shares and acquire businesses. Our operations are highly seasonal and therefore generally require the use of cash to fund operating losses during the period May through mid January. Given the likely availability of a number of liquidity options discussed herein, including borrowing capacity under our CLOC, we believe that in the absence of any unexpected developments our existing sources of capital at April 30, 2012 are sufficient to meet our operating needs. These comments should be read in conjunction with the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included in Item 8. (in 000s) Year ended April 30, 2012 2011 2010 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 362,049 $ 512,503 $ 587,469 Investing activities 351,867 (110,157 ) 31,353 Financing activities (445,062 ) (534,391 ) (481,118 ) Effect of exchange rates on cash (2,364 ) 5,844 11,678 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 266,490 $ (126,201 ) $ 149,382 CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES Cash provided by operations, which consists primarily of cash received from customers, decreased $150.5 million from fiscal year 2011. The decline from the prior year was primarily due to lower net income of our continuing operations and losses in our discontinued operations. Restricted Cash. We hold certain cash balances that are restricted as to use. Cash and cash equivalents restricted totaled $48.1 million at April 30, 2012, and primarily consisted of cash held by our captive insurance subsidiary that will be used to pay claims and cash held by HRB Bank required for regulatory compliance. CASH FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES Changes in cash provided by investing activities primarily relate to the following: Available for Sale Securities. During fiscal year 2012, HRB Bank purchased $256.2 million in mortgage backed securities for regulatory purposes, compared to $138.8 million in fiscal year 2011. Additionally, we received payments on AFS securities of $66.4 million in fiscal year 2012 compared to $16.8 million and $15.8 million in fiscal years 2011 and 2010, respectively. See additional discussion in Item 8, note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. Mortgage Loans Held for Investment. We received net proceeds of $49.1 million, $58.5 million and $72.8 million on our mortgage loans held for investment in fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Purchases of Property and Equipment. Total cash paid for property and equipment was $82.5 million, $63.0 million and $90.5 million for fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Business Acquisitions. Total cash paid for acquisitions was $15.3 million, $54.2 million and $10.5 million during fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In fiscal year 2011 our previously reported Business Services segment acquired Caturano, a Boston based accounting firm, and cash used in investing activities includes payments totaling $32.6 million related to this acquisition. Sales of Businesses. We received proceeds from the sales of businesses of $560.5 million, $71.1 million and $66.6 million for fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Current year amounts include net proceeds of $523.1 million from the sale of RSM and proceeds of $37.4 million from the sale of ancillary businesses and offices. During fiscal year 2012, we sold 83 tax offices to franchisees, compared to 280 tax offices in fiscal year 2011, and 267 in fiscal year 2010. The majority of these sales were financed through affiliate loans. Loans Made to Franchisees. Loans made to franchisees totaled $46.2 million, $92.5 million and $89.7 million for fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We received payments from franchisees totaling $56.6 million, $57.6 million and $40.7 million, respectively. These amounts include both the financing of sales of tax offices and franchisee draws under our Franchise Equity Lines of Credit (FELCs). CASH FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES Changes in cash used in financing activities primarily relate to the following: Short Term Borrowings. While we use commercial paper borrowings to fund our off season losses and cover our seasonal working capital needs, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of April 30, 2012 or 2011. Our commercial paper borrowings peaked at $331.5 million in January of the current year. Our borrowings in the current year were lower than previous years due to cash received from the sale of RSM. FHLB Borrowings. HRB Bank obtains borrowings from the FHLB in accordance with regulatory and capital requirements. During fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, we had net repayments of $25.0 million, $50.0 million and $25.0 million, respectively. H&R BLOCK 2012 Form 10K 27 Table of Contents Customer Banking Deposits. Changes in customer banking deposits resulted in a use of cash of $26.1 million in the current year compared to $11.4 million in fiscal year 2011. Cash totaling $17.5 million was provided in fiscal year 2010. These deposits are held by HRB Bank. Dividends. We have consistently paid quarterly dividends. Dividends paid totaled $208.8 million, $186.8 million and $200.9 million in fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. During fiscal year 2012, our Board of Directors approved an increase of our quarterly cash dividend from $0.15 per share to $0.20 per share. The increase was effective with the quarterly dividend payable on January 5, 2012 to shareholders of record as of December 22, 2011. Although we have historically paid dividends and currently plan to continue to do so, there can be no assurances that circumstances will not change in the future that could affect our ability or decisions to pay dividends. Repurchase and Retirement of Common Stock. During fiscal year 2012, we purchased and immediately retired 14.6 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $200.0 million. As of April 30, 2012, payment of $22.5 million related to 1.5 million shares had not yet settled and was accrued as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet. During fiscal year 2011, we purchased and immediately retired 19.0 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $279.9 million. During fiscal year 2010, we purchased and immediately retired 12.8 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $250.0 million. Although we have historically from time to time repurchased and retired common stock and our Board of Directors has approved an extension of our current share repurchase program as discussed below, there can be no assurances that circumstances will not change in the future that could affect our ability or decisions to repurchase and retire common stock. Through June 25 of the first quarter of fiscal year 2013, we repurchased and immediately retired an additional 21.3 million shares at a cost of $315.0 million. We also retired 60.0 million shares of treasury stock in June 2012. The June retirement of treasury stock had no impact on our total consolidated stockholders equity. In June 2008, our Board of Directors approved an authorization to purchase up to $2.0 billion of our common stock through June 2012. In June 2012, our Board of Directors extended this authorization through June 2015. There was approximately $1.2 billion remaining under this authorization at April 30, 2012. Issuances of Common Stock. Proceeds from the issuance of common stock in accordance with our stock based compensation plans totaled $12.3 million, $0.4 million and $16.7 million in fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. HRB BANK At April 30, 2012, HRB Bank had cash balances of $513.5 million. Distribution of that cash balance would be subject to regulatory approval and it is therefore not available for general corporate purposes. Block Financial LLC (Block Financial) typically makes capital contributions to HRB Bank to help meet its capital requirements. Block Financial made capital contributions to HRB Bank of $400.0 million during fiscal year 2012 and $235.0 million during both fiscal year 2011 and fiscal year 2010. Historically, capital contributions by Block Financial have been repaid as dividends or a return of capital by HRB Bank as capital requirements decline. A return of capital or dividend paid by HRB Bank must be approved by the OCC and the Federal Reserve. Although such payments have been approved by our regulators in the past, there is no assurance that they will continue to be in the future, in particular if our regulators determine that higher capital levels at HRB Bank are necessary due to non performing asset levels. In addition, Block Financial may elect to maintain higher capital levels at HRB Bank. HRB Bank paid dividends and returned capital of $400.0 million during fiscal year 2012. HRB Bank paid dividends and returned capital of $262.5 million during fiscal year 2011, comprised of $37.5 million in real estate owned (REO) properties and loans and $225.0 million in cash. There were no such dividends or repayments of capital in fiscal year 2010. See additional discussion of regulatory and capital requirements of HRB Bank in Regulatory Environment below. ASSETS HELD BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES At April 30, 2012, cash and short term investment balances of $101.8 million were held by our foreign subsidiaries. These funds would have to be repatriated to be available to fund domestic operations, and income taxes would be accrued and paid on those amounts. We do not currently intend to repatriate any funds held by our foreign subsidiaries. 28 H&R BLOCK 2012 Form 10K Table of Contents BORROWINGS We continually monitor our funding requirements and execute strategies to manage our overall asset and liability profile. The following chart provides the ratings for debt issued by Block Financial as of April 30, 2012 and 2011: As of April 30, 2012 April 30, 2011 Short term Long term Outlook Short term Long term Outlook Moodys P 2 Baa2 Stable P 2 Baa2 Negative S&P A 2 BBB Negative A 2 BBB Negative DBRS R 2 (high) BBB (high) Stable R 2 (high) BBB (high) Stable At April 30, 2012, we maintained a CLOC agreement to support commercial paper issuances, general corporate purposes or for working capital needs. This facility provides funding up to $1.7 billion and matures July 31, 2013. This facility bears interest at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 1.30% to 2.80% or PRIME plus 0.30% to 1.80%, depending on the type of borrowing, and includes an annual facility fee of 0.20% to 0.70% of the committed amounts, based on our credit ratings. Covenants in this facility include: (1) maintenance of a minimum equity of $500.0 million on the last day of any fiscal quarter; and (2) reduction of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of short term debt, as defined in the CLOC agreement, to $200.0 million or less for thirty consecutive days during the period March 1 to June 30 of each year. At April 30, 2012, we were in compliance with these covenants and had net worth of $1.3 billion. We had no balance outstanding under the CLOC at April 30, 2012. During fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, borrowing needs in our Canadian operations were funded by our U.S. operations. To mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate risk, we used foreign exchange forward contracts. We do not enter into forward contracts for speculative purposes. In estimating the fair value of derivative positions, we utilize quoted market prices, if available, or quotes obtained from external sources. There were no forward contracts outstanding as of April 30, 2012. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS A summary of our obligations to make future payments as of April 30, 2012, is as follows: (in 000s) Total Less Than1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Long term debt (including interest) $ 1,084,044 $ 653,882 $ 430,162 $ $ Customer deposits (including interest) 838,272 832,474 5,710 88 Acquisition payments 30,831 30,831 Contingent acquisition payments 6,838 5,572 1,266 Media advertising purchase obligation 2,779 2,779 Capital lease obligations 10,393 690 1,476 1,616 6,611 Operating leases 468,194 181,800 230,044 48,450 7,900 Total contractual cash obligations $ 2,441,351 $ 1,708,028 $ 668,658 $ 50,154 $ 14,511 The table above does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $206 million due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the future cash outflows associated with these amounts. See discussion of contractual obligations and commitments in Item 8, within the notes to the consolidated financial statements. REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT H&R Block, Inc. is a SLHC and HRB Bank is a federal savings bank. Prior to July 21, 2011, both entities were subject to supervision and regulation by the OTS. The Dodd Frank Act eliminated the OTS effective July 21, 2011. As a result, the Federal Reserve became H&R Block, Inc.s primary federal regulator and the OCC became HRB Banks primary federal regulator. The OTS did not historically subject savings and loan holding companies to consolidated regulatory capital requirements. However, under the Dodd Frank Act, H&R Block, Inc. will be subject to capital requirements that will be set by the Federal Reserve. See discussion in Item 1, Regulation and Supervision Bank and Holding Companies, and in Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional information on regulatory capital requirements for SLHCs, including the new capital requirements for SLHCs proposed by the Federal Reserve in June 2012. The Federal Reserve has indicated that its supervision and oversight of SLHCs and their non bank subsidiaries will be more rigorous than what was previously exercised by the OTS. See Item 1, Regulation and Supervision Bank and Holding Companies, for more detailed information on Federal Reserve regulations. All savings associations are subject to regulatory capital requirements. As of March 31, 2012, our most recent Call Report filing with the OCC, HRB Bank was a well capitalized institution. See Item 1, Regulation and H&R BLOCK 2012 Form 10K 29 Table of Contents Supervision Bank and Holding Companies, and Item 8, note 21 to the consolidated financial statements, for additional discussion of HRB Banks regulatory capital requirements. H&R Block, Inc. is a legal entity separate and distinct from its indirect subsidiary, HRB Bank. Various federal and state statutory and regulatory provisions limit the amount of dividends HRB Bank may pay without regulatory approval. The ability of HRB Bank to pay dividends in the future is currently, and could be further, influenced by bank regulatory policies and capital guidelines. See Item 1, Regulation and Supervision Bank and Holding Companies, for a more detailed discussion of restrictions on payment of dividends. The federal government, various state, local, provincial and foreign governments, and some self regulatory organizations have enacted statutes and ordinances, and or adopted rules and regulations, regulating aspects of our business. These aspects include, but are not limited to, commercial income tax return preparers, income tax courses, the electronic filing of income tax returns, the offering of RACs, the facilitation of RALs, loan originations and assistance in loan originations, mortgage lending, privacy, consumer protection, franchising, sales methods and banking. We seek to determine the applicability of such statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations (collectively, Laws) and comply with those Laws. From time to time in the ordinary course of business, we receive inquiries from governmental and self regulatory agencies regarding the applicability of Laws to our services and products. In response to past inquiries, we have agreed to comply with such Laws, convinced the authorities that such Laws were not applicable or that compliance already exists, and or modified our activities in the applicable jurisdiction to avoid the application of all or certain parts of such Laws. We believe the past resolution of such inquiries and our ongoing compliance with Laws has not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. We cannot predict what effect future Laws, changes in interpretations of existing Laws or the results of future regulator inquiries with respect to the applicability of Laws may have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See additional discussion of legal matters in Item 8, note 19 to the consolidated financial statements.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Item 8, note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK INTEREST RATE RISK General. We have a formal investment policy that strives to minimize the market risk exposure of our cash equivalents and available for sale (AFS) securities, which are primarily affected by credit quality and movements in interest rates. The guidelines in our investment policy focus on managing liquidity and preserving principal and earnings. Our cash equivalents are primarily held for liquidity purposes and are comprised of high quality, short term investments, including qualified money market funds. Because our cash and cash equivalents have a relatively short maturity, our portfolios market value is relatively insensitive to interest rate changes. Our AFS securities consist primarily of mortgage backed securities held to meet the regulatory requirements of HRB Bank. As our short term borrowings are generally seasonal, interest rate risk typically increases through our third fiscal quarter and declines to zero by fiscal year end. While the market value of short term borrowings is relatively insensitive to interest rate changes, interest expense on short term borrowings will increase and decrease with changes in the underlying short term interest rates. Our long term debt at April 30, 2012, consists primarily of fixed rate Senior Notes; therefore, a change in interest rates would have no impact on consolidated pretax earnings. See Item 8, note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. H&R BLOCK 2012 Form 10K 33 Table of Contents Under criteria published by the OCC, HRB Banks overall interest rate risk exposure at March 31, 2012, the most recent date an evaluation was completed, was characterized as minimal. We actively manage our interest rate risk positions. As interest rates change, we will adjust our strategy and mix of assets and liabilities to optimize our position. Mortgage Loans Held for Investment. At April 30, 2012, residential mortgage loans held for investment consisted of a mix of 44% fixed rate loans and 56% adjustable rate loans. These loans are sensitive to changes in interest rates as well as expected prepayment levels. As interest rates increase, fixed rate residential mortgages tend to exhibit lower prepayments. The opposite is true in a falling rate environment. When mortgage loans prepay, mortgage origination costs are written off. Depending on the timing of the prepayment, the write offs of mortgage origination costs may result in lower than anticipated yields. Customer Deposits and FHLB Advances. HRB Banks liabilities consist primarily of transactional deposit relationships, such as prepaid debit card accounts and checking accounts. Other liabilities typically include money market accounts, certificates of deposit and collateralized borrowings from the FHLB. Money market accounts re price as interest rates change. Certificates of deposit re price over time depending on maturities. FHLB advances generally have fixed rates ranging from one day through multiple years. We had no FHLB advances outstanding as of April 30, 2012. FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE RISK Our operations in international markets are exposed to movements in currency exchange rates. The currencies involved are the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar. We translate revenues and expenses related to these operations at the average of exchange rates in effect during the period. Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing at the end of the year. Translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of other comprehensive income in stockholders equity. Translation of financial results into U.S. dollars does not presently materially affect, and has not historically materially affected, our consolidated financial results, although such changes do affect the year to year comparability of the operating results in U.S. dollars of our international businesses. We estimate a 10% change in foreign exchange rates by itself would impact consolidated net income in fiscal years 2012 and 2011 by $5.1 million and $3.7 million, respectively, and cash balances at April 30, 2012 and 2011 by $10.2 million and $7.6 million, respectively. During fiscal year 2012, borrowing needs in our Canadian operations were funded by our U.S. operations. To mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate risk, we used forward foreign exchange contracts during the tax season. We do not enter into forward contracts for speculative purposes. In estimating the fair value of derivative positions, we utilized quoted market prices, if available, or quotes obtained from external sources. When foreign currency financial instruments are outstanding, exposure to market risk on these instruments results from fluctuations in currency rates during the periods in which the contracts are outstanding. The counterparties to our currency exchange contracts consist of major financial institutions, each of which is rated investment grade. We are exposed to credit risk to the extent of potential non performance by counterparties on financial instruments. Any potential credit exposure does not exceed the fair value. We believe the risk of incurring losses due to credit risk is remote. At April 30, 2012 we had no forward exchange contracts outstanding. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS The sensitivities of certain financial instruments to changes in interest rates as of April 30, 2012 and 2011 are presented below. The following table represents hypothetical instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in interest rates and should not be relied on as an indicator of future expected results. The impact of a change in interest rates on other factors, such as delinquency and prepayment rates, is not included in the analysis below.
