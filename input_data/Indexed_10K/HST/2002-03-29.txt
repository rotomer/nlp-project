Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition Overview Host Marriott Corporation, a Maryland corporation, operating through an umbrella partnership structure, is the owner of hotel properties. We operate as a self managed and self administered REIT with our operations conducted solely through the operating partnership and its subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2001, we owned approximately 92% of the operating partnership. Recent Events On September 11, 2001, two aircraft that were hijacked by terrorists destroyed the World Trade Center Towers in New York City, and as a result, our New York World Trade Center Marriott hotel was destroyed. In addition, we sustained considerable damage to a second property, the New York Marriott Financial Center hotel. A third hijacked aircraft caused considerable damage to the Pentagon in Northern Virginia and a fourth hijacked aircraft crashed in western Pennsylvania. Subsequent to the attacks, the Federal Aviation Administration closed United States airspace to commercial traffic for several days, significantly impacting the operations of our hotels during this period. As described below, the aftermath of these events, together with an economic recession has adversely affected our operations. Through our manager, Marriott International, we have both property and business interruption insurance for our two affected hotels with a major insurer. We have restored the New York Marriott Financial Center to operating condition and reopened the hotel January 7, 2002. We are required under our ground lease with The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to rebuild the New York World Trade Center Marriott, and our insurance provides for rebuilding of the asset at replacement cost. Our insurer is a large insurance company with an A/+ A.M. Best Rating and has accepted responsibility for the claim. In addition, we are obligated to make payments on behalf of the property, including ground rent and debt service. We are also liable for severance payments for employees of both hotels as well as other operating liabilities. While we expect to receive sufficient insurance proceeds to cover all or a substantial portion of these and other costs at both hotels and reimbursement of lost profits, we cannot currently determine the total amount or timing of those payments. We wrote off the $129 million net book value of the New York World Trade Center Marriott hotel and recorded a corresponding receivable for property insurance proceeds due to us under the terms of our insurance contract and for which we believe receipt is probable . We believe the replacement cost of the property is substantially in excess of the hotels previously recorded net book value. Currently, no gain or loss has been recorded. As of December 31, 2001, the Company has received $5 million in property insurance with respect to the two hotels. / The Company also receives business interruption insurance as a result of the discontinuation of operations of the two hotels. Income resulting from business interruption insurance will not be recognized until all contingencies related to the insurance recoveries are resolved. To the extent that we incur expenses related to the hotels, principally the ground rent due for the New York World Trade Center Marriott, for which we are still liable and for which we are entitled to recovery under the insurance contract, we will recognize a receivable, if we can demonstrate that the receivable is probable of realization. As of December 31, 2001, the Company has received $12 million in business interruption insurance with respect to the two hotels. In the fourth quarter of 2001, RevPAR for comparable hotels showed a significant decline of approximately 28% when compared to the 2000 fourth quarter as a result of a decrease in occupancy of 13.4 percentage points and a decline in room rates of 12.6% due to an economic recession and the reduction in business travel. During the 4 week period subsequent to the events of September 11, 2001, our hotels recorded weekly occupancy rates of 38% to 63%. During that period, we had a very high level of large group cancellations, which represented a loss of approximately $70 million in revenue. The results of operations for the fourth quarter have shown steady growth from that point, reflecting a steady return to more normal business levels; however, they still remain below prior year levels. 38 We have been actively working with the managers of our hotels to reduce the operating costs of our hotels as well as to provide economic incentives to individuals and business travelers in selected markets to increase demand. This process was accelerated after the September 11/th terrorist attacks. These initiatives include reducing labor costs, streamlining staffing and service delivery, reducing hours of operations at hotel restaurants and consolidating operations by closing unused or unoccupied floors in hotels. / In addition, based on our assessment of the current operating environment and to conserve capital, we have reduced or temporarily suspended certain capital expenditure projects. Our renewal and replacement expenditures for 2001 were $206 million versus $230 million in 2000. For 2002, we anticipate a further reduction in spending of approximately 10% for renewal and replacement expenditures. Dividends. Our policy on common dividends generally has been to distribute the minimum amount necessary to maintain REIT status. As a result of September 11th and the economic downturn, our operating results and, thus, taxable income have been greatly reduced. On December 6, 2001, our Board of Directors declared a $0.625 dividend per share of Class A, B and C Preferred Stock, but did not declare a dividend on Host REITs common stock for the fourth quarter of 2001. The preferred stock dividend was paid on January 15, 2002. Upon a review of our operating and taxable income on a quarterly basis, we will reinstate the dividend on our common stock when operations have improved sufficiently so that our taxable income supports such a payment. It is likely that when the common dividend is reinstated, it will be meaningfully lower than the level for the first three quarters of 2001. It is our intention to continue to pay dividends on our convertible preferred securities and preferred stock. On March 19, 2002, our Board of Directors declared a $0.625 dividend per share of Class A, B and C Preferred Stock. Credit Facility and Senior Notes. Our bank credit facility contains certain financial covenants related to, among other things, maintaining certain levels of tangible net worth and certain ratios of EBITDA to interest and fixed charges, total debt to EBITDA, unencumbered EBITDA interest coverage and unencumbered EBITDA as a percentage of total EBITDA. Effective November 19, 2001, we amended our bank credit facility to modify these covenants through August 15, 2002, among other things. This amendment also has resulted in reducing the availability under the credit facility to $50 million through the first quarter of 2002 and $25 million for the second quarter of 2002 and placed additional restrictions on our ability to issue debt or equity, pay dividends to certain holders of our capital stock, make acquisitions or investments, or to use the proceeds from asset sales. As of March 1, 2002, there was no outstanding balance for the credit facility. For a further discussion of the modified covenants of the bank credit facility, see Risk Factors "There is no charter or by law restriction on the amount of debt we may incur." We have $3.2 billion of senior notes outstanding as of March 1, 2002. The balance includes $450 million of Series H senior notes with a fixed interest rate of 9 1/2% that were issued in December 2001. The proceeds from this offering were used to repay the majority of the outstanding balance under the bank credit facility. Under the indenture pursuant to which the senior notes were issued there are covenants that could restrict our ability to incur indebtedness, grant liens on our assets, acquire or sell or make investments in other entities, and make certain distributions to our equity holders. This restriction would take effect if, after giving effect to any new increase of debt on a pro forma basis, our consolidated coverage ratio is less than or equal to 2.0 to 1.0. As a result of the effects on our business of the economic recession and the events of September 11, 2001, we anticipate that any consolidated coverage ratio that is calculated under the indenture after the end of our first quarter 2002 may be less than or equal to 2.0 to 1.0. If this occurs, then we will be prohibited from incurring indebtedness and from issuing stock (other than certain types of debt specifically permitted under the indenture) and we would be prohibited from declaring or paying dividends on our capital stock, other than to the extent required to maintain our status as a REIT. Debt and Equity Registrations. In January 2002, our shelf registration for $1.55 billion of debt and equity was declared effective. We completed this shelf in order to help expedite future public offerings; however, we currently do not anticipate accessing the capital markets during 2002. Additionally, during February 2002, we 39 filed a shelf registration statement for 1.1 million common shares to be issued to a minority partner in the San Diego Marina Marriott Hotel in exchange for certain interests in the San Diego partnership. On March 15, 2002, this minority partner sold the 1.1 million common shares to an underwriter for resale on the open market. Concurrent with the issuance of the common shares, the Operating Partnership issued to us an equivalent number of OP Units. This transaction did not materially impact our ownership percentage in the Operating Partnership. We received no proceeds as a result of these transactions. Subsequent to this exchange, other minority partners in the San Diego hotel have notified us of their intent to exchange additional interests in the San Diego partnership for approximately 6.8 million OP Units. We expect these exchanges to close during the second quarter. After completion of these exchanges the minority partner will own a 10% interest in the San Diego hotel. Management and Other Agreements. The Company currently is in the process of negotiating changes to the management and other agreements with Marriott International and its affiliates. If made, the changes, which remain subject to the consent of various lenders to the properties and other third parties, would be effective December 29, 2001. The proposed changes would result in reductions in incentive management fees on the portfolio of Marriott managed hotels, reduce certain expenses to the property, lower our working capital requirements, clarify the circumstances and conditions under which Marriott International and its affiliates may earn a profit on transactions with the hotels, and provide greater approval rights over budgets and capital expenditures. The Company is also negotiating to expand the pool of hotels that are subject to an existing agreement that allows us to sell certain assets without a Marriott International management agreement, and to revise the method for determining the number of hotels that may be sold without a Marriott International management agreement or a franchise agreement, in each case, without the payment of a termination fee. There can be no assurance that the negotiations will be successful, that the changes will be made in substantially the form described or that we will receive the necessary consents to implement these changes. Marriott International currently has the right to purchase up to 20 percent of the Companys outstanding stock upon certain changes in control of Host Marriott. In connection with the Companys negotiations with Marriott International on changes to the management agreements, we are discussing terminating this right and clarifying existing provisions in the management agreements that currently limit the Companys ability to sell a hotel or the company to a competitor of Marriott International. Results of Operations Our historical revenues for 2000 and 1999 represent rental income on leases of our hotels. Expenses during 2000 and 1999 represent specific owner costs, including real estate and property taxes, property insurance and ground and equipment rent. Beginning January 1, 2001, we reported gross property level sales from the majority of our hotels and, accordingly, our expenses included all property level costs including depreciation, management fees, real and personal property taxes, ground building and equipment rent, property insurance and other costs due to changes in the REIT tax laws which enabled the subsequent acquisition by the TRS of leases on our hotels previously leased to third parties (see Business and Properties, "Operating Structure"). As a result, our 2001 results are not comparable to the historical reported amounts for 2000 and 1999. 2001 Compared to 2000 Revenues. Revenues increased $2.4 billion, or 171%, to approximately $3.8 billion for 2001. As discussed above, our revenues and operating profit are not comparable to 2000, due to the acquisition of the lessee entities by the TRS. Rental income decreased $1.3 billion, or 91%, to $126 million for 2001 versus 2000, reflecting the purchase of the leasehold interests from Crestline with respect to 116 hotels by the TRS effective January 1, 2001 and the purchase of four additional lessee entities (three of the lessee entities were purchased from Wyndham, while the other was 40 purchased from Crestline) effective June 16, 2001. Rental income for 2001 includes: 1) lease income from our HPT leases of $77 million, 2) lease income earned on five full service properties of $29 million, 3) lease income earned on certain FF&E of $14 million and 4) office building rental income of $6 million. For 2002, rental income will include the HPT leases income, rent from the one remaining leased full service hotel and the office buildings leases. The table below presents gross hotel sales for the years ended December 2001 and 2000. For 2000, gross hotel sales were used as the basis for calculating rental income. The data is presented in order to facilitate an investors understanding and comparative analysis of the operations of our properties. Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2001 2000 (in millions) Hotel sales Rooms..................... $2,550 $2,877 Food and beverage......... 1,173 1,309 Other..................... 306 323 Total hotel sales..... $4,029 $4,509 The $480 million decrease in hotel sales for the year ended December 31, 2001 primarily reflects the decrease in REVPAR for our properties of 13.7% to $105.96. Room sales also declined as a result of the loss of sales from the New York Marriott World Trade Center and the New York Marriott Financial Center due to the terrorist acts of September 11. The declines were partially offset by incremental revenues provided by the 500 room expansion at Orlando Marriott, which was placed in service in June 2000, and the addition of three hotels as a result of our consolidation of Rockledge and Fernwood as of March 24, 2001. The aforementioned decline in REVPAR for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to the year ended December 31, 2000, of 13.7% to $105.96, was due to the economic recession and the effects of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The decrease is attributable to a decrease in occupancy of 7.7 percentage points and a 4.1% decrease in room rates for the year. As a result of decreased hotel sales, our hotel managers implemented cost cutting measures and revenue enhancement programs at the property level during the second quarter in order to stabilize house profit. These measures include increasing labor efficiency particularly at the managerial level and in the food and beverage area at the hotels, reducing discretionary expenses in rooms, food and beverage, and repairs and maintenance and reducing energy consumption. These cost cutting measures served to stabilize the profit margins during the second and third quarters, however, due to continued declines in RevPAR during the third and fourth quarters, profit margins on our entire portfolio of hotels decreased 3.0 percentage points for the year ended December 31, 2001. Other Property level Expenses. Other property level owner expenses primarily consist of property taxes, insurance, and ground and equipment rent. These expenses increased $6 million, or 2%, to $282 million, for the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase was primarily due to additional expenses required as the lessee of the properties. Included in other property level expenses is $72 million and $74 million for rental expense on our HPT Lease for 2001 and 2000, respectively. Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased $47 million, or 14%, to $378 million during 2001 primarily reflecting an increase in depreciable assets. The increase in depreciation expense reflects the consolidation of three hotels and other equipment as a result of the purchase of the voting interests in Rockledge and Fernwood. The transaction caused an increase in depreciable assets of $206 million. The increase in depreciation expense is also the result of $286 million and $379 million in capital expenditures in 2000 and 2001, respectively. 41 Corporate Expenses. Corporate expenses decreased by $10 million, or 24%, as a result of our efforts to curb costs in the wake of a more difficult operating environment during 2001 and a decrease in compensation expense related to employee stock plans. Lease Repurchase Expense. In connection with the definitive agreement with Crestline in November 2000 for the purchase of the leasehold interests with respect to 116 hotels, by the TRS, we recorded a nonrecurring loss provision of $207 million. In 2001, as a result of the purchase of four additional leasehold interests by the TRS, we recognized a loss of $5 million. Minority Interest Expense. For 2001 and 2000, we recognized minority interest expense of $23 million and $72 million, respectively. The variance is primarily due to the decrease in the minority interest ownership from 22% at December 31, 2000 to 8% at December 31, 2001. The decline is also a reflection of the decrease in our results of operations. Assuming the Blackstone OP Units had been converted at January 1, 2001, the year end minority interest expense would have been $21 million, or a decrease of $51 million when compared to prior year. Interest Expense. For the year ended December 31, 2001, interest expense increased 6% to $460 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2000, primarily due to the issuance in October 2000 of $250 million of 9/1/4% Series F Senior Notes, which were primarily used to fund the purchase of the leasehold interests from Crestline and for general corporate purposes. / Interest Income. Interest income decreased $4 million, or 10%, for the year ended December 31, 2001, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2000. The decrease was due to the elimination of notes receivable as a result of the consolidation of Rockledge on March 24, 2001, the elimination of working capital notes receivable in connection with the acquisition of the leasehold interests in 120 hotels, as well as a decrease in the average cash balance during the year. The decrease was partially offset by interest on a note relating to the 1994 sale of 26 Fairfield Inns that is recorded under the cost recovery method. Equity in Earnings of Affiliates. For the year ended December 31, 2001, equity in earnings of affiliates decreased $22 million, or 88%, to $3 million. The decrease is due to the consolidation of Rockledge and Fernwood on March 24, 2001 as a result of the purchase of the 5% voting interests in both entities. Dividends on Convertible Preferred Securities. Dividends on Convertible Preferred Securities were unchanged for the year ended December 31, 2001, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2000, as virtually none of the securities were repurchased or exchanged for our common stock during 2001. Provision for Income Taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2001, we recorded an income tax provision of $8 million, a change of $106 million, from the $98 million income tax benefit in 2000. The change is primarily due to the $82 million benefit taken during 2000 due to the recognition of the income tax asset as a result of the purchase of the leasehold interests with respect to 120 hotels. Also, during 2001 and 2000, we favorably resolved certain tax matters and recognized $16 million and $32 million, respectively, related thereto as a benefit to our tax provision. Extraordinary Loss. We recorded extraordinary losses of $2 million and $3 million during 2001 and 2000, respectively. During 2001 and 2000 the losses consist of $1 million and $2 million, respectively, representing the write off of deferred financing costs and certain fees paid to our lender in connection with renegotiations of the bank credit facility in each year. Additionally, in 2001, we recorded an extraordinary loss of $1 million representing the write off of deferred financing costs in connection with the refinancing of the mortgage debt of our Canadian properties. In 2000, we recognized an additional loss of $1 million representing the write off of deferred financing costs in connection with the repurchase of 0.4 million shares of the Convertible Preferred Securities. 42 Net Income. Our net income was $51 million in 2001 compared to net income of $156 million in 2000. Basic and diluted earnings per common share were $.08 and $.08, respectively, for 2001, compared to $.64 and $.63, respectively, in 2000. Net Income Available to Common Shareholders. The net income available to common shareholders was $19 million in 2001, a decrease of $122 million when compared to the same period in 2000. The decrease reflects the previously discussed decrease in net income, an increase in preferred stock dividends as a result of the issuance of Class C preferred stock in March 2001 as well as the $5 million gain on the repurchase of the Convertible Preferred Securities recorded during the first quarter of 2000. 2000 Compared to 1999 Revenues. Revenues increased $104 million, or 8%, to approximately $1.4 billion for 2000. Gross hotel sales, which is used in the determination of rental income for 2000, increased $231 million or 5% over 1999 amounts as is shown in the following table. Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2000 1999 (in millions) Hotel Sales(1) Rooms............... $2,877 $2,725 Food and beverage... 1,309 1,258 Other............... 323 295 Total sales..... $4,509 $4,278 (1) Gross hotel sales do not represent our reported revenues for 2000 and 1999, but are used to compute our reported rental income. Rental income increased $95 million, or 7%, to approximately $1.4 billion for 2000, primarily driven by the growth in room revenues generated per available room or RevPAR, completion of the new Tampa Waterside Marriott in February 2000, and the opening of a 500 room expansion at the Orlando World Center Marriott in June 2000, partially offset by the sale of five properties (1,577 rooms) in 1999. RevPAR increased 5.4% to $122.43 in 2000 for our hotels. Average room rates increased approximately 5.6%, while average occupancy decreased less than one percentage point for 2000. Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased $38 million or 13% during 2000, reflecting an increase in depreciable assets, which is primarily the result of capital projects placed in service in 2000, including the Tampa Waterside Marriott and expansion at the Orlando World Center Marriott, partially offset by net asset disposals of approximately $174 million in connection with the sale of five hotels during 1999. Other Property level Expenses. Property level expenses primarily consist of property taxes, insurance, and ground and equipment rent. These expenses increased $8 million, or 3%, to $276 million for 2000, primarily due to an increase in ground lease expense, which is commensurate with the increase in hotel sales, and an increase in equipment rent expense due to technology initiatives at the hotels during 2000. Minority Interest Expense. Minority interest expense decreased $10 million to $72 million in 2000, primarily reflecting the OP Unitholders share of the operating partnerships net income, which decreased $78 million to $207 million in 2000. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased to $433 million in 2000, primarily due to the issuance of the Series F Senior Notes in October 2000, partially offset by the decrease in the outstanding balance of the bank credit facility during 2000 compared to 1999. 43 Corporate Expenses. Corporate expenses increased $8 million to $42 million for 2000, resulting primarily from an increase in compensation expense related to employee stock plans. Dividends on Convertible Preferred Securities. The dividends on the convertible preferred securities decreased $5 million or 14% for 2000, as a result of repurchases of 1.5 million shares of the convertible preferred securities during the fourth quarter of 1999 and the first quarter of 2000 in connection with our stock repurchase program. Loss on Litigation Settlement. The Company and Marriott International closed on the settlement with plaintiffs to resolve specific litigation involving seven limited partnerships in which we acted as general partner. The settlement involved an acquisition during the fourth quarter of 2000 of the limited partner interests in two partnerships by a joint venture between one of our affiliates and a subsidiary of Marriott International, the contribution by our subsidiaries of cash and their general and limited partnership interests in the partnerships to the joint venture and cash payments to partners in the other five partnerships, in exchange for resolution of claims against all defendants in all seven partnerships. Our total share of the cash required to resolve the litigation and purchase the interest in the joint venture, including amounts paid by our subsidiary, was approximately $121 million. As a result of the settlement, we recorded a one time non recurring, pre tax charge of $40 million in the fourth quarter of 1999. Lease Repurchase Expense. In connection with the execution of a definitive agreement with Crestline in November 2000 for the termination of the Crestline leases through the purchase and sale of the Crestline subsidiaries leasehold interests by our TRS for $207 million in cash, we recorded a non recurring loss provision of $207 million during the fourth quarter of 2000. Provision for Income Taxes. In connection with the lease repurchase expense recognized during the fourth quarter of 2000, we recognized an income tax benefit of $82 million, because, for income tax purposes, the acquisition is recognized as an asset that will be amortized over the remaining term of the leases. In addition, during 2000 we favorably resolved certain tax contingencies and reversed $32 million of our net tax liabilities into income through the tax provision during the year ended December 31, 2000. Extraordinary Gain (Loss). During 2000, we recorded an extraordinary loss of approximately $2 million representing the write off of deferred financing costs and certain fees paid to our lender in connection with the renegotiation of the bank credit facility and an extraordinary loss of $1 million representing the write off of deferred financing costs in connection with the repurchase of 0.4 million shares of the Convertible Preferred Securities. During 1999, in connection with the refinancing of the mortgage and renegotiation of the management agreement on the New York Marriott Marquis hotel, we recognized an extraordinary gain of $14 million on the forgiveness of debt in the form of accrued incentive management fees. An extraordinary loss of $3 million representing the write off of deferred financing fees occurred in July 1999 when the mortgage debt for eight properties, including the New York Marriott Marquis hotel, was refinanced. In connection with this refinancing, the interest rate swap agreements associated with some of the original debt were terminated and an extraordinary gain of $8 million was recognized. An extraordinary loss of $2 million representing the write off of deferred financing fees occurred during the fourth quarter of 1999 when prepayments totaling $225 million were made to permanently reduce the outstanding balance of the term loan portion of the Bank Credit Facility to $125 million. An extraordinary loss of $2 million representing the write off of deferred financing fees occurred during the fourth quarter of 1999 when approximately 1.1 million shares of our Convertible Preferred Securities were repurchased (see Note 6 to the financial statements) and subsequently retired. 44 Net Income (Loss). Our net income in 2000 was $156 million, compared to $211 million in 1999. Basic and diluted earnings per common share was $.64 and $.63, respectively, for 2000, compared to $.95 and $.92, respectively, in 1999. Net Income (Loss) Available to Common Shareholders. Our net income available to common shareholders in 2000 was $141 million, compared to $216 million in 1999, reflecting dividends of $20 million in 2000 on the Class A and Class B preferred stock which were issued during 1999, and gains of $5 million and $11 million on the repurchase of the Convertible Preferred Securities during 2000 and 1999, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources During 2000 and 2001, we focused on maintaining the strength and flexibility of our balance sheet in order to allow us the opportunity to selectively choose investment alternatives that will further enhance shareholder value. As a result September 11, 2001, we have focused on implementing cost controls, limiting capital expenditures and maintaining our liquidity and access to capital markets. The acquisitions made in January 2001 and June 2001 of the Crestline and Wyndham lessee entities enable us to better control our portfolio of hotels and were accretive to our earnings and cash flow during 2001. There can be no guarantee, however, that we will benefit from similar favorable results in the future. As a result of several key actions taken by us in the fourth quarter of 2001, including amending our bank credit facility, issuing $450 million of senior notes and selling two hotels, we had $352 million of cash at year end, no outstanding debt on our bank credit facility and no significant debt maturities until 2005. Although we do not believe we will need to access the bank credit facility during 2002, we are seeking to implement a new long term facility that will be smaller but with less restrictive covenants than our existing agreement. Cash from Operations. Cash and cash equivalents were $352 million and $313 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Cash from operations decreased $244 million to $239 million in 2001, primarily reflecting declining results of operations due to the 13% decrease in RevPAR for our comparable properties as previously discussed, in addition to the $208 million paid in 2001 for the purchase of the leasehold interests with respect to 120 of our hotels. Cash from Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities was $279 million and $448 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Cash used in investing activities includes capital expenditures of $286 million and $379 million and cash payments for acquisitions of $63 million and $40 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Cash used in investing activities during 2001 was partially offset by cash provided by the sale of two hotels of $60 million, discussed below. As a result of our efforts to conserve capital, we have budgeted a lower level of capital expenditures for 2002 as compared to 2001. We estimate that approximately $185 million will be required for the upcoming year for renewals and replacements, new investments and other capital expenditure projects. We expect to fund the anticipated capital expenditure projects from the property improvement funds as well as from operations. Capital expenditures include contributions to property improvement funds, which have been established for certain of our hotels pursuant to the management agreement in order to provide for the replacement of furniture, fixtures and equipment as well as non routine repairs and maintenance which are normally capitalized. Contributions to the property improvement funds are generally 5% of gross hotel sales. Capital expenditures also include the costs for expansion and development projects that are funded through loans such as the Orlando World Center Marriott that was completed during 2000. 45 The following table summarizes significant investing activities which were completed during 2001 and 2000 (in millions). Transaction Sale/(Purchase) Date Description of Transaction Price 2001 March Purchase of the 5% voting interest in Rockledge and Fernwood(1) $ (2) April Addition of a spa facility at The Ritz Carlton, Naples(2) (26) June Purchase of Wyndham limited partner interests(3) (60) June Addition of a spa facility at the Marriott Harbor Beach Resort (8) December Sale of Vail Marriott Mountain Resort and the Pittsburgh City Center Marriott 65 2000 May Purchase of non controlling partnership interest in JWDC Limited Partnership(4) $(40) June Additions to the Orlando World Center Marriott(5) (88) October Purchase of 50% interest in Courtyard by Marriott Joint Venture(6) (90) (1) The voting interests were previously held by the Host Marriott Statutory Employee/Charitable Trust. Prior to the acquisition we held a 95% non voting interest in each company. As a result of the acquisition we now consolidate three additional full service hotels. (2) During 2001, a total of $5 million of the development cost was expended. (3) The limited partner interests relate to 7 full service hotels, and as a part of the transaction, the leases were acquired from Wyndham with respect to three of the hotels. (4) The partnership owns the 772 room JW Marriott Hotel located on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, DC. (5) Includes the addition of a 500 room tower and 15,000 square feet of meeting space. During 2000, a total of $39 million of the development cost was expended. (6) See below for discussion. In December 2000, a joint venture formed by us (through non controlled subsidiaries) and Marriott International acquired the partnership interests in CBM I and CBM II, two partnerships owning 120 hotels for an aggregate payment of approximately $372 million plus interest and legal fees, of which Rockledge paid approximately $90 million. The joint venture acquired the partnerships by acquiring partnership units pursuant to a tender offer for such units followed by a merger of each of CBM I and CBM II with subsidiaries of the joint venture. The joint venture financed the acquisition with mezzanine indebtedness borrowed from Marriott International, cash and other assets contributed by us (through our non controlled subsidiaries) including Rockledges existing general partner and limited partner interests in the partnerships, and cash contributed by Marriott International. We own a 50% interest in the joint venture and account for it on the equity method because we do not control it. For purposes of our investment analysis and the charge for litigation settlements in our 1999 financial statements, we estimated the value of the planned investment in the Courtyard joint venture based upon: (1) estimated post acquisition cash flows, including anticipated changes in the related hotel management agreements to be made contemporaneously with the investment; (2) the joint ventures new capital structure; and (3) estimates of prevailing discount rates and capitalization rates reflected in the market at that time. The amount of post settlement equity of the Courtyard joint venture was considerably lower than the pre acquisition equity due to additional indebtedness post acquisition offset by the impact of changes to the management agreements made contemporaneously with the transaction. The investment in the Courtyard joint venture was consummated late in the fourth quarter of 2000. The Courtyard joint venture has recorded its investment in the partnership units at $363 million, which reflected estimated fair value based on: (1) pre acquisition cash flows; (2) the pre acquisition capital structure; and (3) prevailing discount rates and capitalization rates in December 2000. The factors giving rise to the differences between our 1999 assessment based on post acquisition cash flows and the joint venture purchase accounting based on pre acquisition cash flows did not materially affect our previous assessment of expense related to litigation. Due to a number of factors, the equity values used in the purchase accounting for the joint ventures investment were different from limited partner unit estimates included in the CBM I and CBM II Purchase Offer 46 and Consent Solicitations prepared in early 2000. The solicitations reported that the value of limited partner units based on an assumed 20 percent discount rate would be $254 million. The difference between this and the purchase accounting entry by the Courtyard joint venture is primarily attributed to: (1) the investments being consummated almost one year subsequent to the time the original estimates were prepared ($30 million); and (2) a lower discount rate (17 percent) and capitalization rate reflecting changes in market conditions and capital structure versus the date at which the estimates in the solicitations were prepared ($79 million). Although we may from time to time sell assets for strategic reasons or to realize unique market conditions, the factors driving the change in value for the CBM I and CBM II properties did not have a material impact on other properties owned by us because our strategy is to buy and hold investments in real estate. As investments in real estate are accounted for on a historical basis, the impact of changes in market conditions are not reflected in the financial statements. Property and equipment balances include $149 million and $135 million for construction in progress as of December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, respectively. The balance as of December 31, 2001, primarily relates to the development of the Ritz Carlton, Naples Golf Resort, which opened on January 4, 2002. Cash from Financing Activities. Cash provided by financing activities was $79 million and $1 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. As of December 31, 2001, our total consolidated debt was approximately $5.6 billion. Our total enterprise value was approximately $9.0 billion as of December 31, 2001 calculated using the fair market value of our long term debt, plus outstanding shares of our common and preferred stock, shares granted under the comprehensive stock plans, common and preferred OP Units issuable or outstanding that are held by minority partners which could be converted, and mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities multiplied by the closing stock prices on the balance sheet date. Consolidated debt represents 62% of our total enterprise value, compared to 56% as of December 31, 2000. As a result of the repayment of the outstanding balance on the credit facility with the proceeds from the Series H senior notes we have substantially reduced all of our near term maturities, with $148 million in principal payments due during 2002 and $294 million in principal payments due over the next three years. The weighted average interest rate of all our debt is approximately 8.2%, and our current average maturity is six years. Additionally, 98% of our debt has a fixed rate of interest as of December 31, 2001. However, in order to reduce interest rate risk by taking advantage of low, short term interest rates and to maintain a mix of floating and fixed rate debt, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement (described below), effective in January 2002, to convert the fixed rate of the Series H senior notes to a floating rate. If the swap agreement had been effective as of December 31, 2001, the percentage of fixed rate debt would have been 90%. We do not have a specific goal relative to our level of variable or fixed interest rate debt. We will continue to evaluate each debt offering in regards to the type and timing of payments, maturity date and its overall effect on earnings. We entered into a separate cap arrangement in January to limit our exposure to interest rate increases on this floating rate swap (described below). 47 The following table summarizes significant financing activity except for the bank credit facility and non cash equity transactions (all of which are discussed below) for fiscal years 2001 and 2000 (in millions): Transaction Transaction Interest Rate at Date Description of Transaction Amount 12/31/01 2001 Payment of Class A, B and C cumulative redeemable preferred stock dividends(1) $ (28) Payment of common stock dividends (256) March Issuance of Class C cumulative redeemable preferred stock(1) 143 10.00% August The Ritz Carlton, Amelia Island mortgage loan(2) (88) August Canadian mortgage loan(2) 96.6 4.82% October San Antonio Marriott Riverwalk mortgage loan (16.5) December Issuance of Series H Senior Notes(3) 450 9.50% 2000 Repurchase of equity instruments(4) $ (62) Payment of Class A and B cumulative redeemable preferred stock dividends (19) Payment of common stock dividends (190) February Harbor Beach Marriott mortgage(5) 84 8.58% February Harbor Beach Marriott mortgage(5) (80) 9.13% October Issuance of Series F Senior Notes(6) 250 9.25% (1) On March 27, 2001, we sold approximately 6.0 million shares of 10% Class C cumulative redeemable preferred stock ("Class C Preferred Stock") with a par value of $0.01 for net proceeds of $143 million. Holders of the Class C Preferred Stock are entitled to receive cumulative cash distributions at a rate of 10% per year of the $25 per unit liquidation preference. Dividends are payable quarterly in arrears commencing April 15, 2001, on which date pro rata distributions of $0.03 per Class C Preferred Stock were paid. We paid two other quarterly distributions of $0.625 per share in 2001, and on December 5, 2001, the Board of Directors declared the fourth quarter dividend of $0.625, which was paid in January 2002. (2) Proceeds from the Canadian mortgage were used to repay the mortgage debt on the Ritz Carlton, Amelia Island and the Toronto Eaton Centre. See below for further discussion. (3) Proceeds from the Series H senior notes were used to repay the outstanding balance on the credit facility. Additionally, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with regards to this principal balance, as is dicussed below. (4) For the year ended December 31, 2000, we purchased approximately 4.9 million shares of common stock, 0.4 million shares of the Convertible Preferred Securities, and 0.3 million OP Units for approximately $62 million. (5) These transactions represent the refinancing of the prior $80 million mortgage debt on the Harbor Beach Marriott Hotel. (6) Proceeds from the Series F senior notes were used to partially fund the buyback of leases from Crestline and litigation dealing with our Courtyard partnerships. During March of 2001, the Series F senior notes were exchanged on a one for one basis for Series G senior notes, which are freely transferable. We have a bank credit facility, which was entered into in 1998 and has been subsequently modified in May 2000 and November 2001. The original facility was for $1.25 billion and matured in three years. In May 2000 the borrowing capacity under the facility was reduced to $775 million. As previously discussed, the last modification to the facility was in November 2001, which reduced the available capacity to $50 million during the first quarter of 2002 and $25 million during the second quarter of 2002, and temporarily amended certain covenants as a result of the economic recession and the events of September 11, 2001. Borrowings under the facility bear interest currently at the Eurodollar rate plus 225 basis points. Additionally, the interest rate fluctuates based on our leverage ratio. Borrowings under the facility averaged $248 million in 2001 and $153 million in 2000 and were used for the purchase of outside partnership interests in our hotels, to partially fund the purchase of the leasehold interests by the TRS, as well as general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2001 there are no outstanding borrowings under the facility. Historically, our debt has primarily been fixed rate including all of the previous series of senior notes. We have increased the amount of our exposure to variable rate instruments on the issuance of our Series H senior notes by using derivative products. On December 20, 2001, we entered into a 5 year interest rate swap agreement, which is effective January 15, 2002 and matures January 2007. Under the swap, we receive fixed rate 48 payments at 9.5% and pay floating rate payments based on one month LIBOR plus 450 basis points, on a $450 million notional amount. The fair value of the interest rate swap agreement was zero at inception. Under SFAS 133 we have entered into an interest rate swap which is designated as a fair value hedge. The requirements for hedge accounting having been met, the swap is recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with changes in the fair value recorded to the carrying value of the Series H debt. Additionally, the amounts paid or received under the swap agreement will be recognized over the life of the agreement as an adjustment to interest expense. On January 4, 2002, in a separate agreement with a different counter party, we purchased for approximately $3.5 million an interest rate cap with the same notional amount which caps the floating interest rate at 14%. Under SFAS 133 the cap does not qualify for hedge accounting and therefore will be marked to market and the gains and losses from changes in the market value of the cap will be recorded in other income or expense in the current period. On August 30, 2001, certain Canadian subsidiaries entered into financing agreements pursuant to which they borrowed $96.6 million due August 2006 at a variable rate of LIBOR plus 275 basis points. The Calgary Marriott, Toronto Airport Marriott, Toronto Marriott Eaton Centre, and Toronto Meadowvale Delta hotels serve as collateral. Since the mortgage loan on these Canadian properties is denominated in U.S. Dollars and the functional currency of the Canadian subsidiary is the Canadian Dollar, we purchased derivative instruments for hedging of the foreign currency investment. Therefore, the subsidiaries entered into 60 separate currency forward contracts to buy U.S. dollars at a fixed price. These forward contracts hedge the currency exposure of converting Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars on a monthly basis to make debt service payments. This swap has been designated as a cash flow hedge of the principal payments, and the forward contracts are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with offsetting changes recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. The fair value of the forward contracts is recorded each period. As of December 31, 2001, the fair value of these contracts was $1.5 million and were recorded in other assets. On February 7, 2001, May 7, 2001 and May 29, 2001, Blackstone and affiliates ("Blackstone") converted 12.5 million, 10.0 million and 18.2 million OP Units, respectively, to common shares and immediately sold them to an underwriter for sale on the open market. As a result of the transactions, Blackstone now owns approximately 1% of the outstanding OP Units of the Operating Partnership and we increased our ownership in the Operating Partnership to 92%. We received no proceeds as a result of the transactions. FFO and EBITDA We consider Comparative Funds From Operations ("Comparative FFO"), which consists of Funds From Operations, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, adjusted for significant non recurring items detailed in the chart below, and our consolidated earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and other non cash items (including contingent rent) ("EBITDA") to be indicative measures of our operating performance due to the significance of our long lived assets. Comparative FFO and EBITDA are also useful in measuring our ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures and expand our business. Furthermore, management believes that Comparative FFO and EBITDA are meaningful disclosures that will help shareholders and the investment community to better understand our financial performance, including comparing our performance to other real estate investment trusts. However, Comparative FFO and EBITDA as presented may not be comparable to amounts calculated by other companies. This information should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating profit, cash from operations, or any other operating or liquidity performance measure prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Cash expenditures for various long term assets, interest expense (for EBITDA purposes only) and income taxes have been, and will be incurred which are not reflected in the EBITDA and Comparative FFO presentations. 49 Comparative FFO available to common shareholders decreased $107 million, or 22%, to $370 million in 2001 over 2000. The following is a reconciliation of income before extraordinary items to Comparative FFO (in millions): Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2001 2000 Funds from Operations Income before extraordinary items........................................... $ 53 $ 159 Depreciation and amortization............................................ 370 322 Other real estate activities............................................. (2) (3) Partnership adjustments.................................................. 32 61 Funds from operations of Host LP............................................ 453 539 Effective impact of lease repurchase..................................... 15 125 Tax benefit unrelated to ongoing operations..............................

(32) (20) Comparative funds from operations of Host LP available to common unitholders 420 614 Comparative funds from operations of minority partners of Host LP(1)........ (50) (137) Comparative funds from operations available to common shareholders of Host REIT................................................................. $370 $ 477 (1) During the REIT conversion, we received a number of units of general and limited partnership interests in the operating partnership which we refer to as OP Units equal to the number of then outstanding shares of our common stock, and the operating partnership assumed all of our liabilities. As a result of this reorganization we are the sole general partner in the operating partnership and as of December 31, 2001 held approximately 92% of the outstanding OP Units. The $50 million and $137 million deducted for 2001 and 2000, respectively, represent the Comparative FFO attributable to the interests in the operating partnership earned by those minority partners. OP Units owned by holders other than us are redeemable at the option of the holder, generally commencing one year after the issuance of their OP Units. Upon redemption of an OP Unit, the holder would receive from the operating partnership cash in an amount equal to the market value of one share of our common stock, or at our option, a share of our common stock. EBITDA decreased $135 million, or 13%, to $908 million in 2001 from $1,043 million in 2000. Hotel EBITDA decreased $160 million, or 14%, to $959 million in 2001 from $1,119 million in 2000, reflecting the decrease in hotel operating results during 2001. As previously discussed, 2001 hotel EBITDA primarily reflects the revenues and expenses generated by the hotels, whereas 2000 hotel EBITDA primarily reflects rental income from lessees. 50 The following schedule presents the components of our EBITDA as well as a reconciliation of EBITDA to income before extraordinary items (in millions): Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2001 2000 EBITDA.................................................... Hotels................................................. $ 959 $1,119 Office buildings and other investments................. 14 13 Interest income........................................ 36 40 Corporate and other expenses...........................

Our interest coverage, defined as EBITDA divided by cash interest expense, was 2.0 times, 2.4 times, and 2.3 times for 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. The ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 1.2 to 1.0, 1.2 to 1.0, and 1.5 to 1.0 in 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. Leases. In addition to our full service hotels, we also lease some property and equipment under noncancelable operating leases, including the long term ground leases for some of our hotels, generally with multiple renewal options. The leases related to the 53 Courtyard properties and 18 Residence Inn properties sold during 1995 and 1996, are nonrecourse to us and contain provisions for the payment of contingent rentals based on a percentage of sales in excess of stipulated amounts. We remain contingently liable on some leases related to divested non lodging properties. Such contingent liabilities aggregated $57 million at December 31, 2001. However, management considers the likelihood of any substantial funding related to these divested properties leases to be remote. Inflation. Our hotel lodging properties have been impacted by inflation through its effect on increasing costs and on the managers ability to increase room rates. Unlike other real estate, hotels have the ability to change room rates on a daily basis, so the impact of higher inflation often can be passed on to customers. However, the current weak economic environment has resulted in a decline in demand and has restricted our managers ability to raise room rates to offset rising costs. 51 Critical Accounting Policies. Our consolidated financial statements include accounts of the company and all majority owned subsidiaries. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different, application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. All of our significant accounting policies are disclosed in footnote 1 to the audited financial statements. The following represent certain critical accounting policies that require the use of business judgment or significant estimates to be made. . Revenue Recognition from the sale of real estate. Gains on the sale of real estate are affected by exposure to continuing involvement with properties sold and the structure of specific transactions. . Minority Interest Expense. The allocation of income between us and outside investors for properties that are not wholly owned is generally based on stated percentage of ownership by outside interests. However, judgment can be required when structures of agreements provide for different allocations among investors for profits, losses, certain costs, distributions from operations and distributions on liquidations or when changes in the allocation ratios are required at specified times or upon the occurrence of certain events. . Management Fees. Incentive management fees due to managers are accrued when earned, whether or not paid, based on stated formulas in management agreements. However, judgment can be required during interim reporting periods as a result of the change in allocation ratios at specified times or upon the occurrence of certain events. . Consolidation policies. Judgment is required with respect to consolidation of partnership and joint venture entities in the evaluation of control including assessment of the importance of rights and privileges of the partners. Currently, we have investments in entities that in the aggregate own 161 hotel properties and a golf course, which we record using the equity method of accounting. The debt on these investments is non recourse to the company and the effect of the results of operations is not material. For further detail on our unconsolidated entities see footnote 4 to the audited financial statements. New Accounting Standards. In October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets" which replaces SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of." The standard provides guidance beyond that previously specified in Statement 121 to determine when a long lived asset should be classified as held for sale, among other things. This Statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. Additionally, in February 2002 the Financial Accounting Standards Board resolved an implementation issue regarding SFAS No. 144 dealing with the treatment of sales of properties. Under the new guidelines, gains and losses from the dispositions of investment properties and the properties historical operations for periods beginning in 2002 will be treated as discontinued operations, and therefore, be classified separately from income from continuing operations. Historically, we have occasionally disposed of properties that were not consistent with the overall quality of our portfolio or presented unique opportunities to realize the assets value and we may dispose of additional assets from time to time in the future. This statement would require us to reclassify results for any future dispositions previously included in continuing operations to discontinued operations for all periods presented, although net income would not be affected. In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations," and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS No. 141 sets forth new standards on business combinations, eliminating the pooling treatment of accounting for business combinations. SFAS No. 142 requires additional disclosure of identifiable intangible assets, and requires that they be segregated from goodwill. Additionally, the statement requires that goodwill no longer be amortized over 40 years, and that it is instead impaired as the fair value of the goodwill declines. We have not accounted for any of our business combinations using the pooling method of accounting and do not have goodwill or intangible assets at year end 2001. These statements are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. We will adopt SFAS Nos. 141 and 142 in 2002 and do not believe implementation of the statements will have a material effect. 52 In 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an exposure draft which would rescind SFAS No. 4, Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt. The rescission, which would apply to periods subsequent to December 31, 2001, would eliminate the requirement that gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt be classified as extraordinary items, unless it can be considered unusual in nature and infrequent in occurrence. As a result, we would no longer classify gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt as extraordinary items and will adjust prior years accordingly. In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." The Statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument (including specified derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) be recorded in the balance sheet measured at its fair value. The Statement requires that changes in the derivatives fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. Special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivatives gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement. SFAS No. 133 was implemented on January 1, 2001. Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Interest Rate Sensitivity The table below provides information about the companys derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates, including interest rate swaps and debt obligations. For debt obligations, the table presents scheduled maturities and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. For interest rate swaps, the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by expected (contractual) maturity dates. Weighted average interest rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve as of December 31, 2001. Notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract. Weighted average variable rates are presented in U.S. dollar equivalents, which is the companys reporting currency.

As of December 31, 2001, approximately 98% of our debt bears interest at fixed rates. Effective January 15, 2002, we entered an interest rate swap agreement, and, as a result, the percentage of our debt bearing interest at a fixed rate decreased to 90%. This debt structure largely mitigates the impact of changes in the rate of inflation on future interest costs. We have some financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates, including our bank credit facility. The interest rate on our bank credit facility, which had no outstanding balance at December 31, 2001 and $150 million at December 31, 2000, is based on various LIBOR terms plus a spread. The weighted average interest rate for the facility was 4.4% for the year ended December 31, 2001 and 9.0% for the year ended December 31, 2000. The credit facility was repaid in full in December 2001 with the net proceeds from the offering of the Series H senior notes and a portion of the proceeds from the sale of two properties. 53 Subsequent to the Series H senior note offering, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively converts the $450 million notional amount from a fixed rate to a floating rate based on 30 day LIBOR plus 450 basis points. A change in the LIBOR rate of 100 basis points will result in an additional $4.5 million increase or decrease in interest expense. As discussed earlier, the swap has been designated as a hedge and changes in the interest rate over the life of the agreement are recorded as an adjustment to interest expense. Changes in the fair value of the swap and the notes are reflected in the balance sheet as offsetting changes and have no income statement effect. In January 2002, in addition to the swap agreement, we have entered into a separate interest rate cap agreement with a different counter party that has a notional amount of $450 million and caps our floating rate interest expense at 14%. Changes in interest rates will affect the fair value of the cap. The gains or losses from the changes in the market value of the cap will be recorded in other income or expense in the current period. Exchange Rate Sensitivity The table below summarizes information on instruments and transactions that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rates, including foreign currency forward exchange agreements. For foreign currency forward exchange agreements, the table presents the notional amounts and weighted average exchange rates by expected (contractual) maturity dates. These notional amounts generally are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract. Expected Maturity Date Fair 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 Thereafter Total Value ($ in millions) Anticipated Transactions and Related Derivative Foreign Currency Forward Exchange Agreements Contract Amount.......... $ 7.1 $ 8.3 $ 8.9 $ 9.2 $97.0 $ $130.5 $132.0 Average Contractual Exchange Rate........... 1.55 1.56 1.56 1.57 1.57 On August 30, 2001, Canadian subsidiaries of the operating partnership entered into a mortgage loan pursuant to which they borrowed $96.6 million (denominated in US dollars) at a variable rate of LIBOR plus 275 basis points. In addition, the subsidiaries entered into currency forward contracts to hedge the currency exposure of converting Canadian dollars to US dollars on a monthly basis to cover debt service payments. This swap has been designated as a cash flow hedge of the principal payments, and the forward contracts are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with offsetting changes recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. The weighted average interest rate for this mortgage loan was 5.5% for the year ended December 31, 2001. The fair value of the forward contracts was $1.5 million at December 31, 2001. 54
