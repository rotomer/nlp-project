Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward looking statements about our business. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors contained elsewhere in this report. Overview Structure and Business We own 107 full service luxury and upper upscale hotel properties and, as of February 28, 2005, HMC was the largest hotel REIT in the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts composite index. A REIT is a legal entity that holds real estate interests and, through payments of dividends to stockholders, is permitted to reduce or avoid federal income taxes at the corporate level. HMC operates as a self managed and self administered REIT, which means that we are managed by a board of directors and executive officers. We conduct our operations through Host LP and its subsidiaries, which hold substantially all of our assets. HMC is the sole general partner of Host LP and owns approximately 94% of the partnership interests. Our hotels are operated under brand names that are among the most respected and widely recognized in the lodging industry including Marriott&reg;, Ritz Carlton&reg;, Hyatt&reg;, Four Seasons&reg;, Fairmont&reg;, Hilton&reg; and Westin&reg;. Approximately 85% of our hotels (as measured by sales) are managed by Marriott International or its affiliates and branded under the Marriott or Ritz Carlton brand names. The majority of our properties are located in central business districts of major cities, near airports and in resort/conference locations. The target profile for our portfolio includes luxury and upper upscale full service properties in urban and resort/conference locations which benefit from significant barriers to entry by competitors. Though hotels meeting this target profile will still be subject to competitive pressures, we believe this will allow us to maintain room rate and occupancy premiums over our competitors. We also seek to maximize the value of our portfolio through aggressive asset management, by assisting the managers of our hotels in maximizing property operations and by completing strategic capital improvements. The majority of our customers fall into three broad groups: transient business, group business, and contract business (approximately 54%, 43% and 3%, respectively, of our business in 2004). Our transient business, which includes the individual corporate and leisure traveler, is generally accommodated at a premium rate when compared to other customer types. Group business includes hotel bookings related to conferences and events. The remainder of our customer base results from contracts for a specified number of rooms over a fixed period. Our hotels are operated by third party managers under long term agreements under which they earn base and incentive management fees related to revenues and profitability of each individual hotel. We provide operating funds, or working capital, which the managers use to operate the property including purchasing inventory and paying wages, utilities, property taxes and other expenses. We generally receive a cash distribution, which reflects hotel level sales less property level operating expenses (excluding depreciation), from our hotel managers each four week or monthly accounting period, depending on the manager. 20 Table of Contents Hotel revenue is approximately 97% of our total revenue. The following table presents the components of our hotel revenue as a percentage of our total revenue: % of 2004 Revenues Rooms revenue. Occupancy and average daily room rate are the major drivers of rooms revenue. The business mix of the hotel (group versus transient and premium versus discount business) is the key driver of room rates. 59 % Food and beverage revenue. Occupancy and the type of customer staying at the hotel are the major drivers of food and beverage revenue (i.e., group business typically generates more food and beverage business through catering functions when compared to transient business, which may or may not utilize the restaurant outlets). 31 % Other revenue. Occupancy, the nature of the property (i.e., resort, etc.) and its price point are the main drivers of other ancillary revenue, such as parking, golf course, spa, telephone, entertainment and other guest services. 7 % Hotel operating expenses are approximately 98% of our total operating costs and expenses. The following table presents the components of our hotel operating expenses as a percentage of our total operating costs and expenses: % of 2004 Operating Costs and Expenses Rooms expense. These costs include housekeeping, reservation systems, room supplies, laundry services and front desk costs. Occupancy is the major driver of rooms expense. These costs can increase based on increases in salaries and wages, as well as the level of service and amenities that are provided. 17 % Food and beverage expense. These expenses primarily include food, beverage and labor costs. Occupancy and the type of customer staying at the hotel (i.e., catered functions are generally more profitable than outlet sales) are the major drivers of food and beverage expense, which correlates closely with food and beverage revenue. 26 % Hotel departmental expense. These expenses include labor and other costs associated with the other ancillary revenues such as parking, golf courses, spas, telephones, entertainment and other guest services, as well as labor and other costs associated with administrative departments, sales and marketing, repairs and minor maintenance and utility costs. 30 % Management fees. Base management fees are computed as a percentage of gross revenue as set forth in our management contracts. Incentive management fees are generally paid when operating profits exceed threshold levels established in our management agreements. 4 % Other property level expenses. These expenses consist primarily of real and personal property taxes, ground rent, equipment rent and property insurance. Many of these expenses are relatively inflexible and do not necessarily change in tandem with changes in revenues at our hotels. 9 % Depreciation and amortization expense. This is a non cash expense which is relatively inflexible and changes primarily based on the acquisition and disposition of hotel properties and the level of post acquisition capital expenditures. 11 % Key Performance Indicators We have several key indicators that we use to evaluate the performance of our business. Revenue per available room, or RevPAR, is a commonly used measure within the hotel industry to evaluate hotel operations. 21 Table of Contents RevPAR is defined as the product of the average daily room rate charged and the average daily occupancy achieved. RevPAR does not include revenues from food and beverage or parking, telephone, or other guest services generated by the property. Although RevPAR does not include these ancillary revenues, it is generally considered the leading indicator of core revenues for many hotels. We also use RevPAR to evaluate the results of individual hotels between periods and our comparable hotels. See Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics for further discussion of what we consider to be our comparable hotels. RevPAR changes driven predominately by occupancy have different implications on overall revenue levels as well as incremental operating profit than do changes driven predominately by average room rate. For example, increases in occupancy at a hotel would lead to increases in rooms revenues and ancillary revenues, such as food and beverage, as well as additional incremental costs (including housekeeping services, utilities and room amenity costs). RevPAR increases due to higher room rates, however, would not result in these additional room related costs. For this reason, while operating profit typically increases when occupancy rises, RevPAR increases due to higher room rates would have a greater impact on our profitability. A related revenue measure for our hotels is the RevPAR penetration index. The RevPAR penetration index reflects each propertys RevPAR in relation to the RevPAR for that propertys competitive set. We use the measure as an indicator of a propertys market share. For example, a RevPAR penetration index of 100 would indicate that a hotels RevPAR is, on average, the same as its competitors. A RevPAR penetration index exceeding 100 would indicate that a hotel maintains a RevPAR premium in relation to its competitive set, while a RevPAR penetration index below 100 would be an indicator that a hotel is underperforming its competitive set. One critical component in this calculation is the determination of a hotels competitive set. Factors that we consider include geographic proximity, as well as the level of service provided at the property. For example, a hotel located near a convention center might have a competitive set that includes other hotels located in close proximity to the convention center. In addition, a luxury hotel might include other luxury or upper upscale hotels in its competitive set but not economy hotels. Competitive set determinations are highly subjective, however, and our methodology for determining a hotels competitive set may differ materially from those used by other owners and or managers. We assess profitability by measuring changes in our operating margins, which are operating profit as a percentage of total revenues. Another key profitability indicator we use is hotel adjusted operating profit which is a non GAAP measure, and which is used to evaluate the profitability of our comparable hotels. Hotel adjusted operating profit measures property level results before funding furniture, fixtures and equipment reserves and debt service and is a supplemental measure of individual property level profitability. The comparable hotel adjusted operating profit that we discuss is an aggregation of the adjusted operating profit for each of our comparable hotels. See Non GAAP Financial Measures Comparable Hotel Operating Results for further discussion. We also use, among other things, FFO per diluted share as a supplemental measure of company wide profitability. See Non GAAP Financial Measures FFO per Diluted Share for further discussion. Each of the non GAAP measures should be considered by investors as supplemental measures to GAAP performance measures such as total revenues, operating profit and earnings per share. Outlook For 2004, RevPAR increased approximately 7.3% at our comparable hotels as compared to 2003. We believe that lodging demand will continue to grow in 2005 and, in particular, as corporate group and corporate transient business strengthen, we believe that RevPAR at our hotels will continue to increase. Improvements in RevPAR for the first half of 2004 were primarily driven by increases in occupancy at our hotels. In the second half of 2004, increases in RevPAR were attributable to increases in both occupancy and average room rates. We expect that demand will continue to grow and allow for additional growth in average room rates in 2005. This is a result of a number of positive trends such as strong U.S. GDP growth, low supply growth of new hotels, a continued increase in corporate transient demand and a solid group booking pace. Historically, we have seen that lodging demand in the United States correlates to GDP growth, with typically a one to two quarter lag period, 22 Table of Contents especially within the luxury and upper upscale sectors of the lodging industry. Therefore, given the relatively strong U.S. GDP growth in 2004 and the GDP forecasts for 2005, we are optimistic about improvements in lodging demand in 2005. As a result of these trends, we expect our comparable hotel RevPAR to increase approximately 6.5% to 8.5% for 2005. In addition to the favorable demand trends forecast to affect the lodging industry in general, we believe we will be able to capitalize on the low supply growth trends that have existed during the past few years. Supply growth in the lodging industry and the geographic markets in which we operate may be influenced by a number of factors, including growth of the economy, interest rates, local considerations and the relatively long lead time required to build urban and resort/conference hotels. We believe that the low construction levels over the past few years, together with low expectations for additional supply growth over the next few years, will lead to an imbalance between supply and growing demand that will allow for improved RevPAR performance at our hotels. In terms of profitability measures, operating margins were relatively unchanged for the first half of 2004. However, operating margins increased in the second half of 2004, as the average room rate increases at our hotels began to exceed the rate of inflation for the first time since 2000, resulting in an overall increase for the full year for our comparable hotels. Operating margins continue to be affected by certain of our costs, primarily wages, benefits, utilities and sales and marketing, which increased at a rate greater than inflation. We expect these costs to continue to increase at a rate greater than inflation in the near term. As noted above, approximately 31% of our revenues are from food and beverage operations. During 2004, food and beverage revenue growth at our comparable hotels was 5.7%. As the economy continues to expand in 2005, we expect to see an increase in our catering revenues, which should improve our food and beverage operating margins. We also may see improvements in RevPAR and operating margins as we continue our strategy of recycling assets. As noted below, over the past year we have been acquiring upper upscale and luxury properties in urban and resort/conference locations, where further large scale lodging development is limited, and selling assets in suburban, secondary and tertiary markets. The assets we have been acquiring have higher RevPAR, higher operating margins and, we believe, higher growth potential than those we have sold. Over time, this should contribute to improvements in overall RevPAR and operating margins. During 2004, the average RevPAR penetration index for our comparable hotels modestly declined, but it remains at a premium in relation to our competitive set. This follows a similar decline in our average RevPAR penetration index for our comparable hotels in 2003. Market share at our urban and airport hotels increased slightly in 2004, reversing the prior year trend as a result of the increase in business travel, however, market share continued to decline at our suburban properties and our larger convention hotels. We believe that this decline in market share over the past two years occurred because: our hotels generally have a higher percentage of their revenues generated by corporate group and corporate transient customers than their competitors and that business in the upper upscale and luxury segment did not begin to significantly increase until the second half of 2004; certain of our properties overcommitted to lower rated group business late in 2003, which has resulted in those properties being unable to take advantage of higher rated transient business as travel increased in 2004; we have a significant number of large hotels in our portfolio, including nine convention hotels with greater than 1,000 rooms, which require longer periods of time to rebuild their customer base; and new supply in several of our markets affected our hotels. As lodging demand continues to grow and, in particular, as corporate group and corporate transient business strengthens, we believe that our hotels may regain the majority of the market share lost in 2003 and 2004. 23 Table of Contents While we believe the combination of improved demand trends and low supply growth trends in the lodging industry creates the possibility for improvements in our business in 2005, there can be no assurances that any increases in hotel revenues or earnings at our properties will continue. The trends discussed above may not occur for any number of reasons, including: slower than anticipated growth in the economy, business investment and employment and changes in travel patterns; and the continued threat of additional terrorist attacks, high oil prices, airline strikes and other factors that may have an adverse impact on travel and lodging demand. All of the above, as well as the risks set forth in the section Forward Looking Statements may result in lower revenues or higher operating costs and declining operating margins. Managements Priorities Based on forecasted operating conditions, our key management priorities over the next several years include the following: to work with our managers to increase revenues and minimize operating costs; to invest capital in our existing portfolio to maintain our assets and pursue repositioning/ROI opportunities. Potential investments at our hotels could include increasing the number of rooms, building a spa, fitness facility, convention or meeting space or upgrading the infrastructure, such as energy efficient heating and cooling systems; to invest in opportunities to enhance the value of existing assets by converting underutilized space to alternate uses such as timeshare or condominium units; to acquire upper upscale and luxury hotels in unique locations, including hotels in urban and resort/conference locations; to use the proceeds from the sale of non core hotels to acquire properties more closely aligned with our target profile or to repay debt; and to reduce our leverage, over time, to achieve an EBITDA to interest coverage ratio of 3.0x or greater under our senior notes indenture and seek to maintain a balanced maturity schedule with an average maturity of no less than five years. In furtherance of these objectives, we acquired three hotels in 2004 valued at approximately $502 million (the Fairmont Kea Lani Maui, the Embassy Suites Chicago Downtown Lakefront and the Scottsdale Marriott at McDowell Mountains). We sold nine non core properties in 2004 for $254 million and another four properties in January 2005 for $128 million. We also committed to sell by March 2005, subject to several closing conditions, 85% of our interest in the CBM Joint Venture, which owns 120 Courtyard by Marriott properties. Additionally, we raised $1.2 billion through financing activities in 2004, using those funds along with funds raised through asset dispositions to acquire properties and to repay or refinance $1.1 billion in senior notes and $116 million in mortgage debt, all of which improved our interest coverage ratio and our overall leverage ratio. Similarly, in 2004 we spent approximately $44 million on repositioning and ROI projects, including commencing a $60 million renovation and repositioning of our Newport Beach Marriott hotel. As part of this project, we have negotiated to sell land which currently houses a tennis facility at this property to a high end condominium developer. In 2005, we committed to invest approximately $60 million for the development of a 105,000 square foot exhibit hall at the Orlando World Center Marriott Resort and Convention Center, or the Orlando Marriott World Center. We expect to spend $200 million to $400 million on such investments in the next several years. By contrast, we had limited our expenditures on such development projects in 2002 and 2003 based on our assessment of the relatively weak operating environment and to preserve capital. 24 Table of Contents For further detail on each of the above transactions, see the discussion in Liquidity and Capital Resources. We believe we successfully executed on a number of these management priorities in 2004 based on the positive trends in the hotel industry noted above, as well as improving conditions in the financial markets. There can be no assurances, however, that these trends will continue in 2005 or that we will be able to continue to execute on all, or any, of these priorities in 2005 or over the next several years.

(2) Comparable hotel operating statistics for 2004 and 2003 are based on the 103 hotels we define as comparable as of December 31, 2004. The percent change from 2002 to 2003 is based on the 107 hotels we define as comparable as of December 31, 2003. See Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics for further details. 2004 Compared to 2003 Hotel Sales Overview. Hotel sales increased $357 million, or 11.2%, to $3.5 billion for 2004 as compared to $3.2 billion for 2003. Hotel sales for 2004 include approximately $59 million of sales for the three hotels acquired in 2004 and exclude sales for the properties we have sold or classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2004 for all periods presented, which have been reclassified to discontinued operations. See Discontinued Operations below. Comparable hotel sales increased 6.4%, or $203 million, to $3.4 billion. The growth in revenues reflects the increase in comparable RevPAR of 7.3% for 2004, as a result of strong increases in occupancy of 2.9 percentage points, as well as an increase in average room rate of 2.9%. Food and beverage revenues for our comparable hotels increased 5.7%, primarily due to an increase in catering revenues and the overall increase in occupancy. We discuss operating results for our full service hotels on a comparable basis, which is properties that we have owned throughout the entire year, while eliminating the results of properties acquired or sold, or that incurred significant property damage or large scale capital improvements during these periods. As of December 31, 2004, 103 of our full service hotels have been classified as comparable hotels. The following discussion is of the sales results of our comparable hotels considering the mix of business (i.e. transient or group), property type (i.e. urban, suburban, resort/conference or airport) and geographic region. See Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics for a complete description of our comparable hotels and further detail on these classifications. 25 Table of Contents Comparable Hotel Sales by Customer Mix. The majority of our customers fall into two broad groups: transient and group travelers. Continuing a trend we noted in the first three quarters of 2004, the business mix of our portfolio is showing a shift in transient room nights, from lower rated discount business to higher rated corporate and premium business. For 2004, total transient room revenue for our comparable Marriott and Ritz Carlton hotels was up 6.8% compared to last year, as premium and corporate occupancy increased to 29.3% of total transient demand, up from 25.8% last year, while our average transient room rate increased by 5.4%. This indicates that our hotel managers are having greater success in reducing the number of rooms sold at discounted rates as a result of improving transient demand. We believe the upward trend in occupancy and average room rate should continue as a result of increased corporate and premium business in the fourth quarter. For 2004, total group room revenue for our comparable Marriott and Ritz Carlton hotels was up 8.2% compared to last year, primarily due to an increase in occupancy of approximately 7.5%, while our average group room rate was up slightly, or 0.7%. This increase reflects the increased business travel and the steady growth in the economy. Additionally, our managers improved overall occupancy by accepting greater numbers of advance room reservations for groups, which resulted in fewer rooms available for transient business. We expect this trend to reverse in 2005. Comparable Hotel Sales by Property Type. For full year 2004, revenues increased consistently across all of our hotel property types. Comparable hotel RevPAR increased 6.8%, 6.4%, 7.0% and 12.0% for urban, suburban, resort/conference and airport properties, respectively. The largest increases were for our airport hotels, which reflects a significant increase in business travel in 2004 compared with the significantly depressed levels of 2002 and 2003. The performance of our portfolio is significantly affected by the size of our hotels, including our large convention hotels, the majority of which are included in urban properties. Convention hotels have historically outperformed in the early stages of an industry downturn; however, they also lag the industry in performance in the early stages of recovery. This is due to the longer booking lead time for large group business and the level of transient demand required for the greater capacity of rooms. As with other recoveries, we expect that these hotels will ultimately outperform and their performance will stay relatively strong for a longer period of time. Comparable Hotel Sales by Geographic Region. During 2004, we experienced RevPAR gains in most regions. Full year 2004 comparable hotel RevPAR in our New England region improved 11.0% over the prior year. The region benefited from the Democratic National Convention during the third quarter and was led by the Boston Hyatt, which was converted from the Swiss&ocirc;tel brand in late 2003, where RevPAR improved by 25.6% for the year. Comparable hotel RevPAR increased 9.2% for our DC Metro region due primarily to a 5.2% increase in average room rates in 2004. Growth was slowed during the year by rooms renovations at four of our hotels in the region. We expect that the region will experience strong RevPAR growth in 2005 due to the Presidential inauguration, the overall strength of the market and the negative effect of the rooms renovations in 2004. For our Atlanta region, comparable hotel RevPAR grew by 6.0%. The improvement was led by The Grand Hyatt, Atlanta, The Four Seasons, Atlanta and The Ritz Carlton, Atlanta, where RevPAR increased 9.7%, 10.9% and 9.9%, respectively. Our Pacific region, which had lagged behind the portfolio as a whole during 2002 and 2003, continued to improve as comparable hotel RevPAR increased 8.0%, with significant increases in occupancy. The primary reason this region had been underperforming over the past three years was due to the decline in travel related to the areas technology companies, particularly in the San Francisco Bay area. The improvement in the Pacific region in 2004 reflects an increase in comparable hotel RevPAR at our San Francisco market hotels of 14.5%. 26 Table of Contents The results for the Pacific region also reflect a 6.5% increase in comparable hotel RevPAR at our properties in the Los Angeles market. Overall, we expect the Pacific region to continue to exhibit improving performance in 2005. Comparable hotel RevPAR in our Mid Atlantic region improved 10.7% over the prior year. Our New York City properties benefited from the Republican National Convention in the third quarter and strong demand in the fourth quarter. For 2004, comparable hotel RevPAR in the Florida region improved 7.1% over 2003. During August and September, four hurricanes caused significant damage in Florida. Our 12 properties in the region and the New Orleans Marriott experienced varying levels of property damage and business interruption. During 2004, we recorded $3 million of non recoverable losses. We believe that the hurricanes could have a modest impact on business next year, as planners of group business may elect to book business in other markets during the hurricane season. RevPAR in other regions was relatively unchanged from 2003. RevPAR declined 0.9% in our South Central region, while RevPAR in our North Central and Mountain regions experienced comparable RevPAR increases of 2.2% and 2.7%, respectively. Comparable hotel RevPAR for our international properties increased 17.5% for 2004. Our four Canadian properties, three of which are in Toronto, experienced increases in RevPAR of 24.5%, as the region has recovered from the SARs related travel restrictions in 2003 and the effect of the favorable appreciation of the Canadian dollar compared to the U.S. dollar. Rental Income. Our rental income represents lease income from our 71 limited service hotels and three office property leases, as well as lease income from one full service hotel. In 2003, operations at the leased limited service hotel properties suffered because a significant portion of these properties underwent renovations to enable them to compete with newer hotels and the weak economic conditions in their markets. While several leased properties were still under renovation in 2004, the properties that underwent renovations in 2003 performed substantially better. This was the primary reason for the increase in total rental income of $6 million to $106 million during 2004. Operating Costs and Expenses. Operating costs and expenses increased $244 million, or 8.2%, to $3.2 billion. The operating costs and expenses include the costs of three properties acquired in 2004, totaling approximately $48 million, and exclude the costs for properties we sold or that are classified as held for sale, the results of which are included in discontinued operations. Property level expenses, which account for 98% of our total operating costs and expenses, increased $237 million, or 8.1%, to approximately $3.2 billion. Comparable hotel expenses increased $127 million, or 5.1%, to $2.6 billion. The increase in operating costs and expenses is due to additional costs associated with an increase in occupancy at our hotels and an increase in wage, benefit, utility and sales and marketing costs, all of which we believe will continue to increase at a rate greater than inflation. Operating costs and expenses also include base and incentive management fees, which are earned based on the operating performance of our individual hotels. Due to the difficult operating environment over the past three years, less than half of our hotels reached the necessary thresholds in 2004 that would require us to incur incentive management fees to our managers. In 2004 and 2003, incentive management fees totaled $38 million and $36 million, respectively. We expect the number of hotels reaching these thresholds and the incentive fees earned to further increase in 2005. Corporate and Other Expenses. Corporate and other expenses primarily consist of employee salaries and bonuses and other costs such as employee stock based compensation expense, corporate insurance, audit fees, building rent and system costs. During 2004, the $7 million increase is primarily due to an increase in stock 27 Table of Contents compensation expense, as a result of the significant appreciation in our stock price since December 31, 2003 and an increase in the number of shares that may be issued that are subject to performance criteria established by the Compensation Policy Committee of the Board of Directors. Interest Expense. During 2004, interest expense decreased $5 million. Interest expense for 2004 includes $32 million of interest which was previously classified as dividends on Convertible Preferred Securities (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). Interest expense also includes $55 million and $31 million of call premiums and accelerated deferred financing costs and original issue discounts that were associated with debt prepayments made in 2004 and 2003, respectively. After excluding these items, interest expense decreased approximately $60 million due to the significant amount of debt repayments and refinancings that have occurred in 2003 and 2004. See Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Requirements Debt Repayments and Refinancings. Net Gains on Property Transactions. Net gains on property transactions are due primarily to the recognition of deferred gains. In 1994, we sold a portfolio of Fairfield Inns by Marriott and received a note receivable in partial payment. Subsequently, we recorded a loss on the note due to a decline in the operations of the hotels. During 2004, the owner filed for bankruptcy and several properties were sold. We recognized a previously deferred gain of approximately $12 million based on the amount of the proceeds we received. Loss on Foreign Currency and Derivative Contracts. During 2004, the loss on foreign currency and derivative contracts is primarily due to the approximate $7 million loss from the foreign currency exchange contracts related to mortgage debt that was secured by three of our Canadian hotels for the majority of 2004 as the U.S. dollar continued to decline in relation to the Canadian dollar. These contracts were deemed ineffective for hedge accounting purposes in 2003, which resulted in an $18 million loss at that time. See Liquidity and Capital Resources Debt and Effect of Financial Covenants Mortgage Debt Covenants for further discussion. Minority Interest Expense. Minority interest expense consists of our minority partners share of the income or loss in consolidated hotel partnerships and the approximate 6% ownership in Host LP. Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Affiliates. Equity in earnings (losses) of affiliates consists of our portion of the earnings (losses) of two partnerships in which we own non controlling interests. The decrease in the loss can be attributed to a decrease in the net loss of CBM Joint Venture LLC in 2004 and an increase in the income from our investment in Tiburon Golf Ventures, L.P. See Investments in Affiliates for a discussion of these partnerships. Discontinued Operations. Discontinued operations consist of nine hotels sold in 2004, eight hotels sold in 2003, one hotel sold in 2002, the gain on the disposition and business interruption proceeds for the New York Marriott World Trade Center hotel in 2003 and 2002 and four properties classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2004, all of which were sold in January 2005. In accordance with SFAS 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets or SFAS 144, the results of operations for these properties in the current year and prior periods are reflected in discontinued operations. For 2004, the nine hotels sold generated net proceeds of approximately $246 million with a net gain on disposition of approximately $52 million. Our revenues for the 21 properties sold in 2003 and 2004 or classified as held for sale at December 31, 2004 and the final disposition of insurance proceeds for the New York Marriott World Trade Center hotel were $133 million for 2004 and $442 million for 2003. Income before taxes for the same periods was $12 million and $191 million, respectively. 2003 Compared to 2002 Hotel Sales. Hotel sales declined $68 million, or 2.0%, to approximately $3.2 billion. Hotel sales for 2003 include approximately $10 million for one hotel acquired in 2003 and exclude sales for the properties we have sold in 2004 and 2003 or classified as held for sale in 2004, which have been reclassified to discontinued 28 Table of Contents operations. See Discontinued Operations below. We discuss operating results for our hotels on a comparable basis, and as of December 31, 2003, 112 of our 117 full service hotels owned on that date were classified as comparable for 2003 and 2002. For 2003, our comparable hotel RevPAR of $96.85 was down 4.2% from 2002, reflecting a decline in average room rate of 1.9% and a decrease in occupancy of 1.6 percentage points, primarily due to reduced transient demand for both business and leisure travel. Beginning in the fourth quarter, demand began to improve relative to the first three quarters of 2003, with less than one half a percent decrease in room rate and a slight decrease in occupancy over the fourth quarter of 2002. Comparable hotel RevPAR by property type decreased 4.3%, 4.5%, 3.5% and 3.9% for urban, suburban, resort/conference and airport properties, respectively. While our overall results for 2003 declined, we did experience improvements in comparable hotel RevPAR in four geographic regions for the fourth quarter and two regions for the full year. Comparable hotel RevPAR for our Washington D.C. Metro region increased 4.0% for the fourth quarter and 2.5% for the full year. These increases were driven by strong transient demand particularly at our Northern Virginia properties as occupancy increased 0.9 percentage points for both the fourth quarter and full year for the comparable hotels. Our Florida region also had a slight increase in comparable hotel RevPAR for the year, but a slight decrease for the fourth quarter. The results were primarily driven by our properties in the Ft. Lauderdale and Tampa markets, which benefited from stronger group demand and leisure travel. The relative improvement of these regions was offset by the overall decline in comparable hotel RevPAR in most of our other regions. In particular, our New England and South Central regions had significant declines in comparable hotel RevPAR of 15.1% and 5.8%, respectively, for the year and 14.4% and 5.7%, respectively, for the fourth quarter. The comparable hotel results in the South Central region were primarily affected by our hotels in San Antonio where full year occupancy was down 3.4 percentage points and average room rate declined 3.6%. The decline in our New England properties was driven by the performance of our three comparable hotels in Boston which had comparable hotel RevPAR declines of 18.8% and 19.7%, respectively, for the fourth quarter and full year. The decrease in demand was primarily attributable to a reduction in city wide convention activity in 2003. The New England results discussed above do not include the Boston Copley Marriott which is considered a non comparable hotel, which had an increase in RevPAR for the fourth quarter of 1.6%. Our rental income represents lease income from our 71 limited service hotels and three office property leases, as well as lease income from one full service hotel. Operations at the leased limited service hotel properties continued to suffer due to increased competition from full service and limited service properties and weak economic conditions in their markets, resulting in a very competitive environment and lower room rates. In 2003, we also recognized $9.6 million of other income from the settlement of a claim that we brought against our directors and officers insurance carriers for reimbursement of defense costs and settlement payments incurred in resolving a series of related actions brought against us and Marriott International which arose from the sale of certain limited partnerships units to investors prior to 1993. Operating Costs and Expenses. The increase in operating costs and expenses is primarily the result of increases in wages, benefits, insurance and utilities at our hotels. Rental and other expense for our limited service hotel leases, office properties and one full service hotel that we leased are included in other property level expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. Consistent with the relatively fixed nature of these costs, our operating expenses increased in both 2003 and 2002 despite the decrease in revenues in both years. Corporate and Other Expenses. The increase in corporate and other expenses is primarily due to increases in corporate insurance and the appreciation of Host Marriotts stock price, which affects the employee stock based compensation expense. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased 6.6% over 2002 as a result of the payment of aggregate call premiums of $25 million and the acceleration of deferred financing fees of $6 million associated with the prepayment of our senior notes and various mortgages during 2003. 29 Table of Contents Loss on Foreign Currency and Derivative Contracts. The loss on foreign currency and derivative contracts is due primarily to the approximate $18 million loss from the forward currency exchange contracts for our four Canadian hotels being deemed ineffective for hedge accounting purposes. See Liquidity and Capital Resources Debt and Effect of Financial Covenants Mortgage Debt Covenants for further discussion. Minority Interest Expense. Minority interest expense consists of our minority partners share of the income or loss in consolidated hotel partnerships and the approximate 7% ownership interest in Host LP. The decrease in minority interest expense is due to the decline in our operations discussed above. Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Affiliates. Equity in earnings (losses) of affiliates consists of our portion of the earnings (losses) of two partnerships in which we own non controlling interests and do not consolidate in our financial statements. The increase in the loss can be attributed to an increase in the net loss of CBM Joint Venture LLC in 2003. See Investments in Affiliates for a discussion of this partnership. Discontinued Operations. Discontinued operations consist of nine hotels sold in 2004, eight hotels sold in 2003, one hotel sold in 2002, the gain on the disposition and business interruption proceeds for the New York Marriott World Trade Center hotel in 2003 and 2002 and four properties classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2004. For 2003, the eight hotels sold generated net proceeds of approximately $184 million with a net gain on disposition of approximately $9 million. Discontinued operations for 2003 also includes a $56 million gain on the disposition of World Trade Center hotel. For 2003 and 2002, our revenues for all properties included in discontinued operations were $442 million and $334 million, respectively, and our income before taxes was $191 million and $45 million, respectively. On December 3, 2003, we announced the settlement of the outstanding matters relating to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 affecting the New York Marriott World Trade Center and Financial Center hotels with the hotels insurer, Marriott International and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. As a result of these settlements, we received net insurance proceeds of approximately $372 million. As a result of this settlement, we recorded a one time gain of approximately $212 million, which is comprised of approximately $156 million in post 2003 business interruption proceeds and approximately $56 million from the disposition of the New York Marriott World Trade Center hotel. The gain on disposition and the 2003 and 2002 business interruption income, net of expenses, related to the hotel has been reclassified to discontinued operations. The business interruption proceeds received, net of expenses, for the New York Marriott Financial Center hotel are included in rooms revenue from continuing operations. Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics We present certain operating statistics (i.e., RevPAR, average daily rate and average occupancy) and operating results (revenues, expenses and adjusted operating profit) for the periods included in this report on a comparable hotel basis. We define our comparable hotels as full service properties (i) that are owned or leased by us and the operations of which are included in our consolidated results, whether as continuing operations or discontinued operations, for the entirety of the reporting periods being compared, and (ii) that have not sustained substantial property damage or undergone large scale capital projects during the reporting periods being compared. Of the 111 full service hotels that we owned on December 31, 2004, 103 have been classified as comparable hotels for 2004 versus 2003 comparisons. The operating results of the following eight hotels that we owned as of December 31, 2004 are excluded from comparable hotel results for these periods: The JW Marriott, Washington, D.C. (consolidated in our financial statements beginning in the second quarter of 2003); The Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa (acquired in November 2003); The Memphis Marriott (construction of a 200 room expansion started in 2003 and completed in 2004); The Embassy Suites Chicago Downtown Lakefront Hotel (acquired in April 2004); The Fairmont Kea Lani Maui (acquired in July 2004); 30 Table of Contents The Newport Beach Marriott Hotel (major renovation started in July 2004); Mountain Shadows Resort Hotel (temporarily closed in September 2004); and Scottsdale Marriott at McDowell Mountains (acquired in September 2004). In addition, the operating results of the 17 hotels we disposed of in 2004 and 2003 are also not included in comparable hotel results for the periods presented herein. Moreover, because these statistics and operating results are for our full service hotel properties, they exclude results for our non hotel properties and leased limited service hotels. We evaluate the operating performance of our comparable hotels based on both geographic region and property type. These divisions are generally consistent with industry data provided by hospitality research firms such as Smith Travel Research. Geographic regions consist of the following (only states in which we own hotels are listed): Pacific California, Hawaii, Oregon and Washington; Mountain Arizona and Colorado; North Central Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri and Ohio; South Central Louisiana, Tennessee and Texas; New England Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire; Mid Atlantic Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York; DC Metro Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C.; Atlanta Georgia and North Carolina; Florida Florida; and International Canada and Mexico. Property types consist of the following: Urban Hotels located in central business districts of major cities. This includes most of our large convention center properties, suburban markets or edge cities located outside the urban core in larger metropolitan areas; Suburban Hotels located in office parks or smaller secondary markets; Resort/conference Hotels in tourist locations such as Florida, Hawaii and Southern California; and Airport Hotels located at or near airports. 31 Table of Contents The following table sets forth performance information for our comparable full service hotels by geographic region and property type as of December 31, 2004 and 2003: Comparable by Region As of December 31, 2004 Year ended December 31, 2004 Year ended December 31, 2003 Percent Change in RevPAR No. of Properties No. of Rooms Average Daily Rate Average Occupancy Percentages RevPAR Average Daily Rate Average Occupancy Percentages RevPAR Pacific 20 10,720 $ 148.93 73.3 % $ 109.10 $ 148.71 67.9 % $ 101.03 8.0 % Florida 12 7,337 163.16 71.5 116.69 158.40 68.8 109.00 7.1 Mid Atlantic 10 6,720 189.17 78.3 148.19 180.11 74.3 133.85 10.7 Atlanta 13 5,940 143.30 67.1 96.15 138.16 65.6 90.67 6.0 North Central 13 4,923 123.93 67.8 84.06 123.52 66.6 82.28 2.2 South Central 7 4,816 131.73 75.1 98.87 131.46 75.9 99.79 (0.9 ) DC Metro 10 3,890 155.75 73.4 114.29 148.07 70.7 104.65 9.2 New England 7 3,413 146.12 73.0 106.72 142.32 67.5 96.11 11.0 Mountain 6 2,351 102.34 59.7 61.10 97.56 61.0 59.52 2.7 International 5 1,953 122.86 72.3 88.87 114.67 66.0 75.64 17.5 All Regions 103 52,063 149.64 71.9 107.66 145.42 69.0 100.35 7.3 Comparable by Property Type As of December 31, 2004 Year ended December 31, 2004 Year ended December 31, 2003 Percent Change in RevPAR No. of Properties No. of Rooms Average Daily Rate Average Occupancy Percentages RevPAR Average Daily Rate Average Occupancy Percentages RevPAR Urban 40 25,068 $ 165.67 74.4 % $ 123.21 $ 159.79 72.2 % $ 115.40 6.8 % Suburban 38 14,081 121.44 67.2 81.63 117.25 65.4 76.72 6.4 Airport 16 7,332 113.12 74.6 84.37 111.66 67.5 75.36 12.0 Resort/ Conference 9 5,582 192.56 69.6 133.99 190.79 65.7 125.26 7.0 All Types 103 52,063 149.64 71.9 107.66 145.42 69.0 100.35 7.3 The following statistics are for all of our full service properties as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and the results of operations for nine hotels sold in 2004 and eight hotels sold in 2003 prior to their disposition.

Funds used by HMC to make these distributions are provided from Host LP. Because we are required to distribute almost all of our taxable income, we depend primarily on external sources of capital to finance future growth, including acquisitions. 32 Table of Contents Cash Balances. As of December 31, 2004, we had $347 million of cash and cash equivalents, which was a decrease of $417 million from December 31, 2003. The decrease is primarily attributable to significant debt prepayments and acquisitions in 2004. For a further discussion, see Sources and Uses of Cash below. In the third quarter of 2004, we amended and restated our credit facility, which now provides aggregate revolving loan commitments of $575 million, an increase of $275 million. We have no amounts outstanding under the credit facility. Due to the volatile operating environment in 2002 and 2003, our cash balances have been in excess of the $100 million to $150 million which we had historically maintained. With the added flexibility and capacity of our new credit facility and the continuing growth of the economy, we expect to lower our cash balances to previous levels over the next several quarters. As of December 31, 2004, we also had an additional $154 million of cash which was restricted as a result of lender requirements (including reserves for debt service, real estate taxes, insurance, as well as cash collateral and excess cash flow deposits). The restricted cash balance includes $37 million which is held in escrow in accordance with debt covenant requirements where cash flows after debt service from certain properties did not meet certain required minimum levels (see Financial Condition Mortgage Debt below). The restricted cash balances do not have a significant effect on our liquidity. Debt Repayments and Refinancings. With the proceeds from asset sales and the insurance proceeds received for the New York Marriott World Trade Center hotel, we repaid or redeemed a total of approximately $400 million of debt in 2004. We also made $61 million of scheduled principal payments. In addition, we refinanced approximately $830 million of our debt in 2004. The combined effect of these transactions lowered our average interest rate by approximately 65 basis points. As a result of the repayments and refinancings completed during both 2003 and 2004, our annual interest expense obligations, excluding the effect of call premiums and accelerated deferred financing costs, have declined approximately $80 million based on interest rates as of December 31, 2004. We have no significant debt maturities prior to February 2006, though principal amortization will total approximately $66 million in 2005. We believe we have sufficient cash to deal with our near term debt maturities, as well as any unanticipated decline in the cash flow from our business. Reducing our leverage and future interest payments through debt repayments and refinancings remains a key management priority. In November 2003, Host Marriotts Board of Directors authorized us to purchase or retire up to $600 million of our senior notes with proceeds from additional asset sales ($317 million of which remains available under this authorization). Senior notes redeemed in connection with a refinancing transaction do not affect the availability under this authorization. As a result, we may continue to redeem or refinance additional senior notes, our Convertible Preferred Securities (QUIPs) debt and mortgage debt from time to time to take advantage of favorable market conditions. We may purchase senior notes and QUIPs debt for cash through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, a tender offer or, in some cases, through the early redemption of such securities pursuant to their terms. Repurchases of debt, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. Any refinancing or retirement before the maturity date would affect earnings and FFO per diluted share, as defined herein, as a result of the payment of any applicable call premiums and the acceleration of previously deferred financing costs. During 2004, we incurred interest expense resulting from the payment of call premiums of approximately $40 million and the acceleration of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts totaling approximately $14 million. Capital Expenditures. Typically, our renewal and replacement capital expenditures range from $200 million to $250 million on an annual basis. Based on the improved economy in 2004, we have increased spending compared to 2003, where we had reduced our capital expenditures based on our assessment of the operating environment, including delaying certain projects due to the start of the war in Iraq, and to preserve capital. For 2004, renewal and replacement capital expenditures totaled approximately $206 million. During 2003, our capital expenditures were focused on property maintenance and improvements designed to maintain appropriate levels of quality. We spent approximately $181 million on renewal and replacement capital expenditures in 2003. Our renewal and replacement capital expenditures are generally funded by the furniture, fixture and equipment funds established at certain of our hotels (typically funded annually with approximately 5% of property revenues) and by our available cash. 33 Table of Contents During 2004, we also spent approximately $44 million on repositioning/ROI projects. These projects have historically generated strong returns and over the next several years we expect to spend $200 million to $400 million on such investments. Repositioning /ROI projects include substantial repositionings or expanding room, ballroom, meeting, conference and exhibit hall facilities (often through the conversion of underutilized space), constructing or expanding spa facilities and installing energy management systems. In addition, we will continue to seek opportunities to enhance the value of our portfolio by identifying and executing strategies that capitalize on alternate uses of our assets, such as the development of timeshare or condominium units on excess land or the conversion of existing rooms to timeshare or condominium units such as the previously discussed renovation and repositioning of the Newport Beach Marriott Hotel. The renovation is expected to cost approximately $60 million and will include the addition of a spa and 20 new luxury suites, redesigned guest rooms, a new restaurant concept and updated meeting space. We also recently announced a commitment to invest approximately $60 million for the development of an exhibit hall for the Marriott Orlando World Center hotel. In addition, we are pursuing the development of 120 timeshare units on a beachfront parking lot at the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa. On September 3, 2004, we also converted the 590 room Denver Southeast Marriott to the Four Points by Sheraton Denver Southeast and are currently utilizing 475 rooms. We spent approximately $2 million in 2004 and expect to spend a total of $5 million for the conversion, which we believe will result in improved cash flows. We are also in the process of negotiating a contract to sell the Marriott Mountain Shadows Resort, which has been temporarily closed since September 2004. The sale of the hotel is contingent on, among other items, obtaining local government approval for the proposed redevelopment. Acquisitions. We remain interested in pursuing single asset and portfolio acquisitions and believe that there will be opportunities in the near term and over the next several years to acquire assets that are consistent with our target profile of upper upscale and luxury properties. An example of this strategy is the July 15, 2004 acquisition of the 450 suite Fairmont Kea Lani Maui, a luxury resort hotel located on 21 acres of Waileas Polo Beach, for $355 million. We also acquired the 270 suite Scottsdale Marriott at McDowell Mountains on September 22, 2004 for approximately $58 million, $34 million of which was funded through the assumption of the existing mortgage debt on the hotel and the 455 suite Chicago Embassy Suites Downtown Lakefront for $89 million in May 2004. In addition, during 2004, we purchased a retail building adjacent to one of our hotels and the land under the JW Marriott Hotel at Lenox in Atlanta, which we previously leased, for a combined total of approximately $30 million. We may acquire properties through various structures, including transactions involving portfolios, single assets, joint ventures and acquisitions of all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other REITs or similar real estate entities. We anticipate that our acquisitions will be financed through a combination of methods, including proceeds from equity offerings of HMC, issuance of OP Units by Host LP, advances under our credit facility, our available cash and the incurrence or assumption of indebtedness. We may, from time to time, be in the process of identifying, analyzing and negotiating possible acquisition transactions and we expect to continue to do so in the future. We cannot be certain as to the size or timing of acquisition opportunities or of our ability to obtain additional acquisition financing, if needed. Additionally, the number of potential acquirers for individual hotel properties has increased due to the improvement of both the capital markets and the lodging industry and, as a result, the cost of acquiring properties has increased. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to find acquisition targets that provide a suitable return on investment. Sources and Uses of Cash Our principal sources of cash are cash from operations, the sale of assets, borrowing under our credit facility and our ability to obtain additional financing through various capital markets. Our principal uses of cash are debt service, asset acquisitions, capital expenditures, operating costs, corporate and other expenses and distributions to equity holders. 34 Table of Contents Cash Provided by Operations. Our cash provided by operations decreased $10 million to $360 million for 2004 from $370 million for 2003. Cash from operations in 2003 included $156 million in business interruption proceeds related to the disposition of the New York Marriott World Trade Center hotel. Excluding this transaction, cash provided by operations increased approximately $146 million in 2004. Cash Provided by or Used in Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities for 2004 was $501 million compared to $153 million for 2003. Activity for 2004 primarily included the acquisition of three hotel properties and other assets for total cash expenditures of approximately $503 million, the net proceeds of approximately $246 million from the sale of nine non core properties, and capital expenditures at our properties of approximately $250 million. In January of 2005, we also completed the disposition of four hotels for total proceeds of approximately $128 million. The net proceeds from these sales will be used to repay debt, fund acquisitions or repositioning/ROI projects, or for general corporate purposes. On December 30, 2004, we received approximately $47 million in payment of a note receivable from a minority partner in a consolidated partnership that owns two hotels. At the request of the minority partner, the partnership purchased preferred units of Vornado Realty Trust (the Vornado Preferred Units), which we held as of December 31, 2004. As the Vornado Preferred Units are not publicly traded, we have recorded them in other assets at their cost basis in our consolidated balance sheet. On January 3, 2005, these securities were transferred to the minority partner in redemption of his partnership interest. We also paid approximately $14 million to a second partner for the remaining minority interests in the partnership. No gain or loss was recognized on this transaction. On December 15, 2004, we executed a sale agreement with an affiliate of Sarofim Realty Advisors (Sarofim) and Marriott International, whereby Sarofim will acquire 85% of our interest in CBM Joint Venture for approximately $92 million. We and Marriott International each currently own a 50% interest in CBM Joint Venture, which owns 120 Courtyard by Marriott properties totaling approximately 17,500 rooms. As part of the transaction, CBM Joint Venture will be converted into a limited partnership and we will have the right to cause the partnership to redeem our remaining interest in the partnership under certain conditions between December 8, 2007 and December 8, 2009. Starting December 9, 2009, the partnership will have the right to redeem our remaining interest. The sale is expected to close by March 2005 and is subject to several closing conditions, including: no significant decrease in the net worth of CBM Joint Venture (but not considering a decrease in net worth due to changes in market conditions); the entering into by CBM Joint Venture of new management agreements and ground leases with Marriott International and its affiliates; Sarofims ability to complete the refinancing of certain secured debt and to obtain certain lender consents; and other customary closing conditions. There can be no assurances that the sale will be completed. There have been no cash distributions to us from CBM Joint Venture since 2001. 35 Table of Contents The following table summarizes significant investing activities that have been completed since the beginning of fiscal year 2003 (in millions): Transaction Date Description of Transaction Sale (Investment) Price Acquisitions September 2004 Purchase of the 270 room Scottsdale Marriott at McDowell Mountains (1) $ (58 ) July 2004 Purchase of the 450 suite Fairmont Kea Lani (355 ) May 2004 Purchase of the 455 room Embassy Suites Lakefront, Chicago (89 ) November 2003 Purchase of the 806 room Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa (321 ) June 2003 Acquisition of the remaining interests in the JW Marriott in Washington, D.C.(2) (98 ) Total acquisitions $ (921 ) Dispositions January 2005 Sale of Torrance Marriott $ 62 January 2005 Sale of Hartford Marriott at Farmington, Tampa Westshore Marriott and Albuquerque Marriott 66 December 2004 Sale of the Bethesda Marriott 45 December 2004 Sale of the Salt Lake City Marriott 50 May 2004 Sale of the Dallas/Fort Worth Airport Marriott 59 January 2004 Sale of the Mexico City Airport Marriott 30 January 2004 Sale of the Atlanta Northwest Marriott, Detroit Romulus Marriott and the Detroit Southfield Marriott, Atlanta Marriott Norcross and the Fullerton Marriott 70 December 2003 Insurance recovery from the New York Marriott World Trade Center and New York Marriott Financial Center hotels 372 December 2003 Sale of the Williamsburg Marriott, Oklahoma City Marriott and the Plaza San Antonio Marriott 75 November 2003 Sale of the Jacksonville Marriott 17 July 2003 Sale of Norfolk Waterside Marriott, Oklahoma City Waterford Marriott and Palm Beach Gardens Marriott 71 January 2003 Sale of Ontario Airport Marriott 26 Total dispositions $ 943 (1) Investment price includes the assumption of $34 million of mortgage debt.

Cash provided by financing activities, net, was $186 million for 2003. During 2004, approximately $1.2 billion of cash has been provided by financing activities through the issuance of equity and debt securities, while cash used in financing activities primarily consisted of debt prepayments of approximately $1.2 billion. See the table below for additional information. In connection with the redemptions of senior notes in 2004, we were required to pay premiums totaling approximately $40 million in exchange for the right to retire this debt in advance of its maturity. We also recorded interest expense of $14 million for the acceleration of the related deferred financing fees and original issue discounts for the prepayment of the senior notes. On August 3, 2004, we redeemed all 4.16 million shares of HMCs 10% Class A preferred stock (and corresponding Class A preferred units of Host LP) for approximately $104 million with the proceeds from the issuance of 4 million shares of the 8 7/8% Class E preferred shares and available cash. During December 2003, we announced the settlement of all outstanding matters related to the New York Marriott World Trade Center and Financial Center hotels with our insurer, Marriott International and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. As a result of this settlement, we received net proceeds of approximately $372 million, substantially all of which were used to repay debt. During the fourth quarter of 2003, we used the proceeds to repay the $65 million mortgage debt on the New York Marriott World Trade Center hotel and made a 36 Table of Contents partial prepayment of $32 million of mortgage debt on our Canadian properties. The remainder of the proceeds was used in the first quarter of 2004 for a partial prepayment of $44 million of debt secured by mortgages on two Ritz Carlton properties and to retire the remaining outstanding Series C senior notes of approximately $218 million (both of which are included in the totals for financing activities for 2004 noted above).

The weighted average interest rate of our debt is approximately 7.1% and the current average maturity is 6.6 years. Additionally, approximately 86% of our debt has a fixed rate of interest as of December 31, 2004. In general, we seek to limit near term maturities and maintain an average maturity of no less than five years, although there can be no assurances that we will achieve this objective. We may also make exceptions to these objectives to take advantage of market conditions. Senior Notes General. The following summary is a description of the material provisions of the indentures governing our various senior notes issues issued by the operating partnership, which we refer to collectively as the senior notes indenture. Under the terms of our senior notes indenture, our senior notes are equal in right of payment with all of the operating partnerships unsubordinated indebtedness and senior to all subordinated obligations of the operating partnership. The notes outstanding under our senior notes indenture are guaranteed by certain of our existing subsidiaries and are currently secured by pledges of equity interests in many of our subsidiaries. The guarantees and pledges ratably benefit the notes outstanding under our senior notes indenture, as well as our credit facility, certain other senior debt, and interest rate swap agreements and other hedging agreements with lenders that are parties to the credit facility. Restrictive Covenants. Under the terms of the senior notes indenture, our ability to incur indebtedness and pay dividends is subject to restrictions and the satisfaction of various conditions, including the achievement of an EBITDA to interest coverage ratio of at least 2.0x by the operating partnership. This ratio is calculated in accordance with our senior notes indenture and excludes from interest expense items such as interest on our Convertible Subordinated Debentures, call premiums and deferred financing charges that are included in interest expense on our consolidated statement of operations. In addition, the calculation is based on our pro forma results for the four prior fiscal quarters giving effect to the transactions, such as acquisitions, dispositions and financings, as if they occurred at the beginning of the period. Other covenants limiting our ability to incur indebtedness and pay dividends include maintaining total indebtedness (excluding our Convertible Subordinated Debentures) of less than 65% of adjusted total assets (using undepreciated real estate values) and secured indebtedness of less than 45% of adjusted total assets. So long as the operating partnership maintains the required level of interest coverage and satisfies these and other conditions in the senior notes indenture, we may pay preferred or common dividends and incur additional debt under the senior notes indenture, including debt incurred in connection with an acquisition. Our senior notes indenture also imposes restrictions on customary matters, such as limitations on capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments, transactions with affiliates and the incurrence of liens. Interest. We pay interest on each series of our outstanding senior notes semi annually in arrears at the respective annual rates indicated on the table below. Exchangeable Senior Debentures. On March 16, 2004, we issued $500 million of 3.25% Exchangeable Senior Debentures and received net proceeds of $484 million, net of underwriting fees and expenses and an original issue discount. These debentures were issued under our senior notes indenture, and are the only series of senior notes that are exchangeable into HMC common stock. The Exchangeable Senior Debentures mature on April 15, 2024 and are equal in right of payment with all of our unsubordinated debt. Interest is payable quarterly in arrears on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year beginning on April 15, 2004. We can redeem for cash all, or part of, the Exchangeable Senior Debentures at any time subsequent to April 19, 2009 upon 30 days notice at the applicable redemption price as set forth in the indenture. Holders have the right to require us to repurchase the Exchangeable Senior Debentures on April 15, 2010, April 15, 2014 and April 15, 2019 at the issue price. The Exchangeable Senior Debentures are exchangeable into shares of HMCs common stock at a rate of 54.6448 shares for each $1,000 of principal amount of the debentures, or a total of approximately 27 million shares, which is equivalent to an initial exchange price of $18.30 per share our 38 Table of Contents common stock. The exchange rate may be adjusted under certain circumstances, including the payment of common dividends. Holders may exchange their Exchangeable Senior Debentures prior to maturity under certain conditions, including at any time at which the closing sale price of our common stock is more than 120% of the exchange price per share, or initially $21.89, for at least 20 of 30 trading days. The Exchangeable Senior Debentures and the common stock issuable upon exchange of the debentures have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold except to qualified institutional buyers, as defined. We have a shelf registration statement that is currently effective with respect to the resale of our common stock issuable upon exchange of the debentures. The following table summarizes our outstanding debt and scheduled amortization and maturities related to our senior notes, credit facility and Convertible Subordinated Debentures as of December 31, 2004 (in millions): Balance as of December 31, 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter 7 7/8% Series B senior notes, due 8/1/2008 $ 304 $ $ $ $ 305 $ $ 8 3/8% Series E senior notes, due 2/15/2006 300 300 9 1/4% Series G senior notes, due 10/1/2007 (1) 243 242 9 1/2% Series I senior notes, due 1/15/2007 (1) 468 450 7 1/8% Series K senior notes, due 11/1/2013 725 725 7% Series L senior notes, due 8/15/2012 346 350 Other senior notes (2) 13 6 7 Exchangeable Senior Debentures, due 4/15/2024 491 500 Total senior notes 2,890 300 698 305 1,582 Credit Facility, due 9/1/2008 Convertible Subordinated Debentures, due 12/2/2026 492 492 $ 3,382 $ $ 300 $ 698 $ 305 $ $ 2,074 (1) Balances at December 31, 2004 for the Series G and Series I senior notes include the fair value of interest rate swaps of approximately $1 million and $18 million, respectively. The interest payments under the Series G and Series I swaps are based on LIBOR plus 5.9% and 4.5%, respectively. (2) Other senior notes consist of two notes with an average interest rate of 9.7% and mature through 2012 and were issued under different indentures than our other senior notes. Convertible Subordinated Debentures As of December 31, 2004, Host Marriott Financial Trust (the Trust), a wholly owned subsidiary, has 9.5 million shares of 6 3/4% convertible quarterly income preferred securities outstanding (the Convertible Preferred Securities), with a liquidation preference of $50 per share (for a total liquidation amount of $475 million). The Convertible Preferred Securities represent an undivided beneficial interest in the assets of the Trust. The payment of distributions by the Trust, payments on liquidation of the Trust, or the redemption of the Convertible Preferred Securities are guaranteed by us. This guarantee, when taken together with our obligations under the indenture pursuant to which the 6 3/4% convertible subordinated debentures due December 2026 (the Convertible Subordinated Debentures) were issued, provides a full and unconditional guarantee of amounts due on the Convertible Preferred Securities. Proceeds from the issuance of the Convertible Preferred Securities were invested in Convertible Subordinated Debentures issued by HMC. The Trust exists solely to issue the Convertible Preferred Securities and its own common securities and invest the proceeds therefrom in the Debentures, which is its sole asset. The Trust is wholly owned and has no independent operations. Each of the Convertible Preferred Securities and the related debentures are convertible at the option of the holder into shares of HMC common stock at the rate of 3.2537 shares per Convertible Preferred Security for a 39 Table of Contents total of approximately 31 million shares (equivalent to a conversion price of $15.367 per share of our common stock). The Trust will only convert Convertible Subordinated Debentures pursuant to a notice of conversion by a holder of Convertible Preferred Securities. The conversion ratio and price have been adjusted to reflect certain transactions including our conversion to a REIT. During 2004 and 2003, no shares were converted to common stock. Holders of the Convertible Preferred Securities are entitled to receive preferential cumulative cash distributions at an annual rate of 6 3/4% payable quarterly in arrears. The distribution rate and the distribution and other payment dates for the Convertible Preferred Securities correspond to the interest rate and interest and other payment dates on the Convertible Subordinated Debentures. We may defer interest payments on the Convertible Subordinated Debentures for a period not to exceed 20 consecutive quarters. If interest payments on the Convertible Subordinated Debentures are deferred, so too are payments on the Convertible Preferred Securities. Under this circumstance, we will not be permitted to declare or pay any cash distributions with respect to our capital stock or debt securities that rank pari passu with or junior to the Convertible Subordinated Debentures. The Convertible Preferred Securities are redeemable at the Trusts option upon any redemption by us of the Convertible Subordinated Debentures after December 2, 1999. During 2005, the Convertible Preferred Securities can be redeemed at a price equal to 100.675% of the liquidation preference, or $50.3375 per security. Upon repayment at maturity or as a result of the acceleration of the Convertible Subordinated Debentures upon the occurrence of a default, the Convertible Preferred Securities are subject to mandatory redemption. The Convertible Preferred Securities, as a potentially dilutive security, are evaluated in the calculation of earning per share and FFO per diluted share. The securities were dilutive for FFO per diluted share for both fourth quarter 2004 and 2003, but not for full year. We believe that the securities will be dilutive in 2005 to the extent our FFO per diluted share exceeds approximately $1.04. In connection with the REIT conversion, Host LP assumed primary liability for repayment of the Convertible Subordinated Debentures underlying the Convertible Preferred Securities. Upon conversion by a Convertible Preferred Securities holder, HMC will issue shares of its common stock, which will be delivered to such holder. Upon the issuance of such shares by HMC, Host LP will issue to HMC a number of OP units equal to the number of shares of HMC common stock issued in exchange for the Convertible Subordinated Debentures. In accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of the Variable Interest Entities, we no longer consolidate the Trust effective January 1, 2004. As a result, we recognize the $492 million in Convertible Subordinated Debentures issued by the Trust as debt, eliminating the $475 million of Convertible Preferred Securities previously classified in the mezzanine section of our balance sheet and recognize, as an equity investment, the $17 million invested in the Trust. Additionally, we classify the related dividend payments as interest expense. Credit Facility General. On September 10, 2004, we entered into an amended and restated credit facility. The credit facility replaces our prior credit facility and provides aggregate revolving loan commitments in the amount of $575 million. The credit facility also includes sub commitments for the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount of $10 million and loans to certain of our Canadian subsidiaries in Canadian Dollars in an aggregate amount of $150 million. The credit facility has an initial scheduled maturity in September 2008. We have an option to extend the maturity for an additional year if certain conditions are met at the time of the initial scheduled maturity. We also have the option to increase the amount of the credit facility by up to $100 million to the extent that any one or more lenders, whether or not currently party to the credit facility, commits to be a lender for such amount. We have not made any borrowings under the credit facility. As with the prior facility, the debt under the amended credit facility is guaranteed by certain of our existing subsidiaries and is currently secured by pledges of equity interests in many of our subsidiaries. The guarantees and pledges ratably benefit our credit facility as well as the notes outstanding under our senior notes indenture, 40 Table of Contents certain other senior debt, and interest rate swap agreements and other hedging agreements with lenders that are parties to the credit facility. As with the prior facility, the pledges are permitted to be released in the event that our leverage ratio falls below 6.0x for two consecutive fiscal quarters. Dual Tranche Structure. Unlike our prior facility, the revolving loan commitment under the amended credit facility is divided into two separate tranches: (1) a Revolving Facility A tranche of $385 million and (2) a Revolving Facility B tranche of $190 million. Subject to compliance with the facilitys financial covenants, amounts available for borrowing under Revolving Facility A vary depending on our leverage ratio, with $385 million being available when our leverage ratio is less than 6.5x, $300 million being available when our leverage ratio equals or exceeds 6.5x but is less than 6.75x, $150 million being available when our leverage ratio equals or exceeds 6.75x but is less than 7.0x, and no amounts being available when our leverage ratio equals or exceeds 7.0x. By contrast, the entire amount of Revolving Facility B is available for borrowing at any time that our unsecured interest coverage ratio equals or exceeds 1.5x and our leverage ratio does not exceed levels ranging from 7.5x to 7.0x. Specifically, prior to the end of our third quarter of 2007, we are permitted to make borrowings and maintain amounts outstanding under Revolving Facility B so long as our leverage ratio is not in excess of 7.5x; the maximum leverage ratio applicable to Revolving Facility B is then reduced to 7.25x from the end of the third quarter of 2007 until the day prior to end of our third quarter of 2008, and is reduced to 7.0x thereafter. Financial Covenants. We are subject to different financial covenants depending on whether amounts are borrowed under Revolving Facility A or Revolving Facility B, and we are permitted to convert amounts borrowed under either tranche into amounts borrowed under the other tranche. While the financial covenants applicable under Revolving Facility A are generally comparable to those contained in our prior facility (including covenants for leverage, fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage), the financial covenants applicable to Revolving Facility B are limited to leverage and unsecured interest coverage, and are set at less restrictive levels than the corresponding covenants applicable to Revolving Facility A. As a result of this structure, we have gained flexibility to make and maintain borrowings in circumstances where adverse changes to our financial condition could have prohibited the maintenance of borrowings under the prior facility. The financial covenants for the Revolving Facility A and Revolving Facility B do not apply when there are no borrowings under the respective tranche. Hence, so long as there are no amounts outstanding we are not in default of the credit facility if we do not satisfy the financial covenants and we do not lose the potential to draw under the amended credit facility in the future if we were ever to come back into compliance with the financial covenants. We are in compliance with all our covenants as of December 31, 2004. The following table summarizes the financial tests contained in the credit facility through 2006: Facility A Financial Covenant Levels Quarter Minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio Maximum leverage ratio Minimum fixed chargecoverage ratio Third Quarter 2004 to Fourth Quarter 2005 1.50 7.00 1.00 First Quarter 2006 to Fourth Quarter 2006 1.50 6.75 1.00 Facility B Financial Covenant Levels Quarter Minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio Maximum leverage ratio Third Quarter 2004 to Fourth Quarter 2005 1.50 7.50 First Quarter 2006 to Fourth Quarter 2006 1.50 7.50 41 Table of Contents Interest and Fees. We pay interest on borrowings under the Revolving Facility A at floating interest rates plus a margin (which, in the case of LIBOR based borrowings, ranges from 2.00% to 3.00%) that is set with reference to our leverage ratio. Borrowings under Revolving Facility B are subject to a margin that is 0.5% higher than the corresponding margin applicable to Revolving Facility A borrowings and .75% higher when our leverage ratio is greater than 7.0x. As with the prior facility, to the extent that amounts under the amended credit facility remain unused, we pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unused portion of the loan commitment. Other Covenants. Our amended credit facility imposes restrictions on customary matters that were also restricted in our prior facility, such as limitations on capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments, the incurrence of debt and the payment of dividends. While such restrictions are generally similar to those contained in our prior facility, we have modified certain covenants to become less restrictive at any time that our leverage ratio falls below 6.0x. In particular, at any time that our leverage ratio is below 6.0x, we will not be subject to limitations on capital expenditures, and the limitations on acquisitions, investments and dividends will be replaced by the generally less restrictive corresponding covenants in our senior notes indenture. Mortgage Debt General. As of December 31, 2004, we have 28 assets that are secured by mortgage debt. Substantially all of our mortgage debt is recourse solely to specific assets except in instances of fraud, misapplication of funds and other customary recourse provisions. Currently, secured debt represents approximately 37% of our total debt and has an average interest rate of 7.7% and an average maturity of 4.8 years. Over time, we expect to reduce the amount of our secured debt as a percentage of our total debt. We may refinance secured debt with other financing alternatives, such as senior notes, although there can be no assurances that we will achieve this objective. As a result of the decline in operations of our properties in 2002 and 2003, restrictive covenants on eight of our hotel properties secured by a $571 million mortgage loan, which we refer to as the CMBS Loan, were triggered. These hotel properties are, the New York Marriott Marquis, the San Francisco Airport Hyatt Regency, the Cambridge Hyatt Regency the Reston Hyatt Regency, the Boston Hyatt Regency, the Drake Hotel New York, the Westin Buckhead Atlanta, and the Swiss&ocirc;tel Chicago, which we refer to as the CMBS Portfolio. The CMBS Loan contains a provision that requires the mortgage servicer to retain certain excess cash flow from the CMBS Portfolio after payment of debt service (approximately $64 million) if net cash flow after payment of taxes, insurance, ground rent and reserves for furniture, fixtures and equipment for the trailing twelve months declines below $96 million. This provision was triggered beginning in the third quarter of 2002 and will remain in effect until the CMBS Portfolio generates the necessary minimum cash flow for two consecutive quarters, at which point, the cash that has been escrowed will be returned to us. As of December 31, 2004, approximately $37 million of cash has been escrowed. We do not expect cash flows from the CMBS Portfolio to be at the level required to trigger the release of the escrow until 2006. Therefore, we anticipate that additional cash of $25 million will be escrowed in 2005. On July 12, 2002, we modified the terms of the mortgage debt secured by our four Canadian properties. Under the terms of this modification, we agreed to escrow the excess cash flow from these hotels on a retroactive basis effective December 29, 2001. In April 2003, approximately $7 million of the cash escrowed in accordance with the loan was applied to the outstanding balance of the indebtedness and approximately $2 million was released to us. In July 2003, we entered into an agreement with the lenders to further modify certain covenants so that we would not be required to make additional prepayments at that time. The terms of the modification required us to provide $10 million of cash collateral and pay an additional 25 basis points of interest on the loan. On December 29, 2003, we made a partial repayment of $32 million. In conjunction with the repayment, one of the hotels and the $10 million was released from the collateral in 2003. On December 15, 2004, we repaid an additional $34 million repayment and an additional hotel was released from the collateral. There were no amounts escrowed at December 31, 2003. As of December 31, 2004, approximately $7 million was escrowed. The properties obtained the required level of operations so that the covenant restrictions were lifted and the $7 million escrow will be released in the first quarter of 2005. 42 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our outstanding debt and scheduled amortization and maturities related to mortgage and other debt as of December 31, 2004 (in millions): Balance as of December 31, 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Mortgage Debt CMBS Loan, 7.54%, due 8/1/2009 (1) $ 571 $ 24 $ 24 $ 26 $ 28 $ 469 $ Orlando Marriott World Center, 7.48%, due 1/1/2008 222 4 4 4 210 San Diego Marriott, 8.45%, due 7/1/2009 185 2 3 3 3 174 Host Hotel Properties II, 8.22%, due 10/11/2017 (2) (7) 182 8 9 8 7 7 143 Atlanta Marriott Marquis, 7.4%, due 2/11/2023 (8) 145 4 4 4 4 5 124 Ritz Carlton Naples & Buckhead, 9.00%, due 10/1/2006 143 9 134 Desert Springs Marriott Resort and Spa, 7.8%, due 12/11/2022 (8) 91 2 3 3 3 3 77 Harbor Beach Marriott, 8.58%, due 3/1/2007 91 1 2 88 Boston Copley Marriott, 8.39%, due 6/1/2006 89 4 85 JW Marriott Washington, D.C., 4.5%, due 9/15/2006 (3) 88 88 Philadelphia Convention Center, 8.49%, due 4/1/2009 81 2 2 2 2 73 Other mortgage debt (4) 155 7 24 37 37 22 28 Total mortgage debt (5) 2,043 67 382 175 294 753 372 Other Debt Philadelphia Airport industrial revenue bonds, 7 3/4%, due 12/1/2017 40 40 Capital leases and other (6) 58 6 3 3 46 Total other debt 98 6 3 3 86 Total mortgage and other debt $ 2,141 $ 73 $ 385 $ 178 $ 294 $ 753 $ 458 (1) This mortgage debt is secured by eight hotel properties and has certain restrictive covenants. (2) This mortgage debt is secured by first mortgages on three hotels, as well as a pledge of our limited partnership interest in the Santa Clara Partnership. (3) This floating rate mortgage is based on LIBOR plus 2.10%. The rate shown is as of December 31, 2004. Also, this mortgage has an interest rate cap derivative with a maximum rate of 8.1%. (4) Other mortgage debt consists of mortgage debt amounts that are less than $40 million, have an average interest rate of 7.6% at December 31, 2004 and mature through 2017. (5) Total mortgage debt excludes approximately $20 million of mortgage debt, related to the Hartford Marriott Farmington, that was reclassified as liabilities associated with assets held for sale at December 31, 2004. The hotel was sold on January 6, 2005. (6) Capital leases and other consists of five loans with an average interest rate of 7.36% and mature through 2016 as well as capital leases with varying interest rates and maturity dates. (7) Beginning in 2007, the interest rate on this loan increases a minimum of 200 basis points and all excess cash (as defined in the loan agreement) generated by the partnership is applied to principal; however, the loan can be repaid without a premium or penalty on that date. The amortization presented in this table is the minimum principal payment considering the increase in interest rate, but does not include additional principal payments based on excess cash flow. (8) Beginning in 2010, the interest rate on these loans increases a minimum of 200 basis points and all excess cash (as defined in the loan agreement) generated by the partnerships that own these two properties is applied to principal; however, the loans can be repaid without a premium or penalty on that date. The amortization presented is the minimum principal payment considering the increase in interest rate, but does not include additional principal payments based on excess cash flow. 43 Table of Contents Credit Ratings Currently, we have $2.9 billion of senior notes outstanding and $337 million of HMC preferred stock that are rated by Moodys Investors Service and Standard & Poors. Standard and Poors rating on our senior debt is B+ and the rating on HMCs preferred stock is CCC+. Moodys has a Ba3 rating on our senior debt and a B3 rating on HMCs preferred stock. While we have no senior note maturities until 2006, if our operations or our credit ratios were to decline, the ratings on our securities could be reduced. If we were unable to subsequently improve our credit ratings, our cost to issue additional senior notes, either in connection with a refinancing or otherwise, or to issue additional preferred stock would likely increase. HMC Dividend Policy HMC is required to distribute to stockholders at least 90% of its taxable income in order to qualify as a REIT, including taxable income recognized for tax purposes but with regard to which we do not receive corresponding cash. Funds used by HMC to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock are provided through distributions from Host LP. For every share of common and preferred stock of HMC, Host LP has issued to HMC a corresponding common OP unit and preferred OP unit. As of February 28, 2005, HMC is the owner of substantially all of the preferred OP units and approximately 94% of the common OP units. The remaining 6% of the common OP units are held by various third party limited partners. As a result of the minority position in Host LP common OP units, these holders share, on a pro rata basis, in amounts being distributed by Host LP. As a general rule, when HMC pays a common or preferred dividend, Host LP pays an equivalent per unit distribution on all common or corresponding preferred OP units. For example, if HMC paid a five cent per share dividend on its common stock, it would be based on payment of a five cent per unit distribution by Host LP to HMC as well as other common OP unit holders. For these reasons, investors should also take into account the 6% minority position in Host LP and the requirement that they share pro rata in distributions from Host LP, when analyzing dividend payments by HMC to its stockholders. HMCs current policy on common dividends is generally to distribute at least 100% of its taxable income, unless otherwise contractually restricted. HMC currently intends to continue paying dividends on its preferred stock, regardless of the amount of taxable income, unless similarly contractually restricted. While we are not currently restricted in our ability to pay dividends, during the second half of 2002 and through the first quarter of 2004 we were limited in our ability to pay dividends, except to the extent necessary to maintain HMCs REIT status. (See Risk Factors Our ability to pay dividends may be limited or prohibited by the terms of our indebtedness for a discussion of those restrictions). HMC did not pay a dividend on its common stock (and, correspondingly, Host LP did not pay distributions on its common OP units) in 2002 and 2003. As a result of the improvements in operations, on December 20, 2004, we paid a $0.05 per share dividend on HMCs common stock, representing primarily the final distribution of 2003 taxable income. HMC intends to reinstate a quarterly dividend on HMCs common stock beginning with the first quarter of 2005 dividend. We announced that we believe the first quarter dividend will be approximately $.07 to $.09 per share. The amount of any common distribution will be determined by HMCs Board of Directors. Investments in Affiliates We have made investments in certain ventures which we do not consolidate and, accordingly, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting in accordance with our accounting policies as described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Currently, we and an affiliate of Marriott International each own a 50% interest in CBM Joint Venture, which owns, through two limited partnerships, 120 Courtyard by Marriott properties totaling 17,550 rooms. The joint venture has approximately $1,071 million of assets and $898 million of debt. This debt consists of approximately $519 million of first mortgage loans secured by 119 of the 120 properties owned by the partnerships, approximately $129 million of senior notes secured by the ownership interest in one partnership and mezzanine debt in the amount of $250 million. The lender of the mezzanine debt is an affiliate of Marriott International. None of the debt is recourse to, or guaranteed by, us or any of our 44 Table of Contents subsidiaries. RevPAR at the partnerships Courtyard hotels increased 6.3% year to date with an average occupancy increase of 2.0 percentage points and an increase in average room rate of 3.2%. We have not received any cash distributions from this partnership since 2001. On December 15, 2004, we announced the pending sale of our interest in CBM Joint Venture (see Sources and Uses of Cash for more information). As described previously, we deconsolidated the Trust which issued the Convertible Preferred Securities in accordance with FIN 46R. This resulted in our recognizing the $492 million in Convertible Subordinated Debentures issued by the Trust as debt, eliminating the $475 million of Convertible Preferred Securities previously classified in the mezzanine section of our balance sheet and recognizing, as an equity investment, the $17 million invested in the Trust. Additionally, we have classified the related interest payments as interest expense. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We are party to various transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements with unconsolidated entities (which we refer to as off balance sheet arrangements) under which we have certain contingent liabilities and guarantees. As of December 31, 2004, we are party to the following material off balance sheet arrangements: Tax Sharing Arrangements. Under tax sharing agreements with former affiliated companies (such as Marriott International, Host Marriott Services Corporation and Crestline), we are obligated to pay certain taxes (Federal, state, local and foreign, including any related interest and penalties) relating to periods in which the companies were affiliated with us. For example, a taxing authority could adjust an item deducted by a former affiliate during the period that this former affiliate was owned by us. This adjustment could produce a material tax liability that we may be obligated to pay under the tax sharing agreement. In addition, under the partnership agreement between HMC and Host LP, Host LP is obligated to pay certain taxes (Federal, state, local and foreign, including any related interest and penalties) incurred by HMC, as well as any liabilities the IRS successfully may assert against HMC. We do not expect any amounts paid under the tax sharing arrangement to be material. Tax Indemnification Agreements. For reasons relating to tax considerations of the former and current owners of five hotels, we have agreed to restrictions on selling the hotels, or repaying or refinancing the mortgage debt for varying periods depending on the hotel. These agreements require that we indemnify the owners for their tax consequences resulting from our selling the hotel or refinancing the mortgage debt during the period under the agreement. We have also agreed not to sell more than 50% of the original allocated value attributable to the former owners of a portfolio of 11 additional hotels, or to take other actions that would result in the recognition and allocation of gain to the former owners of such hotels for income tax purposes. Because the timing of these potential transactions is within our control, we believe that the likelihood of any material indemnification to be remote and therefore not material to our financial statements. On average, these restrictions will generally expire, or cease to be significant, in 2009. Guarantees. We have certain guarantees, which consist of commitments we have made to third parties for leases or debt, that are not on our books due to various dispositions, spin offs and contractual arrangements, but that we have agreed to pay in the event of certain circumstances including default by an unrelated party. We consider the likelihood of any material payments under these guarantees to be remote. The largest guarantees (by dollar amount) are listed below: We remain contingently liable for rental payments on certain divested non lodging properties. These primarily represent divested restaurants that were sold subject to our guarantee of the future rental payments. The aggregate amount of these future rental payments is approximately $33 million as of December 31, 2004. 45 Table of Contents In 1997, we owned Leisure Park Venture Limited Partnership, which owns and operates a senior living facility. We spun off the partnership as part of Crestline in the REIT conversion, but we remain obligated under a guarantee of interest and principal with regard to $14.7 million of municipal bonds issued by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority through their maturity in 2027. However, to the extent we are required to make any payments under the guarantee, we have been indemnified by Crestline, who, in turn, is indemnified by the current owner of the facility. In connection with the sale of three hotels in the fourth quarter of 2004 and January 2005, we remain contingently liable for the amounts due under the respective ground leases. The future minimum lease payments are approximately $20 million through the full term of the leases, including renewal options. We believe that any liability related to these ground leases is remote, and in each case, we have been indemnified by the purchaser of the hotel. Information on other guarantees and other off balance sheet arrangements may be found in Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements. Contractual Obligations The table below summarizes our obligations for principal and estimated interest payments on our debt, future minimum lease payments on our operating and capital leases and projected capital expenditures, each as of December 31, 2004 (in millions): Payments due by period Total Lessthan 1 year 1 to 3years 3 to 5years Morethan 5 years Long term debt obligations(1)(2) $ 7,958 $ 465 $ 2,208 $ 1,780 $ 3,505 Capital lease obligations(3) 11 4 7 Operating lease obligations(4) 1,809 111 214 236 1,248 Purchase obligations(5) 148 148 Deferred management fees(6) 38 38 Total $ 9,964 $ 728 $ 2,429 $ 2,016 $ 4,791 (1) The amounts shown include amortization of principal, debt maturities and estimated interest payments. Interest payments have been included in the long term debt obligations based on the weighted average interest rate for both fixed and variable debt. For variable rate debt, we have used the applicable percentage interest rate as of December 31, 2004. (2) Long term debt obligations excludes $20 million of mortgage debt, related to the Hartford Marriott Farmington, that was classified as liabilities associated with assets held for sale at December 31, 2004. The hotel was sold on January 6, 2005. (3) Future minimum lease payments have not been reduced by aggregate minimum sublease rentals from restaurants of $.2 million, payable to us under non cancelable subleases. The lease payments also include interest payable of $2 million. (4) Future minimum lease payments have not been reduced by aggregate minimum sublease rentals from restaurants and the HPT subleases of $27 million and $550 million, respectively, payable to us under non cancelable subleases. (5) Our only purchase obligations consist of commitments for capital expenditures at our hotels. Under our contracts, we have the ability to defer some of these expenditures into later years and some of the current year amount reflects prior year contracts that were deferred or not completed. See Capital Expenditures. (6) Under terms of our management agreements, we have deferred payment of management fees to our hotel managers for some of our properties that have not achieved the required income thresholds for payment of owners priority to us. The timing of the payments, if any, is based on future operations, the termination of the management agreement or sale of the hotel and is therefore not determinable. Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different, application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future 46 Table of Contents uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. We evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to the impairment of long lived assets, on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. All of our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. The following represent certain critical accounting policies that require us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates: Impairment testing. We are required by GAAP to record an impairment charge when we believe that one or more of our hotels has been impaired, whereby, future undiscounted cash flows for the hotel would be less than the net book value of the hotel. For impaired assets, we record an impairment charge when a propertys fair value less selling costs is less than its net book value. We test for impairment in several situations, including when current or projected cash flows are less than historical cash flows, when it becomes more likely than not that a hotel will be sold before the end of its previously estimated useful life, as well as whenever an asset is classified as held for sale or events or changes in circumstances indicate that a hotels net book value may not be recoverable. In the evaluation of the impairment of our hotels, we make many assumptions and estimates, including: projected cash flows, holding period, expected useful life future capital expenditures fair values, including consideration of capitalization rates, discount rates and comparable selling prices. Changes in these estimates, assumptions, future changes in economic conditions, or property level results could require us to record additional impairment charges, which would be reflected in operations in the future. Classification of Assets as Held for Sale. We classify properties that we are actively marketing as held for sale when all of the following conditions are met: our Board of Directors has approved the sale (to the extent the dollar magnitude of the sale requires Board approval); a binding agreement to purchase the property has been signed; the buyer has committed a significant amount of non refundable cash; and no significant financing contingencies exist which could cause the transaction not to be completed in a timely manner. To the extent a property is classified as held for sale and its fair value less selling costs is lower than the net book value of the property, we will record an impairment loss. See the discussion above concerning the use of estimates and judgments in determining fair values for impairment tests. Depreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation expense is based on the estimated useful life of our assets and amortization expense for leasehold improvements is the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related assets. The lives of the assets are based on a number of assumptions including cost and timing of capital expenditures to maintain and refurbish the assets, as well as specific market and economic conditions. While management believes its estimates are reasonable, a change in the estimated lives could affect depreciation expense and net income (loss) or the gain or loss on the sale of any of our hotels. Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets. We have approximately $111 million, net of a valuation allowance of $14 million, in consolidated deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2004. The objective of financial accounting and reporting standards for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or 47 Table of Contents refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in a companys financial statements or tax returns. We have considered various factors, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future projected taxable income and tax planning strategies in determining a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets, and we believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the $111 million in deferred tax assets in the future. When a determination is made that all, or a portion, of the deferred tax assets may not be realized, an increase in income tax expense would be recorded in that period. Valuation of Foreign Currency and Derivative Contracts. We have two interest rate swap agreements outstanding as of December 31, 2004. Our interest rate swap agreements with a fair market value of $19 million as of December 31, 2004 have been designated as fair value hedges, as described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. While we intend to continue to meet the conditions for hedge accounting, if a particular interest rate swap does not qualify as highly effective, any change in the fair value of the derivative used as a hedge would be reflected in current earnings. Should any change in management strategy, or any other circumstance, cause an existing highly effective hedge to become ineffective, the accumulated loss or gain in the value of the derivative instrument since its inception may be reclassified from the stockholders equity section of the balance sheet to current net income (loss). We also have two interest rate cap agreements that are fair valued each quarter and the increase or decrease in fair value is recorded in net income (loss). We also have several foreign currency forward exchange contracts that we previously used to hedge the mortgage loan on our Canadian properties. The hedge was deemed ineffective for accounting purposes in the fourth quarter of 2003. Accordingly, the change in fair value of these foreign currency forward exchange contracts is recorded in net income (loss) on the consolidated statements of operations. See the discussion in Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We estimate the fair value of all of these instruments through the use of third party valuations, which utilize the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future cash receipts and the discounted expected cash payments. The variable cash flow streams are based on an expectation of future interest and exchange rates derived from observed market interest and exchange rate curves. The values of these instruments will change over time as cash receipts and payments are made and as market conditions change. Any event that impacts the level of actual and expected future interest or exchange rates will impact our valuations. The fair value of our existing foreign currency and derivatives is likely to fluctuate materially from year to year based on changing levels of interest and exchange rates and shortening terms to maturity. Consolidation Policies. Judgment is required with respect to the consolidation of partnership and joint venture entities in the evaluation of control, including assessment of the importance of rights and privileges of the partners based on voting rights, as well as financial interests that are not controllable through voting interests. Currently, we have investments in entities that in the aggregate own 123 hotel properties and other investments which we record using the equity method of accounting. These entities are considered to be voting interest entities. The debt on these investments is non recourse to the company and the effect of their operations on our results of operations is not material. While we do not believe we are required to consolidate any of our current partnerships or joint ventures, if we were required to do so, then all of the results of operations and the assets and liabilities would be included in our financial statements. For further detail on our unconsolidated entities see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. Application of New Accounting Standards During November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) ratified the Emerging Issues Task Force on EITF Issue No. 04 8, The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share. EITF 04 8 requires contingently convertible debt instruments to be included in diluted earnings per share, if dilutive, regardless of whether a market price contingency for the conversion of the debt into common shares or any other contingent factor has been met. Prior to this consensus, such instruments were excluded from 48 Table of Contents the calculation of the diluted earnings per share until one or more of the contingencies were met. EITF 04 8 is effective for reporting periods ending after December 15, 2004, and does require restatement of prior period earnings per share amounts. As a result, we will include the common shares that are issuable from the conversion of the Exchangeable Senior Debentures, if dilutive, in our diluted earnings (loss) per share. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment, (FAS 123R), which requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements. The statement requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). That cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). No compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service. Employee share purchase plans will not result in recognition of compensation cost if certain conditions are met; those conditions are much the same as the related conditions in FAS 123. The provisions of FAS 123R are effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005. The adoption of this standard in 2005 will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. Reporting Periods Reporting Periods for Consolidated Statement of Operations The results we report are based on results of our hotels reported to us by our hotel managers. Our hotel managers use different reporting periods. Marriott International, the manager of the majority of our properties, uses a year ending on the Friday closest to December 31 and reports twelve weeks of operations for the first three quarters and sixteen or seventeen weeks for the fourth quarter of the year for its Marriott managed hotels. In contrast, other managers of our hotels, such as Hyatt, report results on a monthly basis. HMC, as a REIT, is required by tax laws to report results on a calendar year. As a result, we elected to adopt the reporting periods used by Marriott International modified so that our fiscal year always ends on December 31 to comply with REIT rules. Our first three quarters of operations end on the same day as Marriott International but our fourth quarter ends on December 31. Two consequences of the reporting cycle we have adopted are: (1) quarterly start dates will usually differ between years, except for the first quarter which always commences on January 1, and (2) our first and fourth quarters of operations and year to date operations may not include the same number of days as reflected in prior years. For example, set forth below are the quarterly start and end dates for 2004 and 2003. Note that the second and third quarters of 2004 and 2003 both reflect twelve weeks of operations. In contrast, the first and fourth quarters reflect differing days of operations. 2005 2004 (1) 2003 Start End Dates No. ofDays Start End Dates No. ofDays Start End Dates No. ofDays First Quarter January 1 March 25 84 January 1 March 26 86 January 1 March 28 87 Second Quarter March 26 June 17 84 March 27 June 18 84 March 29 June 20 84 Third Quarter June 18 September 9 84 June 19 September 10 84 June 21 September 12 84 Fourth Quarter September 10 December 31 113 September 11 December 31 112 September 13 December 31, 110 (1) Reflects an additional day in February for the leap year. While the reporting calendar we adopted is more closely aligned with the reporting calendar used by the manager of a majority of our properties, one final consequence of our calendar is we are unable to report the month of operations that ends after our fiscal quarter end until the following quarter because our hotel managers using a monthly reporting period do not make mid month results available to us. Hence, the month of operation that ends after our fiscal quarter end is included in our quarterly results of operations in the following quarter for those hotel managers (covering approximately one fourth of our full service hotels). As a result, our quarterly 49 Table of Contents results of operations include results from hotel managers reporting results on a monthly basis as follows: first quarter (January, February), second quarter (March to May), third quarter (June to August) and fourth quarter (September to December). While this does not affect full year results, it does affect the reporting of quarterly results. Reporting Periods for Hotel Operating Statistics and Comparable Hotel Results In contrast to the reporting periods for our consolidated statement of operations, our hotel operating statistics (i.e., RevPAR, average daily rate and average occupancy) and our comparable hotel results are always reported based on the reporting cycle used by Marriott International for our Marriott managed hotels. This facilitates year to year comparisons, as each reporting period will be comprised of the same number of days of operations as in the prior year (except in the case of fourth quarters comprised of seventeen weeks (such as fiscal year 2002) versus sixteen weeks). This means, however, that the reporting periods we use for hotel operating statistics and our comparable hotel results may differ slightly from the reporting periods used for our statements of operations for the first and fourth quarters and the full year. Set forth below are the quarterly start and end dates for 2004 and 2003 that are used for our hotel operating statistics and comparable hotel results reported herein. Results from hotel managers reporting on a monthly basis are included in our operating statistics and comparable hotel results consistent with their reporting in our consolidated statement of operations. Hotel Result Reporting Periods for Operating Statistics and Comparable Hotel Results for Marriott Managed Properties 2005 2004 2003 Start End Dates No. ofDays Start End Dates No. ofDays Start End Dates No. ofDays First Quarter January 1 March 25 84 January 3 March 26 84 January 4 March 28 84 Second Quarter March 26 June 17 84 March 27 June 18 84 March 29 June 20 84 Third Quarter June 18 September 9 84 June 19 September 10 84 June 21 September 12 84 Fourth Quarter September 10 December 30 112 September 11 December 31 112 September 13 January 2, 2004 112 Non GAAP Financial Measures We use certain non GAAP financial measures, which are measures of our historical financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, within the meaning of applicable SEC rules. They are as follows: (i) Funds From Operations (FFO) per diluted share, and (ii) Comparable Hotel Operating Results. The following discussion defines these terms and presents why we believe they are useful measures of our performance. FFO Per Diluted Share We present FFO per diluted share as a non GAAP measure of our performance in addition to our earnings per share (calculated in accordance with GAAP). We calculate FFO per diluted share for a given operating period as our FFO (defined as set forth below) for such period divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) defines FFO as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO is presented on a per share basis after making adjustments for the effects of dilutive securities, including the payment of preferred stock dividends, in accordance with NAREIT guidelines. We believe that FFO per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that presentation of FFO per diluted share, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of earnings per 50 Table of Contents share, provides beneficial information to investors. By excluding the effect of real estate depreciation, amortization and gains and losses from sales of real estate, all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance, we believe that such measure can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other REITs, even though FFO per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted by NAREIT in its April 2002 White Paper on Funds From Operations, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. For these reasons, NAREIT adopted the definition of FFO in order to promote an industry wide measure of REIT operating performance. We calculate FFO per diluted share, in accordance with standards established by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies who do not use the NAREIT definition of FFO or calculate FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT guidance. In addition, although FFO per diluted share is a useful measure when comparing our results to other REITs, it may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non REITs. This information should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating profit, cash from operations, or any other operating performance measure prescribed by GAAP. Cash expenditures for various long term assets (such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures) and other items have been and will be incurred and are not reflected in the FFO per diluted share presentations. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows include depreciation, capital expenditures and other excluded items, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance, as well as the usefulness of our non GAAP financial measures. Additionally, FFO per diluted share should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. In addition, FFO per diluted share does not measure, and should not be used as a measure of, amounts that accrue directly to stockholders benefit. 51 Table of Contents The following table provides a reconciliation of net income (loss) available to common stockholders per share to FFO per diluted share (in millions, except per share amounts): Reconciliation of Net Loss Available to Common Stockholders to Funds From Operations per Diluted Share Year ended December 31, 2004 2003 Income(Loss) Shares Per ShareAmount Income(Loss) Shares Per ShareAmount Net loss available to common stockholders $ (41 ) 337.2 $ (.12 ) $ (21 ) 281.0 $ (.07 ) Adjustments: Gain on the disposition of the World Trade Center hotel (56 ) (.20 ) Gain on dispositions, net (59 ) (.18 ) (9 ) (.04 ) Amortization of deferred gains (4 ) (.01 ) (4 ) (.01 ) Depreciation and amortization 364 1.08 375 1.33 Partnership adjustments 21 .06 24 .08 FFO of minority partners of Host LP (a) (18 ) (.05 ) (26 ) (.09 ) Adjustments for dilutive securities: Assuming distribution of common shares granted under the comprehensive stock plan less shares assumed purchased at average market price 3.0 (.01 ) 3.5 (.01 ) Assuming conversion of Convertible Subordinated Debentures Assuming conversion of Exchangeable Senior Debentures (b) 15 21.7 FFO per diluted share (c)(d) $ 278 361.9 $ .77 $ 283 284.5 $ .99 (a) Represents FFO attributable to the minority interest in Host LP. (b) EITF 04 08, The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share, became effective in the fourth quarter of 2004 and, as a result, the Exchangeable Senior Debentures are now included as a potentially dilutive security. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on EITF 04 8. (c) FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT is adjusted for the effects of dilutive securities. Dilutive securities may include shares granted under comprehensive stock plans, convertible debt securities, those preferred OP units held by minority partners and other minority interests that have the option to convert their limited partnership interest to common shares. No effect is shown for securities if they are anti dilutive. (d) The results for the periods presented were significantly affected by several transactions, the effect of which is shown in the tables below (in millions, except per share amounts): Year ended December 31, 2004 2003 Net Income(Loss) FFO Net Income(Loss) FFO Senior notes redemptions and debt prepayments (1) $ (59 ) $ (59 ) $ (36 ) $ (36 ) World Trade Center hotel insurance gain(2) 212 156 Loss on foreign currency forward contracts(3) (18 ) (18 ) Class A preferred stock redemption (4) (6 ) (6 ) Directors and officers insurance settlement(5) 7 7 Minority interest benefit (expense) (6) 4 4 (14 ) (10 ) Total $ (61 ) $ (61 ) $ 151 $ 99 Per diluted share $ (.18 ) $ (.17 ) $ .54 $ .34 52 Table of Contents (1) Represents call premiums and the acceleration of original issue discounts and deferred financing costs, as well as incremental interest during the call period for refinancings, included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. We recognized these costs in conjunction with the prepayment of senior notes and mortgages during the periods presented. (2) As a result of the New York Marriott World Trade Center hotel insurance settlement in the fourth quarter of 2003, we recorded a gain of approximately $212 million, which is comprised of $156 million in post 2003 business interruption proceeds and $56 million from the disposition of the hotel. See the previous discussion of non GAAP financial measures, which describes why we exclude the $56 million gain from FFO per diluted share. (3) During 2003, we made partial repayments of the Canadian mortgage debt, which resulted in certain of our forward currency hedge contracts being deemed ineffective for accounting purposes. (4) Represents the original issuance costs for the Class A preferred stock, which were required to be charged against net loss available to common stockholders in conjunction with the redemption of the Class A preferred stock in the third quarter of 2004, as well as the incremental dividends from the date of issuance of the Class E preferred units to the date of redemption of the Class A preferred stock. (5) During 2003, we recognized approximately $10 million of other income from the settlement of a claim that we brought against our directors and officers insurance carriers for reimbursement of defense costs and settlement payments incurred in resolving a series of related actions brought against us and Marriott International that arose from the sale of certain limited partnership units to investors prior to 1993. The effect on net loss and FFO is approximately $7 million due to income taxes on the proceeds. (6) Represents the portion of the above listed amounts attributable to minority partners in Host LP. Comparable Hotel Operating Results We present certain operating results for our full service hotels, such as hotel revenues, expenses, and adjusted operating profit, on a comparable hotel, or same store basis as supplemental information for investors. Our comparable hotel operating results present operating results for full service hotels owned during the entirety of the periods being compared without giving effect to any acquisitions or dispositions, significant property damage or large scale capital improvements incurred during these periods. We present these comparable hotel operating results by eliminating corporate level costs and expenses related to our capital structure, as well as depreciation and amortization. We eliminate corporate level costs and expenses to arrive at property level results because we believe property level results provide investors with more specific insight into the ongoing operating performance of our hotels and the effectiveness of management in running our business on a property level basis. We eliminate depreciation and amortization, because even though depreciation and amortization are property level expenses, these non cash expenses, which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets, implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted earlier, because real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. As a result of the elimination of corporate level costs and expenses and depreciation and amortization, the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues, expenses, or operating profit and these comparable hotel operating results should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations include such amounts, all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance. We present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides investors and management with useful information for evaluating the period to period performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel REITs and hotel owners. In particular, these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues and or expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at comparable hotels (which represent the vast majority of our portfolio) or from other factors, such as the effect of acquisitions or dispositions. While management believes that presentation of comparable hotel results is a same store supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance, this measure is not used to allocate resources or assess the operating performance of these hotels, as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on comparable portfolio hotel results. For these reasons, we believe that comparable hotel operating results, when combined with the presentation of GAAP operating profit, revenues and expenses, provide useful information to investors and management. 53 Table of Contents The following table presents certain operating results and statistics for our comparable hotels for the periods presented herein: Comparable Hotel Results (in millions, except hotel statistics) Year ended December 31, 2004 2003 Number of hotels 103 103 Number of rooms 52,063 52,183 Percent change in Comparable Hotel RevPAR 7.3 % Comparable hotel sales Room $ 2,045 $ 1,907 Food and beverage 1,102 1,043 Other 226 220 Comparable hotel sales (1) 3,373 3,170 Comparable hotel expenses Room 515 483 Food and beverage 823 784 Other 141 134 Management fees, ground rent and other costs 1,140 1,091 Comparable hotel expenses (2) 2,619 2,492 Comparable hotel adjusted operating profit 754 678 Non comparable hotel results, net (3) 83 26 Comparable hotels classified as held for sale (12 ) (11 ) Office building and limited service properties, net (4) 2 1 Other income 1 12 Depreciation and amortization (354 ) (347 ) Corporate and other expenses (67 ) (60 ) Operating profit $ 407 $ 299 (1) The reconciliation of total revenues per the consolidated statements of operations to the comparable hotel sales is as follows (in millions): Year ended December 31, 2004 2003 Revenues per the consolidated statements of operations $ 3,640 $ 3,288 Revenues of hotels held for sale 70 66 Non comparable hotel sales (292 ) (137 ) Hotel sales for the property for which we record rental income, net 47 46 Rental income for office buildings and limited service hotels (80 ) (75 ) Other income (1 ) (12 ) Adjustment for hotel sales for comparable hotels to reflect Marriotts fiscal year for Marriott managed hotels (11 ) (6 ) Comparable hotel sales $ 3,373 $ 3,170 (2) The reconciliation of operating costs per the consolidated statements of operations to the comparable hotel expenses is as follows (in millions): 54 Table of Contents Year ended December 31, 2004 2003 Operating costs and expenses per the consolidated statements of operations $ 3,233 $ 2,989 Operating costs of hotels held for sale 58 55 Non comparable hotel expenses (210 ) (112 ) Hotel expenses for the property for which we record rental income 47 46 Rent expense for office buildings and limited service hotels (78 ) (74 ) Adjustment for hotel expenses for comparable hotels to reflect Marriotts fiscal year for Marriott managed hotels (10 ) (5 ) Depreciation and amortization (354 ) (347 ) Corporate and other expenses (67 ) (60 ) Comparable hotel expenses $ 2,619 $ 2,492 (3) Non comparable hotel results, net, includes the following items: (i) the results of operations of our non comparable hotels whose operations are included in our consolidated statement of operations as continuing operations and (ii) the difference between the number of days of operations reflected in the comparable hotel results and the number of days of operations reflected in the consolidated statements of operations (see Reporting Periods for additional information). (4) Represents rental income less rental expense for limited service properties and office buildings. 55 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Interest Rate Sensitivity Our future income, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates. Market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. The majority of our outstanding debt has a fixed interest rate. We use some derivative financial instruments to manage, or hedge, interest rate risks related to our borrowings. The table below provides information about our derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates, including interest rate swaps and debt obligations. For debt obligations, the table presents scheduled maturities and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. For interest rate swaps, the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by expected (contractual) maturity dates. Weighted average interest rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve as of December 31, 2004. Notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract. Weighted average variable rates are presented in U.S. dollar equivalents, which is our reporting currency. The interest rate swaps and caps that we have entered into are strictly to hedge interest rate risk and not for trading purposes.

(2) Total debt excludes $20 million of mortgage debt, related to the Hartford Marriott Farmington, that was reclassified as liabilities associated with assets held for sale at December 31, 2004. The hotel was sold on January 6, 2005. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 85.5% of our debt bears interest at fixed rates. This debt structure largely mitigates the impact of changes in interest rates. We have some financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates, including our credit facility. The interest rate on our credit facility is based on a spread over LIBOR, ranging from 2.0% to 3.75%. There were no amounts outstanding on our credit facility at December 31, 2004. We expect the proportion of fixed rate debt in our capital structure to range from 70% to 85% of our total debt, although there can be no assurances that we will be able to achieve this result on terms acceptable to us. In furtherance of this objective, we have entered into three interest rate swaps effectively converting $692 million of fixed rate payments to floating rate payments based on a spread to LIBOR. On December 20, 2001, we entered into a 5 year interest rate swap agreement, which was effective on January 15, 2002 and matures in January 2007, effectively converting our Series I senior notes to floating rate 56 Table of Contents debt. Under the swap, we receive fixed rate payments of 9.5% and pay floating rate payments based on one month LIBOR plus 450 basis points on a $450 million notional amount, which is equal to the current amount of outstanding Series I senior notes. On August 21, 2003, we entered into two four year interest rate swap agreements, which mature October 2007, effectively converting our Series G senior notes to floating rate debt. Under the swaps, we receive fixed rate payments of 9.25% and we make floating rate payments based on six month LIBOR plus 590 basis points on a $242 million notional amount, which is equal to the current amount of outstanding Series G senior notes. We have designated the interest rate swaps as fair value hedges for both financial reporting and tax purposes and the amounts paid or received under the swap agreements will be recognized over the life of the agreement as an adjustment to interest expense. Changes in the fair value of the swap and the Series I senior notes and Series G senior notes, respectively, are reflected in the balance sheet as offsetting changes and have no income statement effect. The fair value of the Series I interest rate swap at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003 was $18 million and $34 million, respectively. The fair value of the Series G interest rate swaps at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003 was $1 million and $2 million, respectively. These amounts are included in the senior notes line item on our consolidated balance sheet. If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt and the above swap agreements decrease by 100 basis points, the decrease in interest expense would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately $7 million annually. If market rates of interest on the same variable rate debt and swap agreements increase by 100 basis points, the increase in interest expense would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $7 million annually. Exchange Rate Sensitivity As we have non U.S. operations (specifically, the ownership of hotels in Canada and Mexico), currency exchange risk arises as a normal part of our business. To manage the currency exchange risk applicable to ownership in non U.S. hotel, where possible, we may enter into forward or option contracts. The table below summarizes information on instruments and transactions that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rates, including foreign currency forward exchange agreements as of December 31, 2004. The foreign currency exchange agreements that we have entered into are strictly to hedge foreign currency risk and not for trading purposes. For foreign currency forward exchange agreements, the table presents the notional amounts and weighted average exchange rates by expected (contractual) maturity dates. These notional amounts generally are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract. Expected Maturity Date Total FairValue 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter ($ in millions) Anticipated Transactions and Related Derivatives Foreign Currency Forward Exchange Agreements Contract Amount $ 7 $ 57 $ $ $ $ 64 $ (20 ) Average Contractual Exchange Rate 1.57 1.57 On August 30, 2001, our Canadian subsidiaries entered into a mortgage loan pursuant to which they borrowed $96.6 million (denominated in U.S. dollars) at a variable rate of LIBOR plus 2.75%. The weighted average interest rate for this mortgage loan was 4.4% and 4.5%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. In addition, since the mortgage loan on these Canadian properties is denominated in U.S. dollars and the functional currency of the Canadian subsidiaries is the Canadian dollar, the subsidiaries entered into currency forward contracts to hedge the currency exposure of converting Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars on a monthly basis to cover debt service payments. Up until April 2003, these forward exchange contracts had been designated as a cash flow hedges of the debt service payments, and the forward contracts were recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with offsetting changes recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. In December 2003, the Company entered into certain transactions which resulted in the forward contracts no longer 57 Table of Contents qualifying as hedges. We recognized a loss of approximately $18 million in 2003, which was previously included in accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheet. During 2003, we prepaid approximately $39 million of the loan and terminated the foreign currency contracts equal to the prepayments for a payment of approximately $8 million. Accordingly, the change in fair value is recorded in our consolidated statement of operations each period. For 2004, we recorded a loss of $7 million. The fair value of the forward contracts was approximately $(20) million and $(12) million, respectively, at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003. In January of 2005, we assigned approximately $32 million notional amount of the forward contracts to a third party for approximately $8 million, which approximated the fair value of those contracts on the date of sale. After this sale, our outstanding notional amount is approximately $20 million and the fair value of the remaining contracts is approximately $(8) million. 58 Table of Contents FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS In this report on Form 10 K we make some forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are included throughout this report on Form 10 K and the information incorporated by reference herein, including in the section entitled Risk Factors and relate to, among other things, analyses and other information based on forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable. These forward looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as anticipate, believe, could, estimate, expect, intend, may, plan, predict, project, will, continue, and other similar terms and phrases, including references to assumptions. These forward looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties. Factors which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by us in the forward looking statements include, among others, the following: national and local economic and business conditions and changes in travel patterns that will affect demand for products and services at our hotels, the level of room rates and occupancy that can be achieved by such properties and the availability and terms of financing and our liquidity; changes in taxes and government regulations that influence or determine wages, prices, construction procedures and costs; our ability to maintain properties in a first class manner, including meeting capital expenditure requirements; our ability to compete effectively in areas such as access, location, quality of accommodations and room rate; our ability to acquire or develop additional properties and the risk that potential acquisitions or developments may not perform in accordance with expectations; our degree of leverage, which may affect our ability to obtain financing in the future; the reduction in our operating flexibility and our ability to pay dividends resulting from restrictive covenants contained in our debt agreements, including the risk of default that could occur, and in the terms of our preferred stock; the effect of terror alerts and potential terrorist activity on travel and our ability to recover fully under our existing insurance for terrorist acts and our ability to maintain adequate or full replacement cost all risk property insurance on our properties; government approvals, actions and initiatives, including the need for compliance with environmental and safety requirements, and changes in laws and regulations or the interpretation thereof; the effects of tax legislative action; HMCs ability to continue to satisfy complex rules in order for it to maintain REIT status for Federal income tax purposes, the ability of the operating partnership to satisfy the rules to maintain its status as a partnership for Federal income tax purposes, the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to maintain their status as taxable REIT subsidiaries for Federal income tax purposes, and our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to operate effectively within the limitations imposed by these rules; the effect of any rating agency downgrades on the cost and availability of new debt financings; the relatively fixed nature of our property level operating costs and expenses; and other factors discussed under the heading Risk Factors and in other filings with the SEC. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in any of our forward looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, any of these assumptions could prove to be inaccurate and the forward looking 59 Table of Contents statement based on these assumptions could be incorrect and actual results could differ materially from those projected or assumed. Our future financial condition and results of operations, as well as any forward looking statements, are subject to change and to inherent known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, our forward looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the factors described above and under the heading Risk Factors and in the information incorporated by reference herein. Except as otherwise required by the federal securities laws, we disclaim any obligation to publicly release any updates or revisions to any forward looking statement contained in this annual report on Form 10 K to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based 60 Table of Contents RISK FACTORS Prospective investors should carefully consider, among other factors, the material risks described below. Financial Risks and Risks of Operation We depend on external sources of capital for future growth and we may be unable to access capital when necessary. Unlike corporations, our ability to reduce our debt and finance our growth largely must be funded by external sources of capital because HMC is required to distribute to its stockholders at least 90% of its taxable income in order to qualify as a REIT, including taxable income we recognize for tax purposes but with regard to which we do not receive corresponding cash. Our ability to access the external capital we require could be hampered by a number of factors many of which are outside of our control, including declining general market conditions, unfavorable market perception of our growth potential, decreases in our current and estimated future earnings, excessive cash distributions or decreases in the market price of HMCs common stock. In addition, our ability to access additional capital may also be limited by the terms of our existing indebtedness, which, among other things, restricts our incurrence of debt and the payment of distributions. The occurrence of any of these above mentioned factors, individually or in combination, could prevent us from being able to obtain the external capital we require on terms that are acceptable to us or at all and the failure to obtain necessary external capital could have a material adverse affect our ability to finance our future growth. We have substantial leverage. As of February 28, 2005, we and our subsidiaries had total indebtedness of approximately $5.5 billion. Our substantial indebtedness has important consequences. It currently requires us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, which reduces the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, expansion efforts, distributions to our partners and other general purposes. Additionally, it could: limit our ability in the future to undertake refinancings of our debt or obtain financing for expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general business purposes on terms and conditions acceptable to us, if at all; or affect adversely our ability to compete effectively or operate successfully under adverse economic conditions. Because HMC must distribute most of its taxable income in order to maintain its qualification as a REIT, we depend upon external sources of capital for future growth. If our cash flow and working capital were not sufficient to fund our expenditures or service our indebtedness, we would have to raise additional funds. See Risk Factors We depend on external sources of capital for future growth and we may be unable to access capital when necessary. Our revenues and the value of our properties are subject to conditions affecting the lodging industry. The lodging industry experienced a down turn from 2001 to 2003, and operations generally declined during this period. The decline was attributed to a number of factors including a weak economy, the effect of terrorist attacks, terror alerts in the United States and the war in Iraq, all of which changed the travel patterns of both business and leisure travelers. While our operations have improved and RevPAR increased in 2004, we cannot provide assurance that changes in travel patterns of both business and leisure travelers are permanent or whether they will continue to evolve creating new opportunities or difficulties for the industry. Any forecast we make regarding our results of operations may be affected and can change based on the following risks: changes in the national, regional and local economic climate; changes in business and leisure travel patterns; 61 Table of Contents local market conditions such as an oversupply of hotel rooms or a reduction in lodging demand; the attractiveness of our hotels to consumers relative to our competition; the performance of the managers of our hotels; changes in room rates and increases in operating costs due to inflation and other factors; and unionization of the labor force at our hotels. Future terrorist attacks or changes in terror alert levels could adversely affect us. Previous terrorist attacks in the United States and subsequent terrorist alerts have adversely affected the travel and hospitality industries. The impact which terrorist attacks in the United States or elsewhere could have on our business in particular and the U.S. economy, the global economy and global financial markets in general is indeterminable. It is possible that such attacks or the threat of such attacks could have a material adverse effect on our business, our ability to finance our business, our ability to insure our properties and on our results of operations and financial condition as a whole. Our expenses may not decrease if our revenue drops. Many of the expenses associated with owning and operating hotels, such as debt payments, property taxes, insurance, utilities, and employee wages and benefits, are relatively inflexible and do not necessarily decrease in tandem with a reduction in revenue at the hotels. Our expenses will also be affected by inflationary increases, and in the case of certain costs, such as wages, benefits and insurance, may exceed the rate of inflation in any given period. Our managers may be unable to offset any such increased expenses with higher room rates. Any of our efforts to reduce operating costs or failure to make scheduled capital expenditures could adversely affect the growth of our business and the value of our hotel properties. Our ground lease payments may increase faster than the revenues we receive on the hotels situated on the leased properties. As of February 28, 2005, forty of our hotels are subject to third party ground leases (encumbering all or a portion of the hotel). These ground leases generally require increases in ground rent payments every five years. Our ability to service our debt could be adversely affected to the extent that our revenues do not increase at the same or a greater rate than the increases in rental payments under the ground leases. In addition, if we were to sell a hotel encumbered by a ground lease, the buyer would have to assume the ground lease, which may result in a lower sales price. We do not control our hotel operations and we are dependent on the managers of our hotels. Because Federal income tax laws restrict REITs and their subsidiaries from operating a hotel, we do not manage our hotels. Instead, we lease substantially all of our full service properties to subsidiaries which qualify as taxable REIT subsidiaries under applicable REIT laws, and our taxable REIT subsidiaries retain third party managers to manage our hotels pursuant to management agreements. Our income from the hotels may be adversely affected if our managers fail to provide quality services and amenities or if they fail to maintain a quality brand name. While our taxable REIT subsidiaries monitor the hotel managers performance, we have limited specific recourse under our management agreements if we believe that the hotel managers are not performing adequately. In addition, from time to time, we have had, and continue to have, differences with the managers of our hotels over their performance and compliance with the terms of our management agreements. We generally resolve issues with our managers through discussions and negotiations. However, if we are unable to reach satisfactory results through discussions and negotiations, we may choose to litigate such a dispute. Failure by our hotel managers to fully perform the duties agreed to in our management agreements could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, our hotel managers manage, and in some cases own or have invested in, hotels that compete with our hotels, which may result in conflicts of interest. As a result, our 62 Table of Contents hotel managers have in the past made and may in the future make decisions regarding competing lodging facilities that are not or would not be in our best interests. The terms of our debt place restrictions on us and our subsidiaries, reducing operational flexibility and creating default risks. The documents governing the terms of our senior notes and our credit facility contain covenants that place restrictions on us and our subsidiaries. The activities upon which such restrictions exist include, but are not limited to: acquisitions, mergers and consolidations; the incurrence of additional debt; the creation of liens; the sale of assets; capital expenditures; raising capital from the issuance of certain types of mandatorily redeemable capital stock; the payment of dividends; and transactions with affiliates. In addition, certain covenants in the credit facility require us and our subsidiaries to meet financial performance tests. The restrictive covenants in the indenture, the credit facility and the documents governing our other debt (including our mortgage debt) will reduce our flexibility in conducting our operations and will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long term best interest. Our failure to comply with these restrictive covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all or a substantial portion of our debt. Our ability to pay dividends may be limited or prohibited by the terms of our indebtedness. We are, and may in the future become, parties to agreements and instruments which restrict or prevent the payment of dividends on our classes and series of capital stock. Under the terms of our credit facility and our senior notes indenture, distributions to HMC by Host LP, upon which HMC depends in order to obtain the cash necessary to pay dividends, are permitted only to the extent that, at the time of the distribution, we can satisfy certain financial covenant tests and meet other requirements. For example, beginning in the third quarter of 2002 and continuing through the first quarter of 2004, Host LP was prohibited from making distributions (other than in the amounts required to permit HMC to pay dividends necessary to maintain REIT qualification) because our EBITDA to interest coverage ratio as calculated under the indenture governing our senior notes (which measures the ratio of pro forma consolidated EBITDA to pro forma consolidated interest expense) was below 2.0 to 1.0. During this period, Host LP was only able to make distributions to HMC, and HMC was only able to pay dividends, to the extent that we were required to make distributions to maintain HMCs status as a REIT. While our EBITDA to interest coverage ratio is currently above 2.0 to 1.0 and as a result we are no longer limited by this particular restriction, a decline in our operations could once again limit the amount of distributions that Host LP could make, and HMCs ability to pay dividends, either because our EBITDA to interest coverage ratio again falls below 2.0 to 1.0 or because we fail to meet other financial covenant tests or meet other requirements in our credit facility or senior notes indenture. Our ability to pay dividends on our common stock may also be limited or prohibited by the terms of our preferred stock and Convertible Subordinated Debentures. Under the terms of each of our outstanding classes of preferred stock, we are not permitted to pay dividends on our common stock unless cumulative dividends have been paid (or funds for payment have been set aside for 63 Table of Contents payment) on each such class of preferred stock. The amount of aggregate dividends that accrue on our outstanding classes of preferred stock each quarter is approximately $8 million. In the event that we fail to pay the accrued dividends on our preferred stock for any reason, including because we are prevented from paying such dividends under the terms of our debt instruments (as discussed above), dividends will continue to accrue on all outstanding classes of our preferred stock and we will be prohibited from paying any dividends on our common stock until all such accrued but unpaid dividends on our preferred stock have been paid (or funds for such payment have been set aside). We may defer interest payments on the Convertible Subordinated Debentures for a period not to exceed 20 consecutive quarters. If interest payments on the Convertible Subordinated Debentures are deferred, so too are payments on the Convertible Preferred Securities. Under this circumstance, we will not be permitted to declare or pay any cash distributions with respect to our capital stock or debt securities that rank pari passu with or junior to the Convertible Subordinated Debentures. Foreclosure on our mortgage debt could adversely affect our business. Twenty eight of our hotels and assets related thereto are subject to various mortgages in an aggregate amount of approximately $2.0 billion. Although the debt is generally non recourse to us, if these hotels do not produce adequate cash flow to service the debt secured by such mortgages, the mortgage lenders could foreclose on these assets. We may opt to allow such foreclosure rather than make the necessary mortgage payments with funds from other sources. However, our senior notes indenture and credit facility contain cross default provisions, which, depending upon the amount of secured debt defaulted on, could cause a cross default under both of these agreements. Our credit facility, which contains the more restrictive cross default provision as compared to our senior notes indenture, provides that it is a credit facility default in the event we default on non recourse secured indebtedness in excess of 1% of our total assets (using undepreciated real estate values) or default on other indebtedness in excess of $50 million. For this and other reasons, permitting a foreclosure could adversely affect our long term business prospects. Our mortgage debt contains provisions that may reduce our liquidity. Certain of our mortgage debt requires that, to the extent cash flow from the hotels which secure such debt drops below stated levels, we escrow cash flow after the payment of debt service until operations improve above the stated levels. In some cases, the escrowed amount may be applied to the outstanding balance of the mortgage debt. When such provisions are triggered, there can be no assurance that the affected properties will achieve the minimum cash flow levels required to trigger a release of any escrowed funds. The amounts required to be escrowed may be material and may negatively affect our liquidity by limiting our access to cash flow after debt service from these mortgaged properties. Rating Agency downgrades may increase our cost of capital. Both our senior notes and our preferred stock are rated by Moodys and Standard & Poors. These independent rating agencies may elect to downgrade their ratings on our senior notes and our preferred stock at any time. These downgrades negatively affect our access to the capital markets and increase our cost of capital. Our management agreements could impair the sale or financing of our hotels. Under the terms of our management agreements, we generally may not sell, lease or otherwise transfer the hotels unless the transferee is not a competitor of the manager and the transferee assumes the related management agreements and meets specified other conditions. Our ability to finance or sell our properties, depending upon the structure of such transactions, may require the managers consent. If, in these circumstances, the manager does not consent, we may be precluded from taking actions in our best interest without breaching the management agreement. 64 Table of Contents The acquisition contracts relating to some hotels limit our ability to sell or refinance those hotels. For reasons relating to tax considerations of the former and current owners of seven hotels, we have agreed to restrictions on selling the hotels, or repaying or refinancing the mortgage debt for varying periods depending on the hotel. We have also agreed not to sell more than 50% of the original allocated value attributable to the former owners of a portfolio of 11 additional hotels, or to take other actions that would result in the recognition and allocation of gain to the former owners of such hotels for income tax purposes. We anticipate that, in specified circumstances, we may agree to similar restrictions in connection with future hotel acquisitions. As a result, even if it were in our best interests to sell these hotels or repay or otherwise reduce the level of the mortgage debt on such hotels, it may be difficult or costly to do so during their respective lock out periods. We may be unable to sell properties because real estate investments are illiquid. Real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly. We may not be able to vary our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions. The inability to respond promptly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to service our debt. In addition, there are limitations under the federal tax laws applicable to REITs that may limit our ability to recognize the full economic benefit from a sale of our assets. Applicable REIT laws may restrict certain business activities. As a REIT we are subject to various restrictions on our income, assets and activities. Business activities that could be impacted by applicable REIT laws include, but are not limited to, activities such as developing alternative uses of real estate, including the development and or sale of timeshare or condominium units, investments in real estate mortgages, investments in securities and dispositions of certain properties. Due to these restrictions, certain business activities, including those mentioned above, may need to occur in one or more of our taxable REIT subsidiaries. Our taxable REIT subsidiaries are taxable as corporations and are subject to federal, state, and, if applicable, local and foreign taxation on their income at applicable corporate rates. In addition, under REIT laws, the aggregate value of all of our taxable REIT subsidiaries may not exceed 20% of the value of all of the REITs assets. We depend on our key personnel. Our success depends on the efforts of our executive officers and other key personnel. None of our key personnel have employment agreements and we do not maintain key person life insurance for any of our executive officers. We cannot assure you that these key personnel will remain employed by us. While we believe that we could find replacements for these key personnel, the loss of their services could have a significant adverse effect on our financial performance. Litigation judgments or settlements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. We are a party to various lawsuits. While we and the other defendants to such lawsuits believe all of the lawsuits in which we are a defendant are without merit and we are vigorously defending against such claims, we can give no assurance as to the outcome of any of the lawsuits. If any of the lawsuits were to be determined adversely to us or a settlement involving a payment of a material sum of money were to occur, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Our acquisition of additional properties may have a significant effect on our business, liquidity, financial position and or results of operations. As part of our business strategy, we seek to acquire upper upscale and luxury hotel properties. We may acquire these properties through various structures, including transactions involving portfolios, single assets, 65 Table of Contents joint ventures and acquisitions of all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other REITs or similar real estate entities. We anticipate that our acquisitions will be financed through a combination of methods, including proceeds from equity offerings of HMC, issuance of limited partnership interests in Host LP, advances under our credit facility, and the incurrence or assumption of indebtedness. We may, from time to time, be in the process of identifying, analyzing and negotiating possible acquisition transactions and we expect to continue to do so in the future. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in consummating future acquisitions on favorable terms or that we will realize the benefits that we anticipate from one or more acquisitions that we consummate. Our inability to consummate one or more acquisitions on such terms, or our failure to realize the intended benefits from one or more acquisitions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial position and or results of operations, including as a result of our incurrence of additional indebtedness and related interest expense and our assumption of unforeseen contingent liabilities. We may acquire hotel properties through joint ventures with third parties that could result in conflicts. Instead of purchasing hotel properties directly, we may invest as a co venturer. Co venturers often share control over the operation of a joint venture. For example, we entered into a joint venture with Marriott International that owns two limited partnerships holding, in the aggregate, 120 Courtyard by Marriott hotels. Subsidiaries of Marriott International manage these Courtyard by Marriott hotels and other subsidiaries of Marriott International serve as ground lessors and mezzanine lender to the partnerships. Actions by a co venturer could subject the assets to additional risk, including: our co venturer in an investment might have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our, or the joint ventures, interests or goals; our co venturer may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives; or our co venturer could go bankrupt, leaving us liable for its share of joint venture liabilities. Although we generally will seek to maintain sufficient control of any joint venture to permit our objectives to be achieved, we might not be able to take action without the approval of our joint venture partners. Also, our joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without our consent. Environmental problems are possible and can be costly. We believe that our properties are in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental laws. Unidentified environmental liabilities could arise, however, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and performance. Federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at the property. The owner or operator may have to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean up costs incurred by the parties in connection with the contamination. These laws typically impose clean up responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. Even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination, each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean up costs incurred. In addition, third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site. Environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance and removal of asbestos. These laws require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos, that they notify and train those who may come into contact with asbestos and that they undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, if asbestos would be disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building. These laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers. 66 Table of Contents Compliance with other government regulations can be costly. Our hotels are subject to various other forms of regulation, including Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act, building codes and regulations pertaining to fire safety. Compliance with those laws and regulations could require substantial capital expenditures. These regulations may be changed from time to time, or new regulations adopted, resulting in additional costs of compliance, including potential litigation. Any increased costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Some potential losses are not covered by insurance. We carry comprehensive insurance coverage for general liability, property, business interruption and other risks with respect to all of our hotels and other properties. These policies offer coverage features and insured limits that we believe are customary for similar type properties. Generally, our all risk property policies provide coverage that is available on a per occurrence basis and that, for each occurrence, has an overall limit as well as various sub limits on the amount of insurance proceeds we can receive. Sub limits exist for certain types of claims such as service interruption, abatement, earthquakes, expediting costs or landscaping replacement, and the dollar amounts of these sub limits are significantly lower than the dollar amounts of the overall coverage limit. Our property policies also provide that all of the claims from each of our properties resulting from a particular insurable event must be combined together for purposes of evaluating whether the aggregate limits and sub limits contained in our policies have been exceeded and, in the case of four of our hotels where the manager provides this coverage, any such claims will also be combined with the claims of other owners participating in the managers program for the same purpose. That means that, if an insurable event occurs that affects more than one of our hotels, or, in the case of hotels where coverage is provided by the management company, affects hotels owned by others, the claims from each affected hotel will be added together to determine whether the aggregate limit or sub limits, depending on the type of claim, have been reached and each affected hotel may only receive a proportional share of the amount of insurance proceeds provided for under the policy if the total value of the loss exceeds the aggregate limits available. We may incur losses in excess of insured limits and, as a result, we may be even less likely to receive sufficient coverage for risks that affect multiple properties such as earthquakes or certain types of terrorism. In addition, there are other risks such as war, certain forms of terrorism such as nuclear, biological or chemical terrorism and some environmental hazards that may be deemed to fall completely outside the general coverage limits of our policies or may be uninsurable or may be too expensive to justify insuring against. If any such risk were to materialize and materially adversely affect one or more of our properties, we would likely not be able to recover our losses. We may also encounter challenges with an insurance provider regarding whether it will pay a particular claim that we believe to be covered under our policy. Should a loss in excess of insured limits or an uninsured loss occur or should we be unsuccessful in obtaining coverage from an insurance carrier, we could lose all, or a portion of, the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the hotel. In that event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. We may not be able to recover fully under our existing terrorism insurance for losses caused by some types of terrorist acts, and Federal terrorism legislation does not ensure that we will be able to obtain terrorism insurance in adequate amounts or at acceptable premium levels in the future. We obtain terrorism insurance as part of our all risk property insurance program. However, as noted above, our all risk policies have limitations such as per occurrence limits and sublimits which might have to be shared proportionally across participating hotels under certain loss scenarios. Also, all risk insurers only have to provide terrorism coverage to the extent mandated by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) for certified acts of terrorism namely those which are committed on behalf of non United States persons or interests. Furthermore, we do not have full replacement coverage at all of our properties for acts of terrorism committed on behalf of United States persons or interests (noncertified events) as our coverage for such incidents is subject to 67 Table of Contents sublimits and annual aggregate limits. In addition, property damage related to war and to nuclear, biological and chemical incidents is excluded under our policies. While TRIA will reimburse insurers for losses resulting from nuclear, biological and chemical perils, TRIA does not require insurers to offer coverage for these perils and, to date, insurers are not willing to provide this coverage, even with government reinsurance. In addition, TRIA terminates on December 31, 2005, and there is no guarantee that the terrorism coverage that it mandates will be readily available or affordable thereafter. As a result of the above, there remains considerable uncertainty regarding the extent and adequacy of terrorism coverage that will be available to protect our interests in the event of future terrorist attacks that impact our properties. Risks of Ownership of HMCs Common Stock There are limitations on the acquisition of HMC common stock and changes in control. HMCs charter and bylaws, the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership, HMCs stockholder rights plan and the Maryland General Corporation Law contain a number of provisions, the exercise of which could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our stockholders or OP unit holders or otherwise be in their best interests, including the following: Restrictions on ownership and transfer of HMCs stock. To maintain HMCs qualification as a REIT for Federal income tax purposes, not more than 50% in value of HMCs outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code to include some entities. In addition, a person who owns, directly or by attribution, 10% or more of an interest in a tenant of ours, or a tenant of any partnership in which we are a partner, cannot own, directly or by attribution, 10% or more of HMCs shares without jeopardizing HMCs qualification as a REIT. Unless exempted by HMCs Board of Directors, HMCs charter prohibits ownership, directly or by virtue of the attribution provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, by any person or persons acting as a group, of more than 9.8% in value or number, whichever is more restrictive, of shares of HMCs outstanding common stock, preferred stock or any other stock, each considered as a separate class or series for this purpose. Together, these limitations are referred to as the ownership limit. Stock acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred automatically to a trust for the benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary, and the person who acquired the stock in violation of the ownership limit will not be entitled to any distributions thereon, to vote those shares of stock or to receive any proceeds from the subsequent sale of the stock in excess of the lesser of the price paid for the stock or the amount realized from the sale. A transfer of shares of HMCs stock to a person who, as a result of the transfer, violates the ownership limit may be void under certain circumstances, and, in any event, would deny that person any of the economic benefits of owning shares of HMCs stock in excess of the ownership limit. These restrictions on transferability and ownership will not apply if the Board of Directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to continue to qualify as a REIT. Removal of board of directors. HMCs charter provides that, except for any directors who may be elected by holders of a class or series of shares of capital stock other than common stock, directors may be removed only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least two thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast for the election of directors. Vacancies on the Board of Directors may be filled by the concurring vote of a majority of the remaining directors (except that a vacancy resulting from an increase in the number of directors must be filled by a majority vote of the entire Board of Directors) and, in the case of a vacancy resulting from the removal of a director by the stockholders, by at least two thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast in the election of directors. Preferred shares; classification or reclassification of unissued shares of capital stock without stockholder approval. HMCs charter provides that the total number of shares of stock of all classes that we have authority to issue is 800,000,000, initially consisting of 750,000,000 shares of common stock and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The Board of Directors has the authority, without a vote of stockholders, to classify or reclassify any unissued shares of stock, including common stock into 68 Table of Contents preferred stock or vice versa, and to establish the preferences and rights of any preferred or other class or series of shares to be issued. Because the Board of Directors has the power to establish the preferences and rights of additional classes or series of stock without a stockholder vote, HMCs Board of Directors may give the holders of any class or series of stock preferences, powers and rights, including voting rights, senior to the rights of holders of existing stock. Consent rights of the limited partners. Under the partnership agreement of the operating partnership, we generally will be able to merge or consolidate with another entity with the consent of partners holding limited percentage interests that are more than 50% of the aggregate percentage interests of the outstanding limited partnership interests entitled to vote on the merger or consolidation, including any limited partnership interests held by us, as long as the holders of limited partnership interests either receive or have the right to receive the same consideration as HMCs stockholders. HMC, as holder of a majority of the limited partnership interests, would be able to control the vote. Under HMCs charter, holders of at least two thirds of HMCs outstanding shares of common stock generally must approve a merger or consolidation. Maryland business combination law. Under the Maryland General Corporation Law, specified business combinations, including specified issuances of equity securities, between a Maryland corporation and any person who owns 10% or more of the voting power of the corporations then outstanding shares, or an affiliate or associate of the corporation who at any time during the two year period prior to the date in question owned 10% or more of the voting power of the outstanding stock of the corporation (each, an interested stockholder), or an affiliate of the interested stockholder, are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. Thereafter, any of these specified business combinations must be approved by 80% of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of outstanding voting shares and by two thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of voting shares other than voting shares held by an interested stockholder unless, among other conditions, the corporations common stockholders receive a minimum price, as defined in the Maryland General Corporation Law, for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder. HMC is subject to the Maryland business combination statute. Maryland control share acquisition law. Under the Maryland General Corporation Law, control shares acquired in a control share acquisition have no voting rights except to the extent approved by a vote of two thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding shares owned by the acquiror, by officers or by directors who are employees of the corporation. Control shares are voting shares which, if aggregated with all other voting shares previously acquired by the acquiror or over which the acquiror is able to exercise or direct the exercise of voting power (except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy), would entitle the acquiror to exercise voting power in electing directors within one of the following ranges of voting power: (1) one tenth or more but less than one third, (2) one third or more but less than a majority or (3) a majority or more of the voting power. Control shares do not include shares the acquiring person is then entitled to vote as a result of having previously obtained stockholder approval. A control share acquisition means the acquisition of control shares, subject to specified exceptions. HMC is subject to these control share provisions of Maryland law. Merger, consolidation, share exchange and transfer of HMCs assets. Pursuant to HMCs charter, subject to the terms of any outstanding class or series of capital stock, we can merge with or into another entity, consolidate with one or more other entities, participate in a share exchange or transfer HMCs assets within the meaning of the Maryland General Corporation Law if approved (1) by HMCs Board of Directors in the manner provided in the Maryland General Corporation Law and (2) by HMCs stockholders holding two thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, except that any merger of us with or into a trust organized for the purpose of changing HMCs form of organization from a corporation to a trust requires only the approval of HMCs stockholders holding a majority of all votes entitled to be cast on the merger. Under the Maryland General Corporation Law, specified mergers may be approved without a vote of stockholders and a share exchange is only required to be approved by a 69 Table of Contents Maryland corporation by its board of directors if the corporation is the successor. HMCs voluntary dissolution also would require approval of stockholders holding two thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Certain charter and bylaw amendments. HMCs charter contains provisions relating to restrictions on transferability of HMCs stock, fixing the size of the Board of Directors within the range set forth in the charter, removal of directors and the filling of vacancies, all of which may be amended only by a resolution adopted by the Board of Directors and approved by HMCs stockholders holding two thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Any amendments of these provisions of the charter (setting forth the necessary approval requirements) also would require action of the Board of Directors and the approval by stockholders holding two thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. As permitted under the Maryland General Corporation Law, HMCs bylaws provide that directors have the exclusive right to amend HMCs bylaws. These provisions may make it more difficult to amend HMCs charter and bylaws to alter the provisions described herein that could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control or the acquisition of HMC common stock, without the approval of the Board of Directors. Stockholder rights plan. We adopted a stockholder rights plan which provides, among other things, that when specified events occur, HMCs stockholders, other than an acquiring person, will be entitled to purchase from us a newly created class or series of junior preferred stock, subject to HMCs ownership limits described above. The preferred stock purchase rights are triggered by the earlier to occur of (1) ten days after the date of a public announcement that a person or group acting in concert has acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of 20% or more of HMCs outstanding shares of common stock or (2) ten business days after the commencement of or announcement of an intention to make a tender offer or exchange offer, the consummation of which would result in the acquiring person becoming the beneficial owner of 20% or more of HMCs outstanding common stock. The exercise of the preferred share purchase rights would cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by HMCs Board of Directors. Shares of HMCs common stock that are or become available for sale could affect the share price. Sales of a substantial number of shares of HMCs common stock, or the perception that sales could occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices for HMCs common stock. In addition, holders of units of limited partnership interest in the operating partnership, whose OP units are redeemed by the operating partnership in exchange for common stock, will be able to sell those shares freely, unless the person is our affiliate and resale of the affiliates shares is not covered by an effective registration statement. Further, a substantial number of shares of HMCs common stock have been and will be issued or reserved for issuance from time to time under our employee benefit plans, including shares of common stock reserved for options, or pursuant to securities we may issue that are convertible into shares of HMC common stock or securities (other than OP units) that the operating partnership has issued that are exchangeable for shares of our common stock. As of February 28, 2005, (i) there are approximately 21 million OP units outstanding that are redeemable, and (ii) there are outstanding $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.25% Exchangeable Senior Debentures of the operating partnership exchangeable under certain conditions for shares of HMC common stock at an initial exchange price equivalent to $18.30 per share for a total of approximately 27 million shares (subject to adjustment for various reasons, including as a result of the payment of dividends to common stockholders) (iii) there are outstanding $492 million of 6 3/4% convertible preferred securities issued by the Host Marriott REIT Financial Trust that are convertible into shares of HMC common stock at a conversion price equivalent to $15.367 per share for a total of approximately 31 million shares. Moreover, additional shares of common stock issued by HMC would be available in the future for sale in the public markets. We can make no prediction about the effect that future sales of common stock would have on the market price of HMC common stock. Our earnings and cash distributions will affect the market price of shares of HMCs common stock. We believe that the market value of a REITs equity securities is based primarily upon the markets perception of the REITs growth potential and its current and potential future cash distributions, whether from 70 Table of Contents operations, sales, acquisitions, development or refinancings, and is secondarily based upon the value of the underlying assets. For that reason, shares of HMCs common stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share. To the extent we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes, working capital reserves or other purposes rather than distributing the cash flow to stockholders, these retained funds, while increasing the value of our underlying assets, may negatively impact the market price of HMCs common stock. Our failure to meet the markets expectation with regard to future earnings and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of HMCs common stock. Market interest rates may affect the price of shares of HMCs common stock. We believe that one of the factors that investors consider important in deciding whether to buy or sell shares of a REIT is the distribution rate on the shares, considered as a percentage of the price of the shares, relative to market interest rates. If market interest rates increase, prospective purchasers of REIT shares may expect a higher distribution rate. Thus, higher market interest rates could cause the market price of HMCs shares to go down. Federal Income Tax Risks The lower tax rate on certain dividends from regular C corporations may cause investors to hold stock in those corporations. While corporate dividends have traditionally been taxed at ordinary income rates, dividends received by individuals through December 31, 2008 from regular C corporations generally will be taxed at the maximum capital gains tax rate of 15% as opposed to the maximum ordinary income tax rate of 35%. REIT dividends are not eligible for the lower capital gains rates, except in certain circumstances where the dividends are attributable to income that has been subject to corporate level tax. This difference in the taxation of dividends could cause individual investors to view the stock of regular C corporations as more attractive relative to the stock of REITs. Individual investors could hold this view because the dividends from regular C corporations will generally be taxed at a lower rate while dividends from REITs will generally be taxed at the same rate as the individuals other ordinary income. We cannot predict what effect, if any, this difference in the taxation of dividends may have on the value of the stock of REITs, either in terms of price or relative to other potential investments. To qualify as a REIT, HMC is required to distribute at least 90% of its taxable income, irrespective of its available cash or outstanding obligations. To continue to qualify as a REIT, HMC currently is required to distribute to its stockholders with respect to each year at least 90% of its taxable income, excluding net capital gain. In addition, it will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which distributions made by it with respect to the calendar year are less than the sum of 85% of its ordinary income and 95% of its capital gain net income for that year and any undistributed taxable income from prior periods less excess distributions from prior years. HMC intends to make distributions, subject to the availability of cash and in compliance with any debt covenants, to its stockholders to comply with the distribution requirement and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax and will rely for this purpose on distributions from the operating partnership. However, there are differences in timing between HMCs recognition of taxable income and its receipt of cash available for distribution due to, among other things, the seasonality of the lodging industry and the fact that some taxable income will be phantom income, which is taxable income that is not matched by cash flow to us. Due to some transactions entered into in years prior to the REIT conversion, HMC could recognize substantial amounts of phantom income. It is possible that these timing differences could require us to borrow funds or to issue additional equity to enable HMC to meet the distribution requirement and, therefore, to maintain its REIT status, and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax. In addition, because the REIT distribution requirement prevents HMC from retaining earnings, we will generally be required to refinance debt that matures with additional debt or equity. We cannot assure you that any of the sources of funds, if available at all, would be sufficient to meet HMCs distribution and tax obligations. 71 Table of Contents Adverse tax consequences would apply if HMC failed to qualify as a REIT. We believe that HMC has been organized and has operated in such a manner so as to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, commencing with its taxable year beginning January 1, 1999, and HMC currently intends to continue to operate as a REIT during future years. No assurance can be provided, however, that HMC qualifies as a REIT or that new legislation, treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly change the tax laws with respect to its qualification as a REIT or the federal income tax consequences of its REIT qualification. If HMC fails to qualify as a REIT, and any available relief provisions do not apply, it will not be allowed to take a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing its taxable income, and it will be subject to Federal and state income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on its taxable income at regular corporate rates. In addition, unless entitled to statutory relief, it would not qualify as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which REIT qualification is lost. Any determination that HMC does not qualify as a REIT would have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations and could reduce the value of our common stock materially. The additional tax liability to us for the year, or years, in which HMC did not qualify would reduce our net earnings available for investment, debt service or distributions to our stockholders. Furthermore, HMC would no longer be required to make any distributions to stockholders as a condition to REIT qualification and all of our distributions to stockholders would be taxable as regular corporate dividends to the extent of HMCs current and accumulated earnings and profits, or E&P. This means that stockholders taxed as individuals currently would be taxed on those dividends at capital gains rates and corporate stockholders generally would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends, subject in each case, to applicable limitations under the Internal Revenue Code. HMCs failure to qualify as a REIT also would cause an event of default under our credit facility that could lead to an acceleration of the amounts due under the credit facility, which, in turn, would constitute an event of default under our outstanding debt securities. New legislation, enacted October 22, 2004, contained several provisions applicable to REITs, including provisions that could provide relief in the event HMC violates certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code that otherwise would result in its failure to qualify as a REIT. We cannot assure you that these relief provisions would apply if HMC failed to comply with the REIT qualification laws. Even if the relief provisions do apply, HMC would be subject to a penalty tax of at least $50,000 for each disqualifying event in most cases. HMC will be disqualified as a REIT at least for taxable year 1999 if it failed to distribute all of its E&P attributable to its non REIT taxable years. In order to qualify as a REIT, HMC cannot have at the end of any taxable year any undistributed E&P that is attributable to one of its non REIT taxable years. A REIT has until the close of its first taxable year as a REIT in which it has non REIT E&P to distribute its accumulated E&P. HMC was required to have distributed this E&P prior to the end of 1999, the first taxable year for which its REIT election was effective. If it failed to do this, it will be disqualified as a REIT at least for taxable year 1999. We believe that distributions of non REIT E&P that HMC made were sufficient to distribute all of the non REIT E&P as of December 31, 1999, but we cannot provide assurance that we met this requirement. If our leases are not respected as true leases for Federal income tax purposes, HMC would fail to qualify as a REIT. To qualify as a REIT, HMC must satisfy two gross income tests, under which specified percentages of its gross income must be passive income, like rent. For the rent paid pursuant to the leases, which constitutes substantially all of our gross income, to qualify for purposes of the gross income tests, the leases must be respected as true leases for Federal income tax purposes and not be treated as service contracts, joint ventures or some other type of arrangement. In addition, the lessees must not be regarded as related party tenants, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. We believe that the leases will be respected as true leases for federal income tax purposes. There can be no assurance, however, that the IRS will agree with this view. We also believe that Crestline, the lessee of substantially all of our full service hotels prior to January 1, 2001, was not a related party 72 Table of Contents tenant and, as a result of changes in the tax laws effective January 1, 2001, our affiliated lessee will not be treated as a related party tenant so long as it qualifies as a taxable REIT subsidiary. If the leases were not respected as true leases for federal income tax purposes or if the lessee was regarded as a related party tenant, HMC would not be able to satisfy either of the two gross income tests applicable to REITs and it would lose its REIT status. See Risk Factors Federal Income Tax Risks Adverse tax consequences would apply if HMC failed to qualify as a REIT above. If our affiliated lessee fails to qualify as a taxable REIT subsidiary, HMC would fail to qualify as a REIT. For our taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2001, we are permitted to lease our hotels to a subsidiary of the operating partnership that is taxable as a corporation and that elects to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary. So long as any affiliated lessee qualifies as a taxable REIT subsidiary of ours, it will not be treated as related party tenant. We believe that our affiliated lessee qualifies to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary for federal income tax purposes. We cannot assure you, however, that the IRS will not challenge its status as a taxable REIT subsidiary for federal income tax purposes, or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If the IRS were successful in disqualifying our affiliated lessee from treatment as a taxable REIT subsidiary, HMC would fail to meet the asset tests applicable to REITs and substantially all of its income would fail to qualify for the gross income tests and, accordingly, HMC would cease to qualify as a REIT. See Risk Factors Federal Income Tax Risks Adverse tax consequences would apply if HMC failed to qualify as a REIT above. Despite HMCs REIT status, we remain subject to various taxes, including substantial deferred and contingent tax liabilities. Notwithstanding HMCs status as a REIT, we are subject to certain Federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and property. In addition, HMC will be required to pay Federal income tax at the highest regular corporate rate upon its share of any built in gain recognized as a result of any sale before January 1, 2009, by the operating partnership of assets, including the hotels, in which interests were acquired by the operating partnership from our predecessor and its subsidiaries as part of the REIT conversion. Built in gain is the amount by which an assets fair market value exceeded our adjusted basis in the asset on January 1, 1999, the first day of HMCs first taxable year as a REIT. The total amount of gain on which HMC would be subject to corporate income tax if the assets that we held at the time of the REIT conversion were sold in a taxable transaction prior to January 1, 2009 would be material to us. In addition, at the time of the REIT conversion, we expected that HMC or Rockledge Hotel Properties, Inc. or Fernwood Hotel Assets, Inc., or Rockledge and Fernwood, respectively (each of which is a taxable corporation in which the operating partnership owned a 95% nonvoting interest and, as of April, 2001, acquired 100% of the voting interests and each of which, elected to be a taxable REIT subsidiary effective January 1, 2001), likely would recognize substantial built in gain and deferred tax liabilities in the next ten years without any corresponding receipt of cash. HMC may have to pay certain state income taxes because not all states treat REITs the same as they are treated for federal income tax purposes. We may also have to pay certain foreign taxes to the extent we own assets or conduct operations in foreign jurisdictions. The operating partnership is obligated under its partnership agreement to pay all such taxes (and any related interest and penalties) incurred by HMC, as well as any liabilities that the IRS or the tax authorities successfully may assert against HMC for corporate income taxes for taxable years prior to the time it qualified as a REIT. Our taxable REIT subsidiaries, including Rockledge and Fernwood, are taxable as corporations and will pay federal, state and local income tax on their net income at the applicable corporate rates, and foreign taxes to the extent they own assets or conduct operations in foreign jurisdictions. If the IRS were to challenge successfully the operating partnerships status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, HMC would cease to qualify as a REIT and suffer other adverse consequences. We believe that the operating partnership qualifies to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, it is not subject to federal income tax on its income. Instead, each of its partners, 73 Table of Contents including HMC, is required to pay tax on its allocable share of the operating partnerships income. No assurance can be provided, however, that the IRS will not challenge its status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If the IRS were successful in treating the operating partnership as a corporation for tax purposes, HMC would fail to meet the income tests and certain of the asset tests applicable to REITs and, accordingly, cease to qualify as a REIT. If the operating partnership fails to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or HMC fails to qualify as a REIT, either failure would cause an event of default under our credit facility that, in turn, could constitute an event of default under our outstanding debt securities. Also, the failure of the operating partnership to qualify as a partnership would cause it to become subject to federal and state corporate income tax, which would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for debt service and for distribution to its partners, including HMC. Finally, the classification of the operating partnership as a corporation would cause HMC to recognize gain at least equal to our negative capital account, if any. As a REIT, HMC is subject to limitations on its ownership of debt and equity securities. Subject to certain exceptions a REIT is generally prohibited from owning securities in any one issuer to the extent that the value of those securities exceeds 5% of the value of the REITs total assets or the securities owned by the REIT represent more than 10% of the issuers outstanding voting securities or more than 10% of the value of the issuers outstanding securities. A REIT is permitted to own securities of a subsidiary in an amount that exceeds the 5% value test and the 10% vote or value test if the subsidiary elects to be a taxable REIT subsidiary. However, a REIT may not own securities of taxable REIT subsidiaries that represent in the aggregate more than 20% of the value of the REITs total assets. Our taxable REIT subsidiaries are subject to special rules that may result in increased taxes. Several Internal Revenue Code provisions ensure that a taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to an appropriate level of federal income taxation. For example, a taxable REIT subsidiary is limited in its ability to deduct interest payments made to an affiliated REIT. In addition, the REIT has to pay a 100% penalty tax on some payments that it receives if the economic arrangements between the REIT and the taxable REIT subsidiary are not comparable to similar arrangements between unrelated parties. HMC may be required to pay a penalty tax upon the sale of a hotel. The Federal income tax provisions applicable to REITs provide that any gain realized by a REIT on the sale of property held as inventory or other property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is treated as income from a prohibited transaction that is subject to a 100% penalty tax. Under existing law, whether property, including hotels, is held as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is a question of fact that depends upon all of the facts and circumstances with respect to the particular transaction. We intend that we will hold the hotels for investment with a view to long term appreciation, to engage in the business of acquiring and owning hotels and to make occasional sales of hotels as are consistent with our investment objectives. We cannot assure you, however, that the IRS might not contend that one or more of these sales is subject to the 100% penalty tax. 74 Table of Contents
