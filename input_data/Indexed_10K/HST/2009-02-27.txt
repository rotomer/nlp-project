Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. Overview As of February 23, 2009, we own 116 luxury and upper upscale hotel properties and we are the largest lodging REIT in the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts composite index. A REIT is a legal entity that owns real estate assets and, through payments of dividends to stockholders, is permitted to reduce or eliminate federal income taxes at the corporate level. Host operates as a self managed and self administered REIT and owns approximately 97% of the partnership interests of Host Hotels & Resorts, L.P., or Host LP. Our hotels are operated under brand names that are among the most respected and widely recognized in the lodging industry. The majority of our properties are located in central business districts of major cities, near airports and in resort/conference destinations that benefit from significant barriers to entry by competitors. In 2008, approximately 75% of our revenues were generated by our urban and resort/conference hotels. The classification of a property as luxury or upper upscale is based on lodging industry standards, which take into consideration many factors such as guest facilities and amenities, level of service and quality of accommodations. While our hotels are still subject to competitive pressures, we believe this strategy will allow us to achieve room rate and occupancy premiums over our competitors. We seek to maximize the value of our portfolio through aggressive asset management by assisting the managers of our hotels in optimizing property operations and by completing strategic capital improvements. Our Customers The majority of our customers fall into three broad groups: transient business, group business, and contract business, which accounted for approximately 54%, 41% and 5%, respectively, of our 2008 room sales. Similar to the majority of the lodging industry, we further categorize business within these categories based on characteristics they have in common as follows: Transient business broadly represents individual business or leisure travelers. Business travelers make up the majority of transient demand at our hotels, with leisure travelers making up the remainder. Therefore, we will be more significantly affected by trends in business travel versus leisure demand. The four key subcategories of the transient business group are: Premium: Sometimes referred to as rack rate, typically consists of rooms booked close to arrival during high demand periods and is the highest rate category available. Room rates will fluctuate depending on anticipated demand levels (e.g. seasonality, weekday vs. weekend stays). Corporate: This is the benchmark rate which a hotel publishes and offers to the general public. It is typically the second highest category, and is for travelers that do not have access to negotiated or discount rates. Special Corporate: This is a negotiated rate offered to companies and organizations that provide significant levels of room night demand to the hotel or to hotel brands generally. These rates are typically negotiated annually, at a discount to the anticipated corporate rate. Discount: This encompasses all discount programs, such as AAA and AARP discounts, government per diem, rooms booked through wholesale channels, frequent guest program redemptions, and promotional rates and packages offered by a hotel. 40 Group business represents clusters of guestrooms booked together, usually with a minimum of 10 rooms. Examples include a company training session or a social event such as a family reunion. The three key sub categories of the group business category are: Association: group business related to national and regional association meetings and conventions. Corporate: group business related to corporate meetings (e.g., product launches, training programs, contract negotiations, and presentations). Other: group business predominately related to social, military, education, religious, fraternal and youth and amateur sports teams, otherwise known as SMERF business. The final category is contract demand, which refers to blocks of rooms sold to a specific company for an extended period of time at significantly discounted rates. Contract rates are usually utilized by hotels that are located in markets that are experiencing consistently lower levels of demand. Airline crews are typical generators of contract demand for our hotels. Understanding Our Performance Our Revenues and Expenses Our hotels are operated by third party managers under long term agreements under which they typically earn base and incentive management fees based on the levels of revenues and profitability of each individual hotel. We provide operating funds, or working capital, which the managers use to purchase inventory and to pay wages, utilities, property taxes and other hotel level expenses. We generally receive a cash distribution from our hotel managers each four week or monthly accounting period, depending on the manager, which reflects hotel level sales less property level operating expenses (excluding depreciation). Hotel revenue is approximately 98% of our total revenue. The following table presents the components of our hotel revenue as a percentage of our total revenue: % of 2008Revenues Rooms revenue. Occupancy and average daily room rate are the major drivers of rooms revenue. The business mix of the hotel (group versus transient and premium versus discount business) is a significant driver of room rates. 61 % Food and beverage revenue. Occupancy and the type of customer staying at the hotel are the major drivers of food and beverage revenue (i.e., group business typically generates more food and beverage business through catering functions when compared to transient business, which may or may not utilize the hotels restaurants). 30 % Other revenue. Occupancy, the nature of the property (i.e., resort, etc.) and its price point are the main drivers of other ancillary revenue, such as parking, golf course, spa, telephone, entertainment and other guest services. 7 % 41 Hotel operating expenses are approximately 99% of our total operating costs and expenses. The following table presents the components of our hotel operating expenses as a percentage of our total operating costs and expenses: % of 2008OperatingCosts andExpenses Rooms expense. These costs include housekeeping, reservation systems, room supplies, laundry services and front desk costs. Occupancy is the major driver of rooms expense. These costs can increase based on increases in salaries and wages, as well as the level of service and amenities that are provided. 17 % Food and beverage expense. These expenses primarily include food, beverage and labor costs. Occupancy and the type of customer staying at the hotel (i.e., catered functions generally are more profitable than outlet sales) are the major drivers of food and beverage expense, which correlates closely with food and beverage revenue. 26 % Other departmental and support expenses. These expenses include labor and other costs associated with the other ancillary revenues such as parking, golf courses, spas, telephones, entertainment and other guest services, as well as labor and other costs associated with administrative departments, sales and marketing, repairs and minor maintenance and utility costs. 29 % Management fees. Base management fees are computed as a percentage of gross revenue. Incentive management fees generally are paid when operating profits exceed certain threshold levels. 5 % Other property level expenses. These expenses consist primarily of real and personal property taxes, ground rent, equipment rent and property insurance. Many of these expenses are relatively inflexible and do not necessarily change based on changes in revenues at our hotels. 9 % Depreciation and amortization expense. This is a non cash expense that changes primarily based on the acquisition and disposition of hotel properties and the level of past capital expenditures. 13 % The expense components listed above are based on those presented in our consolidated statements of operations. It is also worth noting that wage and benefit costs are spread among various line items, however, taken separately these costs represent approximately 54% of our hotel operating expenses. Key Performance Indicators Revenue per available room, or RevPAR, is a commonly used measure within the hotel industry to evaluate hotel operations. RevPAR is defined as the product of the average daily room rate charged and the average daily occupancy achieved. RevPAR does not include food and beverage or parking, telephone or other guest service revenues generated by the property. Although RevPAR does not include these ancillary revenues, it is generally considered the leading indicator of core revenues for many hotels. RevPAR changes that are driven predominately by occupancy have different implications on overall revenue levels, as well as incremental operating profit than do changes that are driven predominately by average room rate. For example, increases in occupancy at a hotel would lead to increases in rooms revenues and ancillary revenues, such as food and beverage, as well as additional incremental costs (including housekeeping services, utilities and room amenity costs). RevPAR increases due to higher room rates, however, would not result in additional room related costs. As a result, changes in RevPAR driven by increases or decreases in average room rates have a greater effect on profitability than changes in RevPAR caused by occupancy levels. 42 In discussing our operating results, we present RevPAR and certain other financial data for our hotels on a comparable hotel basis. Comparable hotels are those properties that we have owned for the entirety of the reporting periods being compared. Comparable hotels do not include the results of properties acquired or sold, or that incurred business interruption due to significant property damage, large scale capital improvements or significant events during these periods. We also evaluate the performance of our business through non GAAP financial measures, including funds from operations (FFO) per diluted share and comparable hotel adjusted operating profit. We use FFO per diluted share as a supplemental measure of company wide profitability. Another key profitability indicator we use is hotel adjusted operating profit, which is a non GAAP measure used to evaluate the profitability of our comparable hotels. Hotel adjusted operating profit measures property level results before debt service and is a supplemental measure of individual property level profitability. The comparable hotel adjusted operating profit that we discuss is an aggregation of the adjusted operating profit for each of our comparable hotels. Each of the non GAAP measures should be considered by investors as supplemental measures to GAAP performance measures such as total revenues, operating profit and earnings per share. We provide a more detailed discussion of these non GAAP financial measures, how management uses such measures to evaluate our financial condition and operating performance as well as certain limitations of such measures. See Non GAAP Financial Measures in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition. Summary of 2008 Operating Results During 2008, we were significantly affected by the economic recession in the U.S. and the collapse of the credit markets, which contributed to a significant decrease in business and consumer spending. These factors combined to depress overall lodging demand for both the Company and the lodging industry throughout 2008, which resulted in a year long decline in occupancy levels and, starting in the fourth quarter, a decline in average room rates. The Company began to experience a decline in comparable RevPAR in the third quarter before decreasing sharply in the fourth quarter. Overall comparable RevPAR decreased 2.6% in 2008 as a result of a decrease in occupancy of 2.4 percentage points, which was partially offset by a .7% in increase in average room rate. Additionally, food and beverage revenues at our comparable hotels decreased 2.9% during 2008. Total revenue decreased $123 million, or 2.3%, to $5.3 billion for the year, primarily due to the decline in RevPAR and food and beverage revenues. As a result, we have experienced a steady weakening in operating results and a decrease in comparable hotel adjusted operating profit each quarter, though most significantly in the fourth quarter. Net income from continuing operations decreased $144 million in 2008 to $402 million. Net income decreased $300 million to $427 million in 2008. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in operations at our hotels and a decrease in gains on dispositions from $164 million in 2007 compared to $23 million in 2008. Diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations decreased $.29 to $.71 in 2008, while diluted earnings per share decreased $.57 to $.76 in 2008. FFO per diluted share decreased $.17, to $1.74, for 2008. FFO per diluted share was reduced by $.08 for 2007 due to costs associated with debt repayments or refinancings. There were no such costs incurred in 2008. We worked to mitigate the decline in revenues and operating income by directing our operators to implement significant contingency plans early in the year to help contain margin deterioration. These cost cutting measures included right sizing the work force to the amount of business being generated, not filling vacant positions, reducing discretionary spending, delaying the implementation of brand standards, closing restaurant outlets or modifying hours of operations, as well as closing specific floors or towers to reflect the decrease in occupancy. While these efforts have been successful in reducing operating costs, other expenses such as wages and benefits, real estate taxes and utilities increased at above inflationary rates in 2008. In addition to our cost cutting measures, our managers accessed additional revenue channels, particularly e commerce channels, in an effort to offset the decline in revenues from more traditional sources. 43 Investing Activities Acquisitions/Dispositions Domestically, we did not complete any acquisitions during 2008. During the first half of 2008, as lodging fundamentals weakened, the luxury and upper upscale hotels that were marketed did not meet our investment criteria. During the second half of 2008, the economic recession deepened and the ability to obtain financing for acquisitions became extremely limited and only at much lower leverage ratios and at significantly higher interest rates. Consequently, very few hotels were marketed or sold. Management believes that there may be an increase in the number of assets available for purchase late in 2009 and in 2010 as a result of the current recessionary environment and illiquid credit market. Our European joint venture in which we hold a 32.1% interest, was able to successfully complete the purchase of the 270 room Crowne Plaza Amsterdam City Centre for approximately 72 million (U.S. $113 million) in April 2008. On February 17, 2009, we disposed of the Hyatt Regency Boston for net proceeds of approximately $113 million, including the return of reserves held by the manager. We anticipate that we will recognize a gain on the disposition of approximately $20 million, net of tax, in 2009. During 2008, we disposed of the Sheraton Tampa Suites Airport Hotel and the Host Airport Hotel Sacramento. Proceeds from these dispositions were approximately $39 million and we recorded a gain of $23 million, net of tax, in 2008. Capital Expenditures We recently completed a three year $1.8 billion capital expenditure program, which we believe significantly enhances the competitiveness of our properties. This program consisted of renewal and replacement, ROI/repositioning and value enhancement projects in a broad array of areas including lobbies and public spaces, food and beverage facilities, spas, retail outlets, meeting space and rooms as well as energy conservation and other non public areas of the properties. We spent approximately $695 million on capital expenditures in 2008, including $321 million on ROI/repositioning projects and value enhancement projects at 17 properties. These amounts include the application of a $23 million deposit made in 2007. These projects included: the completion of a 105,000 square foot exhibit hall at the Orlando World Center Marriott in 2007; the construction of new food and beverage facilities, renovation of all existing break out space and the construction of the new 26,000 square foot Atrium Ballroom at the Atlanta Marriott Marquis in 2007 and 2008; and the construction of an 8,300 square foot meeting space addition and the renovation of over 60,000 square feet of public space and food and beverage facilities at the San Francisco Marriott in 2008. Additionally, our renewal and replacement capital expenditures totaled $374 million during 2008 and included the renovation of over 11,900 rooms and over 465,000 square feet of meeting space. As a result of these efforts and in an effort to improve future liquidity, we anticipate reducing total capital expenditures to approximately $340 million to $360 million in 2009, which represents approximately one half of the 2008 level. A significant portion of our spending in 2009 will be dedicated to projects that are already in process. Additionally, we may reduce the level of expenditures further if the economic recession is longer or deeper than currently anticipated. Financing Activities The volatility and disruption in the credit markets in the latter half of 2008 was dramatic and has resulted in significantly higher interest rates for all types of financing, as well as greatly reduced availability for many of the traditional forms of financing such as collateralized mortgage backed securities and other secured debt 44 financings. As noted above, this not only affected the ability to acquire or dispose of assets, but also to refinance existing debt. For example, during the fourth quarter of 2008, yields on BB rated senior notes peaked at approximately 15%, or approximately 1350 basis points over treasury rates. This is compared to yields of approximately 8.5% and spreads of approximately 450 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2007. While spreads tightened by 250 to 350 basis points since mid December 2008, they are still well above the historical average. Due to this uncertainty in the financial markets, we increased our available cash position by drawing $200 million on the revolving portion of the credit facility in September 2008. As a result of prior year efforts to establish a capital structure with the appropriate mixture of debt and equity and balanced maturities, we ended 2008 with strong interest coverage and leverage ratios under our credit facility and senior notes covenants (See Financial Condition). Currently, our debt maturities in 2009 are approximately $321 million, including $11 million of principal amortization, which we have the ability to either refinance or repay. Subsequent to the closing of the sale of the Hyatt Regency Boston on February 17, 2009, we have over $600 million of cash and cash equivalents and $400 million of capacity under our credit facility revolver. 2009 Outlook We believe the recessionary economic environment expected for 2009, specifically declining GDP, employment, business investment, corporate profits and consumer spending, will negatively impact the demand for lodging in both the business and leisure components of our business. When looking at historical relationships, the current 2009 consensus estimates for the key economic drivers would suggest an overall decrease in industry lodging demand ranging from 3% to 5%. We believe that lodging demand will decline in 2009 and, in particular, we expect lodging demand in the luxury segment will continue to underperform other segments as consumers trade down to less expensive alternatives. We do not anticipate an improvement in lodging demand until the current economic trends reverse course, particularly the expected continued weakness in the overall economy and the lack of liquidity in the credit markets. While new supply in 2009 is expected to be moderately above historical average, we expect that as a result of the current fiscal environment increases in lodging supply over the next few years will likely slow significantly. This may be particularly relevant for the markets and lodging sectors in which we compete due to the long term planning and high level of investment associated with these properties. We believe that the economic slowdown will significantly affect both the group and transient elements of our business. We believe group demand will continue to decline as companies reduce travel expenditures, which will lead to increased cancellations, diminished booking activity and reduced attendance. Similarly, the reduction in corporate travel budgets will affect the transient business traveler. The consumer led elements of this economic slowdown will also result in a disproportionate impact to leisure dependent destinations, such as Hawaii and Florida, as domestic and international households are likely to reduce discretionary spending. In 2008, we declared a total dividend of $.65 per share. We intend to suspend our regular quarterly dividend in 2009 and instead we expect to declare a $.30 to $.35 per share common dividend in the fourth quarter, which may be paid either in cash or in a combination of cash and shares of common stock. The amount of any dividend will be determined by Hosts Board of Directors. We intend to continue paying dividends on our preferred stock. The general economic trends discussed above make it a difficult environment to predict operating results for our hotels for 2009. Therefore, there can be no assurances that we will not experience further declines in hotel revenues or earnings at our properties for any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, greater than anticipated weakness in the economy and changes in travel patterns. 45 Results of Operations The following table reflects certain line items from our audited statements of operations and other significant operating statistics (in millions, except operating statistics and percentages): 2008 2007 % Change2007 to 2008 2006 % Change2006 to 2007 Revenues Total hotel sales $ 5,170 $ 5,291 (2.3 )% $ 4,683 13.0 % Operating costs and expenses: Property level costs(1) 4,489 4,444 1.0 3,962 12.2 Corporate and other expenses 58 69 (15.9 ) 94 (26.6 ) Gain on insurance settlement 7 51 (86.3 ) 13 N/M (4) Operating profit 748 949 (21.2 ) 759 25.0 Interest expense 341 422 (19.2 ) 450 (6.2 ) Minority interest expense 21 32 (34.4 ) 41 (22.0 ) Income from discontinued operations 25 181 (86.2 ) 447 (59.5 ) Net income 427 727 (41.3 ) 738 (1.5 ) All hotel operating statistics(2): RevPAR $ 140.35 $ 142.81 (1.7 )% $ 133.48 7.0 % Average room rate $ 196.70 $ 194.71 1.0 % $ 182.56 6.7 % Average occupancy 71.4 % 73.3 % (1.9) pts. 73.1 % 0.2 pts.

Sales for properties disposed of in both years have been reclassified as discontinued operations. See Discontinued Operations below. Comparable hotel RevPAR decreased 2.6%. The decrease in RevPAR was the result of a 2.4 percentage point decrease in occupancy which was slightly offset by a .7% increase in average room rates. Occupancy was negatively affected by the decrease in overall lodging demand. 46 Food and beverage revenues for our comparable hotels decreased 2.9%, primarily due to decreased sales from our catering and banquet business and meeting room rentals and the decline in occupancy at our hotels. Other revenues for our comparable hotels, which primarily represent spa, golf, parking, internet connectivity and other fees, were down slightly. While management evaluates the performance of each individual hotel against its competitive set in a given market, overall we evaluate the portfolio operating results using three different criteria: property type (i.e. urban, suburban, resort/conference or airport), geographic region and mix of business (i.e. transient, group or contract). Comparable Hotel Sales by Property Type The following tables set forth performance information for 2008 and 2007: Comparable Hotels Portfolio by Property Type(a) As of December 31, 2008 Year ended December 31, 2008 Year ended December 31, 2007 No. ofProperties No. ofRooms AverageRoomRate AverageOccupancyPercentages RevPAR AverageRoomRate AverageOccupancyPercentages RevPAR PercentChangeinRevPAR Urban 53 32,388 $ 215.42 74.1 % $ 159.60 $ 211.97 77.0 % $ 163.22 (2.2 )% Suburban 34 12,904 158.42 65.5 103.81 157.39 67.9 106.90 (2.9 ) Airport 15 7,208 138.39 74.0 102.45 139.04 75.3 104.72 (2.2 ) Resort/ Conference 13 8,082 248.61 69.0 171.45 253.45 70.7 179.12 (4.3 ) All Types 115 60,582 199.10 71.6 142.51 197.76 74.0 146.39 (2.6 ) (a) The reporting period for 2008 is from December 29, 2007 to December 26, 2008 and for 2007 is from December 30, 2006 to December 28, 2007 for our Marriott hotels. For further discussion, see Reporting Periods. For 2008, RevPAR decreased across all of our hotel property types. RevPAR at our resort/conference properties have been particularly affected by the current economic recession due to reduced consumer spending and increased travel costs. In particular, our Hawaiian properties have seen a dramatic decline in RevPAR as a result of decreased airlift to the Hawaiian islands and overall weak demand in this market. RevPAR at our urban, airport and suburban hotels also declined due to the overall decline in lodging demand. 47 Comparable Hotel Sales by Geographic Region The following tables set forth performance information for 2008 and 2007: Comparable Hotels by Region(a) As of December 31, 2008 Year ended December 31, 2008 Year ended December 31, 2007 No. ofProperties No. ofRooms AverageRoomRate AverageOccupancyPercentages RevPAR AverageRoomRate AverageOccupancyPercentages RevPAR PercentChange inRevPAR Pacific 27 15,934 $ 198.45 73.7 % $ 146.16 $ 200.99 75.9 % $ 152.60 (4.2 )% Mid Atlantic 11 8,684 266.72 79.2 211.16 260.84 82.6 215.51 (2.0 ) North Central 14 6,175 152.23 65.5 99.72 153.96 69.3 106.63 (6.5 ) Florida 9 5,676 211.20 69.7 147.21 209.60 69.6 145.95 0.9 New England 11 5,663 176.34 70.9 125.04 176.22 74.7 131.68 (5.0 ) DC Metro 13 5,666 199.15 74.5 148.30 198.34 75.6 150.03 (1.2 ) South Central 8 4,358 165.49 68.0 112.48 158.80 70.1 111.35 1.0 Mountain 8 3,364 170.73 64.6 110.35 166.75 67.9 113.22 (2.5 ) Atlanta 7 2,589 190.52 65.4 124.68 197.10 68.6 135.13 (7.7 ) International 7 2,473 170.63 68.1 116.22 156.37 69.3 108.30 7.3 All Regions 115 60,582 199.10 71.6 142.51 197.76 74.0 146.39 (2.6 ) (a) The reporting period for 2008 is from December 29, 2007 to December 26, 2008 and for 2007 is from December 30, 2006 to December 28, 2007 for our Marriott hotels. For further discussion, see Reporting Periods. In terms of RevPAR growth, our International region was the top performing region due to RevPAR growth at our Chilean and Canadian hotels and the impact of favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Comparable hotel RevPAR growth in our Florida region was driven by RevPAR growth at the Harbor Beach Marriott where we benefited from prior year disruption caused by rooms renovations and the Orlando World Center Marriott where significant discounting drove transient demand. RevPAR results were partially offset by rooms renovations at three hotels in the region, as well as the impact of Hurricane Fay. RevPAR growth in the South Central region was the result of year over year growth in our Houston market which had a strong fourth quarter due to Hurricane Ike induced demand as well as our San Antonio properties, which experienced strong group business because of recent renovations in the fourth quarter of 2007. The RevPAR decline in our Pacific region was driven by the 17.1% RevPAR decline at our Hawaiian properties and a 3.8% decline at our San Diego properties. The regions best performer based on RevPAR growth was the San Francisco market which had a 1.9% increase in RevPAR, however, the RevPAR growth was concentrated in the first half of the year, as RevPAR in San Francisco declined significantly in the fourth quarter. RevPAR in our New England region also declined, reflecting decreased demand at our Boston hotels due to fewer city wide events and softening leisure demand. In addition, we experienced higher group attrition and cancellations than in prior periods. The North Central region underperformed other regions, as results in Chicago were particularly weak due primarily to renovations at three of our Chicago properties and lower transient demand. The Atlanta region also underperformed in comparison to the overall portfolio due to weak group bookings, lower transient demand and increased supply. RevPAR in our Mountain region also declined as the Phoenix market continued to struggle due to lower group and transient demand and rooms renovations at two hotels. Hotel Sales by Business Mix. The majority of our customers fall into three broad groups: transient, group and contract business. The information below is derived from business mix data for 108 of our hotels for which business mix data is available from our managers. 48 In 2008, overall transient average daily rates decreased 1.3% when compared to last year while our overall group average room rate increased almost 3.9% over the prior year as most of the business was contracted prior to any significant downturn. We expect that booking pace will continue to slow as the weaker economy slows demand growth and, as a result, we expect increased competition in terms of pricing will put added pressure on rates. 2007 Compared to 2006 Hotel sales growth for 2007 was due to increases in RevPAR, as well as increases in food and beverage and other revenue items. Hotel sales for 2007 also reflect a full year of operations for the Starwood Portfolio and include $1,056 million and $755 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, from these properties. Sales for properties sold in both years have been reclassified as discontinued operations. See Discontinued Operations below. Comparable Hotel RevPAR increased 5.8% (as of December 31, 2007, 93 of our 119 hotels were classified as comparable hotels). The increase in RevPAR was the result of strong growth in average room rates and a slight increase in occupancy. The growth in average room rate was driven by increasing demand due to strong economic growth in the first half of 2007 and low growth in the supply of new luxury and upper upscale hotels. As a result of these trends, our operators were able to continue to increase room rates, while marginally improving the year over year occupancy levels. However, occupancy was affected at a number of our hotels by our capital expenditure program, which is described below, as well as weakness in individual markets. Food and beverage revenues for our comparable hotels increased 3.7%, primarily due to increased sales from our catering and banquet business and meeting room rentals. In addition, operating margins at our food and beverage outlets increased 1.1 percentage points. Other revenues for our comparable hotels, which primarily represent spa, golf, parking, internet connectivity and other fees, increased 7.4%.

For 2007, RevPAR increased across all of our hotel property types, led by our urban hotels, as we benefited from strong performance in several downtown markets such as Boston, New York, and San Francisco. We also experienced RevPAR growth at our suburban hotels due to strong performances at our suburban Boston, Denver and Los Angeles hotels. RevPAR growth at our airport hotels was led by our San Francisco and Houston airport hotels. RevPAR growth for our resort/convention hotels was moderate as several hotels were significantly affected by major renovations. 49 Comparable Hotel Sales by Geographic Region The following table sets forth performance information for 2007 and 2006: Comparable Hotels By Region(a) As of December 31, 2007 Year ended December 31, 2007 Year ended December 31, 2006 PercentChange inRevPAR No. ofProperties No. ofRooms AverageRoomRate AverageOccupancyPercentages RevPAR AverageRoomRate AverageOccupancyPercentages RevPAR Pacific 22 12,016 $ 211.60 75.1 % $ 158.90 $ 200.75 74.5 % $ 149.49 6.3 % Mid Atlantic 8 5,870 248.56 81.3 202.12 227.45 79.9 181.76 11.2 North Central 11 4,586 160.44 70.6 113.22 154.63 72.3 111.87 1.2 Florida 9 5,663 209.60 69.6 145.95 203.71 70.2 142.94 2.1 New England 6 3,032 182.63 77.8 142.10 170.11 76.9 130.81 8.6 DC Metro 12 5,399 197.41 75.4 148.78 192.23 73.1 140.51 5.9 South Central 7 4,126 152.88 70.5 107.77 144.72 71.6 103.63 4.0 Mountain 6 2,210 142.20 64.8 92.08 132.71 65.5 86.98 5.9 Atlanta 7 2,625 197.10 68.6 135.13 188.61 70.5 132.97 1.6 International 5 1,953 165.19 69.8 115.31 151.61 72.0 109.21 5.6 All Regions 93 47,480 197.75 73.5 145.37 187.05 73.4 137.36 5.8 (a) The reporting period for 2007 for our Marriott hotels is from December 30, 2006 to December 28, 2007 and for 2006 is from December 31, 2005 to December 29, 2006. For 2007, our Mid Atlantic region was the top performing region due to exceptional RevPAR growth by our New York City hotels driven by strong business and leisure transient demand and average room rate increases. The New England region also performed well due to increased city wide events in the Boston market, particularly during the second half of the year, as this market was affected by lower levels of group and transient demand during the first half of the year. Increases in RevPAR for our Pacific, DC Metro and Mountain regions were generally consistent with the levels for the overall portfolio. Increases in RevPAR in our Pacific region were driven by the Los Angeles and San Francisco markets. The Los Angeles market grew due to increased average room rates for transient business along with a strong group base. The San Francisco market had a strong year driven by city wide events. The growth in the DC Metro region was driven by the performance of our downtown hotels, which was partially offset by weak performance by our suburban properties in the region. RevPAR growth during the year in the Florida region was moderate, as group activity was slow due to hurricane concerns and renovation displacement at several hotels including the Harbor Beach Marriott Resort and Spa and the Tampa Marriott Waterside Hotel and Marina. The weak RevPAR growth in the Atlanta region was due to lower levels of occupancy, as city wide demand decreased from the unusually strong performance in 2006 that reflected business relocation from New Orleans due to Hurricane Katrina. However, in the fourth quarter, the Atlanta region experienced RevPAR increases due to strong group bookings in the mid town area. The North Central region under performed the portfolio primarily due to weakness in the Chicago market. Hotel Sales by Business Mix. In 2007, relatively strong demand levels allowed our operators to increase average daily room rates, particularly in the corporate transient segments. Overall transient average daily rates increased 7% when compared to last year and our overall group average room rate for these hotels increased almost 5%. 50 2008 compared to 2007 and 2007 compared to 2006 Property level Operating Expenses 2008 2007 % Change2008 to 2007 2006 % Change2007 to 2006 (in millions) (in millions) Rooms $ 792 $ 787 0.6 % $ 695 13.2 % Food and beverage 1,171 1,192 (1.8 ) 1,080 10.4 Other departmental and support expenses 1,304 1,287 1.3 1,156 11.3 Management fees 247 269 (8.2 ) 223 20.6 Other property level expenses 393 393 359 9.5 Depreciation and amortization 582 516 12.8 449 14.9 Total property level operating expenses $ 4,489 $ 4,444 1.0 $ 3,962 12.2 Property level operating expenses increased each year from 2006 through 2008 due to several factors. In 2008, the 1% increase was primarily due to an increase in depreciation expense due to our extensive $1.8 billion capital expenditure program from 2006 to 2008. This was offset by a decline in revenue driven costs, primarily management fees, reflecting our decline in operations during the second half of the year. By contrast, in 2007, all property level costs increased, reflecting inflation, increases in revenue driven costs and the effect of our capital expenditures on our depreciation expense. Our operating costs and expenses, which are both fixed and variable, are affected by changes in occupancy, inflationary increases and revenues, though the effect on specific costs will differ. For example, utility costs include a fixed component but will increase based on occupancy and with inflation, while depreciation expense is fixed except for the effects of property transactions (i.e. acquisitions, capital expenditures, dispositions, etc.). Similarly, management fees are directly affected by total revenues, as well as the level of operating profit at each property. Additionally, 2008 and 2007 property level operating expenses include the property level expenses of the Starwood Portfolio for a full year of approximately $844 million and $843 million, respectively. Comparatively, property level operating expenses for 2006 include Starwood Portfolio expenses for the period from April 10, 2006 (the purchase date) through December 31, 2006 of $593 million. Property level operating expenses exclude the costs associated with hotels we have sold, which are included in discontinued operations. Other Income Statement Line Items Corporate and Other Expenses. Corporate and other expenses primarily consist of employee salaries and benefits including stock based compensation expense, as well as other costs such as travel, corporate insurance, audit fees, building rent and system costs. Corporate expenses decreased approximately $11 million in 2008 from 2007 and approximately $25 million in 2007 from 2006 due to the decrease in compensation expense recorded for our liability classified stock based compensation awards as the market performance criteria for the issuance of our restricted stock were not met and fewer shares were earned. Additionally, 2006 included non recurring costs of approximately $7 million associated with the Starwood acquisition. Gain on Insurance Settlement. We recorded a gain on insurance settlement of $7 million in 2008, $51 million in 2007 and $13 million in 2006. The gains primarily relate to the insurance proceeds received for both business interruption and property damage following Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma which occurred during September and October 2005. The hurricanes caused substantial business interruption and property damage at our New Orleans Marriott and at five of our hotels located in southern Florida. During 2008, the gain of $7 million primarily represents the release of contingencies related to an insurance settlement reached for business interruption incurred at the New Orleans Marriott. During 2007, we recognized a gain of $30 million related to business interruption insurance proceeds received as a result of lost profit primarily at our New Orleans Marriott. Additionally, all of the insurance gains of $13 million in 2006 represent business interruption insurance proceeds. 51 The remaining gain of $21 million in 2007 related to insurance proceeds for property damage sustained by these properties. The gain represents the insurance proceeds received in excess of the insurance receivable recorded on the balance sheet at the date of loss. The insurance receivable reflected the book value of the property and equipment written off and repairs and maintenance costs incurred from the hurricanes. We recognize the gains on insurance settlements once all contingencies are met, and, as a result, none of the property insurance proceeds were recognized in income during 2005 or 2006. Interest Income. The $17 million decline in interest income for 2008 when compared to 2007 is primarily due to lower interest rates during 2008, as well as a slightly lower weighted average cash balance for the full year 2008 compared to 2007. The increase of $4 million from 2006 to 2007 was primarily due to an increase in the weighted average cash balance in 2007. Interest Expense. The decrease of $81 million in interest expense for 2008 is primarily due to an expense of $45 million related to call premiums and the acceleration of the amortization of deferred financing costs associated with debt prepayments during 2007 compared to an $18 million gain in 2008 related to the repurchase of $100 million principal amount of our 2004 Debentures. The decline in interest expense also reflects the decrease in our weighted average interest rate of 0.2 percentage points to 5.8%. The decrease of $28 million in interest expense in 2007 is primarily due to a net decrease in debt of approximately $253 million and a decrease in our weighted average interest rate of 0.8 percentage points to 6.0%. The decrease is partially offset by call premiums and the acceleration of the amortization of deferred financing costs associated with debt prepayments totaling $45 million for 2007 compared to similar costs of $17 million for 2006. Minority Interest Expense. Minority interest expense decreased $11 million in 2008 and $9 million in 2007 due to a decline in the net income of Host LP during both years. Host LP net income reflects the operations at our hotels and is significantly affected by the gain on dispositions, which were $23 million, $164 million and $416 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Affiliates. In 2008, our share of income of affiliates decreased by $21 million compared to 2007 primarily due to a decrease in earnings from our joint venture in Europe and the write off of costs associated with a terminated transaction. However, in 2007, our share of income of affiliates increased by $17 million compared to 2006 primarily due to an increase in earnings from our European joint venture, which was formed in April of 2006. Discontinued Operations. Discontinued operations consist of two hotels disposed of in 2008, nine hotels disposed of during 2007 and seven hotels disposed of in 2006 and represent the results of operations and the gains on the disposition of these hotels during the periods. The following table summarizes the revenues, income before taxes, and the gain on dispositions, net of tax, of the hotels which have been reclassified to discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented (in millions): 2008 2007 2006 Revenues $ 6 $ 50 $ 178 Income before taxes 2 18 31 Gain on disposals, net of tax 23 164 416 Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview We seek to maintain a capital structure and liquidity profile with an appropriate balance of cash, debt and equity to provide financial flexibility given the inherent volatility in the lodging industry. During this period of 52 economic uncertainty, we have taken several steps to preserve capital and increase liquidity, including the third quarter draw of $200 million on our credit facility, the reduction of our dividend beginning in the fourth quarter and the implementation of cost savings initiatives at both the corporate and hotel level which will include a reduction in 2009 in capital expenditures to approximately one half of the 2008 level. We believe, as a result of all of the above mentioned efforts and the overall strength of our balance sheet, we have sufficient liquidity and access to capital markets to withstand the anticipated decline in operating cash flow in 2009 and pay our debt maturities, fund our capital expenditure programs and maintain compliance with our debt financial covenants. We continue to maintain higher than historical cash levels due to uncertainty in the credit markets and we intend to do so until the credit markets stabilize. Cash Requirements. We use cash for acquisitions, capital expenditures, debt payments, operating costs, corporate and other expenses and dividends to stockholders. As a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our taxable income (excluding net capital gain) to our stockholders. Our sources of cash are cash from operations, proceeds from the sale of assets, borrowings under our credit facility and our ability to obtain additional financing through various capital markets. Set forth below is a schedule of our debt maturities through 2011. Our near term debt maturities in 2009 and 2010 are relatively low. While maturities in 2011 total $825 million, they include borrowings under the revolver portion of the credit facility, as well as the $210 million credit facility term loan and the Orlando Marriott World Center mortgage, all of which are subject to extension at our option if certain requirements are met. See Financial Condition for more information on our debt maturities.

(2) Our 3.25% Exchangeable Senior Debentures are due in 2024 but are subject to a put option by the holders in 2010. (3) This mortgage is subject to two, one year extension options provided that debt coverage exceeds certain ratios and other conditions are met. (4) Our credit facility may be extended for one year provided that our leverage ratio is below 6.75x. See Financial Condition for further discussion. As of December 31, 2008, we had $508 million of cash and cash equivalents, which was an increase of $20 million from December 31, 2007. In the first quarter of 2009, we paid the fourth quarter common and preferred dividends of $29 million and received $113 million net proceeds from the sale of the Hyatt Regency Boston, including the return of reserves held by the manager. We also have $400 million available under our credit facility. During 2009, our primary uses of cash will be debt maturities, capital expenditures at our hotels and REIT distribution requirements. Additionally, we may take advantage of the ability to satisfy up to 90% of our dividend requirements through the issuance of common stock dividends in order to conserve cash. 53 Capital Resources. We depend primarily on external sources of capital to finance future growth, including acquisitions. As a result, the liquidity and debt capacity provided by our credit facility and the ability to issue senior unsecured debt are key components of our capital structure. Therefore, our financial flexibility (including our ability to incur debt, pay dividends and make investments) is contingent on our ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants, which include, among others, the allowable amounts of leverage, coverage and fixed charges. Since 2003, we have improved our financial covenant ratios through a number of transactions that have extended our weighted average maturity and reduced interest costs. As a result of these efforts, our weighted average interest rate has declined significantly, from 7.7% at December 31, 2003 to 5.8% at December 31, 2008 and our weighted average maturities have remained consistent at approximately five years. Additionally, since December 31, 2006, we have reduced our secured mortgage indebtedness by approximately 29% to $1.4 billion, which represents approximately 24% of our overall indebtedness and is secured by 14 of our hotels. As of December 31, 2008, approximately 80% of our hotels (as measured by revenues) are unencumbered by mortgage debt. Given the flexibility provided by the structure of our balance sheet, we will look to access both the market for our senior notes and the secured mortgage debt markets, based on relative pricing and capacity, to fund our cash requirements. We may, at any time, seek to access such markets in the event that we determine that the terms and conditions available to us are advantageous based upon prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other circumstances. See Financial Condition for further discussion of our restrictive covenants. Debt transactions. During 2008, we entered into a $210 million term loan and borrowed $200 million of our available $600 million capacity under the revolver portion of our credit facility. We also refinanced our $208 million mortgage loan on the Orlando World Center Marriott through the issuance of a $300 million floating rate mortgage loan. In addition, we repurchased $100 million principal amount of our 3.25% Exchangeable Senior Debentures for approximately $82 million, for a gain of approximately $18 million in 2008. As of December 31, 2008, our debt has an average maturity of 4.6 years and a weighted average interest rate of 5.8%. In addition to the above financing activities, we paid approximately $16 million of principal amortization of mortgage debt in 2008 and repaid the $33.5 million mortgage secured by our Scottsdale Marriott at McDowell Mountains, which matured in December 2008. We may continue to redeem or refinance senior notes and mortgage debt from time to time, taking advantage of favorable market conditions when available. We may purchase senior notes for cash through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, a tender offer or, in some cases, through the early redemption of such securities pursuant to their terms. Repurchases of debt, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. Any refinancing or retirement before the maturity date would affect earnings and Funds From Operations, or FFO per diluted share, as defined below, as a result of the payment of any applicable call premiums and the acceleration of previously deferred financing costs. Specifically, interest expense includes $45 million for 2007 for call premiums, the acceleration of deferred financing costs and original issue discount and the termination of related interest rate swap agreements associated with debt prepayments. Counterparty Credit Risk. We are subject to counterparty credit risk, which relates to the ability of counterparties to meet their contractual payment obligations or the potential non performance of counterparties to deliver contracted commodities or services at the contracted price. As a result of the recent bankruptcy and insolvency of several high profile, well respected financial institutions, we have performed additional assessments to determine the impact, if any, of these market developments on our financial condition. We are exposed to credit risk with respect to cash held at various financial institutions, access to our credit facility, the amounts due and services performed by our managers and amounts due or payable under our derivative contracts. Currently, our credit exposure in each of these cases is limited. Our exposure with regard to our cash and the $400 million available under our credit facility is mitigated as the credit risk is spread among a diversified group of investment grade financial institutions. Amounts due from the managers of our hotels generally reflect the operations of the hotel in the immediately preceding period and the working capital at the hotels. These amounts 54 totaled $65 million as of December 31, 2008 and we consider the risk that our managers will fail to meet the payment obligations to be remote. Currently, our exposure risk related to our derivative contracts totals $6 million and the counterparties are investment grade financial institutions. Equity Transactions. On February 19, 2008, Hosts Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $500 million of common stock and equity related securities. The securities may be purchased in the open market or through private transactions, depending upon market conditions. The plan does not obligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares and may be suspended at any time at our discretion. As of December 31, 2008, the Company has repurchased 6.5 million common shares valued at approximately $100 million and repurchased $100 million principal amount of our 3.25% Exchangeable Senior Debentures for approximately $82 million. As a result of these purchases, we currently have approximately $318 million left under the Boards authorization for future repurchases. Non cash Investing and Financing Activities. On March 12, 2008, we acquired the remaining limited partnership interests in Pacific Gateway Ltd., a subsidiary partnership of Host LP, which owns the San Diego Marriott Hotel and Marina, and other economic rights formerly held by our outside partner, including the right to receive 1.7% of the hotels sales, in exchange for 5,575,540 limited partnership units of Host LP. The OP units were valued at $93 million based on the closing stock price on such date for Host, or $16.68. Acquisitions and Dispositions. On February 17, 2009, we disposed of the Hyatt Regency Boston for net proceeds of approximately $113 million, including the return of reserves held by the manager. We anticipate that we will recognize a gain on the disposition of approximately $20 million, net of tax, in 2009. During 2008, we disposed of two domestic properties for total proceeds of approximately $39 million and recorded a gain of approximately $23 million, net of tax. In April 2008, the European joint venture acquired the Crowne Plaza Amsterdam City Centre for approximately 72 million (US $113 million), including our investment of 3 million (US $5 million) and the issuance of approximately 53.3 million of mortgage debt. We may acquire additional properties through various structures, including transactions involving single assets, portfolios, joint ventures and acquisitions of all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other REITs or similar real estate entities. We anticipate that our acquisitions will be financed through a combination of methods, including proceeds from sales of properties from our existing portfolio, the incurrence of debt, available cash, advances under our credit facility, proceeds from equity offerings of Host, or issuance of OP units by Host LP. Capital Expenditures. During 2008, we continued our extensive capital expenditure program, which included the renovation of approximately 11,900 rooms and approximately 465,000 square feet of meeting space. In 2008, our capital expenditures totaled $695 million, including the application of $23 million of deposits made in 2007. For 2008, renewal and replacement capital expenditures were approximately $374 million, as compared to $267 million in 2007. Our renewal and replacement capital expenditures are generally funded by the furniture, fixtures and equipment funds established at certain of our hotels (typically funded with approximately 5% of property revenues) and by our available cash. We also spent approximately $321 million on repositioning/ROI and value enhancement projects in 2008, as compared to $346 million in 2007. These projects are expected to enhance the competitiveness of our properties and should help drive operating performance, particularly during the current economic recession, by separating and differentiating our properties from those of our competitors. As a result of this extensive capital expenditure program, we believe that our properties will remain in a strong competitive position with respect to their market competitors despite our planned reduction in capital expenditures in 2009. Sources and Uses of Cash During 2008, our primary sources of cash included cash from operations, proceeds from debt issuances and refinancings and proceeds from hotel dispositions. Uses of cash during the year primarily consisted of capital 55 expenditures, dividend payments, stock repurchases and debt repayments and repurchases. Significant uses of cash during 2009 will include the repayment or repurchase of our debt maturing in the near term, capital expenditures at our hotels and dividends on our common and preferred stock. Other uses may include, among others, investment in our European and Asian joint ventures or hotel acquisitions. We anticipate that our primary sources of cash for 2009 will include cash from operations and proceeds from hotel dispositions and debt or equity issuances. Cash Provided by Operations. Our cash provided by operations for 2008 increased $19 million to $1.0 billion compared to 2007, due primarily to a reduction in interest expense which was partially offset by declines in operations at our hotels. Cash Used in Investing Activities. Approximately $716 million of cash was used in investing activities during 2008. This included approximately $672 million of capital expenditures (net of the $23 million deposit) and $77 million of investments primarily in our European joint venture, partially offset by $38 million of proceeds from the dispositions of the Sheraton Tampa Suites Airport and the Host Airport Hotel Sacramento.

The portfolio transaction was terminated in 2008 and therefore the European joint venture returned approximately $40 million of these funds in January 2009. (2) Represents our investment for the acquisition of three hotels located in Brussels, Belgium. 56 Cash Provided by/Used in Financing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $284 million for 2008, as compared to $685 million in 2007. During 2008 and 2007, cash used in financing activities consisted of debt prepayments or repurchases and equity repurchases of approximately $427 million and $1.3 billion, respectively, and scheduled principal repayments of $16 million and $35 million, respectively. Cash provided by financing activities in 2008 and 2007 included the issuance of debt securities for proceeds of approximately $702 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, net of financing costs. During 2008 and 2007, our common stock dividend payments increased $78 million to $522 million as the 2008 dividend payments included the payment of the $.40 per share fourth quarter 2007 dividend compared to the $.25 fourth quarter 2006 dividend that was paid in 2007. We also paid $9 million for both 2008 and 2007, respectively, of dividends on our preferred stock. 57 The following table summarizes significant debt (net of deferred financing costs) and equity transactions since the beginning of January 2007 (in millions): TransactionDate Description of Transaction TransactionAmount Debt December 2008 Repayment of 6.08% mortgage on the Scottsdale McDowell Mountains $ (34 ) October November 2008 Repurchase of $100 million aggregate principal of the 2004 Exchangeable Senior Debentures (82 ) September 2008 Draw on the credit facility revolver 200 June 2008 Proceeds from 4.93% Orlando World Center Marriott mortgage refinancing(1) 296 June 2008 Repayment of the 7.48% mortgage on the Orlando World Center Marriott (208 ) May 2008 Proceeds from the credit facility term loan 44 April 2008 Repayment of the credit facility revolver (100 ) April 2008 Proceeds from the credit facility term loan 162 March 2008 Draw on the credit facility revolver 100 October 2007 Repayment of New Orleans Marriott, San Antonio Marriott Rivercenter, San Ramon Marriott and Santa Clara Marriott mortgages with an interest rate of 8.22% (190 ) June 2007 Repayment of 9.375% senior notes (6 ) May 2007 Defeasance of 7.61% CMBS loan (514 ) April 2007 Prepayment of the Philadelphia Marriott Convention Center mortgages with a weighted average interest rate of 8.52% (96 ) April 2007 Prepayment of the 8.41% Four Seasons Hotel, Atlanta mortgage (33 ) March 2007 Proceeds from the issuance of 2007 Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2027 589 March 2007 Prepayment of the 7.42% mortgage on the JW Marriott, Washington, D.C.(2) (88 ) March 2007 Proceeds from the issuance of the 5.53% mortgage loan secured by the Ritz Carlton, Naples and Newport Beach Marriott Hotel & Spa 298 March 2007 Repayment of the credit facility revolver (175 ) February 2007 Proceeds from 5.55% Harbor Beach Marriott mortgage refinancing 134 February 2007 Repayment of 8.58% Harbor Beach mortgage (88 ) January 2007 Repayment of the credit facility revolver (75 ) 2008/2007 Principal amortization (51 ) Net debt transactions $ 83 Equity March August 2008 Common stock repurchases $ (100 ) Net equity transactions $ (100 ) (1) The Orlando World Center Marriott mortgage loan has a floating rate of interest of LIBOR plus 350 basis points.

See Financial Condition for further discussion. Similarly, the $300 million mortgage loan on the Orlando World Center Marriott, which also matures in 2011, can be extended for two, one year periods, subject to achieving a certain debt coverage ratio and other conditions. Senior Notes General. The following summary is a description of the material provisions of the indentures governing our various senior notes issued by Host LP, which we refer to collectively as the senior notes indenture. We pay interest on each series of our outstanding senior notes at specified dates in arrears at the respective annual rates indicated on the table above. Under the terms of our senior notes indenture, our senior notes are equal in right of payment with all of Host LPs unsubordinated indebtedness and senior to all subordinated obligations of Host LP. The notes outstanding under our senior notes indenture are guaranteed by certain of our existing subsidiaries and currently are secured by pledges of equity interests in many of our subsidiaries. The guarantees and pledges ratably benefit the notes outstanding under our senior notes indenture, as well as our credit facility, certain other senior debt, and interest rate swap agreements and other hedging agreements with lenders that are parties to the credit facility. The pledges are permitted to be released in the event that our leverage ratio falls below 6.0x for 59 two consecutive fiscal quarters. Because our leverage ratio is below this threshold, we have the right to release all pledges at any time. In October 2005, we exercised this right for pledges of capital stock that would have been otherwise required subsequent to this date. Restrictive Covenants. Under the terms of the senior notes indenture, our ability to incur indebtedness and pay dividends is subject to restrictions and the satisfaction of various conditions, including the achievement of an EBITDA to interest coverage ratio of at least 2.0x by Host LP. Furthermore, Host LP is able to make distributions to enable Host to pay dividends on its preferred stock under the senior notes indenture when our EBITDA to interest coverage ratio is above 1.7 to 1.0. This ratio is calculated in accordance with the terms of our senior notes indenture based on pro forma results for the four prior fiscal quarters giving effect to transactions such as acquisitions, dispositions and financings, as if they occurred at the beginning of the period. Under the terms of our senior notes indenture, interest expense excludes items such as the gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt, deferred financing charges related to the senior notes or the credit facility, amortization of debt premiums or discounts that were recorded at acquisition of a loan to establish the debt at fair value, and, in 2009, approximately $30 million of interest expense to be recorded as a result of the adoption of FSP APB 14 1 relating to our exchangeable debentures, all of which are included in interest expense on our consolidated statements of operations. Other covenants limiting our ability to incur indebtedness and pay dividends include maintaining total indebtedness of less than 65% of adjusted total assets (using undepreciated real estate values) excluding intangible assets and secured indebtedness of less than 45% of adjusted total assets. So long as we maintain the required level of interest coverage and satisfy these and other conditions in the senior notes indenture, we may pay preferred or common dividends and incur additional debt under the senior notes indenture, including debt incurred in connection with an acquisition. In addition, even if we are below the coverage levels otherwise required to incur debt and pay dividends, we are still permitted to incur certain types of debt, including (i) credit facility debt, (ii) refinancing debt, (iii) up to $300 million of mortgage debt whose proceeds would be used to repay debt under credit facility (and permanently reduce our ability to borrow under the credit facility by such amount), and (iv) up to $100 million of other debt. Our senior notes indenture also imposes restrictions on customary matters, such as our ability to pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our equity interests; make investments; permit payment or dividend restrictions on certain of our subsidiaries; sell assets; guarantee indebtedness; enter into transactions with affiliates; create certain liens; and sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies. Our senior notes indenture also imposes a requirement to maintain unencumbered assets (as defined in the indenture as undepreciated property value) of not less than 125% of the aggregate amount of senior note debt plus other debt not secured by mortgages. This coverage requirement must be maintained at all times and is distinct from the coverage requirements necessary to incur debt or pay dividends discussed above (whose consequences, where we fall below the coverage level, are limited to restricting our ability to incur new debt or pay dividends, but which would not otherwise cause a default under our senior notes indenture). As of December 31, 2008, we are in compliance with all of our financial covenants under our senior notes indentures. 2007 Exchangeable Senior Debentures. On March 23, 2007, Host LP issued $600 million 25/8% Exchangeable Senior Debentures (the 2007 Debentures) and received proceeds of $589 million, net of underwriting fees and expenses and original issue discount. The 2007 Debentures mature on April 15, 2027 and are equal in right of payment with all of our other senior notes. Interest is payable quarterly in arrears on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year beginning on July 15, 2007. We can redeem for cash all, or part of, the 2007 Debentures at any time on or after April 20, 2012 upon 15 days notice at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. Holders have the right to require us to repurchase the 2007 Debentures on April 15, 2012, April 15, 2017 and April 15, 2022 for cash equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. Holders may exchange their 2007 Debentures prior to maturity under certain conditions, including when the closing sale price of Hosts common stock is more than 130% of the exchange price per share for at least 20 of 30 consecutive trading days during certain periods or any time up to two days prior to the date on which the debentures have been called for redemption. On exchange, we must deliver cash in an amount equal to not less than the lower of the exchange value (which is the applicable exchange rate multiplied by the average price of our common shares) and the aggregate principal amount of the 2007 60 Debentures to be exchanged and, at our option, shares, cash or a combination thereof for any excess above the principal value. If we elect to redeem the debentures and the exchange value exceeds the cash redemption price, we would expect holders to elect to exchange their debentures at the exchange value described above rather than receive the cash redemption price. The current exchange rate is 31.35 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of debentures, which is equivalent to an exchange price of $31.90 per share of Host common stock. The exchange rate may be adjusted under certain circumstances including the payment of common dividends exceeding $.20 per share in any given quarter. The 2007 Debentures are not currently exchangeable. 2004 Exchangeable Senior Debentures. On March 16, 2004, Host LP issued $500 million of 3.25% Exchangeable Senior Debentures (the 2004 Debentures) and received net proceeds of $484 million, net of discounts, underwriting fees and expenses. During 2008, we repurchased $100 million principal amount of the 2004 Debentures for approximately $82 million and recorded a gain on the repurchase of approximately $18 million. The outstanding 2004 Debentures mature on April 15, 2024 and are equal in right of payment with all of our other senior notes. Interest is payable quarterly in arrears on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year. Holders have the right to require us to repurchase the 2004 Debentures on April 15, 2010, April 15, 2014 and April 15, 2019 for cash equal to 100% of the principal amount. Holders may exchange their 2004 Debentures prior to maturity under certain conditions, including at any time at which the closing sale price of our common stock is more than 120% of the exchange price per share, for at least 20 of 30 consecutive trading days during certain periods or any time up to two days prior to the date on which the debentures have been called for redemption. The current exchange rate is 63.3687 shares for each $1,000 of principal amount of the 2004 Debentures, (which is equivalent to an exchange price of $15.78 per share). The exchange rate is adjusted for certain circumstances, including the payment of common dividends. We can redeem for cash all, or part of, the 2004 Debentures at any time subsequent to April 19, 2009 upon 30 days notice at the applicable redemption price as set forth in the indenture. If we elect to redeem the debentures and the exchange value exceeds the cash redemption price, we would expect holders to elect to exchange their debentures for stock rather than receive the cash redemption price. The 2004 Debentures are not currently exchangeable. Credit Facility General. On May 25, 2007, we entered into a second amended and restated bank credit facility with Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, as Administrative Agent, Bank of America, N.A., as Syndication Agent, Citicorp North America Inc., Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale and Calyon New York Branch, as Co Documentation Agents and certain other agents and lenders. The credit facility provides aggregate revolving loan commitments in the amount of $600 million. During any period in which our leverage ratio equals or exceeds 7.0x, new borrowings are limited to such amount as does not cause the aggregate outstanding principal amount under the credit facility to exceed $300 million. The credit facility also includes subcommitments for (i) the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount of $10 million and (ii) loans in certain foreign currencies in an aggregate amount of $300 million, (A) $150 million of which may be loaned to certain of our Canadian subsidiaries in Canadian Dollars and (B) $300 million of which may be loaned to us in Pounds Sterling and Euros. The credit facility has an initial scheduled maturity of September 2011. We have an option to extend the maturity for an additional year if certain conditions are met as of September 2011. These conditions include the payment of a fee to the lenders, that no default or event of default exists and maintaining a leverage ratio below 6.75x. Subject to certain conditions, we also have the option to increase the amount of the facility by up to $190 million to the extent that any one or more lenders, whether or not currently party to the credit facility, commits to be a lender for such amount. In the second quarter of 2008, we entered into a $210 million term loan under the credit facility. The term loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 175 basis points, with a LIBOR floor of 2.25% for an all in rate of 4.0% at December 31, 2008. We also have the option to pay interest based on the higher of the overnight Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points and the Prime Lending Rate, plus, in both cases, the applicable spread of 75 basis points. In September 2008, we also borrowed $200 million under the revolver portion of our credit facility at a rate of LIBOR plus 65 basis points based on our current leverage. Based on our current leverage, we have $400 million of remaining available capacity under the revolver portion of our credit facility. 61 The obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed by certain of our existing subsidiaries and are currently secured by pledges of equity interests in many of our subsidiaries. The pledges are permitted to be released in the event that certain conditions are satisfied, including the requirement that our leverage ratio falls below 6.0x for two consecutive fiscal quarters. As a result of having satisfied such conditions, currently we are not required to pledge our equity interests in any newly acquired or formed subsidiary, and at our election, we may obtain a release of all existing pledges for so long as our leverage ratio continues to be below 6.0x. The guarantees and pledges ratably benefit our credit facility, as well as the notes outstanding under our senior notes indenture and interest rate swap agreements and other hedging agreements with lenders that are parties to the credit facility. Financial Covenants. The credit facility contains covenants concerning allowable leverage, fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage. Prior to the end of our third quarter of 2009, we are permitted to make borrowings and maintain amounts outstanding under the credit facility so long as our leverage ratio is not in excess of 7.5x and our unsecured coverage ratio is not less than 1.75x. Thereafter, the maximum leverage ratio under the credit facility is reduced to 7.25x, with the minimum unsecured coverage ratio continuing to be set at 1.75x. In all cases, if our leverage ratio equals or exceeds 7.0x, new borrowings are limited to such amount as does not cause the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the credit facility to exceed $300 million. However, to the extent our borrowings under the credit facility revolver exceed $300 million on the date that our leverage ratio exceeds 7.0x, we are not required to repay the excess for one year. The financial covenants for the credit facility do not apply when there are no borrowings under the credit facility. Hence, so long as there are no amounts outstanding, we would not be in default if we do not satisfy the financial covenants and we do not lose the potential to draw under the credit facility in the future if we were ever to come back into compliance with the financial covenants. These calculations are performed in accordance with our credit facility based on pro forma results for the prior four fiscal quarters giving effect to transactions such as acquisitions, dispositions and financings as if they occurred at the beginning of the period. Under the terms of the credit facility, interest expense excludes items such as the gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt, deferred financing charges related to the senior notes or the credit facility, amortization of debt premiums or discounts that were recorded at acquisition of a loan to establish the debt at fair value, and, in 2009, approximately $30 million of interest expense to be recorded as a result of the adoption of FSP APB 14 1 relating to our exchangeable debentures, all of which are included in interest expense on our consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, total debt used in the calculation of our leverage ratio is based on a net debt concept under which cash and cash equivalents in excess of $100 million is deducted from our total debt balance. As of December 31, 2008, our leverage ratio was 4.1x versus the 7.5x maximum leverage ratio allowed under the credit facility, our fixed charge coverage ratio was 2.8x versus the 1.0x minimum fixed charge coverage ratio allowed under the credit facility and our unsecured interest coverage ratio was 4.1x versus the minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio of 1.75x allowed under the credit facility. Accordingly, we are in compliance with all of our financial covenants under the credit facility as of December 31, 2008. The following table summarizes the financial tests contained in the credit facility: Financial Covenant Levels Year Minimum unsecuredinterest coverage ratio(a) Maximum leverage ratio(b) Minimum fixed chargecoverage ratio 2009 1.75 7.5 1.05 2010 1.75 7.25 1.10 2011 1.75 7.25 1.15 (a) If, at any time our leverage ratio is above 7.0x, our minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio will lower to 1.5x. (b) The maximum leverage ratio declines to 7.25x in September 2009. Interest and Fees. We pay interest on revolver borrowings under the credit facility at floating rates plus a margin that is set with reference to our leverage ratio. In the case of LIBOR borrowings in US Dollars, as well as Euros and Pounds Sterling denominated borrowings, the rate of interest ranges from 65 basis points to 150 basis points over LIBOR. We also have the option to pay interest based on the higher of the overnight Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points and the Prime Lending Rate, plus, in both cases, the applicable spread ranging from 0 to 62 50 basis points. Based on our current leverage ratio of 4.1x, we can borrow at a rate of LIBOR plus 70 basis points or Prime plus 0 basis points. To the extent that amounts under the credit facility remain unused, we pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unused portion of the loan commitment of 10 to 15 basis points, depending on our average revolver usage during the applicable period. Other Covenants. The credit facility contains restrictive covenants on customary matters. Certain covenants become less restrictive at any time that our leverage ratio falls below 6.0x. In particular, at any time that our leverage ratio is below 6.0x, we will not be subject to limitations on capital expenditures, and the limitations on acquisitions, investments and dividends contained in the credit facility will be superseded by the generally less restrictive corresponding covenants in our senior notes indenture. Additionally, the credit facilitys restrictions on incurrence of debt and the payment of dividends are generally consistent with our senior notes indenture. These provisions, under certain circumstances, limit debt incurrence to debt incurred under the credit facility or in connection with a refinancing, and limit dividend payments to those necessary to maintain our tax status as a REIT. Mortgage and Other Debt General. As of December 31, 2008, we had 14 hotels that were secured by mortgage debt. Substantially all of our mortgage debt is recourse solely to specific assets except in instances of fraud, misapplication of funds and other customary recourse provisions. As of December 31, 2008, secured debt represented approximately 24% of our total debt and our aggregate secured debt had an average interest rate of 6.2% and an average maturity of 4.3 years. The following table summarizes our outstanding debt and scheduled amortization and maturities related to mortgage and other debt as of December 31, 2008 (in millions): Balance as ofDecember 31,2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Mortgage Debt Orlando Marriott World Center, 4.93%, due 7/1/2011(1) $ 300 $ $ $ 300 $ $ $ San Diego Marriott Hotel and Marina, 8.45%, due 7/1/2009 175 175 Atlanta Marriott Marquis, 7.4%, due2/11/2023(2) 129 5 5 5 6 6 102 Westin Kierland, 5.08%, due 12/1/2009 134 134 Harbor Beach Marriott Resort and Spa, 5.55%, due 3/1/2014 134 134 The Ritz Carlton, Naples and Newport Beach Marriott Hotel and Spa, 5.531%, due 3/1/2014 300 300 Desert Springs, a JW Marriott Resort and Spa, 7.8%, due 12/11/2022(2) 80 3 4 4 4 4 61 The Westin Tabor Center, 8.51%, due 12/11/2023 41 1 1 1 1 1 36 Other mortgage debt(3) 143 3 1 105 34 Total mortgage debt 1,436 321 11 415 11 11 667 Other Debt Philadelphia Airport Marriott industrial revenue bonds, 7 3/4%, due 12/1/2017 40 40 Industrial revenue bonds and other(4) 47 47 Total other debt 87 87 Total mortgage and other debt $ 1,523 $ 321 $ 11 $ 415 $ 11 $ 11 $ 754 63 (1) This floating rate mortgage is based on LIBOR plus 350 basis points. The rate shown is the rate in effect as of December 31, 2008. (2) Beginning in 2010, the interest rate on these loans increases a minimum of 200 basis points and all excess cash (as defined in the loan agreement) generated by the partnerships that own these properties is applied to principal; however, the loans can be repaid without a premium or penalty on that date. The amortization presented is the minimum principal payment considering the increase in interest rate, but does not include additional principal payments based on excess cash flow. (3) Other mortgage debt consists of individual mortgage debt amounts that are less than $40 million, have an average interest rate of 6.1% at December 31, 2008 and mature through 2022. Beginning in 2009, the interest rate on one of these loans, the Westin Indianapolis, with a principal balance of $34 million increases a minimum of 500 basis points and all excess cash (as defined in the loan agreement) generated by the partnership that owns the property is applied to principal; however, the loan can be repaid without a premium or penalty on that date. We have notified the lender that we will prepay this loan in March 2009. The amortization presented is the minimum principal payment considering the increase in interest rate, but does not include additional principal payments based on excess cash flow. (4) Industrial revenue bonds and other consist of loans with an average interest rate of 7.1% that mature through 2016, and capital leases with varying interest rates and maturity dates. Mortgage Debt of Consolidated and Unconsolidated Partner Interests For the entities that we consolidate in our financial statements that have third party minority partnership interests, the proportion of mortgage debt included in the above table that is attributable to the minority owners, based on their percentage of ownership of the partnerships, is approximately $68 million. Additionally, we have minority interests in partnerships and joint ventures that are not consolidated and are accounted for under the equity method. The proportion of the mortgage and other debt of these partnerships attributable to us, based on our percentage of ownership of the partnerships, was $356 million at December 31, 2008. Approximately 90% of this debt balance is attributable to our 32.1% ownership interest in the European joint venture. The mortgage debt related to our European joint venture hotels contains operating covenants that could result in the joint venture being required to escrow cash from operations or make principal repayments without penalty. The debt of all our unconsolidated partnerships is non recourse to us. Credit Ratings Currently, we have approximately $4.0 billion of senior notes outstanding and $100 million of preferred stock that are rated by Moodys Investors Service, Standard & Poors and Fitch Ratings. Moodys rating on our senior note debt is Ba1 and our preferred stock is Ba2. During 2009, Standard & Poors downgraded our senior note debt one notch from BBB , the lowest investment grade rating, to BB+. Standard & Poors rating on our preferred stock was also downgraded one notch from B to B . In addition, Standard & Poors has maintained its negative outlook. During 2009, Fitch Ratings downgraded our senior note debt from BB+ to BB . The rating on our preferred stock was also downgraded from BB to B. Fitch Ratings has also placed us on negative outlook. If our operations or our credit ratios continue to decline, the ratings on our securities could be further reduced. If we were unable to subsequently improve our credit ratings, our cost to issue senior notes, either in connection with a refinancing or otherwise, or additional preferred stock would likely increase. Dividend Policy Host is required to distribute at least 90% of its annual taxable income, excluding net capital gains, to its stockholders to qualify as a REIT, including taxable income recognized for federal income tax purposes but with regard to which we do not receive cash. Funds used by Host to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock are provided through distributions from Host LP. Currently, for every share of common and preferred stock of Host, Host LP has issued to Host a corresponding common OP unit and preferred OP unit. As of February 23, 2009, Host is the owner of substantially all of the preferred OP units and approximately 97% of the common OP units. The remaining 3% of the common OP units are held by various third party limited partners. Investors should take into account the 3% minority position in Host LP common OP units when analyzing common and preferred dividend payments by Host to its stockholders, as these holders share, on a pro rata basis, in amounts being distributed by Host LP to holders of its corresponding common and preferred OP units. When 64 Host pays a common or preferred dividend, Host LP pays an equivalent per unit distribution on all common or corresponding preferred OP units. For example, if Host paid a $1 per share dividend on its common stock, it would be based on payment of a $1 per common unit distribution by Host LP to Host, as well as to other common OP unit holders. Hosts current policy on common dividends is generally to distribute, over time, 100% of its taxable income. We intend to suspend our regular quarterly dividend in 2009 and instead we expect to declare a $.30 to $.35 per share common dividend in the fourth quarter, which may be paid either in cash or in a combination of cash and shares of common stock. The amount of any dividend will be determined by Hosts Board of Directors. In reliance on the specific terms of recent guidance issued by the IRS, we may pay up to 90% of our required 2009 common dividends with Host common stock, with the remaining 10% paid with cash. Host currently intends to continue paying dividends on its preferred stock, regardless of the amount of taxable income, unless contractually restricted. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We are party to various transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements with unconsolidated entities (which we refer to as off balance sheet arrangements) under which we have certain contingent liabilities and guarantees. As of December 31, 2008, we are party to the following material off balance sheet arrangements: Unconsolidated Investments. We have invested approximately 137 million ($181 million) in the European joint venture, which includes amounts for the acquisition of a portfolio of hotels. The acquisition was terminated in December 2008, and the European joint venture returned approximately $40 million of the invested funds to us in January 2009 reducing our investment to approximately 107 million. Under the joint ventures partnership agreement, the aggregate size of the European joint venture can increase to approximately 540 million of equity (of which approximately 173 million would be contributed by Host LP) and, once all funds have been invested, would be approximately 1.5 billion of assets. The European joint venture currently has 733.8 million of debt outstanding, none of which is recourse to us. As of December 31, 2008, the aggregate size of the European joint venture was approximately 1.3 billion ($1.8 billion), including total capital contributions of approximately 433 million ($567 million), of which a total of approximately 137 million ($181 million) was from the contribution by us of cash and the Sheraton Warsaw Hotel & Towers. During 2008, we entered into three foreign currency forward purchase contracts to hedge approximately 50% of the foreign currency exposure resulting from the eventual repatriation of our net investment in the European joint venture. We hedged 60 million (approximately $88 million) of our investment and the forward purchase will occur between August 2011 and May 2014. As of December 31, 2008, we have recorded approximately $6 million related to the increase in the fair value of the forward purchase contracts. The gain is included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying balance sheet. The derivatives are considered a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation, and, in accordance with SFAS 133, are marked to market with changes in fair value recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income within the stockholders equity portion of our balance sheet. We also have other unconsolidated investments with a total of $810 million in debt with various partners. For additional detail on these investments and the European joint venture, see Note 3, Investments in Affiliates, and Note 7, Leases, in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Tax Sharing Arrangements. Under tax sharing agreements with former affiliated companies (such as Marriott International, HMS Host and Barcel&oacute; Crestline Corporation), we are obligated to pay certain taxes (federal, state, local and foreign, including any related interest and penalties) relating to periods in which the 65 companies were affiliated with us. For example, a taxing authority could adjust an item deducted by a former affiliate during the period that this former affiliate was owned by us. This adjustment could produce a material tax liability that we may be obligated to pay under the tax sharing agreement. Additionally, under the partnership agreement between Host and Host LP, Host LP is obligated to pay certain taxes (federal, state, local and foreign, including any related interest and penalties) incurred by Host, as well as any liabilities the IRS may successfully assert against Host. We do not expect any amounts paid under the tax sharing arrangements to be material. Tax Indemnification Agreements. For reasons relating to federal and state income tax considerations of the former and current owners of three hotels, we have agreed to restrictions on selling the hotels, or repaying or refinancing the mortgage debt for varying periods depending on the hotel. Two of these agreements will expire in 2010 and the third will expire in 2028. Guarantees. We have certain guarantees, which consist of commitments we have made to third parties for leases or debt, that are not on our books due to various dispositions, spin offs and contractual arrangements, but that we have agreed to pay in the event of certain circumstances including default by an unrelated party. We consider the likelihood of any material payments under these guarantees to be remote. The largest guarantees (by dollar amount) are listed below: We remain contingently liable for rental payments on certain divested non lodging properties. These primarily represent certain divested restaurants that were sold subject to our guarantee of the future rental payments. The aggregate amount of these future rental payments is approximately $23 million as of December 31, 2008. In 1997, we owned Leisure Park Venture Limited Partnership, which owns and operates a senior living facility. We no longer have an ownership interest in the partnership, but we remain obligated under a guarantee of interest and principal with regard to $14.7 million of municipal bonds issued by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority through their maturity in 2027. However, to the extent we are required to make any payments under the guarantee, we have been indemnified by Barcel&oacute; Crestline Corporation, who, in turn, is indemnified by the current owner of the facility. In connection with the sale of two hotels in January 2005, we remain contingently liable for the amounts due under the respective ground leases. The future minimum lease payments are approximately $13 million through the full term of the leases, including renewal options. We believe that any liability related to these ground leases is remote, and in each case, we have been indemnified by the purchaser of the hotel. Information on other guarantees and other off balance sheet arrangements may be found in Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements. 66 Contractual Obligations The table below summarizes our obligations for principal and estimated interest payments on our debt, future minimum lease payments on our operating and capital leases, projected capital expenditures and other long term liabilities, each as of December 31, 2008 (in millions): Payments due by period Total Less than1 year 1 to 3 years 3 to 5 years More than5 years Long term debt obligations(1) $ 7,523 $ 656 $ 1,838 $ 2,177 $ 2,852 Capital lease obligations 2 1 1 Operating lease obligations(2) 1,439 122 215 123 979 Purchase obligations(3) 254 235 19 Other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet(4) 17 13 4 Total $ 9,235 $ 1,014 $ 2,086 $ 2,300 $ 3,835 (1) The amounts shown include amortization of principal, debt maturities and estimated interest payments. Interest payments have been included in the long term debt obligations based on the weighted average interest rate. (2) Future minimum lease payments have not been reduced by aggregate minimum sublease rentals from restaurants and the HPT subleases of approximately $9 million and $275 million, respectively, payable to us under non cancelable subleases. (3) Our only purchase obligations consist of commitments for capital expenditures at our hotels. Under our contracts, we have the ability to defer some of these expenditures into later years and some of the 2008 amount reflects prior year contracts that were deferred or not completed. See Capital Expenditures. (4) The amounts shown include deferred management fees and the estimated amount of tax expense based upon FIN 48. Under terms of our management agreements, we have deferred payment of management fees to our hotel managers for some of our properties that have not achieved the required income thresholds for payment of owners priority to us. The timing of the payments, if any, is based on future operations, the termination of the management agreement or the sale of the hotel, and, is therefore, not determinable. The estimated amount of tax expense relates to uncertain tax liabilities from prior years based upon FIN 48. Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different, application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. We evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to the impairment of long lived assets, on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. All of our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. The following represent certain critical accounting policies that require us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates: Purchase Price Allocations to Hotels. Investments in hotel properties are stated at acquisition cost and allocated to land, property and equipment, identifiable intangible assets and assumed debt and other liabilities at fair value in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, Business Combinations. Any remaining unallocated acquisition costs would be treated as goodwill. Property and equipment are recorded at fair value based on current replacement cost for similar capacity and allocated to buildings, improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment using appraisals and valuations performed by management and independent third parties. Identifiable intangible assets are typically contracts including ground and retail leases and management and franchise agreements, which are recorded at fair value, although no value is generally allocated to contracts which are at market terms. Above market and below market contract values are based on the present value of the difference between contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the contracts acquired and our estimate of the fair value of contract rates for corresponding contracts measured over the period equal to the 67 remaining non cancelable term of the contract. Intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over the remaining non cancelable term of the related agreements. In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we may utilize a number of sources that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of a property and other market data, including third party appraisals and valuations. Impairment testing. We are required by GAAP to record an impairment charge when we believe that one or more of our hotels has been impaired, whereby, future undiscounted cash flows for the hotel would be less than the net book value of the asset. For impaired assets, we record an impairment charge when a propertys fair value is less than its net book value. We test for impairment in several situations, including when current or projected cash flows are less than historical cash flows, when it becomes more likely than not that a hotel will be sold before the end of its previously estimated useful life, as well as whenever an asset is classified as held for sale or events or changes in circumstances indicate that an assets net book value may not be recoverable. In the evaluation of the impairment of our assets, we make many assumptions and estimates, including: projected cash flows holding period expected useful life future capital expenditures fair values, including consideration of capitalization rates, discount rates and comparable selling prices. Changes in these estimates, assumptions, future changes in economic conditions, or property level results could require us to record additional impairment charges, which would be reflected in operations in the future. Classification of Assets as Held for Sale. Our policy for the classification of a hotel as held for sale is intended to ensure that the sale of the asset is probable, will be completed within one year and that actions required to complete the sale are unlikely to change or that the planned sale will be withdrawn. This policy is consistent with our experience with real estate transactions under which the timing and final terms of a sale are frequently not known until purchase agreements are executed, the buyer has a significant deposit at risk and no financing contingencies exist which could prevent the transaction from being completed in a timely manner. Specifically, we will typically classify properties that we are actively marketing as held for sale when all of the following conditions are met: our Board of Directors has approved the sale (to the extent the dollar amount of the sale requires Board approval); a binding agreement to purchase the property has been signed; the buyer has committed a significant amount of non refundable cash; and no significant financing contingencies exist which could cause the transaction not to be completed in a timely manner. To the extent a property is classified as held for sale and its fair value less selling costs is lower than the net book value of the property, we will record an impairment loss. See the discussion above concerning the use of estimates and judgments in determining fair values for impairment tests. Depreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation expense is based on the estimated useful life of our assets and amortization expense for leasehold improvements is the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related assets. The lives of the assets are based on a number of assumptions including cost and timing of capital expenditures to maintain and refurbish the assets, as well as specific market and economic conditions. While management believes its estimates are 68 reasonable, a change in the estimated lives could affect depreciation expense and net income (loss) or the gain or loss on the sale of any of our hotels. Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets. We have approximately $79 million, net of a valuation allowance of $28 million, of consolidated deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2008. The objective of financial accounting and reporting standards for income taxes is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in a companys financial statements or tax returns. We have considered various factors, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future projected taxable income and tax planning strategies in determining a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets, and we believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the $79 million of deferred tax assets in the future. When a determination is made that all, or a portion, of the deferred tax assets may not be realized, an increase in income tax expense would be recorded in that period. Valuation of Derivative Contracts. We will occasionally enter into derivative products including interest rate and foreign currency swaps, caps and collars. Derivative instruments are fair valued at each reporting date and the increase or decrease in fair value is recorded in net income (loss) unless the instrument qualifies as a hedge under SFAS 133. We estimate the fair value of these instruments through the use of third party valuations, which utilize the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future cash receipts and the discounted expected cash payments. We incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterpartys nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, we have considered the impact of netting any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts and guarantees. The variable cash flow streams are based on an expectation of future interest and exchange rates derived from observed market interest and exchange rate curves. The values of these instruments will change over time as cash receipts and payments are made and as market conditions change. Any event that impacts the level of actual and expected future interest or exchange rates will impact our valuations. The fair value of our derivatives is likely to fluctuate from year to year based on changing levels of interest and exchange rates and shortening terms to maturity. Stock Compensation. We recognize costs resulting from our share based payment transactions in our financial statements over their vesting periods. We classify share based payment awards granted in exchange for employee services as either equity classified awards or liability classified awards. The classification of our restricted stock awards as either an equity award or a liability award is based upon cash settlement options. Equity classified awards are measured based on the fair value on the date of grant. Liability classified awards are remeasured to fair value each reporting period. The value of these restricted stock awards, less estimated forfeitures, is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). No compensation cost is recognized for awards for which employees do not render the requisite service. The majority of our restricted stock awards to senior management vested as of December 31, 2008. These awards were classified as liability awards due to settlement features that allowed the recipient to have a percentage of the restricted stock awards withheld to meet tax requirements in excess of the statutory minimum requirements. During 2009, we will implement a new employee stock plan for our senior management that will include the following awards: Restricted stock awards with vesting based on market conditions. These awards will be considered liability awards due to their cash settlement features. Therefore, they will be remeasured to fair value each reporting period. We utilize a simulation, or Monte Carlo model to determine the fair value of our restricted stock awards with vesting based on market conditions. The utilization of this model requires us to make certain estimates related to the volatility of the share price of our common stock, risk free interest rates, the risk profile of our common shares compared to our peer group and the amount of our awards expected to be forfeited. 69 Restricted stock awards with vesting based on performance conditions. These awards are earned based on an employees achieving a specified performance target, which will be based on the employees specific management business objectives. Compensation cost will be recognized when the achievement of the performance condition is considered probable of achievement. If a performance condition has more than one outcome that is probable of achievement, recognition of compensation cost will be based on the condition that is the most likely outcome. These awards are also considered liability awards due to the cash settlement provisions. Therefore, the value of the shares to be issued will be based on the share price on the reporting date. Stock Option Awards. The stock option awards will be equity based awards, as they will not include cash settlement features. Therefore, the value of the award will be determined on the grant date using a binomial pricing model and will not be adjusted for future changes in the fair value. The utilization of the binomial model requires us to make certain estimates related to the volatility of the share price of our common stock, risk free interest rates and the amount of our awards expected to be forfeited. We also grant restricted stock awards to our upper middle management with vesting based on service conditions. These awards are considered equity awards as they do not have an option for tax withholding similar to that for senior management. Consolidation Policies. Judgment is required with respect to the consolidation of partnership and joint venture entities in the evaluation of control, including assessment of the importance of rights and privileges of the partners based on voting rights, as well as financial interests that are not controllable through voting interests. Currently, we have investments in entities that own hotel properties and other investments which we record using the equity method of accounting. These entities are considered to be voting interest entities. The debt on these investments is non recourse to us and the effect of their operations on our results of operations is not material. While we do not believe we are required to consolidate any of our current partnerships or joint ventures presented under the equity method, if we were required to do so, then all of the results of operations and the assets and liabilities would be included in our financial statements. Application of New Accounting Standards In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations, (FAS 141R). FAS 141R provides principles on the recognition and measurement of the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and goodwill acquired in a business combination. The standard particularly requires the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests to be measured at the acquisition date fair value, including contingent consideration. Furthermore, FAS 141R prohibits acquisition related costs, such as due diligence, legal and accounting fees, from being applied in determining the fair value of the acquired assets. We will adopt the provisions of this statement beginning in the first quarter of 2009 prospectively. We do not believe the adoption of this statement will materially affect the recognition and measurement related to our future business combinations. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51, (FAS 160), which defines a noncontrolling interest in a consolidated subsidiary as the portion of the equity (net assets) in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent and requires noncontrolling interest to be presented as a separate component of equity in the consolidated balance sheet. FAS 160 also modifies the presentation of net income by requiring earnings and other comprehensive income to be attributed to controlling and noncontrolling interests. We will adopt this standard beginning in the first quarter of 2009 prospectively and any presentation and disclosure requirements retrospectively. Upon the adoption of this standard, we will reclassify interests of our minority partners of other consolidated partnerships from the mezzanine level of the balance sheet to stockholders equity. Interest of minority partners of Host L.P. will continue to be classified in the minority interest section of our balance sheet, as the OP Units do not meet the requirements for equity classification per EITF topic D 98. Upon adoption, the 70 interest of minority partners of Host LP will be carried at fair value. As of December 31, 2008, the balance to be reclassified totaled $24 million. Additionally, the income attributable to minority partners of Host L.P. and other consolidated partnerships will no longer be deducted in our determination of net income and net income would have increased by $21 million, $32 million and $41 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. However, the income attributable to minority partners will be deducted in our determination of net income available to common shareholders. Therefore, we do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on our income available to common shareholders or our diluted earnings per share. In May 2008, the FASB issued FASB staff position (FSP) APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash Upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP 14 1). FSP 14 1 specifies that issuers of such instruments should separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entitys nonconvertible debt borrowing rate on the instruments issuance date when interest cost is recognized. Our 2007 Debentures and our 2004 Debentures are within the scope of FSP 14 1; therefore, we will be required to record the debt components of the debentures at fair value as of the date of issuance and amortize the discount as an increase to interest expense over the expected life of the debt. The implementation of this standard will result in a decrease to net income and earnings per share for all periods presented; however, there is no effect on our cash interest payments. FSP 14 1 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years and shall be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. Early adoption of FSP 14 1 is not permitted. As a result of the application of this standard, our diluted earnings per common share are estimated to decrease by approximately $.04 to $.05 per share. Additionally, the application of this standard will decrease our debt balance as of December 31, 2008 by approximately $77 million, with a corresponding increase to stockholders equity. Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics We present certain operating statistics (i.e., RevPAR, average daily rate and average occupancy) and operating results (revenues, expenses and adjusted operating profit) for the periods included in this report on a comparable hotel basis. We define our comparable hotels as properties (i) that are owned or leased by us and the operations of which are included in our consolidated results, whether as continuing operations or discontinued operations for the entirety of the reporting periods being compared and (ii) that have not sustained substantial property damage or business interruption, or undergone large scale capital projects during the reporting periods being compared. Of the 117 hotels that we owned on December 31, 2008, 115 have been classified as comparable hotels. The operating results of the following hotels that we owned as of December 31, 2008 are excluded from comparable hotel results for these periods: Atlanta Marriott Marquis (a two year major renovation project that was completed in June 2008); and New Orleans Marriott (property damage and business interruption from Hurricane Katrina in August 2005). Additionally, the operating results of the eleven hotels we disposed of in 2008 and 2007 also are not included in comparable hotel results for the periods presented herein. Moreover, because these statistics and operating results are for our hotel properties, they exclude results for our non hotel properties and other real estate investments. We evaluate the operating performance of our comparable hotels based on both geographic region and property type. These divisions are generally consistent with groupings recognized in the lodging industry. Geographic regions consist of the following (only states in which we own hotels are listed): Pacific California, Hawaii, Oregon and Washington; Mountain Arizona and Colorado; 71 North Central Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri and Ohio; South Central Louisiana, Tennessee and Texas; New England Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire; Mid Atlantic Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York; DC Metro Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C.; Atlanta Georgia and North Carolina; Florida Florida; and International Canada, Mexico and Chile. Property types consist of the following: Urban Hotels located in primary business districts of major cities; Suburban Hotels located in office parks or smaller secondary markets; Resort/conference Hotels located in resort/conference destinations such as Arizona, Florida, Hawaii and Southern California; and Airport Hotels located at or near airports. Reporting Periods For Consolidated Statement of Operations. The results we report are based on results of our hotels reported to us by our hotel managers. Our hotel managers use different reporting periods. Marriott, the manager of a significant percentage of our properties, uses a year ending on the Friday closest to December 31 and reports twelve weeks of operations for the first three quarters and sixteen or seventeen weeks for the fourth quarter of the year for its Marriott managed hotels. In contrast, other managers of our hotels, such as Hyatt and Starwood, report results on a monthly basis. Host, as a REIT, is required by federal income tax law to report results on a calendar year. As a result, we elected to adopt the reporting periods used by Marriott modified so that our fiscal year always ends on December 31 to comply with REIT rules. Our first three quarters of operations end on the same day as Marriott but our fourth quarter ends on December 31 and our full year results, as reported in our statement of operations, always includes the same number of days as the calendar year. Two consequences of the reporting cycle we have adopted are: (1) quarterly start dates will usually differ between years, except for the first quarter which always commences on January 1, and (2) our first and fourth quarters of operations and year to date operations may not include the same number of days as reflected in prior years. For example, set forth below are the quarterly start and end dates for 2009, 2008 and 2007. Note that the second and third quarters of each year both reflect twelve weeks of operations. In contrast, the first and fourth quarters reflect differing days of operations. 2009 2008 2007 Start End Dates No. ofDays Start End Dates No. ofDays Start End Dates No. ofDays First Quarter January 1 March 27 86 January 1 March 21 81 January 1 March 23 82 Second Quarter March 28 June 19 84 March 22 June 13 84 March 24 June 15 84 Third Quarter June 20 September 11 84 June 14 September 5 84 June 16 September 7 84 Fourth Quarter September 12 December 31 111 September 6 December 31 117 September 8 December 31 115 While the reporting calendar we adopted is more closely aligned with the reporting calendar used by Marriott, another consequence of our calendar is we are unable to report the month of operations that ends after our fiscal quarter end until the following quarter because our hotel managers using a monthly reporting period do 72 not make mid month results available to us. Hence, the month of operation that ends after our fiscal quarter end is included in our quarterly results of operations in the following quarter for those hotel managers (covering approximately 43% of total revenues of our hotels). As a result, our quarterly results of operations include results from hotel managers reporting results on a monthly basis as follows: first quarter (January, February), second quarter (March to May), third quarter (June to August) and fourth quarter (September to December). While this does not affect full year results, it does affect the reporting of quarterly results. For Hotel Operating Statistics and Comparable Hotel Results. In contrast to the reporting periods for our consolidated statement of operations, our hotel operating statistics (i.e., RevPAR, average daily rate and average occupancy) and our comparable hotel results are reported based on the reporting cycle used by Marriott for our Marriott managed hotels. However, for years such as 2008, where Marriott reports its operations based on a 53 week year and a fourth quarter of 17 weeks, for comparable purposes, we exclude the extra week of operations, and we still reflect 52 weeks for the full year and 16 weeks for the fourth quarter. This facilitates year to year comparisons, as each reporting period will be comprised of the same number of days of operations as in the prior year. This means, however, that the reporting periods we use for hotel operating statistics and our comparable hotel results will typically differ slightly from the reporting periods used for our statements of operations for the first and fourth quarters and the full year. Set forth below are the quarterly start and end dates that are used for our hotel operating statistics and comparable hotel results reported herein. Results from hotel managers reporting on a monthly basis are included in our operating statistics and comparable hotel results consistent with their reporting in our consolidated statement of operations. Hotel Result Reporting Periods for Operating Statistics and Comparable Hotel Results for Marriott Managed Properties 2009 2008 2007 Start End Dates No. ofDays Start End Dates No. ofDays Start End Dates No. ofDays First Quarter January 3 March 27 84 December 29 March 21 84 December 30 March 23 84 Second Quarter March 28 June 19 84 March 22 June 13 84 March 24 June 15 84 Third Quarter June 20 September 11 84 June 14 September 5 84 June 16 September 7 84 Fourth Quarter September 12 January 1 112 September 6 December 26 112 September 8 December 28 112 Non GAAP Financial Measures We use certain non GAAP financial measures, which are measures of our historical financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, within the meaning of applicable SEC rules. They are as follows: (i) FFO per diluted share, and (ii) Comparable Hotel Operating Results. The following discussion defines these terms and presents why we believe they are useful measures of our performance. FFO Per Diluted Share We present FFO per diluted share as a non GAAP measure of our performance in addition to our earnings per share (calculated in accordance with GAAP). We calculate FFO per diluted share for a given operating period as our FFO (defined as set forth below) for such period divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, real estate related depreciation and amortization and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO is presented on a per share basis after making adjustments for the effects of dilutive securities, including the payment of preferred stock dividends, in accordance with NAREIT guidelines. We believe that FFO per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that presentation of FFO per diluted share, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of earnings per share, provides beneficial information to investors. By excluding the effect of real estate depreciation, 73 amortization and gains and losses from sales of real estate, all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance, we believe that such measure can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other REITs, even though FFO per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted by NAREIT in its April 2002 White Paper on Funds From Operations, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. For these reasons, NAREIT adopted the definition of FFO in order to promote an industry wide measure of REIT operating performance. We calculate FFO per diluted share, in accordance with standards established by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies who do not use the NAREIT definition of FFO or calculate FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT guidance. In addition, although FFO per diluted share is a useful measure when comparing our results to other REITs, it may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non REITs. This information should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating profit, cash from operations, or any other operating performance measure prescribed by GAAP. Cash expenditures for various long term assets (such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures) and other items have been and will be incurred and are not reflected in the FFO per diluted share presentations. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows include depreciation, capital expenditures and other excluded items, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance, as well as the usefulness of our non GAAP financial measures. FFO per diluted share should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. In addition, FFO per diluted share does not measure, and should not be used as a measure of, amounts that accrue directly to our stockholders benefit. 74 The following tables provide a reconciliation of net income available to common shareholders per share to FFO per diluted share (in millions, except per share amounts): Reconciliation of Net Income Available to Common Stockholders to Funds From Operations per Diluted Share Year ended December 31, 2008 2007 Income Shares Per ShareAmount Income Shares Per ShareAmount Net income available to common stockholders $ 418 521.6 $ .80 $ 718 522.1 $ 1.38 Adjustments: Gain on dispositions, net of taxes (23 ) (.04 ) (164 ) (.31 ) Gain on insurance settlements(a) (22 ) (.04 ) Amortization of deferred gains, net of taxes (4 ) (.01 ) (6 ) (.01 ) Depreciation and amortization 578 1.11 519 .99 Partnership adjustments 28 .05 30 .06 FFO of minority partners of Host LP(b) (38 ) (.07 ) (37 ) (.07 ) Adjustments for dilutive securities: Assuming distribution of common shares granted under the comprehensive stock plan less shares assumed purchased at average market price .4 .9 (.01 ) Assuming conversion of 2004 Exchangeable Senior Debentures(c) 1 30.8 (.10 ) 19 30.5 (.08 ) FFO per diluted share(d)(e) $ 960 552.8 $ 1.74 $ 1,057 553.5 $ 1.91 (a) Represents the gain during the period from the settlement of property insurance claims, including the gains that are included in discontinued operations related to hotels that we have sold. (b) Represents FFO attributable to the minority interests in Host LP. (c) During the fourth quarter of 2008, we repurchased $100 million principal amount of the 2004 Exchangeable Senior Debentures for $82 million. Under FASBs Emerging Issues Task Force Topic D 53, Computation of Earnings per Share for a Period that Includes a Redemption or an Induced Conversion of a Portion of a Class of Preferred Stock (EITF D 53) we are required to determine the dilutive effect of the repurchased 2004 Exchangeable Debentures separately from the 2004 Exchangeable Debentures outstanding at December 31, 2008. 2004 Exchangeable Debentures repurchased during 2008 are treated as having been converted to common stock equivalents at the start of the period. Accordingly, the adjustments to dilutive FFO related to the 2004 Exchangeable Senior Debentures consist of an add back of $19 million of interest expense netted with the $18 million gain realized on the repurchases, for a net effect of $1 million. (d) FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT is adjusted for the effects of dilutive securities.

(2) Represents the portion of the significant transactions attributable to minority partners in Host LP. Comparable Hotel Operating Results We present certain operating results for our hotels, such as hotel revenues, expenses, and adjusted operating profit, on a comparable hotel, or same store basis as supplemental information for investors. We present these comparable hotel operating results by eliminating corporate level costs and expenses related to our capital structure, as well as depreciation and amortization. We eliminate corporate level costs and expenses to arrive at property level results because we believe property level results provide investors with more specific insight into the ongoing operating performance of our hotels. We eliminate depreciation and amortization, because even though depreciation and amortization are property level expenses, these non cash expenses, which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets, implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted earlier, because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. As a result of the elimination of corporate level costs and expenses and depreciation and amortization, the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues, expenses or operating profit and these comparable hotel operating results should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations include such amounts, all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance. We present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides investors and management with useful information for evaluating the period to period performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel REITs and hotel owners. In particular, these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues and or expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at comparable hotels (which represent the vast majority of our portfolio) or from other factors, such as the effect of acquisitions or dispositions. While management believes that presentation of comparable hotel results is a same store supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance, this measure is not used to allocate resources or assess the operating performance of these hotels, as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on comparable portfolio hotel results. For these reasons, we believe that comparable hotel operating results, when combined with the presentation of GAAP operating profit, revenues and expenses, provide useful information to investors and management. 76 The following table presents certain operating results and statistics for our comparable hotels for the periods presented herein: Comparable Hotel Results(a) (in millions, except hotel statistics) Year endedDecember 31, 2008 2007 Number of hotels 115 115 Number of rooms 60,582 60,582 Percent change in Comparable Hotel RevPAR (2.6 )% Comparable hotel sales Room $ 3,150 $ 3,233 Food and beverage(c) 1,582 1,630 Other 356 358 Comparable hotel sales(b) 5,088 5,221 Comparable hotel expenses Room 776 770 Food and beverage(e) 1,157 1,177 Other 189 197 Management fees, ground rent and other costs 1,632 1,638 Comparable hotel expenses(d) 3,754 3,782 Comparable hotel adjusted operating profit 1,334 1,439 Non comparable hotel results, net(f) 40 35 Office buildings and limited services properties, net(g) 7 9 Depreciation and amortization (582 ) (516 ) Corporate and other expenses (58 ) (69 ) Gain on insurance settlements 7 51 Operating profit per the consolidated statements of operations $ 748 $ 949 (a) The reporting period for 2008 for the Marriott managed hotels is from December 29, 2007 to December 26, 2008 and for 2007 is from December 30, 2006 to December 28, 2007.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Interest Rate Sensitivity Our future income, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates. Market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Valuations for secured debt are determined based on the expected future payments discounted at risk adjusted rates. Senior notes and the Exchangeable Debentures are valued based on quoted market prices. Currently, we have no derivative financial instruments that are used to hedge interest rate risk or that are held for trading purposes. However, going forward, we may use derivative financial instruments to manage, or hedge, interest rate risks related to future borrowings. The table below presents scheduled maturities and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Expected Maturity Date 2009 2010 2011(1) 2012 2013 Thereafter Total FairValue ($ in millions) Liabilities Debt: Fixed rate $ 321 $ 409 $ 115 $ 959 $ 737 $ 2,701 $ 5,242 $ 4,240 Average interest rate 6.0 % 6.1 % 6.2 % 6.6 % 6.7 % 6.8 % Variable rate Variable rate $ $ $ 710 $ $ $ $ 710 $ 679 Average interest rate 4.1 % 4.1 % 4.0 % % % % Total debt $ 5,952 $ 4,919 (1) The debt maturing in 2011 includes $410 million related to borrowings under the credit facility, which can be extended, at our option, for one year if our leverage ratio is below 6.75x. See Financial Condition for further discussion. Similarly, the $300 million mortgage loan on the Orlando World Center Marriott, which also matures in 2011, can be extended for two one year periods, subject to achieving a certain debt coverage ratio and other conditions. Our current debt structure, which primarily consists of fixed rate debt largely mitigates the impact of changes in interest rates on our cash interest payments. As of December 31, 2008, we had a $210 million term loan and $200 million outstanding under the revolver portion of our credit facility. Our credit facility borrowings are sensitive to changes in interest rates, and are based on a spread over LIBOR, ranging from 65 basis points to 175 basis points depending on our leverage ratio. Additionally, in 2008 we entered into a $300 million floating rate mortgage loan on our Orlando World Center Marriott that bears interest at LIBOR plus 350 basis points. Valuations for secured debt and the credit facility are determined based on the expected future payments discounted at risk adjusted rates. Senior notes and the Exchangeable Senior Debentures are valued based on quoted market prices. During March 2007, we prepaid our $88 million mortgage on the JW Marriott, Washington, D.C. As a result, we terminated an interest rate cap that capped the floating interest rate of the loan at 8.1%. The cap represented a derivative that was marked to market each period and the gains and losses from changes in the market value of the cap were recorded in gain (loss) on foreign currency and derivative contracts. If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increase or decrease by 100 basis points, the change in interest expense would change future earnings and cash flows by approximately $7 million annually. Exchange Rate Sensitivity As we have non U.S. operations (specifically, the ownership of hotels in Canada, Mexico and Chile and investments in our European joint venture), currency exchange risk arises as a normal part of our business. To 79 manage the currency exchange risk applicable to ownership in non U.S. hotels, where possible, we may enter into forward or option contracts. The foreign currency exchange agreements that we have entered into were strictly to hedge foreign currency risk and not for trading purposes. During 2008, we have entered into three foreign currency forward purchase contracts totaling 60 million (approximately $88 million) to hedge a portion of the foreign currency exposure resulting from the eventual repatriation of our net investment in the European joint venture. Under these transactions, we will sell the Euro amount, and receive the U.S. Dollar amount on the forward purchase date. These derivatives are considered a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation, and, in accordance with SFAS 133, are marked to market with changes in fair value recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income within the stockholders equity portion of our balance sheet. We also evaluate counterparty credit risk in the calculation of the fair value of the swaps. During 2008, we recorded an increase in the fair value of the derivative instruments totaling approximately $6 million, which is equal to the fair value as of December 31, 2008 included in accumulated other comprehensive income. The following table summarizes our three foreign currency purchase contracts (in millions): Transaction Date TransactionAmount in Euros TransactionAmount in Dollars Forward PurchaseDate February 2008 30 $ 43 August 2011 February 2008 15 22 February 2013 May 2008 15 23 May 2014 80
