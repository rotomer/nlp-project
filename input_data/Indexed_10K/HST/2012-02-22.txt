Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. Overview Host Inc. operates as a self managed and self administered REIT. Host Inc. is the sole general partner of Host L.P. and holds 98.5% of its partnership interests. Host L.P. is a limited partnership operating through an umbrella partnership structure. As of February 22, 2012, we own 121 hotels, primarily consisting of luxury and upper upscale properties. Host Inc. is the largest lodging REIT in NAREITs composite index. A REIT is a legal entity that owns real estate assets and, through payments of dividends to stockholders, is permitted to reduce or eliminate federal income taxes at the corporate level. Our hotels are operated under brand names that are among the most respected and widely recognized in the lodging industry. The majority of our properties are luxury and upper upscale that are located in central business districts of major cities, near airports and in resort/conference destinations that benefit from significant barriers to entry by competitors. In 2011, approximately 79% of our revenues were generated by our urban and resort/conference hotels. While our hotels are still subject to competitive pressures, we believe this strategy should allow us to achieve room rate and occupancy premiums in excess of those of our competitors. We seek to maximize the value of our portfolio through aggressive asset management by assisting the managers of our hotels in optimizing property operations and by completing strategic capital improvements. Our Customers The majority of our customers fall into three broad groups: transient business, group business and contract business, which accounted for approximately 59%, 36%, and 5%, respectively, of our 2011 room sales. Similar to the majority of the lodging industry, we further categorize business within these categories based on characteristics they have in common as follows: Transient business broadly represents individual business or leisure travelers. Business travelers make up the majority of transient demand at our hotels. Therefore, we will be significantly more affected by trends in business travel versus leisure demand. The three key subcategories of the transient business group are: Retail: This is the benchmark rate that a hotel publishes and offers to the general public. It typically is for travelers that do not have access to negotiated or discount rates. It includes the rack rate, which typically is applied to rooms during high demand periods and is the highest rate category available. Retail room rates will fluctuate more freely depending on anticipated demand levels (e.g. seasonality and weekday vs. weekend stays). Special Corporate: This is a negotiated rate offered to companies and organizations that provide significant levels of room night demand to the hotel or to hotel brands generally. These rates are typically negotiated annually at a discount to the anticipated retail rate. Discount: This category encompasses all discount programs, such as AAA and AARP discounts, government per diem, rooms booked through wholesale channels, frequent guest program redemptions, and promotional rates and packages offered by a hotel. Group business represents clusters of guestrooms booked together, usually with a minimum of 10 rooms. The three key sub categories of the group business category are: Association: group business related to national and regional association meetings and conventions. Corporate: group business related to corporate meetings (e.g., product launches, training programs, contract negotiations, and presentations). 43 Table of Contents Other: group business predominately related to social, military, education, religious, fraternal and youth and amateur sports teams, otherwise known as SMERF business. The final category is contract demand, which refers to blocks of rooms sold to a specific company for an extended period of time at significantly discounted rates. Contract rates are usually utilized by hotels that are located in markets that are experiencing consistently lower levels of demand. Airline crews are typical generators of contract demand for our hotels. Understanding Our Performance Our Revenues and Expenses. Our hotels are operated by third party managers under long term agreements, pursuant to which they typically earn base and incentive management fees based on the levels of revenues and profitability of each individual hotel. We provide operating funds, or working capital, which the managers use to purchase inventory and to pay wages, utilities, property taxes and other hotel level expenses. We generally receive a cash distribution from our hotel managers each four week or monthly accounting period, which distribution reflects hotel level sales less property level operating expenses (excluding depreciation). Revenues for owned hotels represent 95% of our total revenue. The following table presents the components of our hotel revenue as a percentage of our total revenue: % of 2011Revenues Rooms revenue. Occupancy and average daily room rate are the major drivers of rooms revenue. The business mix of the hotel (group versus transient and premium versus discount business) is a significant driver of room rates. 60 % Food and beverage revenue. Occupancy and the type of customer staying at the hotel are the major drivers of food and beverage revenue (i.e., group business typically generates more food and beverage business through catering functions when compared to transient business, which may or may not utilize the hotels restaurants). 29 % Other revenue. Occupancy, the nature of the property (i.e., resort, etc.) and its price point are the main drivers of other ancillary revenue, such as parking, golf course, spa, entertainment and other guest services. 6 % Hotel operating expenses represent approximately 98% of our total operating costs and expenses. The following table presents the components of our hotel operating expenses as a percentage of our total operating costs and expenses: % of 2011OperatingCosts andExpenses Rooms expense. These costs include housekeeping, reservation systems, room supplies, laundry services and front desk costs. Occupancy is the major driver of rooms expense. These costs can increase based on increases in salaries and wages, as well as the level of service and amenities that are provided. 18 % Food and beverage expense. These expenses primarily include food, beverage and labor costs. Occupancy and the type of customer staying at the hotel (i.e., catered functions generally are more profitable than outlet sales) are the major drivers of food and beverage expense, which correlates closely with food and beverage revenue. 23 % 44 Table of Contents % of 2011OperatingCosts andExpenses Other departmental and support expenses. These expenses include labor and other costs associated with other ancillary revenues, such as parking, golf courses, spas, entertainment and other guest services, as well as labor and other costs associated with administrative departments, sales and marketing, repairs and minor maintenance and utility costs. 27 % Management fees. Base management fees are computed as a percentage of gross revenue. Incentive management fees generally are paid when operating profits exceed certain threshold levels. 4 % Other property level expenses. These expenses consist primarily of real and personal property taxes, ground rent, equipment rent and property insurance. Many of these expenses are relatively inflexible and do not necessarily change based on changes in revenues at our hotels. 12 % Depreciation and amortization expense. This is a non cash expense that changes primarily based on the acquisition and disposition of hotel properties and the level of past capital expenditures. 14 % The expense components listed above are based on those presented in our consolidated statements of operations. It also is worth noting that wage and benefit costs are spread among various line items. Taken separately, these costs represent approximately 55% of our hotel operating expenses. Key Performance Indicators. Revenue per available room (RevPAR) is a commonly used measure within the hotel industry to evaluate hotel operations. RevPAR is defined as the product of the average daily room rate charged and the average daily occupancy achieved. RevPAR does not include food and beverage or parking, telephone or other guest service revenues generated by the property. Although RevPAR does not include these ancillary revenues, it generally is considered the key indicator of core revenues for many hotels. RevPAR changes that are driven predominately by occupancy have different implications on overall revenue levels, as well as incremental operating profit, than do changes that are driven predominately by average room rate. For example, increases in occupancy at a hotel would lead to increases in rooms revenues and ancillary revenues, such as food and beverage revenue, as well as additional incremental costs (including housekeeping services, utilities and room amenity costs). RevPAR increases due to higher room rates, however, would not result in additional room related costs, with the exception of those charged as a percentage of revenue. As a result, changes in RevPAR driven by increases or decreases in average room rates have a greater effect on profitability than changes in RevPAR caused by occupancy levels. In discussing our operating results, we present RevPAR and certain other financial data for our hotels on a comparable hotel basis. Comparable hotels are those properties that we have owned for the entirety of the reporting periods being compared. Comparable hotels do not include the results of properties acquired or sold, or that incurred business interruption due to significant property damage or large scale capital improvements. We also evaluate the performance of our business through certain non GAAP financial measures. Each of these non GAAP financial measures should be considered by investors as supplemental measures to GAAP performance measures such as total revenues, operating profit, net income and earnings per share. We provide a more detailed discussion of these non GAAP financial measures, how management uses such measures to evaluate our financial condition and operating performance and a discussion of certain limitations of such measures in Non GAAP Financial Measures. Our non GAAP financial measures include: NAREIT Funds From Operations (FFO) and Adjusted FFO per diluted share. We use NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share as a supplemental measure of company wide profitability. NAREIT adopted FFO in order to promote an industry wide measure of REIT operating performance. We also 45 Table of Contents adjust NAREIT FFO for gains and losses on extinguishment of debt, acquisition costs and litigation gains or losses outside the ordinary course of business, which we believe provides useful supplemental information about our ongoing operating performance. Hotel adjusted operating profit. Hotel adjusted operating profit measures property level results before debt service, depreciation and corporate expenses and is a supplemental measure of aggregate property level profitability. We use hotel adjusted operating profit to evaluate the profitability of our comparable hotels. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. Earnings before income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), is a commonly used measure in many industries. Management believes that such measure provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations as it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties and facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging REITs, hotel owners who are not REITs and other capital intensive companies. We adjust EBITDA when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain items, such as gains and losses related to real estate transactions and impairment losses (Adjusted EBITDA), provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. Summary of 2011 Operating Results Operating Results(in millions, except per share and hotel statistics)Year ended December 31, 2011 2010 % Change2010 to 2011 2009 % Change2009 to 2010 Total revenues $ 4,998 $ 4,428 12.9 % $ 4,135 7.1 % Comparable hotel revenues (a) 4,315 4,087 5.6 N/A 4.2 Net loss (16 ) (132 ) 87.9 (258 ) 48.8 Adjusted EBITDA 1,018 834 22.1 798 4.5 Diluted loss per share $ (.02 ) $ (.21 ) 90.5 % $ (.45 ) 53.3 % NAREIT FFO per diluted share .89 .68 30.9 .51 33.3 Adjusted FFO per diluted share .92 .74 24.3 .79 (6.3 ) Comparable hotel RevPAR (a) $ 129.97 $ 122.47 6.1 % N/A 5.8 % (a) Comparable hotel operating statistics for 2011 and 2010 are based on 104 comparable hotels as of December 31, 2011. The percent change from 2009 and 2010 are based on 108 comparable hotels as of December 31, 2010. During 2011, RevPAR at our comparable hotels increased 6.1% compared to 2010 as a result of improvements in overall lodging demand, combined with low supply growth in the industry. While the recovery in the overall economy has been slower than we expected, 2011 marked the second year of solid growth in the lodging industry as increases in business investment and corporate profits, as well as low levels of new supply, offset the effects of lower than anticipated GDP growth and continued high unemployment. As expected during the recovery process, initially the growth in RevPAR was driven primarily by improvements in occupancy. During 2011, as occupancy approached more normalized levels, RevPAR growth was driven increasingly by increases in average rates. For 2011, RevPAR growth reflects the 4.3% increase in average daily rates, and an occupancy improvement of 1.3 percentage points. The RevPAR growth of our properties was tempered, however, by the effects of major capital projects that were on going throughout the year, particularly those at some of our largest properties, such as the Sheraton New York Hotel & Towers and the Philadelphia Marriott Downtown. RevPAR would have increased an additional 40 basis points for the full year if the results of these two properties were excluded. Combined with the improvements in RevPAR, total owned hotel revenues increased 7.0% due to the inclusion of the operations of 14 hotels acquired in 2010 and 2011 (the Recent Acquisitions), which increased revenues by $353 million and $57 million, respectively. 46 Table of Contents Rate increases for the year have been driven primarily by increases in transient business across all segments in the category, as well as improvements in corporate group business. Group demand has recovered more slowly as weak association group demand has offset the improvement in corporate group demand. Food and beverage revenue for 2011 increased by 10.5% compared to 2010, which increase was driven by a 5.5% improvement in comparable hotel food and beverage revenue and incremental food and beverage revenues from our Recent Acquisitions of $74 million, or 5.7% for the year. Improvements in banquet and audio visual revenue were a significant driver of the growth in comparable food and beverage revenues. As a result of these trends, total comparable revenues for our owned hotels increased $228 million, or 5.6%, to approximately $4.3 billion for the year. In addition to the hotel revenues for our owned hotels described above, our other revenues increased $54 million due to incremental revenue from the 53 Courtyard by Marriott hotels leased from Hospitality Properties Trust that previously had been sublet (the HPT portfolio; see Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations). Therefore, total revenues increased $570 million, or 12.9%, to approximately $5.0 billion for 2011. Operating margins (calculated based on GAAP operating profit as a percentage of GAAP revenues) increased 150 basis points for the full year 2011. Operating margins calculated using GAAP measures are significantly affected by several items, including our Recent Acquisitions. Our comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins, which exclude, among other items, operations from our recently acquired hotels, depreciation and corporate expenses, increased 90 basis points. Net loss for Host Inc. decreased $116 million in 2011 to a loss of $16 million and Adjusted EBITDA increased $184 million, or 22.1%, to $1,018 million. Net loss, GAAP operating profit and Adjusted EBITDA all were affected negatively by the forfeiture of the $15 million deposit on the terminated transaction to acquire the Grand Hyatt, Washington, D.C. in December 2011. Host Inc.s diluted loss per common share decreased $.19 to a loss in 2011 of $.02. The reduction in our loss per diluted share reflects the improvement in operating results at our hotels as described above. Host Inc.s NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share of $.89 and $.92, respectively, increased 30.9% and 24.3% for 2011. For 2011, the $15 million deposit forfeiture discussed above reduced NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share by $.02. The trends and transactions described above for Host Inc. similarly affected the operating results for Host L.P, as the only significant difference between the Host Inc. and Host L.P. statements of operations relates to the treatment of income attributable to the outside partners of Host L.P. For the year, Host L.P.s net loss declined $116 million to $16 million, and the loss per diluted unit declined $.19 to $.02 per unit. Investing Activities Acquisitions. We believe that the lodging industry continues to present opportunities to purchase assets with high growth potential at a significant discount to replacement cost. Many of the prospective acquisition opportunities are expected to be driven by debt maturities on over leveraged assets that were refinanced in 2006 and 2007 as owners may look to sell as they face refinancing challenges with lower loan to value ratios and higher interest rates. In many cases, we expect that these owners will seek to meet their financing obligations through an all cash sale of the hotel. As the recovery continues, we expect to see more competition in the acquisition market, especially from private equity and foreign sovereign wealth firms. During 2011, we completed the following acquisitions: On September 1, 2011, we acquired the remaining 51% partnership interest in the Tiburon Golf Ventures, L.P., which owns the golf club surrounding The Ritz Carlton, Naples Golf Resort, for $11 million. We previously held a 49% limited partner interest in the entity. On April 29, 2011, we acquired a 75% common voting interest and a preferred interest in the joint venture that owns the 364 room Hilton Melbourne South Wharf, Australia. The total transaction value, including 47 Table of Contents the 25% voting interest retained by the previous owners, was A$142 million ($152 million) and included the assumption of an existing A$80 million ($86 million) mortgage loan. We are entitled to receive a cumulative priority return of 12% based on our initial investment of A$45 million ($48 million) plus 75% of the distributable cash after our partners subordinated preferred interest. On March 23, 2011 we acquired the 775 room New York Helmsley Hotel for $313.5 million. The property is managed by Starwood and will be converted to the Westin brand in 2012. On March 17, 2011, we acquired the 1,625 room Manchester Grand Hyatt San Diego for $572 million (which includes the payment of $19 million for the existing FF&E replacement fund). The transaction was comprised of cash consideration of $566 million, including the repayment of $403 million of existing loans and the issuance of approximately 0.3 million OP units valued at $6 million. On February 18, 2011, we acquired a portfolio of seven midscale and upscale hotels totaling 1,207 rooms in New Zealand for approximately NZ$190 million ($145 million), at which time we entered into an NZ$105 million ($80 million) mortgage. The properties are operated by Accor under the ibis and Novotel brands. Also during the year, as part of the expansion of the Euro JV, we transferred the Le M&eacute;ridien Piccadilly to Fund II thereof and received proceeds from the transfer of $40 million. Fund II also purchased the Pullman Bercy, Paris in 2011 for approximately 96 million ($132 million). Redevelopment and Return on Investment Capital Expenditures. During 2011 and 2010, we invested a total of $215 million and $114 million, respectively, in redevelopment and ROI expenditures that primarily consisted of large scale redevelopment projects at numerous properties. We expect that our investment in redevelopment and ROI expenditures in 2012 will total approximately $235 million to $275 million. Significant redevelopment capital expenditures during the year included the following projects: Sheraton New York Hotel & Towers the complete renovation of all 1,777 rooms, as well as major mechanical upgrades to the heating and cooling system; Atlanta Marriott Perimeter Center complete redevelopment of the hotel, including rooms renovation, lobby enhancements, mechanical systems upgrades, parking garage and exterior enhancements; Chicago Marriott OHare complete redevelopment of the hotel, including rooms renovation, new meeting space and the creation of a new great room and lobby; San Diego Marriott Marquis & Marina continuation of the extensive renovation and redevelopment project begun in 2010; and Sheraton Indianapolis renovation of rooms, lobby, fitness center, bar and restaurant, as well as the conversion of an existing tower into 129 apartments. Included in our ROI expenditures are capital projects at our recently acquired hotels that we considered as part of our initial investment. In 2011, acquisition capital expenditures accounted for $13 million of our ROI capital expenditures as we began the renovation of all 270 rooms at the W New York Union Square and the rebranding of the New York Helmsley Hotel to a Westin, including a redesign of all 773 rooms and a new lobby bar and restaurant. These projects will continue in 2012 and will include the planned renovation of all of the guestrooms at the Manchester Grand Hyatt San Diego. During 2012, we anticipate that these projects will account for $80 million to $100 million of our ROI expenditures. Renewal and Replacement Capital Expenditures. In addition to the redevelopment/ROI expenditures described above, we spent $327 million and $195 million on renewal and replacement expenditures during 2011 and 2010, respectively. During 2011, our renewal and replacement projects included the renovation of over 5,300 rooms, 98,000 square feet of public space and 515,000 square feet of meeting space. These expenditures are 48 Table of Contents designed to ensure that our high standards for product quality are maintained and to enhance the overall competitiveness of our properties in the marketplace. Major projects completed in 2011 included the renovation of the 45,000 square foot Broadway ballroom and 975 rooms at the New York Marriott Marquis, over 87,500 square feet of meeting space and 1,200 rooms in the main tower of the Philadelphia Marriott Downtown and 98,700 square feet of meeting space at the Sheraton Boston. Major renewal and replacement projects that were underway during the fourth quarter of 2011 included all 884 rooms at the JW Marriott Desert Springs and 39,750 square feet of meeting space at the New Orleans Marriott. We expect our investment in renewal and replacement expenditures in 2012 will total approximately $310 million to $330 million. Dispositions. We disposed of one non core property in 2011 for proceeds of $6 million. During 2012, we plan to increase our disposition activity, subject to market conditions that remain challenging. We believe that transaction activity will increase as the year progresses and we remain committed to our strategy of reducing our exposure to non core hotels located in secondary and tertiary markets. We also will consider selling properties in primary markets on an opportunistic basis. Financing Activities During 2011, we continued to make progress in our goal to strengthen the balance sheet by lowering our debt to equity ratio and improving our overall credit statistics, as defined in our credit facility and senior note indentures. As our operations have improved during 2010 and 2011, we have focused on strategically raising and deploying capital to improve our overall leverage ratios, while at the same time completing substantial investments in our portfolio through acquisitions and capital investments. Specifically, during the year we completed the following significant financing transactions. We issued $300 million of 6% Series Y senior notes and $500 million of 5 7/8% Series W senior notes for aggregate net proceeds of $784 million. Proceeds from the senior notes issuances were used to redeem or repay $454 million of debt, including the remaining $250 million of 7 1/8% Series K senior notes, $154 million of exchangeable senior debentures and $50 million under our credit facility. Additionally, we intend to use the proceeds from the issuance of the Series Y senior notes, along with available cash, to redeem the remaining $388 million of our 2 5/8% exchangeable senior debentures (the 2007 Debentures) on April 15, 2012, at which time they can be put to us for cash by the holders. In June 2011, holders of $134 million of our 3 1/4% exchangeable debentures (the 2004 Debentures) elected to exchange their debentures for 8.8 million common shares of Host Inc. upon our notice of intent to redeem $150 million of the debentures in May. The remaining $16 million was paid in cash. We entered into a new senior revolving credit facility that replaced our existing senior revolving credit facility that allows for revolving borrowings in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1 billion, an increase of $400 million. The interest rate spread for LIBOR based borrowings ranges from 175 to 275 basis points. The spread on U.S. dollar based borrowings based on our credit statistics as of December 31, 2011 is 200 basis points. The new facility has an initial maturity of November 2015 with an option to extend for one additional year, subject to certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee. We refinanced the $79 million mortgage loan that we had assumed as part of the acquisition of the Hilton Melbourne South Wharf, lowering the all in interest rate by 400 basis points to 6.77%. We issued 19.1 million common shares under our at the market offering programs. The shares were issued at an average price of $17.09 per share for net proceeds of $323 million. Proceeds from these issuances were used to fund acquisitions and capital investments. We believe, based on the overall strength of our balance sheet, that we have sufficient liquidity and access to the capital markets in order to pay our near term debt maturities, fund our capital expenditures programs and take advantage of investment opportunities (for a detailed discussion, see Liquidity and Capital Resources). 49 Table of Contents 2012 Outlook While the uncertain economic conditions and the European sovereign debt crisis will clearly impact our business, we believe that, other than in Europe, lodging demand will continue to grow based on a number of positive signs. These signs include consensus estimates for U.S. GDP growth of 2.2% in 2012, coupled with expected increases in business investment, a key driver for the lodging industry, rising corporate profit and slight improvements in employment. We believe the combination of these factors will result in solid growth in the lodging industry in 2012. As the recovery continues, we anticipate that improvements in RevPAR will be driven by increases in both rate and occupancy, though rate growth likely will be the key driver. At the same time, we also anticipate that supply growth in the lodging industry will continue to remain at historically low levels in 2012 as the disruption in the credit markets and weak lodging performance caused a significant decline in new hotel construction starts over the last two years. This decline particularly may be relevant for the markets and lodging sectors in which we compete due to the long term planning and high level of investment associated with luxury and upper upscale lodging properties in urban and resort destinations. As a result, we believe that supply growth should remain below the historical trend for the lodging industry for 2012, resulting in occupancy gains that will have a positive effect on revenues and cash flow growth. Based on the trends discussed above and the forecast redevelopment and ROI projects, as well as other capital expenditures at our properties, we anticipate that comparable hotel RevPAR will increase 4% to 6% during 2012. We believe that the positive trends in the lodging industry create the opportunity for business improvements, which, when combined with our strategy to enhance our portfolio through acquisitions and capital projects, ultimately will improve the competitive position of our properties and increase stockholder value. However, there can be no assurances that any increases in hotel revenues or earnings at our properties will continue for any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, slower than anticipated growth in the economy and changes in travel patterns.

In 2011, hotel sales grew 12.2% for our owned hotels, due to strong growth in RevPAR at our properties, as well as the inclusion of operations for 10 hotels acquired in early 2011 and a full year of operations for four hotels acquired in 2010 (Recent Acquisitions). Revenues for properties sold in 2011 or 2010 have been reclassified to discontinued operations. Rooms. The increase in room revenue in 2011 reflects our 6.1% improvement in comparable hotel RevPAR, which was driven by the 4.3% increase in average room rates. Rooms revenue increased an additional 7.9% due to incremental revenues from our Recent Acquisitions. Food and beverage. The increase in food and beverage revenue reflects an increase of 5.5% at our comparable hotels, with the majority of growth generated from our banquet and audio visual revenue. Food and beverage revenue increased an additional 5.7% due to incremental revenues from our Recent Acquisitions. Other. The increase in other revenues for owned hotels in 2011 primarily is due to incremental revenues from our Recent Acquisitions. We also began to see improvement in the fourth quarter in spa and golf revenues as group business improved. Other revenues. For 2011, the increase primarily was driven by the inclusion of a full year of revenues for the leased HPT hotels, which includes hotel revenues of $214 million, compared to $123 million of hotel revenues and $44 million of rental income recorded in 2010. On July 7, 2010, in connection with the termination of subleases for 71 hotels leased from HPT, we began recording the operations of the hotels instead of rental income. On December 30, 2011, we entered into a settlement with our subtenant related to the termination of the subleases, which resulted in an additional $7 million of income being recorded in 2011 to compensate us for a portion of our losses subsequent to the sublease termination. While management evaluates the performance of each individual hotel against its competitive set in a given market, overall we evaluate the portfolio operating results using three different criteria: property type (i.e. urban, suburban, resort/conference or airport), geographic region and mix of business (i.e. transient, group or contract). 52 Table of Contents Comparable Hotel Sales by Property Type. The following tables set forth performance information for 2011 and 2010: Comparable Hotels Portfolio by Property Type (a) As of December 31, 2011 Year ended December 31, 2011 Year ended December 31, 2010 No. ofProperties No. ofRooms AverageRoom Rate AverageOccupancyPercentages RevPAR AverageRoom Rate AverageOccupancyPercentages RevPAR PercentChange inRevPAR Urban 50 32,282 $ 194.40 73.7 % $ 143.33 $ 186.87 73.2 % $ 136.76 4.8 % Suburban 28 10,564 145.56 67.9 98.77 139.45 66.0 91.98 7.4 Resort/Conference 13 8,082 215.19 67.5 145.24 204.83 65.3 133.76 8.6 Airport 13 6,275 122.85 76.6 94.09 116.03 73.9 85.73 9.7 All Types 104 57,203 180.32 72.1 129.97 172.95 70.8 122.47 6.1 (a) The reporting period for 2011 is from January 1, 2011 to December 30, 2011 and for 2010 is from January 2, 2010 to December 31, 2010 for our Marriott hotels. For further discussion, see Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics Reporting Periods. During 2011, comparable hotel RevPAR increased across all of our hotel property types. Our airport properties led the portfolio with a 9.7% increase for the year, driven by an improvement in average room rates of 5.9%, as well as strength at our San Francisco airport hotels. Our resort/conference hotels also experienced a significant RevPAR increase of 8.6%, led by our Hawaiian properties. Our urban properties lagged the portfolio as a whole, with a RevPAR increase of 4.8%. Strong performance in our west coast urban markets, particularly San Francisco and San Diego, was offset by renovation disruption at the Sheraton New York Hotel and Towers and Philadelphia Marriott Downtown, as well as weak overall demand in our Washington, D.C. and Atlanta urban markets. RevPAR improved at our suburban hotels by 7.4% for the year, driven by an increase in rate of 4.4% and an increase in occupancy of 1.9 percentage points. Comparable Hotel Sales by Geographic Region.

For further discussion, see Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics Reporting Periods. For 2011, comparable hotel RevPAR improved across all of our geographic regions when compared to 2010. Our Pacific region was the top performing region, with a RevPAR increase of 12.3% that was driven by strong group and transient demand in our Hawaiian, San Diego and San Francisco markets. 53 Table of Contents The 8.8% RevPAR improvement in our Mountain region was driven primarily by strong growth in the Phoenix market, which increased by 13.3% for 2011. The increase in the Phoenix market was a result of strong group demand, aided by the construction of a new ballroom and meeting space at the Westin Kierland in 2010, as well as increases in both group and transient rates. The North Central region had an increase in RevPAR of 6.2%, led by our Chicago market, which had increases in both transient and group demand, resulting in RevPAR growth of 6.9%. RevPAR in our South Central region grew 5.8% for the year, driven mainly by our Houston market, which saw strong increases in rate of 5.5% and occupancy of 3.5 percentage points as a result of an increase in retail and corporate transient demand. Results in our Florida region were mixed. The Miami and Ft. Lauderdale market experienced a 7.3 percentage points improvement in occupancy, primarily due to strong group demand, aided by the renovation of the Miami Biscayne Bay Marriott, which was completed in 2010. RevPAR growth at our Orlando World Center Marriott had an increase of just 1%, due to lower than expected group demand. The RevPAR growth in our Mid Atlantic region of 4.3% lagged the portfolio as a whole due to lower levels of rate growth and the effect of new supply in the New York market, as well as significant renovations at the Sheraton New York Hotel & Towers and the Philadelphia Marriott Downtown. Our DC Metro and Atlanta regions underperformed the portfolio as a whole, with RevPAR growth of 1.5% and 1.3%, respectively. For our DC Metro market, weak group and transient demand, along with discounted leisure rates, slowed rate growth. Our Atlanta market was negatively affected by the decline in city wide demand, as well as renovations at the JW Marriott, Buckhead, particularly in the second half of 2011. Hotel Sales by Business Mix. The majority of our customers fall into three broad groups: transient, group and contract business. The information below is derived from business mix data for 104 of our hotels for which information is available from our managers. In 2011, overall transient revenues increased 6.9% when compared to 2010, reflecting a 4.6% improvement in average rate and a 2.2% increase in room nights. Average daily rates improved consistently for all transient segments. The improvement in transient demand was driven by increases in special corporate room nights. During 2011, group revenues increased approximately 5.3%. Average daily rates improved 3.4%, reflecting a consistent rate growth for all group customer segments. Overall, group demand improved 1.7% for the year. The improvement was due entirely to an increase in demand in the corporate group segment, as association and other group business declined during 2011. 2010 Compared to 2009. In 2010, hotel sales grew 5.0% for our owned hotels, reflecting strong growth in RevPAR at our properties, as well as increases in food and beverage revenues, partially offset by a decline in attrition and cancellation fees. Revenues for properties sold in 2010 or 2009 have been reclassified to discontinued operations. Rooms. The increase in room revenue in 2010 was consistent with the overall increase in RevPAR, primarily due to occupancy gains at our hotels. While the majority of the increase is due to the 5.8% increase in RevPAR at our comparable hotels, there also was a 1.7% increase related to the revenues recorded at the hotels acquired during the year. Food and beverage. The increase in food and beverage revenue in 2010 primarily was attributable to increased occupancy, which contributes to greater demand for catering and banquet business. Other. The decrease in other revenues for owned hotels in 2010 is primarily a result of a decline in attrition and cancellation fees of approximately $37 million. 54 Table of Contents Other revenues. For 2010, the increase primarily was driven by the inclusion of the revenues for the leased HPT hotels. For 2010, revenues for hotels leased from HPT include hotel revenues of $123 million and rental income of $44 million. For 2009, revenues for hotels leased from HPT include rental income of $79 million. The property revenues and rental income recorded, less the hotel expenses and rental expenses for the HPT properties, resulted in net losses of $13 million and $1 million for 2010 and 2009, respectively. While management evaluates the performance of each individual hotel against its competitive set in a given market, overall we evaluate the portfolio operating results using three different criteria: property type (i.e. urban, suburban, resort/conference or airport), geographic region and mix of business (i.e. transient, group or contract). Comparable Hotel Sales by Property Type. The following tables set forth performance information for 2010 and 2009: Comparable Hotels Portfolio by Property Type (a) As of December 31, 2010 Year ended December 31, 2010 Year ended December 31, 2009 No. ofProperties No. ofRooms AverageRoom Rate AverageOccupancyPercentages RevPAR AverageRoom Rate AverageOccupancyPercentages RevPAR PercentChange inRevPAR Urban 52 33,123 $ 185.53 72.5 % $ 134.50 $ 182.59 69.0 % $ 125.90 6.8 % Suburban 29 10,964 138.29 65.6 90.73 139.71 61.1 85.32 6.3 Resort/Conference 13 8,082 204.83 65.3 133.76 215.19 61.1 131.57 1.7 Airport 14 6,956 115.98 71.8 83.30 115.61 68.5 79.18 5.2 All Types 108 59,125 171.43 70.2 120.26 171.25 66.4 113.66 5.8 (a) The reporting period for 2010 is from January 2, 2010 to December 31, 2010 and for 2009 is from January 3, 2009 to January 1, 2010 for our Marriott hotels. For further discussion, see Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics Reporting Periods. During 2010, comparable hotel RevPAR increased across all of our hotel property types. Our urban properties led the portfolio, with a 6.8% increase in RevPAR for the year. The continued improvement in demand has allowed our operators to begin to increase the average room rates at our urban properties, which improved 1.6% overall for the year. Our suburban properties also experienced a significant RevPAR increase in 2010, driven by strength in the suburban Boston, Orange County and San Francisco markets. Our resort/conference hotels lagged the portfolio as a whole, as the 7.9% improvement in RevPAR at our resort/conference properties in our Florida region were partially offset by the RevPAR declines in the Phoenix and Palm Springs markets. RevPAR at our Airport properties improved 5.2% for the year, driven by strong demand growth in the Chicago and San Francisco airport markets. 55 Table of Contents Comparable Hotel Sales by Geographic Region.

For further discussion, see Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics Reporting Periods. For 2010, comparable hotel RevPAR improved across all of our geographic regions when compared to 2009. Our New England region was the top performing U.S. region, with RevPAR growth of 10.8%, driven by RevPAR growth of 11.6% in the Boston market. This increase was due to strong group and transient demand, as occupancy increased 5.0 percentage points and average room rates increased 3.9%. The 9.4% RevPAR growth in our Atlanta region was driven primarily by strong city wide and transient business in the fourth quarter. Strong demand from both group and transient customers drove a 9.0 percentage point occupancy increase in the fourth quarter. RevPAR in our Mid Atlantic region grew 7.7% for the year, driven by RevPAR growth at our New York properties of 9.5%. For our New York properties, rate improved 5.7% and occupancy improved by 3.0 percentage points. Our Florida region had an increase in RevPAR of 6.4% for the year, led by strong performance at our resort/conference hotels in this region. RevPAR at our Florida resort/conference hotels increased 7.9% for the year, driven primarily by an increase in occupancy of 6.6 percentage points; however, this increase was affected by lower group demand as well as significant renovations at the Orlando World Center Marriott Resort and Convention Center in the fourth quarter. The RevPAR increase for the year in our North Central region was driven by our Chicago hotels, as RevPAR increased 8.8% due to strong transient demand and rate increased 2.6%. Results in our Mountain region were mixed, as the Denver market experienced a 7.9% increase in RevPAR primarily due to strong group and transient demand, while the Phoenix market experienced a 3.9% decline in RevPAR, which was partially attributable to the renovation of a significant amount of meeting space at two hotels and the construction of a new ballroom at the Westin Kierland. Our DC Metro region underperformed the portfolio in terms of RevPAR growth, which underperformance reflects difficult comparisons to the prior year, particularly during the first quarter, due to the 2009 presidential inauguration and other government related activities. 56 Table of Contents Hotel Sales by Business Mix. The majority of our customers fall into three broad groups: transient, group and contract business. The information below is derived from business mix data for 108 of our hotels for which information is available from our managers. In 2010, overall transient revenues increased 7.6% when compared to 2009, reflecting an increase in total room nights of 4.9%, and an increase in average rates of 2.6%. The rate increase was driven primarily by a 5.0% increase in average rate for corporate transient business and a shift in mix away from discounted business. During 2010, group revenues increased approximately 3.5%, reflecting an increase in total room nights of 6.7%, partially offset by a decrease in average rates of 3.0%. Typically, recovery in the group segment will follow improvement in transient demand due to longer booking lead times. As a result, a large portion of the 2010 group business was sold at the lower rates in effect in prior periods. Therefore, while we did experience improvements in group demand, improvements in overall group revenue continues to lag that of transient revenue.

Our operating costs and expenses, both of which are fixed and variable, are affected by a number of factors. As previously discussed, room expense is affected mainly by occupancy, which drives costs related to items such as housekeeping, reservation systems, room supplies, laundry services and front desk costs. Food and beverage expense correlates closely with food and beverage revenues, and is affected by occupancy as well as the type of customers staying at the hotel. However, the most significant expense for both room expense and food and beverage expense is related to wages and employee benefits, which comprise approximately 55% of these expenses in any year. Other property level expenses consist of property taxes, which are highly dependent on local jurisdiction taxing authorities, and property and general liability insurance, and do not necessarily change based on changes in revenues at our hotels. The overall increases in operating expenses in 2011 and 2010 are consistent with higher overall RevPAR at our properties and increases in occupancy and rates at our hotels. The increase also is a result of the inclusion of expenses for Recent Acquisitions, which were $295 million and $45 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Property level operating expenses exclude the costs associated with hotels we have sold during the periods presented, which costs are included in discontinued operations. Rooms. The increase in rooms expenses reflects a 5.7% increase in expenses at our comparable hotels, due primarily to higher wages, benefits, travel agent commissions and reservations expenses, as well as the increase in occupancy during the year. Rooms expense also increased 8.0% due to the inclusion of an incremental $59 million in expenses from our Recent Acquisitions. The increase in rooms expenses in 2010 was consistent with the overall increase in occupancy during the year and higher wage costs. Food and beverage. The increase in food and beverage expenses at our hotels reflects a 4.8% increase at our comparable hotels due to increases in food and beverage business, however, the overall productivity for the department improved. Food and beverage expense also increased 5.6% due to the inclusion of an incremental $54 million in expenses from our Recent Acquisitions. The increase in food and beverage costs in 2010 reflects the increase in revenues, partially offset by the positive shift in the mix of business to more catering and audio visual revenues. However, for 2010, weak productivity in banquet sales hurt overall profitability. 57 Table of Contents Other departmental and support expenses. The increase in other departmental and support expenses in 2011 resulted from the Recent Acquisitions, along with increases in sales and marketing and administrative expenses. The increase in revenues drove an increase in non controllable hotel expenses during 2010, such as credit card commissions, bonus expense, loyalty rewards program expenses and cluster and shared service allocations. Management fees. Our base management fees, which generally are calculated as a percentage of total revenues, increased 9.8% for 2011 and 3.9% in 2010, which is a result of the increase in revenues at our comparable hotels, as well as the inclusion of management fees for our Recent Acquisitions. The incentive management fees, which are based on the level of operating profit at each property after the owner has received a priority return on its investment, increased 16.0% in 2011 and 17.5% in 2010, consistent with the increase in operating profit at those properties earning the incentive fees. Other property level expenses. These expenses generally do not vary significantly based on occupancy and include expenses such as property taxes and insurance. For 2011 and 2010, the increase was driven primarily by the inclusion of the HPT hotel expenses discussed below. For 2011, expenses for hotels leased from HPT include rental expense of $68 million due to HPT, as well as $159 million of hotel expenses. For 2010, expenses for hotels leased from HPT include rental expense of $84 million due to HPT, as well as the $96 million of hotel expenses incurred subsequent to the sublease termination. For 2009, expenses for hotels leased from HPT represent rental expense due to HPT of $80 million. Depreciation and amortization. The increase in depreciation expense in 2011 is due to the inclusion of depreciation expense for newly acquired properties and recent capital expenditures. The decline in depreciation expense in 2010 is due to impairment charges of approximately $20 million recorded in 2009. Other Income Statement Line Items Corporate and Other Expenses. Corporate and other expenses primarily consist of employee salaries and bonuses and other costs, such as employee stock based compensation expense, travel, corporate insurance, legal fees, acquisition related costs, audit fees, building rent and systems costs. Corporate expenses increased approximately $3 million in 2011 due to the $15 million loss on the forfeited deposit for the Grand Hyatt Washington, D.C. transaction and the accrual of $5 million of additional litigation costs, which was largely offset by the decline in employee stock compensation. The stock based compensation is based on employee performance, as well as Host Inc.s stockholder return relative to other REITs and to other lodging companies and will vary significantly due to fluctuations in Host Inc.s stock price. Corporate expenses decreased $8 million in 2010 compared to 2009. The decrease primarily was due to litigation costs of $41 million accrued in 2009 for a potential litigation loss. The decrease was offset partially by an increase in stock based compensation expense and bonus accruals, as they returned to more normalized levels in 2010, and an increase of $10 million due to costs associated with consummated property acquisitions. Gain on Insurance Settlement. During 2011, we recorded a gain of $2 million related to the receipt of business interruption insurance for our two properties in Christchurch, New Zealand, both of which were affected by an earthquake in February 2011. The two properties were damaged substantially and remain closed. We believe the property damage is covered under our insurance policy. We recorded a gain on insurance settlement of $3 million in 2010 for business interruption insurance related to our two hotels in Chile, both of which were affected by the earthquake in July 2010. Interest Expense. The decrease in interest expense during 2011 is due primarily to a decrease in costs associated with debt extinguishments (including the acceleration of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts), which totaled $9 million in 2011, compared to $21 million in 2010. After adjusting for debt extinguishment, interest expense was comparable to 2010 levels. In addition, savings from the fixed to floating interest rate swap that we entered into in the second half of 2009 for our $300 million mortgage on The Ritz Carlton, Naples and Newport Beach Marriott Hotel & Spa reduced interest expense by $6 million for 2011 and 2010 and $1 million in 2009. 58 Table of Contents The increase in interest expense during 2010 from 2009 is due primarily to costs associated with debt extinguishments totaling $21 million, compared to a net gain of $9 million on debt extinguishments in 2009. This increase was offset partially by a net decrease in our overall debt balance, which resulted in interest savings of approximately $23 million. Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Affiliates. The increase in earnings of affiliates during 2011 primarily is due to the inclusion of the operations of the Le M&eacute;ridien Piccadilly and the Pullman Paris Bercy in Fund II of the Euro JV and also reflects a 5.5% growth in RevPAR at the comparable hotels within the joint venture due to rate improvements. In 2009, we determined that the carrying value of our investment in the Euro JV exceeded its fair value on an other than temporary basis. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $34 million, which significantly decreased equity in earnings (losses) of affiliates for 2009, particularly when compared to 2011 and 2010. Benefit for Income Taxes. We lease substantially all of our properties to consolidated subsidiaries designated as TRS for federal income tax purposes. The difference between hotel level operating cash flow and the aggregate rent paid to Host L.P. by the TRS represents taxable income or loss, on which we record an income tax provision or benefit. The decrease in the tax benefit in each of 2011 and 2010 reflects year over year improvements in property operations recognized by our TRS, as well as increases in foreign taxes in 2011. Discontinued Operations. Discontinued operations consist of one hotel disposed of in 2011, two hotels disposed of in 2010 and six hotels disposed of in 2009 and represent the results of operations and the gains on the disposition of these hotels during the indicated periods. The following table summarizes the revenues, loss before taxes, and the gain (loss) on dispositions, net of tax, of the hotels which have been reclassified to discontinued operations, which includes assets held for sale and the results of sold hotels prior to their disposition for the periods presented (in millions): 2011 2010 2009 Revenues $ 5 $ 14 $ 81 Loss before taxes (4 ) (3 ) (88 ) Gain (loss) on dispositions, net of tax (2 ) 26 Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity and Capital Resources of Host Inc. and Host L.P. The liquidity and capital resources of Host Inc. and Host L.P. are derived primarily from the activities of Host L.P. Host L.P. generates the capital required by our business through its operations, the direct or indirect incurrence of indebtedness and the issuance of OP units. Host Inc. is a REIT and its only material asset is the ownership of partnership interests of Host L.P.; therefore, its financing and investing activities are conducted through Host L.P., except for the issuance of its common and preferred stock. Proceeds from stock issuances by Host Inc. are contributed to Host L.P. in exchange for OP units. Additionally, funds used by Host Inc. to pay dividends or to repurchase stock are provided by Host L.P. Therefore, while we have noted those areas in which it is important to distinguish between Host Inc. and Host L.P., we have not included a separate discussion of the liquidity and capital resources of each entity as the discussion below can be applied to both Host Inc. and Host L.P. Overview. We look to maintain a capital structure and liquidity profile with an appropriate balance of cash, debt and equity in order to provide financial flexibility, given the inherent volatility in the lodging industry. During 2011, as operations have improved, we maintained our focus on strategically decreasing our debt to equity ratio through (i) acquisitions and other investments, the majority of which were completed with available cash and proceeds from equity issuances, and (ii) the repayment and refinancing of senior notes and mortgage debt to extend maturity dates and lower interest rates. We also look to structure our debt profile to allow us to access different forms of financing, primarily senior notes, exchangeable debentures and corporate credit facility draws, as well as mortgage debt. Generally, this means that we will look to minimize the number of assets that are encumbered by mortgage debt, minimize near term maturities, and maintain a balanced maturity schedule. As of December 31, 2011, 107 of our 121 hotels were unencumbered by mortgage debt and approximately 81% of our debt consists of senior notes, exchangeable 59 Table of Contents debentures and borrowings under our credit facility, all of which are not collateralized by specific hotel properties. Additionally, our maturities for 2012 are 6.9% of our total debt ($7 million of senior notes and $388 million of exchangeable debentures). We also entered into a new senior revolving credit facility that expanded our revolving borrowing capacity to $1 billion and has an initial maturity of November 2015. As a result, our liquidity position remains very strong, with approximately $826 million of cash and cash equivalents and $883 million of available capacity under our credit facility. As a result of the current operating environment and the flexibility provided by our credit facility, we anticipate that over time we will reduce our available cash balances closer to the $100 million to $150 million level. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and access to the capital markets to take advantage of opportunities to enhance our portfolio, withstand declines in operating cash flow, pay our near term debt maturities and fund our capital expenditures programs. We may continue to access the capital markets if favorable conditions exist in order to further enhance our liquidity and to fund cash needs. The chart below details our significant cash flows for the three years ended December 31, 2011 (in millions): 2011 2010 2009 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of year $ 1,113 $ 1,642 $ 508 Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (287 ) (529 ) 1,134 Cash and cash equivalents, end of year $ 826 $ 1,113 $ 1,642 Operating activities Cash provided by operating activities $ 661 $ 520 $ 552 Investing activities Acquisitions and investments (1,096 ) (434 ) (7 ) Dispositions and return of investment 47 12 251 Capital expenditures (542 ) (309 ) (340 ) Financing activities Issuances of debt 955 500 906 Net draws (repayments) on credit facility 63 56 (410 ) Repurchase of senior notes, including exchangeable debentures (404 ) (821 ) (139 ) Debt prepayments and scheduled maturities (210 ) (364 ) (342 ) Host Inc.: Common stock issuances 323 406 767 Redemption of preferred stock (101 ) Dividends on common stock (70 ) (20 ) (42 ) Host L.P.: Common OP unit issuance 323 406 767 Redemption of preferred units (101 ) Distributions on common OP units (71 ) (20 ) (43 ) Cash Requirements. We use cash primarily for acquisitions, capital expenditures, debt payments, operating costs, corporate and other expenses, as well as dividends and distributions to stockholders and unitholders. As a REIT, Host Inc. is required to distribute to its stockholders at least 90% of its taxable income, excluding net capital gain, on an annual basis. Funds used by Host Inc. to make cash distributions are provided by Host L.P. Our primary sources of cash are cash from operations, proceeds from the sale of assets, borrowings under our credit facility and debt and equity issuances. 60 Table of Contents Below is a schedule of our debt maturities through 2014. As of December 31, 2011, our weighted average interest rate is 6.3% and our weighted average maturity is 4.4 years. See Financial Condition for more information on our debt maturities. During 2011, we took advantage of lower interest rates to issue new debt and used the proceeds to repay near term maturities, resulting in the issuance of approximately $955 million of senior notes and mortgage debt, that has been or will be used to fund the repayment or redemption of $792 million of senior notes and exchangeable debentures (including the $388 million of 2007 Debentures that we expect to be put to us in April of 2012) and $210 million of mortgage debt. Remaining Debt Maturities 2012 2014 (in millions) 2012 2013 2014 2.625% Exchangeable Senior Debentures (1) $ 388 $ $ Senior notes 7 500 3.250% Exchangeable Senior Debentures (2) 175 Mortgage loan, Orlando World Center Marriott 246 Mortgage loan, JW Marriott, Washington, D.C (3) 110 Mortgage loan, Harbor Beach Marriott Resort & Spa 134 Mortgage loan, The Ritz Carlton, Naples and Newport Beach Marriott Hotel & Spa 300 Other bonds 32 Principal amortization on other debt 5 3 1 Total maturities $ 400 $ 359 $ 1,142 (1) Our 2.625% Exchangeable Senior Debentures are due in 2027, but are subject to a put option by the holders on April 15, 2012, which we anticipate they will exercise. The $388 million represents the face amount of the outstanding principal at December 31, 2011. (2) Our 3.250% Exchangeable Senior Debentures are due in 2024, but are subject to a put option by the holders on April 15, 2014. The $175 million represents the face amount of the outstanding principal at December 31, 2011. (3) This mortgage can be extended for one year, at our option, provided that debt coverage exceeds certain ratios and other conditions are met. Capital Resources. As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $826 million of cash and cash equivalents, which was a decrease of $287 million from December 31, 2010. We also had $883 million available under our credit facility at December 31, 2011. As of December 31, 2011, our secured mortgage indebtedness totaled approximately $1.0 billion, which represents approximately 17% of our overall indebtedness, and is secured by 14 of our hotels. We depend primarily on external sources of capital to finance future growth, including acquisitions. As a result, the liquidity and debt capacity provided by our credit facility and the ability to issue senior unsecured debt are key components of our capital structure. Therefore, our financial flexibility (including our ability to incur debt, make distributions and make investments) is contingent on our ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants, which include, among other things, the allowable amounts of leverage, interest coverage and fixed charges. During 2010 and 2011, we have decreased our near term debt maturities, expanded our borrowing capacity under our senior revolving credit facility and maintained compliance with our senior note and credit facility covenants. If, at any time, we determine that market conditions are favorable, after taking into account our liquidity requirements, we may seek to issue and sell shares of Host Inc. common stock in registered public offerings, including through sales directly on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under our existing or a future at the market offering program, or to issue and sell shares of Host Inc. preferred stock. We also may seek to cause Host L.P. to issue debentures exchangeable for shares of Host Inc. common stock or senior notes. Given our total debt level and maturity schedule, we will continue to redeem or refinance senior notes and mortgage debt from time to time, taking advantage of favorable market conditions. In February of 2012, Host Inc.s Board of Directors authorized repurchases up to $500 million of senior notes, exchangeable debentures and mortgage debt (other than in accordance with its terms). Separately, the Board of Directors authorized redemptions and repurchases of all or a portion of $175 million principal amount of our 3 1/4% exchangeable debentures. Any redemption of the 3 1/4% exchangeable debentures will not reduce the $500 million of Board authority noted above to repurchase other debt securities. We may purchase senior notes and exchangeable debentures for cash through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, a tender offer or, in some cases, through the early redemption of such securities 61 Table of Contents pursuant to their terms. Repurchases of debt, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. Any refinancing or retirement before the maturity date would affect earnings and FFO per diluted share as a result of the payment of any applicable call premiums and the acceleration of previously deferred financing costs. Accordingly, in light of our priorities in managing our capital structure and liquidity profile, and given the movement in prevailing conditions in the capital markets and relative pricing, we may, at any time, subject to applicable securities laws, be considering, or be in discussions with respect to, the purchase or sale of common stock, exchangeable debentures and or senior notes. Any such transactions may, subject to applicable securities laws, occur simultaneously. On April 21, 2011, Host Inc. entered into a new Sales Agency Financing Agreement with BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC, through which Host Inc. may issue and sell, from time to time, shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $400 million. The agreement followed the completion of $400 million of sales under a similar agreement, also with BNY Mellon Capital Markets, Inc., that was entered into in 2010. The sales will be made in at the market offerings under SEC rules, including sales made directly on the NYSE. BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC is acting as sales agent. Host Inc. is not under an obligation to sell any shares. During 2011, we issued 19.1 million shares, through this new program and the remaining capacity of the 2010 program, at an average price of $17.09 per share, for net proceeds of $323 million. As of December 31, 2011, we have $174 million of capacity remaining under this program. Counterparty Credit Risk. We are subject to counterparty credit risk, which relates to the ability of counterparties to meet their contractual payment obligations or the potential non performance of counterparties to deliver contracted commodities or services at the contracted price. We assess the ability of our counterparties to fulfill their obligation to determine the impact, if any, of counterparty bankruptcy or insolvency on our financial condition. We are exposed to credit risk with respect to cash held at various financial institutions, access to our credit facility and amounts due or payable under our derivative contracts. Our credit exposure in each of these cases is limited. Our exposure with regard to our cash and the $883 million available under our credit facility is mitigated, as the credit risk is spread among a diversified group of investment grade financial institutions. At December 31, 2011, the exposure risk related to our derivative contracts totaled $22 million and the counterparties were investment grade financial institutions. Sources and Uses of Cash. During 2011, our sources of cash included cash from operations, proceeds from debt and equity issuances and proceeds from the sale or transfer of assets. Uses of cash during the year consisted of acquisitions, investments in our joint ventures, capital expenditures, operating costs, debt repayments and repurchases and distributions to equity holders. During 2012, we anticipate that our primary uses of cash will include acquisitions and investments, capital expenditures at our hotels, the repayment or repurchase of our debt maturing in the near term and distributions to equity holders. We anticipate that our primary sources of cash for 2012 will include cash from operations and proceeds from equity and debt issuances and hotel dispositions. Cash Provided by Operations. Our cash provided by operations for 2011 increased $141 million to $661 million compared to 2010 due to improvements in our GAAP operating profit, after adjusting for non cash items, which primarily consist of depreciation expense. Cash Used in Investing Activities. Approximately $1.6 billion of cash was used in investing activities during 2011. This included approximately $1.0 billion of acquisitions, which is net of debt and other liabilities assumed and $542 million of capital expenditures. We also invested approximately $49 million of cash in our unconsolidated joint ventures, which was offset partially by the $40 million of proceeds we received for the transfer of the Le M&eacute;ridien Piccadilly to the Euro JV Fund II. During 2011, we purchased 10 hotel assets located in New York, San Diego, Melbourne, Australia, and four cities in New Zealand for an aggregate amount of approximately $1.1 billion. We recognized the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non controlling interests in the acquiree at the fair value on the acquisition date. While we continue to actively explore potential acquisitions, given the nature of the transactions, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in acquiring any one or more hotel properties that we may review, bid on or negotiate to purchase. We may acquire additional properties through various structures, including transactions involving single assets, portfolios, joint ventures and acquisitions of all or substantially all of the securities or assets 62 Table of Contents of other REITs. We anticipate that future acquisitions will be funded primarily by proceeds from equity offerings of Host Inc., or issuance of OP units by Host L.P., but potentially also from the proceeds from sales of properties from our existing portfolio, the incurrence of debt, available cash or advances under our credit facility. In 2011, total capital expenditures increased $233 million to $542 million. Our renewal and replacement capital expenditures for 2011 were approximately $327 million, which reflects an increase of approximately 68% from 2010 levels. Our renewal and replacement capital expenditures are generally funded by the furniture, fixture and equipment funds established at certain of our hotels (typically funded with approximately 5% of property revenues) and by our available cash. We also spent approximately $215 million in 2011 on ROI/redevelopment projects, which reflects an increase of approximately 89% compared to 2010 levels, as these projects include some of our largest hotels. Capital expenditures have totaled approximately $2.5 billion over the past five years. As a result, we believe that our properties are in a strong competitive position with respect to their market competitors.

Cash Provided by/Used in Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $628 million for 2011, as compared to cash used in financing activities of $343 million in 2010. During 2011, cash used consisted of debt repayments or repurchases of approximately $704 million, while we received proceeds of approximately $1.4 billion through the issuance of debt and equity securities.

Senior Notes. The following summary is a description of the material provisions of the indentures governing our various senior notes issued by Host L.P., which we refer to collectively as the senior notes indenture. We pay interest on each series of our outstanding senior notes semi annually in arrears at the respective annual rates indicated on the table above. Under the terms of our senior notes indenture, our senior notes are equal in right of payment with all of Host L.P.s unsubordinated indebtedness and senior to all subordinated obligations of Host L.P. Pledges and Guarantees. Under the senior notes indenture, all Host L.P. subsidiaries which guarantee Host L.P. debt similarly are required to guarantee debt issuances under the indenture. Also, to the extent the equity of any subsidiaries of Host L.P. are pledged to secure borrowings under the credit facility, such collateral is likewise required to secure senior note issuances under the senior notes indenture. Because both the pledges and guarantees supporting the prior credit facility were released upon entering into the new senior bank credit facility in November 2011, the collateral pledges and guarantees that benefited ratably Host L.P.s senior notes also were released, such that all existing and future issuances of senior notes under the senior notes indenture similarly are on an unsecured basis and do not have the benefit of any subsidiary guarantees. While the current credit facility initially does not include any subsidiary guarantees or pledges of equity interests, they subsequently will be required in the event that Host L.P.s leverage ratio exceeds 6.0x for two consecutive fiscal quarters at a time that Host L.P. does not have an investment grade long term unsecured debt rating. In the event that such guarantee and pledge requirement is triggered, the guarantees and pledges would benefit ratably the credit facility, as well as the senior notes issued under the senior notes indenture and certain hedging and bank product arrangements with lenders that are parties to the credit facility. Restrictive Covenants. Under the terms of the senior notes indenture, our ability to incur indebtedness and make distributions is subject to restrictions and the satisfaction of various conditions, including the achievement of an EBITDA to interest coverage ratio of at least 2.0x. This ratio is calculated in accordance with the terms of our senior notes indenture based on pro forma results for the four prior fiscal quarters, giving effect to transactions such as acquisitions, dispositions and financings as if they occurred at the beginning of the period. Under the terms of our senior notes indenture, interest expense excludes items such as the gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt, deferred financing charges related to the senior notes or the credit facility, amortization of debt premiums or discounts that were recorded at acquisition of a loan to establish the debt at fair value and approximately $29 million of non cash interest expense recorded in 2011 related to our exchangeable debentures, all of which are included in interest expense on our consolidated statements of operations. Our subsidiaries are subject to the restrictive covenants in the indenture, however, in certain circumstances, we are permitted to designate certain subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries. These unrestricted subsidiaries are not subject to the restrictive covenants (unless they are 67 Table of Contents guarantors) and may engage in transactions to dispose of or encumber their assets or otherwise incur additional indebtedness without complying with the restrictive covenants in the indenture. If we were to designate additional subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries, neither the EBITDA generated by nor the interest expense allocated to these entities would be included in our ratio calculations. Other covenants limiting our ability to incur indebtedness, Host Inc.s ability to pay dividends and Host L.P.s ability to make distributions include maintaining total indebtedness of less than 65% of adjusted total assets (using undepreciated real estate book values), excluding intangible assets, and maintaining secured indebtedness and subsidiary indebtedness of less than 45% of adjusted total assets. So long as we maintain the required level of interest coverage and satisfy these and other conditions in the senior notes indenture, we may make preferred or common OP unit distributions and incur additional debt under the senior notes indenture, including debt incurred in connection with an acquisition. In addition, even if we are below the coverage levels otherwise required to incur debt and make distributions, we still are permitted to incur certain types of debt, including (i) credit facility debt, (ii) refinancing debt, (iii) up to $300 million or $400 million, depending on the series of senior notes, of mortgage debt whose proceeds would be used to repay debt under credit facility (and permanently reduce our ability to borrow under the credit facility by such amount), and (iv) up to $100 million or $150 million, depending on the series of senior notes, of other debt. We also are permitted to make distributions of estimated taxable income that are necessary to maintain Host Inc.s REIT status. Our senior notes indenture also imposes restrictions on customary matters, such as Host L.P.s ability to make distributions on, redeem or repurchase its OP units; make investments; permit payment or dividend restrictions on certain of our subsidiaries; sell assets; guarantee indebtedness; enter into transactions with affiliates; create certain liens; and sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies. Our senior notes indenture also imposes a requirement to maintain unencumbered assets (defined in the indenture as undepreciated property book value) of not less than 125% of the aggregate amount of unsecured indebtedness. This coverage requirement must be maintained at all times and is distinct from the coverage requirements necessary to incur debt or make distributions discussed above (whose consequences, where we fall below the coverage level, are limited to restricting our ability to incur new debt or make distributions, but which would not otherwise cause a default under our senior notes indenture). We are in compliance with all of our financial covenants under the senior notes indenture. The following table summarizes the financial tests contained in the senior notes indenture as of December 31, 2011: Actual Ratio Covenant Requirement Unencumbered assets tests 348 % Minimum ratio of 125 % Total indebtedness to total assets 31 % Maximum ratio of 65 % Secured indebtedness to total assets 5 % Maximum ratio of 45 % EBITDA to interest coverage ratio 3.1x Minimum ratio of 2.0x Exchangeable Debentures. As of December 31, 2011, we have three series of exchangeable senior debentures outstanding: $400 million of 2 1/2% debentures that were issued on December 22, 2009 (the 2009 Debentures), $388 million of 2 5/8% debentures that were issued on March 23, 2007 (the 2007 Debentures) and $175 million of 3 1/4% debentures that were issued on March 16, 2004 (the 2004 Debentures). We refer to these collectively as the Debentures. The Debentures are equal in right of payment with all of our other senior notes. Holders have the right to require us to purchase the Debentures at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount outstanding plus accrued interest (the put option) on certain dates subsequent to their respective issuances. Holders of the Debentures also have the right to exchange the Debentures prior to maturity under certain conditions, including at any time at which the closing price of Host Inc.s common stock is more than 120% (for the 2004 Debentures) or 130% (for the 2007 and 2009 Debentures) of the exchange price per share for at least 20 of 30 consecutive trading days during certain periods or at any time up to two days prior to the date on which the Debentures have been called for redemption. We can redeem for cash all, or part of, any of the Debentures at any time subsequent to each of their respective redemption dates at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. If, at any time, we elect to redeem the Debentures and the exchange value exceeds the cash redemption price, we would expect the holders to elect to exchange the Debentures at the respective exchange value rather than receive the cash redemption price. The exchange value is equal to the applicable exchange rate multiplied by the price of Host Inc.s common stock. Upon exchange, the 2004 Debentures would be exchanged for Host Inc.s common stock, the 2007 Debentures would be exchanged for a combination of cash (for the principal balance of the debentures) and Host Inc.s common stock (for the remainder of the exchange value) and the 2009 Debentures would be exchanged for Host Inc.s common stock, cash or a combination thereof, at our option. Currently, none of the Debentures are exchangeable by holders. 68 Table of Contents The following chart details our outstanding Debentures as of December 31, 2011: Maturitydate Next putoptiondate Redemptiondate Outstandingprincipalamount Current exchangerate for each$1,000 of principal Currentequivalentexchange price Exchangeableshareequivalents (in millions) (in shares) (in shares) 2009 Debentures 10/15/2029 10/15/2015 10/20/2015 $ 400 71.9264 $ 13.90 28.8 million 2007 Debentures 4/15/2027 4/15/2012 4/20/2012 388 32.0239 31.23 12.4 million 2004 Debentures 4/15/2024 4/15/2014 4/19/2009 175 65.5744 15.25 11.5 million Total $ 963 We separately account for the liability and equity components of our exchangeable debentures in order to reflect the fair value of the liability component based on our non convertible borrowing cost at the issuance date. Accordingly, for the Debentures, we record the liability components thereof at fair value as of the date of issuance and amortize the resulting discount as an increase to interest expense over the expected life of the debt; however, there is no effect on our cash interest payments. We measured the fair value of the debt components of the 2009 Debentures, 2007 Debentures and 2004 Debentures at issuance based on effective interest rates of 6.9%, 6.5% and 6.8%, respectively. As a result, we attributed $247 million of the proceeds received to the conversion feature of the Debentures. This amount represents the excess proceeds received over the fair value of the debt at the date of issuance and is included in Host Inc.s additional paid in capital and Host L.P.s partners capital on the consolidated balance sheets. The following chart details the initial allocations between the debt and equity components of the debentures, net of the original issue discount, based on the effective interest rate at the time of issuance, as well as the debt balances at December 31, 2011 (in millions): Initial FaceAmount InitialLiabilityValue Initial EquityValue Face AmountOutstanding at12/31/2011 Debt CarryingValue at12/31/2011 UnamortizedDiscount at12/31/2011 2009 Debentures $ 400 $ 316 $ 82 $ 400 $ 342 $ 58 2007 Debentures 600 502 89 388 385 3 2004 Debentures 500 413 76 175 175 Total $ 1,500 $ 1,231 $ 247 $ 963 $ 902 $ 61 Interest expense recorded for the Debentures for the periods presented consists of the following (in millions): 2011 2010 2009 Contractual interest expense (cash) $ 31 $ 34 $ 26 Non cash interest expense due to discount amortization 31 32 27 Total interest expense $ 62 $ 66 $ 53 Credit Facility. On November 22, 2011, we entered into a new senior revolving credit facility with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as syndication agent, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch and The Bank of Nova Scotia as co documentation agents, and certain other agents and lenders. The new credit facility replaces our existing senior revolving credit facility which would have expired in September 2012. The new credit facility allows for revolving borrowings in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1 billion, including a foreign currency subfacility for Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars, New Zealand Dollars, Japanese Yen, Euros and British Pounds Sterling of up to the foreign currency equivalent of $500 million, subject to a lower amount in the case of New Zealand Dollar borrowings. The credit facility also provides a subfacility of up to $100 million for swingline borrowings and a subfacility of up to $100 million for issuances of letters of credit. Host L.P. also has the option to increase the aggregate principal amount of the credit facility by up to $500 million, subject to obtaining additional loan commitments and satisfaction of certain conditions. The credit facility has an initial scheduled maturity of November 2015, with an option for Host L.P. to extend the term for one additional year, subject to certain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee. At December 31, 2011, we 69 Table of Contents have $883 million of remaining available capacity under our credit facility. The amounts that remained outstanding at the time we entered into the new credit facility were transferred over to the new credit facility and remain outstanding. Collateral and Guarantees. The credit facility does not initially require any subsidiary guarantees or pledges of equity interests in our subsidiaries, and the guarantees and pledges are required only in the event that Host L.P.s leverage ratio exceeds 6.0x for two consecutive fiscal quarters at a time that Host L.P. does not have an investment grade long term unsecured debt rating. In the event that such guarantee and pledge requirement is triggered, the guarantees and pledges would ratably benefit the credit facility, as well as the notes outstanding under Host L.P.s senior notes indenture, interest rate and currency hedges and certain other hedging and bank product arrangements with lenders that are parties to the credit facility. Even when triggered, the guarantees and pledges only would be required by certain U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries of Host L.P. and a substantial portion of our subsidiaries would provide neither guarantees nor pledges of equity interests. Prepayments. Voluntary prepayments of the loans under the credit facility are permitted in whole or in part without premium or penalty. The loans under the credit facility are required to be prepaid in the event that asset sales reduce adjusted total assets (using undepreciated real estate book values) to below $10 billion if we do not reinvest the proceeds of those assets sales in new investments. At December 31, 2011, we have adjusted total assets, as defined in our credit facility, of $18.7 billion. Financial Covenants. The credit facility contains covenants concerning allowable leverage, fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage. Currently, we are permitted to make borrowings and maintain amounts outstanding under the credit facility so long as our leverage ratio is not in excess of 7.25x, our unsecured coverage ratio is not less than 1.75x and our fixed charge coverage ratio is not less than 1.25x. The financial covenants for the credit facility do not apply when there are no borrowings under the credit facility. Hence, so long as there are no amounts outstanding, we would not be in default if we do not satisfy the financial covenants and we do not lose the potential to draw under the credit facility in the future if we were ever to regain compliance with the financial covenants. These calculations are performed based on pro forma results for the prior four fiscal quarters, giving effect to transactions such as acquisitions, dispositions and financings as if they occurred at the beginning of the period. Under the terms of the credit facility, interest expense excludes items such as the gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt, deferred financing charges related to the senior notes or the credit facility, amortization of debt premiums or discounts that were recorded at acquisition of a loan to establish the debt at fair value and non cash interest expense due to the implementation in 2009 of accounting standards relating to our exchangeable debentures, all of which are included in interest expense on our consolidated statement of operations. Additionally, total debt used in the calculation of our leverage ratio is based on a net debt concept, under which cash and cash equivalents in excess of $100 million are deducted from our total debt balance. We are in compliance with all of our financial covenants under the credit facility. The following table summarizes the financial tests contained in the credit facility as of December 31, 2011: Actual Ratio Covenant Requirementfor all years Leverage ratio 4.8x Maximum ratio of 7.25x Fixed charge coverage ratio 2.2x Minimum ratio of 1.25x Unsecured interest coverage ratio (a) 3.2x Minimum ratio of 1.75x (a) If at any time our leverage ratio is above 7.0x, our minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio will be reduced to 1.5x. Interest and Fees. We pay interest on revolver borrowings under the credit facility at floating rates equal to LIBOR plus a margin either (i) ranging from 175 to 275 basis points (depending on Host L.P.s consolidated leverage ratio), or (ii) following the date on which Host L.P.s long term unsecured debt rating is investment grade and Host L.P. elects ratings based pricing, ranging from 100 to 160 basis points (depending on Host LPs unsecured long term debt rating). Based on our leverage ratio at December 31, 2011 of 4.8x, we would be able to borrow at a rate of LIBOR plus 200 basis points. While we are using leverage based pricing, to the extent that amounts under the credit facility remain unused, we pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unused portion of the loan commitment of 25 to 35 basis points, depending on our average revolver usage during the applicable period. Upon attainment of 70 Table of Contents an investment grade unsecured debt rating and election of ratings based pricing, in lieu of paying an unused commitment fee, we instead would pay a facility fee ranging from 15 basis points to 40 basis points, depending on our rating and regardless of usage. Other Covenants and Events of Default. The credit facility contains restrictive covenants on customary matters. Certain covenants are less restrictive at any time that our leverage ratio is below 6.0x. In particular, at any time that our leverage ratio is below 6.0x, we will not be subject to limitations on capital expenditures, and the limitations on acquisitions, investments, dividends and distributions contained in the credit facility will be superseded by the generally less restrictive corresponding covenants in our senior notes indenture. Additionally, the credit facilitys restrictions on incurrence of debt and the payment of dividends and distributions generally are consistent with our senior notes indenture. These provisions, under certain circumstances, limit debt incurrence to debt incurred under the credit facility or in connection with a refinancing, and limit dividend payments to those necessary to maintain Host Inc.s tax status as a REIT. The credit facility also includes usual and customary events of default for facilities of this nature, and provides that, upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default, payment of all amounts payable under the credit facility may be accelerated and the lenders commitments may be terminated. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain insolvency or bankruptcy related events of default, all amounts payable under the credit facility will automatically become due and payable and the lenders commitments will automatically terminate. Mortgage and Other Debt. As of December 31, 2011, we had 14 hotels that were secured by mortgage debt. Substantially all of our mortgage debt is recourse solely to specific assets, except in instances of fraud, misapplication of funds and other customary recourse provisions. As of December 31, 2011, secured debt represented approximately 17% of our total debt and our aggregate secured debt had an average interest rate of 5.0% and an average maturity of 2.6 years. The following table summarizes our outstanding debt and scheduled amortization and maturities related to mortgage and other debt as of December 31, 2011 (in millions): Balance as ofDecember 31,2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Mortgage Debt JW Marriott, Washington, D.C., 7.50%, due 4/2/2013 (1) $ 114 $ 3 $ 111 $ $ $ $ Orlando World Center Marriott, 4.75%, due 7/1/2013 246 246 Harbor Beach Marriott Resort and Spa, 5.55%, due 3/1/2014 134 134 The Ritz Carlton, Naples and Newport Beach Marriott Hotel and Spa, 3.37%, due 3/1/2014 (2) 312 312 The Westin Denver Downtown, 8.51%, due 12/11/2023 (3) 35 2 2 31 New Zealand hotel portfolio, 5.49%, due 2/18/2016 (4) 81 81 Hilton Melbourne South Wharf, 6.77%, due 11/23/2016 (5) 84 84 Total mortgage debt 1,006 5 359 446 165 31 Other Debt Philadelphia Airport Marriott industrial revenue bonds, 7 3/4%, due 12/1/2017 40 40 Industrial revenue bonds and other (6) 47 33 12 2 Total other debt 87 33 12 42 Total mortgage and other debt $ 1,093 $ 5 $ 359 $ 479 $ 12 $ 165 $ 73 71 Table of Contents (1) This floating rate mortgage is based on LIBOR plus 600 basis points, with a LIBOR floor of 1.5% and a LIBOR cap of 3%. The rate shown reflects the rate in effect at December 31, 2011. (2) During 2009, we entered into three interest rate swap agreements for the total notional amount outstanding on this loan. The rate shown reflects the weighted average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2011. The balance reflects the book value at December 31, 2011, as adjusted, due to the implementation of fair value hedge accounting. The face amount at December 31, 2011 was $300 million. (3) Beginning in 2013, the interest rate on this loan increases a minimum of 500 basis points and all excess cash (as defined in the loan agreement) generated by the partnership that owns this property is applied to principal; however, the loan can be repaid without a premium or penalty on that date. The amortization presented is the minimum principal payment considering the increase in interest rate, but does not include additional principal payments based on excess cash flow. We expect to repay this mortgage in 2013. (4) The floating interest rate is equal to the 3 month New Zealand Bank Bill Rate plus 120 basis points plus an additional commitment fee of 120 basis points per annum. In addition, we entered into a swap agreement that fixes 75% of the loan at an all in rate of 7.15%. The rate shown reflects the rate in effect at December 31, 2011. (5) The floating interest rate is equal to the 3 month BBSY plus 230 basis points. In addition, we entered into separate swap agreements that fix 75% of the loan at an all in rate of 6.7% and cap the remaining 25% at an all in interest rate of 9.9%. The rate shown reflects the rate in effect at December 31, 2011. (6) Industrial revenue bonds and other consist of loans with an average interest rate of 7.1% that mature through 2016, and capital leases with varying interest rates and maturity dates. Mortgage Debt of Consolidated and Unconsolidated Partner Interests. For the entities that we consolidate in our financial statements that have third party non controlling partnership interests, the portion of mortgage debt included in the above table that is attributable to the non controlling interests, based on their percentage of ownership of the ventures, is approximately $67 million. Additionally, we have non controlling interests in partnerships and joint ventures that are not consolidated and are accounted for under the equity method. The portion of the mortgage and other debt of these partnerships and joint ventures attributable to us, based on our percentage of ownership thereof, was $328 million at December 31, 2011. This debt balance primarily is attributable to our approximate one third ownership interest in the Euro JV. The mortgage debt related to the hotels owned by our Euro JV contains operating covenants that could result in the joint venture being required to escrow cash from operations or make principal repayments without penalty. The debt of all of our unconsolidated partnerships or ventures is non recourse to us. See Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations. Distribution/Dividend Policy. Host Inc. is required to distribute at least 90% of its annual taxable income, excluding net capital gain, to its stockholders in order to maintain its qualification as a REIT, including taxable income recognized for federal income tax purposes but with regard to which we do not receive cash. Funds used by Host Inc. to pay dividends are provided through distributions from Host L.P. As of February 22, 2012, Host Inc. is the owner of approximately 98.5% of the common OP units. The remaining 1.5% of the common OP units are held by various third party limited partners. Each OP unit may be offered for redemption by the holders thereof for cash or, at the election of Host Inc., Host Inc. common stock based on the then current conversion ratio. The current conversion ratio was adjusted from 1.0 to 1.021494 shares of Host Inc. common stock for each OP unit as a result of Host Inc.s special dividend in 2009, 90% of which was paid in shares of Host Inc. common stock. This adjustment was made to avoid any unintended dilution as a result of the portion of Host Inc.s dividend paid in common stock to its stockholders. Investors should take into account the 1.5% non controlling position of Host L.P. OP units when analyzing dividend payments by Host Inc. to its stockholders, as these holders of OP units share, on a pro rata basis, in amounts being distributed by Host L.P. to holders of its corresponding OP units. For example, if Host Inc. paid a $1 per share dividend on its common stock, it would be based on the payment of a $1.021494 per common unit distribution by Host L.P. to Host Inc., as well as to other common OP unitholders. During 2011, Host Inc.s Board of Directors declared dividends of $0.14 per share (beginning in first quarter at $0.02 and increasing by $0.01 each quarter thereafter) on Host Inc.s common stock. Accordingly, Host L.P. made a distribution of $0.143 per unit on its common OP units. Host Inc.s policy on common dividends is generally to distribute, over time, 100% of its taxable income. Host Inc. intends to declare a dividend of $0.06 per share in the first quarter of 2012. The amount of any future dividend will be determined by Host Inc.s Board of Directors. 72 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Off Balance Sheet Arrangements. We are party to various transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements with unconsolidated entities (which we refer to as off balance sheet arrangements), under which we have certain contingent liabilities and guarantees. As of December 31, 2011, we are party to the following material off balance sheet arrangements: European Joint Venture. We have general and limited partner interests in the Euro JV that consists of two separate funds with APG Strategic Real Estate Pool NV, an affiliate of a Dutch Pension Fund, and Jasmine Hotels Pte Ltd, an affiliate of the real estate investment company of the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation Pte Ltd (GIC RE). We serve as the general partner for the joint venture and have a combined 32.1% ownership interest in Euro JV Fund I and a combined 33.4% interest in Euro JV Fund II. Due to the ownership structure and substantive participating rights of the non Host limited partners, including approval over financing, acquisitions and dispositions, and annual operating and capital expenditure budgets, it is not consolidated in our financial statements. As of December 31, 2011, the aggregate size of the Euro JV is approximately 1.3 billion ($1.7 billion). Our investment is approximately 140 million ($182 million), of which Euro JV Fund I is approximately 109 million ($141 million) and Euro JV Fund II is approximately 31 million ($41 million). As general partner, we earn a management fee based on the amount of equity commitments and equity investments. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, we recorded approximately $11 million, $5 million and $6 million of management fees, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, the partners have funded approximately 487 million, or 90%, of the total equity commitment for Euro JV Fund I and expect to utilize the remainder for capital expenditures and financing needs. On June 27, 2011, the Euro JV was expanded through the creation of Euro JV Fund II, in which each of the partners holds a 33.3% limited partner interest and we hold the 0.1% general partner interest. The Euro JV Fund II has a target size of 450 million of new equity and a target investment of approximately 1 billion, after taking into account anticipated debt. As part of the expansion, we transferred to Euro JV Fund II the Le M&eacute;ridien Piccadilly at a price of &pound;64 million ($102 million), including the assumption of the associated &pound;32 million ($52 million) mortgage. In addition to the expansion of the capacity of the Euro JV, we have extended its term from 2016 to 2021, subject to two one year extensions. On September 30, 2011, the Euro JV Fund II acquired the 396 room Pullman Bercy, Paris, for approximately 96 million, including certain acquisition costs of 6 million and a 52.6 million mortgage loan. We contributed 15 million ($20 million) to the Euro JV to finance our portion of the acquisition. The Euro JV Fund II will invest an additional 9 million to renovate the rooms and public space at the hotel. The Euro JV has 786 million of mortgage debt, all of which is non recourse to us and a default under these loans does not trigger a default under any of our debt. In 2010, the Euro JV negotiated various agreements with the lenders of a significant portion of this debt in order to cure actual or potential covenant defaults, cash sweeps, or non payment defaults that expire throughout 2012. The 341 million mortgage secured by a portfolio of six hotels located in Spain, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom and the &pound;32 million mortgage secured by Le M&eacute;ridien Piccadilly mature in 2013. Additionally, the 53 million mortgage secured by the Amsterdam hotel matures in 2013, but has two one year extension options, subject to small fees and certain financial covenants. Due to the difficult economic climate in Europe, the refinancing options may be limited and we expect that lenders may require more stringent financial covenants, higher rates of interest and lower loan to value ratios on future loans, which would require an equity contribution or debt paydowns with the proceeds from asset sales to reduce the loan principal balance. We have entered into five foreign currency forward sale contracts in order to hedge the foreign currency exposure resulting from the eventual repatriation of our net investment in the Euro JV. We have hedged 100 million (approximately $140 million) of our investment and the forward purchases will occur between October 2012 and August 2015. During 2011 and 2010, we recorded approximately $2 million and $5 million, respectively, related to the change in the fair value of the forward sale contracts to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The current value of the forward contracts of $9 million is included in other assets in the accompanying balance sheet. The derivatives are considered a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation, and, in accordance with applicable hedge accounting guidance, are marked to market with changes in fair value recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Host Inc.s stockholders equity portion and Host L.P.s partners capital portion of their balance sheets. For additional detail on the foreign currency forward sale contracts and our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 73 Table of Contents Asian Joint Venture. We have a 25% interest in the Asian JV, which is structured as a Singapore Corporation with RECO Hotels JV Private Limited, an affiliate of GIC RE, to explore investment opportunities in various markets throughout Asia and the Pacific region. The initial term of the Asian JV is for a period of seven years. Due to the ownership structure and the substantive participating rights of the non Host limited partner, including approval over financing, acquisitions and dispositions, and annual operating and capital expenditure budgets, the Asian JV is not consolidated in our financial statements. The commitment period for equity contributions to the Asian JV expires in March 2012. We do not plan to extend the commitment period beyond the current expiration date; however, we will continue to explore opportunities to invest in Asia with our strategic partners. During 2011, the Asian JV invested approximately $53 million (of which our share was $13.3 million) of its $65 million commitment to acquire a 36% interest of a joint venture in India with Accor S.A. and InterGlobe Enterprises Limited. This joint venture is developing seven properties, totaling approximately 1,750 rooms in three major cities in India, Bengaluru, Chennai and Delhi. The hotels will be managed by Accor under the Pullman, ibis and Novotel brands. The first two hotels are expected to be fully opened by March of 2012. Hospitality Properties Trust. We own a leasehold interest in 53 Courtyard by Marriott properties, which properties were sold to Hospitality Properties Trust (HPT) and leased back to us in 1995 and 1996. In conjunction with our conversion to a REIT, we entered into subleases with Barcel&oacute; Crestline for these 53 properties, as well as 18 Residence Inn by Marriott properties. In June 2010, HPT sent notices of default because the subtenants failed to meet net worth covenants, which would have triggered an event of default by us under the leases between us and HPT. As a result, we terminated the subleases effective July 6, 2010 and we resumed acting as owner under the management agreements. Effective upon termination of the subleases, we recorded the operations of the hotels as opposed to rental income in 2010 and 2011. On December 30, 2011, we entered into a settlement with Barcel&oacute; Crestline, who had guaranteed rent payments to HPT as part of the sublease, related to the termination of the subleases, which resulted in an additional $7 million of income being recorded in 2011 to compensate us for a portion of our operating losses subsequent to the sublease termination. We terminated the master lease with HPT on the 18 Residence Inn properties effective December 31, 2010 and received $17.2 million of deferred proceeds related to the initial sale and additional amounts held in the tenant collection account. On November 23, 2010, we gave notice that we will not extend the lease on the 53 Courtyard by Marriott properties, which will result in termination of the lease effective December 31, 2012. At the expiration of the lease, HPT is obligated to pay us deferred proceeds related to the initial sale of approximately $51 million, subject to damages arising out of an event of default, if any, under the lease plus additional amounts held in a tenant collection account. Tax Sharing Arrangements. Under tax sharing agreements with former affiliated companies (such as Marriott International, Inc., HMS Host and Barcel&oacute; Crestline Corporation), we are obligated to pay certain taxes (federal, state, local and foreign, including any related interest and penalties) relating to periods in which the companies were affiliated with us. For example, a taxing authority could adjust an item deducted by a former affiliate during the period that this former affiliate was owned by us. This adjustment could produce a tax liability that we may be obligated to pay under the tax sharing agreement. Additionally, under the partnership agreement between Host Inc. and Host L.P., Host L.P. is obligated to pay certain taxes (federal, state, local and foreign, including any related interest and penalties) incurred by Host Inc., as well as any liabilities the IRS may successfully assert against Host Inc. We do not expect any amounts paid under these tax sharing arrangements to be material. Tax Indemnification Agreements. As a result of certain federal and state income tax considerations of the former owners of two hotels currently owned by Host LP, we have agreed to restrictions on selling such hotels, or repaying or refinancing the mortgage debt for varying periods. One of these agreements expires in 2028 and the other in 2031. 74 Table of Contents Guarantees. We have certain guarantees, which consist of commitments we have made to third parties for leases or debt, that are not recorded on our books due to various dispositions, spin offs and contractual arrangements, but that we have agreed to pay in the event of certain circumstances, including default by an unrelated party. We consider the likelihood of any material payments under these guarantees to be remote. The largest guarantees (by dollar amount) are listed below: We remain contingently liable for rental payments on certain divested non lodging properties. These primarily represent certain restaurants that were sold subject to our guarantee of the future rental payments. The aggregate amount of these future rental payments is approximately $14 million as of December 31, 2011. In 1997, we owned Leisure Park Venture Limited Partnership, which currently owns and operates a senior living facility. We no longer have an ownership interest in the partnership, but remain obligated under a guarantee of interest and principal with respect to $14.7 million of municipal bonds issued by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority through their maturity in 2027. However, to the extent we are required to make any payments under the guarantee, we have been indemnified by Barcel&oacute; Crestline Corporation, who, in turn, is indemnified by the current owner of the facility. In connection with the sale of two hotels in January 2005, we remain contingently liable for the amounts due under the respective ground leases. The future minimum lease payments are approximately $13 million through the full term of the leases, including renewal options. We believe that any liability related to these ground leases is remote and, in each case, we have been indemnified by the purchaser of the hotel. Information on other guarantees and other off balance sheet arrangements may be found in Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements entitled Guarantees and Contingencies. Contractual Obligations. The table below summarizes our obligations for principal and estimated interest payments on our debt, future minimum lease payments on our operating and capital leases, projected capital expenditures and other long term liabilities, each as of December 31, 2011 (in millions): Payments due by period Total Less than1 year 1 to 3 years 3 to 5 years More than5 years Long term debt obligations (1) $ 7,252 $ 748 $ 2,125 $ 2,512 $ 1,867 Capital lease obligations 2 1 1 Operating lease obligations 1,660 113 88 80 1,379 Purchase obligations (2) 573 374 199 Other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet (3) 17 5 12 Total $ 9,504 $ 1,236 $ 2,418 $ 2,592 $ 3,258 (1) The amounts shown include amortization of principal, debt maturities and estimated interest payments. Interest payments have been included in this category based on the weighted average interest rate. (2) Our only purchase obligations consist of commitments for capital expenditures at our hotels. Under our contracts, we have the ability to defer some of these expenditures into later years. (3) The amounts shown include deferred management fees and the estimated amount of tax expense. Under terms of our management agreements, we have deferred payment of management fees to our hotel managers for some of our properties that have not achieved the required income thresholds for payment of owners priority to us. The timing of the payments, if any, is based on future operations, the termination of the management agreement or the sale of the hotel, and is, therefore, not determinable. The estimated amount of tax expense relates to uncertain tax liabilities from prior years. 75 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different, application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. We evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to the impairment of long lived assets, on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. All of our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. The following represent certain critical accounting policies that require us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates. Hotels Acquired in a Business Combination. We record our investments in hotel properties based on the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at acquisition date. Property and equipment are recorded at fair value and allocated to buildings, improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment using appraisals and valuations performed by management and independent third parties. Fair values are based on the exit price (i.e. the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date). We evaluate several factors, including market data for similar assets, expected cash flows discounted at risk adjusted rates and replacement cost for the assets to determine an appropriate exit cost when evaluating the fair value of our assets. Other items that we evaluate in a business combination include identifiable intangible assets, capital lease assets and obligations and goodwill. Identifiable intangible assets are typically assumed contracts, including ground and retail leases and management and franchise agreements, which are recorded at fair value. Above market and below market contract values are based on the present value of the difference between contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the contracts acquired and our estimate of the fair value of contract rates for corresponding contracts measured over the period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the contract. Intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over the remaining non cancelable term of the related agreements. Capital lease obligations that are assumed as part of the acquisition of a leasehold interest are measured at fair value and included as debt on the accompanying balance sheet and we record the corresponding right to use assets. Classification of a lease does not change if it is part of a business combination. In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we may utilize a number of sources that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of a property and other market data, including third party appraisals and valuations. In certain situations, a deferred tax liability may be created due to the difference between the fair value and the tax basis of the asset at the acquisition date. Any consideration paid in excess of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired would be recorded to goodwill. In very limited circumstances, we may record a bargain purchase gain if the consideration paid is less than the net fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired. Furthermore, acquisition related costs, such as due diligence, legal and accounting fees, are not capitalized or applied in determining the fair value of the acquired assets. Impairment Testing. We analyze our assets for impairment throughout the year when events or circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying values thereof may not be recoverable. We consider a property to be impaired when the sum of future undiscounted cash flows over our remaining estimated holding period is less than the carrying value of the asset. For impaired assets, we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the propertys carrying value over its fair value. To the extent that a property has a substantial remaining estimated useful life and management does not believe that it is more likely than not the property will be disposed of prior to the end of its useful life, it would be unusual for undiscounted cash flows to be insufficient to recover the propertys carrying value. In the absence of other factors, we assume that the estimated life is equal to the GAAP depreciable life because of the continuous property maintenance and improvement capital expenditures required under our management agreements. We adjust our assumptions with respect to the remaining useful life of the property if situations dictate otherwise, such as an expiring ground lease, or it is more likely than not that the asset will be sold prior to its previously expected useful life. We also consider the effect of regular renewal and replacement capital expenditures on the estimable life of our properties, including critical infrastructure, which is regularly maintained and then replaced at the end of its useful life. 76 Table of Contents We test for impairment in several situations, including when a property has a current or projected loss from operations, when it becomes more likely than not that a hotel will be sold before the end of its previously estimated useful life, or when other events, trends, contingencies or changes in circumstances indicate that a triggering event has occurred and the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. In the evaluation of the impairment of our assets, we make many assumptions and estimates, including: projected cash flows, both from operations and the eventual disposition; expected useful life and holding period; future required capital expenditures; and fair values, including consideration of capitalization rates, discount rates and comparable selling prices. While we consider all of the above indicators as a preliminary indicator to determine if the carrying value may not be recovered by undiscounted cash flows, we reviewed the actual year to date and the projected cash flows from operations to identify properties with actual or projected annual operating losses or minimal operating profit as of December 31, 2011. The projected cash flows consider items such as booking pace, occupancy, room rate and property level operating costs. As a result of our review, we identified six properties that required further consideration of property and market specific conditions or factors to determine if the property was impaired using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. Management considered a range of RevPAR and operating margins compared to prior years operating results in evaluating the projected cash flows from operations. To appropriately evaluate if the carrying value of the assets was recoverable, we projected a growth rate such that the individual properties would return to normalized levels of operations within five years and thereafter grow at a stabilized rate of 3% over the remaining estimable lives of the properties. This stabilized growth rate is lower than the projected growth rate for the urban upper upscale properties, which we believe is most representative of our portfolio, over the period from 2010 through 2020. Based on this test, no properties exhibited an impaired value at December 31, 2011. For purposes of this test, if we had assumed a growth rate of 0% after the return to normalized levels of operations, none of the six properties identified above would have required further analysis. Management believes its assumptions and estimates reflect current market conditions. During 2011, we recognized impairment expense in the aggregate amount of $8 million on two properties based on a change in their estimated hold periods. One of the properties was disposed of in 2011. Other than Temporary Impairment of an Investment. We review our equity method investments for other than temporary impairment based on the occurrence of any triggering events that would indicate that the carrying amount of the investment exceeds its fair value on an other than temporary basis. Triggering events can include a decline in distributable cash flows from the investment, a change in the expected hold period or other significant events which would decrease the value of the investment. Our investments primarily consist of joint ventures which own hotel properties; therefore, we generally will have few observable inputs and will determine the fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis of the investment, as well as considering the impact of other elements (i.e. control premiums, etc.). We use certain inputs, such as available third party appraisals and forecast net operating income for the hotel properties, to estimate the expected cash flows. If an equity method investment is impaired, a loss is recorded for the difference between its fair value and its carrying value. Based on this test, no other than temporary impairment was recorded in 2011. Classification of Assets as Held for Sale. Our policy for the classification of a hotel as held for sale is intended to ensure that the sale of the asset is probable prior to classifying it as such, will be completed within one year and that actions required to complete the sale are unlikely to change or that it is unlikely the planned sale will not occur. This policy is consistent with our experience with real estate transactions under which the timing and final terms of a sale are frequently not known until purchase agreements are executed, the buyer has a significant deposit at risk and no financing contingencies exist which could prevent the transaction from being completed in a timely manner. Specifically, we typically will classify properties that we are actively marketing as held for sale when all of the following conditions are met: Host Inc.s Board of Directors has approved the sale (to the extent that the dollar amount of the sale requires Board approval); a binding agreement to purchase the property has been signed; the buyer has committed a significant amount of non refundable cash; and no significant contingencies exist which could prevent the transaction from being completed in a timely manner. 77 Table of Contents To the extent that a property is classified as held for sale and its fair value less selling costs is lower than the net book value of the property, we will record an impairment loss. Depreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation expense is based on the estimated useful life of our assets and amortization expense for leasehold improvements is based on the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related assets. The lives of the assets are based on a number of assumptions, including cost and timing of capital expenditures to maintain and refurbish the assets, as well as specific market and economic conditions. While management believes its estimates are reasonable, a change in the estimated lives could affect depreciation expense and net income (loss) or the gain or loss on the sale of any of our hotels. Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets. We have approximately $125 million, net of a valuation allowance of $47 million, of deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2011. The objective of financial accounting and reporting standards for income taxes is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in a companys financial statements or tax returns. We have considered various factors, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future projected taxable income and tax planning strategies in determining a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets, and we believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the $125 million of net deferred tax assets in the future. When a determination is made that all, or a portion, of the deferred tax assets may not be realized, an increase in income tax expense would be recorded in that period. Valuation of Derivative Contracts. We occasionally will enter into derivative products, including interest rate and foreign currency swaps, caps and collars. Derivative instruments are subject to fair value reporting at each reporting date and the increase or decrease in fair value is recorded in net income (loss) or accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), based on the applicable hedge accounting guidance. We estimate the fair value of these instruments through the use of third party valuations, which utilize the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future cash receipts and the discounted future expected cash payments. We incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterpartys nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, we have considered the impact of netting any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts and guarantees. The variable cash flow streams are based on an expectation of future interest and exchange rates derived from observed market interest and exchange rate curves. The values of these instruments will change over time as cash receipts and payments are made and as market conditions change. Any event that impacts the level of actual and expected future interest or exchange rates will impact our valuations. The fair value of our derivatives is likely to fluctuate from year to year based on changing levels of interest and exchange rates and shortening terms to maturity. Stock Compensation. We recognize costs resulting from Host Inc.s share based payment transactions over their vesting periods. We classify share based payment awards granted in exchange for employee services as either equity awards or liability awards. The classification of Host Inc.s restricted stock awards as either an equity award or a liability award is based upon cash settlement options. Equity classified awards are measured based on the fair value on the date of grant. Liability classified awards are remeasured to fair value each reporting period. Awards are classified as liability awards to the extent that settlement features allow the recipient to have a percentage of the restricted stock awards withheld to meet tax withholding requirements. The value of these restricted stock awards, less estimated forfeitures, is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). No compensation cost is recognized for awards for which employees do not render the requisite services. During 2009, Host Inc. implemented an employee stock plan for our senior management that covered the period 2009 2011 and included the following awards: Restricted stock awards with vesting based on market conditions. These awards vest based on the total shareholder return relative to other REITs and lodging companies. They are classified as liability awards due to their cash settlement features and are remeasured to fair value each reporting period. We utilize a simulation, or Monte Carlo model, to determine the fair value of Host Inc.s restricted stock awards with vesting based on market conditions. The utilization of this model requires us to make certain estimates related to the volatility of the share price of Host Inc.s common stock, risk free interest rates, the risk profile of our common shares compared to our peer group and the amount of Host Inc.s awards expected to be forfeited. 78 Table of Contents Restricted stock awards with vesting based on performance conditions. These awards are earned based on the employee achieving a specified performance target, which will be based on the employees specific management business objectives. Compensation cost will be recognized when the achievement of the performance condition is considered probable. If a performance condition has more than one outcome that is probable, recognition of compensation cost will be based on the condition that is the most likely outcome. These awards are classified as liability awards due to their cash settlement provisions. Therefore, the value of the shares to be issued by Host Inc. will be based on Host Inc.s share price on the reporting date. Stock option awards. The stock option awards are equity classified awards, as they do not include cash settlement features. Therefore, the value of the award is determined on the grant date using a binomial pricing model and is not adjusted for future changes in fair value. Vesting for these awards is based on service conditions. The utilization of the binomial model requires us to make certain estimates related to the volatility of the share price of our common stock, risk free interest rates and the amount of our awards expected to be forfeited. On January 20, 2012, the Compensation Policy Committee of the Board of Directors adopted a new compensation plan for senior management (the 2012 Plan), which plan replaces the expired compensation program discussed above. Components of the 2012 Plan include cash bonuses based on corporate and employee performance measures and grants of restricted stock that vest based on market conditions (total stockholder return relative to the NAREIT Equity Index, the S&P 500 Index, and select hospitality companies that serve as relevant industry/asset specific competitors for capital) and performance conditions (employees specific management business objectives), as well as the issuance of stock options. Consolidation Policies. Judgment is required with respect to the consolidation of partnership and joint venture entities in terms of the evaluation of control, including assessment of the importance of rights and privileges of the partners based on voting rights, as well as financial interests that are not controllable through voting interests. We consolidate subsidiaries when we have the ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the subsidiary. For those partnerships and joint ventures of which we are the general partner, we review the rights of the limited partners to determine if those rights would preclude the assumption of control as the general partner. Limited partner rights which would preclude presumption of control by the general partner include the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the limited partnership or otherwise remove us, as the general partner, without cause and substantive participating rights, primarily through voting rights. We also evaluate our subsidiaries to determine if they should be considered variable interest entities (VIEs). If a subsidiary is a VIE, it is subject to the consolidation framework specifically for VIEs. We consider an entity a VIE if equity investors own an interest therein that does not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or if such investors do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 810, we reviewed our subsidiaries and affiliates to determine if (i) they should be considered VIEs, and (ii) whether we should change our consolidation determination based on changes in their characteristics. Foreign Currency Translation. The operations of foreign subsidiaries are maintained in their functional currency, which generally is the local currency, and are translated to U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates for the period. The assets and liabilities are translated to U.S. dollars using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting translation adjustments are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Foreign currency transactions are recorded in the functional currency of each entity using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured at period end exchange rates. The resulting exchange differences are recorded in gain (loss) on foreign currency transactions and derivatives, except when deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as qualifying net investment hedges. 79 Table of Contents Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics We present certain operating statistics (i.e., RevPAR, average daily rate and average occupancy) and operating results (revenues, expenses and adjusted operating profit) for the periods included in this report on a comparable hotel basis. We define our comparable hotels as properties (i) that are owned or leased by us and the operations of which are included in our consolidated results, whether as continuing operations or discontinued operations for the entirety of the reporting periods being compared, and (ii) that have not sustained substantial property damage or business interruption, or undergone large scale capital projects during the reporting periods being compared. Of the 121 hotels that we owned on December 31, 2011, 104 have been classified as comparable hotels. The operating results of the following hotels that we owned or leased as of December 31, 2011 are excluded from comparable hotel results for these periods: Hilton Melbourne South Wharf (acquired in April 2011); New York Helmsley Hotel (acquired in March 2011); Manchester Grand Hyatt San Diego (acquired in March 2011); The portfolio of seven hotels in New Zealand (acquired in February 2011); JW Marriott, Rio de Janeiro (acquired in September 2010); W New York, Union Square (acquired in September 2010); Westin Chicago River North (acquired in August 2010); Atlanta Marriott Perimeter Center (business interruption due to significant renovations); Chicago Marriott OHare (business interruption due to significant renovations); Sheraton Indianapolis Hotel at Keystone Crossing (business interruption due to significant renovations); and San Diego Marriott Marquis & Marina (business interruption due to significant renovations). The operating results of the Le M&eacute;ridien Piccadilly, which was transferred to the Euro JV Fund II, and of the three hotels we disposed of in 2011 and 2010, as well as the 53 Courtyard by Marriott properties leased from HPT, are not included in comparable hotel results for the periods presented herein. Moreover, because these statistics and operating results relate to our hotel properties, they exclude results for our non hotel properties and other real estate investments. We evaluate the operating performance of our comparable hotels based on both geographic region and property type. These divisions are generally consistent with groupings recognized in the lodging industry. Geographic regions consist of the following (only states in which we own hotels are listed): Pacific California, Hawaii, Oregon and Washington; Mountain Arizona and Colorado; North Central Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, Missouri and Ohio; South Central Louisiana, Tennessee and Texas; New England Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire; Mid Atlantic Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York; DC Metro Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C.; Atlanta Georgia and North Carolina; Florida Florida; and International Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Mexico and New Zealand. Property types consist of the following: Urban Hotels located in primary business districts of major cities; Suburban Hotels located in office parks or smaller secondary markets; 80 Table of Contents Resort/conference Hotels located in resort/conference destinations such as Arizona, Florida, Hawaii and Southern California; and Airport Hotels located at or near airports. Reporting Periods. For Consolidated Statement of Operations. The results we report are based on results of our hotels reported to us by our hotel managers. Our hotel managers use different reporting periods. Marriott, the manager of a significant percentage of our properties, uses a year ending on the Friday closest to December 31 and reports twelve weeks of operations for the first three quarters and sixteen or seventeen weeks for the fourth quarter of the year for its U.S. and Canadian Marriott managed hotels. In contrast, other managers of our hotels, such as Hyatt and Starwood, report results on a monthly basis. Host Inc., as a REIT, is required by federal income tax law to report results on a calendar year basis. As a result, we elected to adopt the reporting periods used by Marriott, modified so that our fiscal year always ends on December 31 in order to comply with REIT rules. Our first three quarters of operations end on the same day as Marriott, but our fourth quarter ends on December 31 and our full year results, as reported in our statement of operations, always includes the same number of days as the calendar year. Two consequences of the reporting cycle we have adopted are: (1) quarterly start dates will usually differ between years, except for the first quarter which always commences on January 1, and (2) our first and fourth quarters of operations and year to date operations may not include the same number of days as reflected in prior years. For example, set forth below are the quarterly start and end dates for 2012, 2011 and 2010. Note that the second and third quarters of each year both reflect twelve weeks of operations. In contrast, the first and fourth quarters reflect differing days of operations. 2012 2011 2010 Start End Dates No. ofDays Start End Dates No. ofDays Start End Dates No. ofDays First Quarter January 1 March 23 83 January 1 March 25 84 January 1 March 26 85 Second Quarter March 24 June 15 84 March 26 June 17 84 March 27 June 18 84 Third Quarter June 16 September 7 84 June 18 September 9 84 June 19 September 10 84 Fourth Quarter September 8 December 31 115 September 10 December 31 113 September 11 December 31 112 While the reporting calendar we adopted is more closely aligned with the reporting calendar used by Marriott, another consequence of our calendar is that we are unable to report the month of operations that ends after our fiscal quarter end until the following quarter because our hotel managers that use a monthly reporting period do not make mid month results available to us. Hence, the month of operation that ends after our fiscal quarter end is included in our quarterly results of operations in the following quarter for those hotel managers (covering approximately 43% of total revenues of our hotels). As a result, our quarterly results of operations include results from hotel managers reporting results on a monthly basis as follows: first quarter (January, February), second quarter (March to May), third quarter (June to August) and fourth quarter (September to December). While this does not affect full year results, it does affect the reporting of quarterly results. For Hotel Operating Statistics and Comparable Hotel Results. In contrast to the reporting periods for our consolidated statement of operations, our hotel operating statistics (i.e., RevPAR, average daily rate and average occupancy) and our comparable hotel results are reported based on the reporting cycle used by Marriott for our Marriott managed hotels. This facilitates year to year comparisons, as each reporting period will be comprised of the same number of days of operations as in the prior year. This means, however, that the reporting periods we use for hotel operating statistics and our comparable hotel results typically will differ slightly from the reporting periods used for our statements of operations for the first and fourth quarters and the full year. Set forth below are the quarterly start and end dates that are used for our hotel operating statistics and comparable hotel results reported herein. Results from hotel managers reporting on a monthly basis are included in our operating statistics and comparable hotel results consistent with their reporting in our consolidated statement of operations. 81 Table of Contents Hotel Result Reporting Periods for Operating Statistics and Comparable Hotel Results for Marriott Managed Properties 2012 2011 2010 Start End Dates No. ofDays Start End Dates No. ofDays Start End Dates No. ofDays First Quarter December 31 March 23 84 January 1 March 25 84 January 2 March 26 84 Second Quarter March 24 June 15 84 March 26 June 17 84 March 27 June 18 84 Third Quarter June 16 September 7 84 June 18 September 9 84 June 19 September 10 84 Fourth Quarter September 8 December 28 112 September 10 December 30 112 September 11 December 31 112 Non GAAP Financial Measures We use certain non GAAP financial measures, which are measures of our historical financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, within the meaning of applicable SEC rules. These measures are as follows: (i) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, as a measure of performance for Host Inc. and Host L.P., (ii) Funds From Operations (FFO) and FFO per diluted share (both NAREIT and Adjusted), as a measure of performance for Host Inc., and (iii) comparable hotel operating results, as a measure of performance for Host Inc. and Host L.P. The following discussion defines these terms and presents why we believe they are useful measures of our performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA EBITDA Earnings before Interest Expense, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries. Management believes EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties after removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense) and our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). Management also believes the use of EBITDA facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging REITs, hotel owners who are not REITs and other capital intensive companies. Management uses EBITDA to evaluate property level results and as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and, like FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share, it is widely used by management in the annual budget process and for compensation programs. Adjusted EBITDA Historically, management has adjusted EBITDA when evaluating Host Inc. and Host L.P. performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance and that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of net income, is beneficial to an investors complete understanding of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is also a relevant measure in calculating certain credit ratios. We adjust EBITDA for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refer to this measure as Adjusted EBITDA: Real Estate Transactions We exclude the effect of gains and losses, including the amortization of deferred gains, recorded on the disposition or acquisition of assets and property insurance gains in our consolidated statement of operations because we believe that including them in Adjusted EBITDA is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our assets. In addition, material gains or losses from the depreciated value of the disposed assets could be less important to investors given that the depreciated asset value often does not reflect its market value (as noted below for FFO). Equity Investment Adjustments We exclude the equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated investments in partnerships and joint ventures as presented in our consolidated statement of operations because it includes our pro rata portion of depreciation, amortization and interest expense, which are excluded from EBITDA. We include our pro rata share of the Adjusted EBITDA of our equity investments as we believe this more accurately reflects the performance of our investment. The pro rata Adjusted EBITDA of equity investments is defined as the EBITDA of our equity investments adjusted for any gains or losses on property transactions multiplied by our percentage ownership in the partnership or joint venture. 82 Table of Contents Consolidated Partnership Adjustments We deduct the non controlling partners pro rata share of the Adjusted EBITDA of our consolidated partnerships as this reflects the non controlling owners interest in the EBITDA of our consolidated partnerships. The pro rata Adjusted EBITDA of non controlling partners is defined as the EBITDA of our consolidated partnerships adjusted for any gains or losses on property transactions multiplied by the non controlling partners positions in the partnership or joint venture. Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle Infrequently, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) promulgates new accounting standards that require the consolidated statement of operations to reflect the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. We exclude these one time adjustments because they do not reflect our actual performance for that period. Impairment Losses We exclude the effect of impairment losses recorded because we believe that including them in Adjusted EBITDA is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our remaining assets. In addition, we believe that impairment charges are similar to gains (losses) on dispositions and depreciation expense, both of which are also excluded from EBITDA. Acquisition Costs Under GAAP, costs associated with completed property acquisitions are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the company. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies. This information should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating profit, cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Cash expenditures for various long term assets (such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures), interest expense and other items have been and will be incurred and are not reflected in the EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA presentations. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statement of operations and cash flows include interest expense, capital expenditures, and other excluded items, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance, as well as the usefulness of our non GAAP financial measures. Additionally, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. 83 Table of Contents The following table provides a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA (in millions): Reconciliation of Net Loss to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Year ended December 31, 2011 2010 Net loss $ (16 ) $ (132 ) Interest expense 371 384 Depreciation and amortization 647 591 Income taxes (1 ) (31 ) EBITDA 1,001 812 Losses on dispositions 2 Acquisition costs 5 10 Non cash impairment charges 8 Amortization of deferred gains (7 ) Equity investment adjustments: Equity in (earnings) losses of affiliates (4 ) 1 Pro rata Adjusted EBITDA of equity investments 29 23 Consolidated partnership adjustments: Pro rata Adjusted EBITDA attributable to non controlling partners in other consolidated partnerships (14 ) (14 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,018 $ 834 NAREIT FFO, NAREIT FFO per Diluted Share and Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share. We present NAREIT FFO and NAREIT FFO per diluted share as non GAAP measures of our performance in addition to our earnings per share (calculated in accordance with GAAP). We calculate NAREIT FFO per diluted share as our NAREIT FFO (defined as set forth below) for a given operating period, as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities, divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period in accordance with NAREIT guidelines. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (losses) from sales of real estate, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, real estate related depreciation, amortization and impairments and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect our pro rata FFO of those entities on the same basis. We believe that NAREIT FFO per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that the presentation of NAREIT FFO per diluted share, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of earnings per share, provides beneficial information to investors. By excluding the effect of real estate depreciation, amortization, impairments and gains and losses from sales of real estate, all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance, we believe such measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and with other REITs, even though NAREIT FFO per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted by NAREIT in its April 2002 White Paper on Funds From Operations, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. For these reasons, NAREIT adopted the FFO metric in order to promote an industry wide measure of REIT operating performance. Effective with this Form 10 K, we also present Adjusted FFO per diluted share when evaluating our performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. While we are presenting Adjusted FFO per diluted share as part of this Form 10 K for the first time, management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in evaluating our performance, in our annual budget process and for our compensation programs. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted FFO per diluted share, when combined with both the primary GAAP presentation of earnings per share and FFO per diluted share as defined by NAREIT, 84 Table of Contents provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investors complete understanding of our operating performance. We adjust NAREIT FFO per diluted share for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refer to this measure as Adjusted FFO per diluted share: Gains and Losses on the Extinguishment of Debt We exclude the effect of finance charges and premiums associated with the extinguishment of debt, including the acceleration of deferred financing costs from the original issuance of the debt being redeemed or retired. We also exclude the gains on debt repurchases and the original issuance costs associated with the retirement of preferred stock. We believe that these items are not reflective of our ongoing finance costs. Acquisition Costs Under GAAP, costs associated with completed property acquisitions are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the company. Litigation Gains and Losses We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance. We calculate NAREIT FFO per diluted share in accordance with standards established by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies who do not use the NAREIT definition of FFO or do not calculate FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT guidance. In addition, although FFO per diluted share is a useful measure when comparing our results to other REITs, it may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non REITs. This information should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating profit, cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Cash expenditures for various long term assets (such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures) and other items have been and will be incurred and are not reflected in the NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share presentations. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statement of operations and cash flows include capital expenditures, and other excluded items, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance, as well as the usefulness of our non GAAP financial measures. Additionally, NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. In addition, NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share do not measure, and should not be used as a measure of, amounts that accrue directly to the benefit of Host Inc. stockholders. 85 Table of Contents The following tables provide a reconciliation of net loss available to common stockholders per share to FFO per diluted share for Host Inc. (in millions, except per share amounts): Host Inc.

(b) Includes approximately $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 related to our share of acquisition costs incurred by unconsolidated joint ventures. (c) Earnings/loss per diluted share and FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT are adjusted for the effects of dilutive securities. Dilutive securities may include Host Inc. shares granted under Host Inc.s comprehensive stock plans, preferred OP units held by non controlling partners, exchangeable debt securities and other non controlling interests that have the option to convert their limited partnership interests to common OP units. No effect is shown for securities if they are anti dilutive. (d) Adjusted FFO per diluted share for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2011 was reduced by $.02 per diluted share due to the $15 million deposit forfeited as a result of the terminated Grand Hyatt Washington, D.C. acquisition. 86 Table of Contents Comparable Hotel Operating Results. We present certain operating results for our hotels, such as hotel revenues, expenses, and adjusted operating profit, on a comparable hotel, or same store, basis as supplemental information for investors of both Host Inc. and Host L.P. We present these comparable hotel operating results by eliminating corporate level costs, including expenses related to our capital structure, as well as depreciation and amortization. We eliminate corporate level costs and expenses because we believe property level results provide investors with more specific insight into the ongoing operating performance of our hotels. We eliminate depreciation and amortization because, even though depreciation and amortization are property level expenses, these non cash expenses, which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets, implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted earlier, because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. As a result of the elimination of corporate level costs and expenses and depreciation and amortization, the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues, expenses or operating profit and these comparable hotel operating results should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations include such amounts, all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance. We present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides investors and management with useful information for evaluating the period to period performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel REITs and hotel owners. In particular, these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues and or expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at comparable hotels (which represent the vast majority of our portfolio) or from other factors, such as the effect of acquisitions or dispositions. While management believes that presentation of comparable hotel results is a same store supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance, this measure is not used to allocate resources or assess the operating performance of these hotels, as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on comparable portfolio hotel results. For these reasons, we believe that comparable hotel operating results, when combined with the presentation of GAAP operating profit, revenues and expenses, provide useful information to investors and management. 87 Table of Contents The following table presents certain operating results and statistics for our comparable hotels for the periods presented herein: Comparable Hotel Results for Host Inc. and Host L.P.

See Reporting Periods for more information on our fiscal calendar. (b) Operating profit margins are calculated by dividing the applicable operating profit by the related revenue amount. GAAP margins are calculated using amounts presented in the consolidated statement of operations. Comparable margins are calculated using amounts presented in the above table.

(f) Represents income less expense for hotels leased from HPT. 89 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk All information in this section applies to Host Inc. and Host L.P. Interest Rate Sensitivity Our future income, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates. Market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. We have no derivative financial instruments that are held for trading purposes. We use derivative financial instruments to manage, or hedge, interest rate risks. The interest payments on 90% of our debt are fixed in nature (this percentage does not include $300 million of mortgage debt for which we have swapped fixed interest payments for floating interest payments), which largely mitigates the effect of changes in interest rates on our cash interest payments. Valuations for mortgage debt and the credit facility are determined based on expected future payments, discounted at risk adjusted rates. The senior notes and the Debentures are valued based on quoted market prices. If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increase or decrease by 100 basis points, interest expense would increase or decrease, respectively, our future earnings and cash flows by approximately $7 million in 2012. The table below presents scheduled maturities and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates (in millions, except percentages): Expected Maturity Date 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total FairValue Liabilities Debt: Fixed rate (1) $ 378 $ 231 $ 1,135 $ 1,046 $ 797 $ 1,770 $ 5,357 $ 5,679 Average interest rate 6.42 % 6.49 % 6.72 % 6.83 % 6.87 % 6.44 % Variable rate (1) $ 3 $ 111 $ $ 117 $ 165 $ $ 396 $ 401 Average interest rate (2) 5.70 % 5.22 % 5.00 % 5.07 % 6.76 % % Total debt $ 5,753 $ 6,080 Interest rate derivative Fixed to variable notional $ $ $ 300 $ $ $ Fair value (asset)/liability $ (11 ) Average pay rate (2) 3.37 % 3.37 % 3.37 % % % % Average receive rate 5.531 % 5.531 % 5.531 % % % % Variable to fixed notional $ $ $ $ $ 124 $ Fair value (asset)/liability $ 4 Average pay rate 6.92 % 6.92 % 6.92 % 6.92 % 6.76 % % Average receive rate (2) 6.15 % 6.15 % 6.15 % 6.15 % 6.76 % % (1) The amounts are net of unamortized discounts and premiums. (2) The interest rate for our floating rate payments is based on the rate in effect as of December 31, 2011. No adjustments are made for forecast changes in the rate. Interest rate swap derivatives designated as cash flow hedges. We have designated our floating to fixed interest rate swap derivatives as cash flow hedges. The derivatives are valued based on the prevailing market yield curve on the date of measurement. We also evaluate counterparty credit risk when we calculate the fair value of the swaps. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded to other comprehensive income (loss) on the accompanying balance sheets. The hedges were fully effective as of December 31, 2011. 90 Table of Contents In connection with the acquisition of the Hilton Melbourne South Wharf on April 29, 2011, we assumed an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of A$80 million ($86 million) related to its mortgage debt. In November 2011, as part of the refinancing of this loan, we paid approximately $1 million to settle the original swap and entered into a new interest rate swap with a notional amount of A$61.5 million ($60 million) and a maturity date of November 23, 2016. The purpose of the interest rate swap is to hedge against changes in cash flows (interest payments) attributable to fluctuations in the Reuters BBSY. As a result, we will pay an all in rate of 6.7% on the notional amount of the swap. We designated the derivative as a cash flow hedge. As a result of the change in fair value of this swap, a $0.3 million loss was recorded to other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. As of December 31, 2011, we recorded a liability of $0.4 million related to the fair value of this swap. On February 18, 2011, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of NZ$79 million ($60 million) related to the mortgage debt on the seven properties acquired in New Zealand on February 18, 2011. We entered into the swap in order to hedge against changes in cash flows (interest payments) attributable to fluctuations in the 3 month NZ$ Bank Bill rate. As a result, we will pay an all in rate of 7.15% on the notional amount of the swap, which includes the 120 basis point spread over the NZ$ Bank Bill rate plus an additional 120 basis point commitment fee. We have designated the derivative as a cash flow hedge. As a result of the change in fair value of this derivative, a $2.7 million loss was recorded to other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. As of December 31, 2011, we recorded a liability of $3.8 million related to the fair value of this swap. Interest Rate Swap Derivatives Designated as Fair Value Hedges. We have designated our fixed to floating interest rate swap derivatives as fair value hedges. We enter into these derivative instruments to hedge changes in the fair value of fixed rate debt that occur as a result of changes in market interest rates. The derivatives are valued based on the prevailing market yield curve on the date of measurement. We also evaluate counterparty credit risk in the calculation of the fair value of the swaps. The change in the fair value of the derivative is offset largely by the corresponding change in the fair value of the underlying debt due to change in the 3 month LIBOR rate, which is recorded as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the debt. Any difference between the change in the fair value of the swap and the change in the fair value in the underlying debt, which was not significant for the periods presented, is considered the ineffective portion of the hedging relationship and is recorded in net income (loss). We have three interest rate swap agreements for an aggregate notional amount of $300 million related to The Ritz Carlton, Naples and Newport Beach Marriott Hotel & Spa mortgage loan in the amount of $300 million. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, we recorded assets of $10.9 million and $10.6 million, respectively, related to the fair value of the swaps. During 2011 and 2010, the fair value of the swaps increased $0.3 million and $11.6 million, respectively. As a result, we will pay a floating interest rate equal to the 3 month LIBOR, plus a spread which ranges from 2.7% to 3.2%, as opposed to the fixed rate of 5.531%, on the notional amount of $300 million through March 1, 2014. During each of 2011 and 2010, the cash settlement received under the swap agreement decreased interest expense by $6 million. If we were to increase the interest rates from the prevailing market yield curve, which for our reverse swaps is 3 month LIBOR, by 25% at December 31, 2011, then the fair value of the swap would decrease $1 million. Similarly, if we were to decrease the interest rates from the prevailing market yield curve by 25% at December 31, 2011, then the fair value of the swap would increase by $1 million. Exchange Rate Sensitivity We have currency exchange risk as a result of our hotel ownership in Australia, Canada, Chile, Mexico, Brazil, and New Zealand and our investment in the European and Asian joint ventures. To manage the currency exchange risk applicable to ownership in non U.S. hotels, where possible, we may enter into forward or option contracts. The foreign currency exchange agreements that we have entered into were strictly to hedge foreign currency risk and not for trading purposes. During 2011, 2010 and 2008, we entered into five foreign currency forward sale contracts totaling 100 million (approximately $140 million) in order to hedge a portion of the foreign currency exposure resulting from the eventual repatriation of our net investment in the European joint venture. Pursuant to these transactions, we will sell the Euro amount and receive the U.S. dollar amount on the forward sale date. On July 29, 2011, we also entered into an NZ$30 million ($25 million) forward purchase contract in order to hedge a portion of the foreign currency exposure resulting from the eventual repatriation of our net investment in HHR New Zealand Holdings Limited. We will sell the NZ dollar amount and receive the U.S. dollar amount on August 2, 2013. These derivatives are considered a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation and are marked 91 Table of Contents to market with changes in fair value and recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Host Inc.s equity portion and Host L.P.s capital portion of their balance sheets. We also evaluate counterparty credit risk in the calculation of the fair value of the swaps.
