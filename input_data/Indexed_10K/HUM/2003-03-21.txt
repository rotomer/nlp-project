Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a description of a number of factors that could adversely affect our results. Business Segments We manage our business with two segments: Commercial and Government. The Commercial segment consists of members enrolled in products marketed to employer groups and individuals, and includes three lines of business: fully insured medical, administrative services only, or ASO, and specialty. The Government segment consists of members enrolled in government sponsored programs, and includes three lines of business: Medicare+Choice, Medicaid, and TRICARE. We identified our segments in accordance with the aggregation provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information which is consistent with information used by our Chief Executive Officer in managing our business. The segment information aggregates products with similar economic characteristics. These characteristics include the nature of customer groups and pricing, benefits, and underwriting requirements. The results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes. We allocate all selling, general and administrative expenses, investment and other income, interest expense, and goodwill, but no other assets or liabilities, to our segments. Members served by our two segments generally utilize the same medical provider networks, enabling us to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers. Our segments also share overhead costs and assets. As a result, the profitability of each segment is interdependent. 3 Table of Contents Strategy Our business strategy centers on increasing Commercial segment profitability while maintaining our existing strength in the Government segment. Our strategy to increase Commercial segment profitability focuses on providing solutions for employers to the rising cost of health care through the use of innovative and consumer centric product designs which are supported by service excellence and industry leading electronic capabilities, including education, tools and technologies provided primarily through the Internet. The intent of our Commercial segment strategy is to enable us to further penetrate high potential commercial markets and to transform the traditional consumer experience for both employers and members to result in a high degree of consumer satisfaction, loyalty and brand awareness. We are in the process of reducing our administrative cost structure primarily to support our Commercial strategy. Our Products The following table presents our segment membership, premiums and ASO fees by product for the year ended December 31, 2002: Medical Membership Specialty Membership Premiums ASO Fees Total Premiums and ASO Fees Percent of Total Premiums and ASO Fees Commercial: Fully insured: HMO 1,147,100 $ 2,610,926 $ $ 2,610,926 23.4 % PPO 1,193,200 2,888,107 2,888,107 25.8 % Total fully insured 2,340,300 5,499,033 5,499,033 49.2 % Administrative services only 652,200 103,203 103,203 0.9 % Specialty 1,640,000 337,295 337,295 3.1 % Total Commercial 2,992,500 1,640,000 5,836,328 103,203 5,939,531 53.2 % Government: Medicare+Choice 344,100 2,629,597 2,629,597 23.5 % Medicaid 506,000 462,998 462,998 4.1 % TRICARE 1,755,800 2,001,474 2,001,474 17.9 % TRICARE ASO 1,048,700 141,193 141,193 1.3 % Total Government 3,654,600 5,094,069 141,193 5,235,262 46.8 % Total 6,647,100 1,640,000 $ 10,930,397 $ 244,396 $ 11,174,793 100.0 % Our Products Marketed to Commercial Segment Members New Generation of Products We have developed a range of innovative products that we believe will be a solution for employers who are consistently facing double digit premium increases as medical costs also continue to rise at that same level. Our new generation of products encompass more choices for the individual consumer, transparency of provider costs, guidance when consumers need it most, and benefit designs that engage consumers in the financial implications of the choices they make with respect to their health care. Innovative tools and technology are available to assist consumers with these decisions, including trade offs between higher premiums and point of service costs at the time consumers choose their plans, and ways in which the consumers can maximize their individual benefits at the point they use their plans. These products are sold to employers with Humana as the sole carrier, but are available as either a fully insured or self funded option to employers. 4 Table of Contents HMO Our health maintenance organization, or HMO, products provide prepaid health insurance coverage to our members through a network of independent primary care physicians, specialty physicians and other health care providers who contract with the HMO to furnish such services. Primary care physicians generally include internists, family practitioners and pediatricians. Generally, the members primary care physician must approve access to certain specialty physicians and other health care providers. These other health care providers include, among others, hospitals, nursing homes, home health agencies, pharmacies, mental health and substance abuse centers, diagnostic centers, optometrists, outpatient surgery centers, dentists, urgent care centers and durable medical equipment suppliers. Because the primary care physician must generally approve access to many of these other health care providers, the HMO product is the most restrictive form of managed care. An HMO member, typically through the members employer, pays a monthly fee, which generally covers, with some copayments, health care services received from or approved by the members primary care physician. For the year ended December 31, 2002, commercial HMO premium revenues totaled approximately $2.6 billion, or 23.4% of our total premiums and ASO fees. PPO Our preferred provider organization, or PPO, products include some elements of managed health care; however, they typically include more cost sharing with the member, through copayments and annual deductibles. PPOs are also similar to traditional health insurance because they provide a member with more freedom to choose a physician or other health care provider. In a PPO, the member is encouraged, through financial incentives, to use participating health care providers, which have contracted with the PPO to provide services at favorable rates. In the event a member chooses not to use a participating health care provider, the member may be required to pay a greater portion of the providers fees. For the year ended December 31, 2002, commercial PPO premium revenues totaled approximately $2.9 billion, or 25.8% of our total premiums and ASO fees. Individual Products In June 2002, we introduced HumanaOne, our first product marketed directly to individuals. We have introduced this product in select markets where we can utilize our existing networks and distribution channels. Administrative Services Only We offer an administrative services only, or ASO, product to those who self insure their employee health plans. We receive fees to provide administrative services which generally include the processing of claims, offering access to our provider networks and clinical programs, and responding to customer services inquiries from members of self funded employers. These products may include all of the same benefit and product design characteristics of our fully insured PPO and HMO products described above, however, under ASO contracts, self funded employers retain the risk of financing the cost of health benefits. For the year ended December 31, 2002, commercial administrative services fees totaled $103.2 million, or 0.9% of our total premiums and ASO fees. Specialty Products We also offer various specialty products including dental, group life and short term disability. At December 31, 2002, we had approximately 1.6 million specialty members. For the year ended December 31, 2002, specialty product premium revenues were approximately $337.3 million, or 3.1% of our total premiums and ASO fees. 5 Table of Contents Our Products Marketed to Government Segment Members Medicare+Choice Product Medicare is a federal program that provides persons age 65 and over and some disabled persons certain hospital and medical insurance benefits, which include hospitalization benefits for up to 90 days per incident of illness plus a lifetime reserve aggregating 60 days. Each Medicare eligible individual is entitled to receive inpatient hospital care, known as Part A care, without the payment of any premium, but is required to pay a premium to the federal government, which is adjusted annually, to be eligible for physician care and other services, known as Part B care. We contract with CMS under the Medicare+Choice program to provide health insurance coverage in exchange for a fixed monthly payment per member for Medicare eligible individuals residing in the geographic areas in which our HMOs operate. Individuals who elect to participate in Medicare+Choice programs receive additional benefits not covered by Medicare and are relieved of the obligation to pay some or all of the deductible or coinsurance amounts but are generally required to use exclusively the services provided by the HMO (subject to nominal copayments and coinsurance) and are required to pay a Part B premium to the Medicare program. The Medicare+Choice product involves a contract between an HMO and CMS, pursuant to which CMS makes a fixed monthly payment to the HMO on behalf of each Medicare eligible individual that chooses to enroll for coverage in the HMO. The fixed monthly payment, payable on the first day of a month, is determined by formula established by federal law. We sometimes receive the fixed monthly payment early due to a weekend or holiday falling on the first day of a month. This receipt is significant, the timing of which can cause material fluctuation in operating cash flows. We also collect additional member premiums from our members in certain of our markets. At December 31, 2002, we provided health insurance coverage under CMS contracts to approximately 344,100 Medicare+Choice members for which we received premium revenues of approximately $2.6 billion, or 23.5% of our total premiums and ASO fees for 2002. One such CMS contract covered approximately 228,400 members in Florida and accounted for premium revenues of approximately $1.7 billion, which represented 66.0% of our Medicare+Choice premium revenues, or 15.5% of our total premiums and ASO fees for 2002. Our Medicare+Choice contracts with the federal government are renewed for a one year term each December 31 unless terminated 90 days prior thereto. Our 2003 average rate of statutory increase under the Medicare+Choice contracts is approximately 3.2%. Over the last five years, annual increases have ranged from as low as the January 2001 increase of 1.9% to as high as 5.0% in January 2002, with an average of approximately 2.8%. On January 1, 2002, we ceased providing our Medicare+Choice product in 5 counties in Kentucky and 1 county in Illinois, affecting approximately 22,000 members. On January 1, 2003, we exited certain counties in several of our markets, affecting about 10,000 members. These exits were the result, in part, of lower CMS reimbursement rates. We are working with CMS to develop other alternative offerings. For example, we are participating in a Medicare+Choice pilot program offering a private fee for service product in DuPage County, Illinois and a PPO product in Pinellas County, Florida. TRICARE TRICARE provides health insurance coverage to the dependents of active duty military personnel and to retired military personnel and their dependents. In November 1995, the United States Department of Defense awarded us our first TRICARE contract for Regions 3 and 4 covering approximately 1.1 million eligible beneficiaries in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee and Eastern Louisiana. On July 1, 1996, we began providing health insurance coverage to these approximately 1.1 million eligible beneficiaries. 6 Table of Contents On May 31, 2001, we acquired for $43.5 million the outstanding shares of common stock of a newly formed Anthem Alliance Health Insurance Company subsidiary responsible for administering TRICARE benefits for Regions 2 and 5 to approximately 1.2 million eligible members in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, a portion of Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia, Wisconsin and West Virginia. We currently are in negotiations with the Department of Defense to extend our TRICARE contracts that expire on April 30, 2003 for Regions 2 and 5 and June 30, 2003 for Regions 3 and 4. We believe we will be able to successfully extend our TRICARE contracts under substantially the same terms for one additional year plus a one year renewal option which should continue our contracts through the new TRICARE Next Generation, or T Nex, transition described below. Historical pretax profit margins for our TRICARE business have generally ranged from 2 to 4 percent. We expect margins to continue in this range during 2003. The Department of Defense recently announced a plan to consolidate the total number of prime contracts from seven to three under the new T Nex program. The Department of Defense has stated that a bidder can be awarded only one prime contract, although a bidder would be allowed to secondarily participate in another contract. We submitted a bid in January 2003 to participate as a prime contractor for the South region. Additionally, we partnered with Aetna Government Health Plans, LLC, a subsidiary of Aetna, Inc. to participate as a subcontractor should Aetna Government Health Plans, LLC be awarded the North region. An announcement of the awards is expected in mid to late 2003 with transition to the new regions not expected until mid to late 2004. At this time we are unable to predict whether we will be awarded a contract, or the effective date of the contract. If we are a successful bidder on the South region, we do not expect a material change to our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, although TRICARE profits could decline slightly. TRICARE membership would not materially change from current levels. TRICARE revenues and expenses would decline by approximately 20% as a result of certain benefits, e.g. pharmacy, which are included under our current contract, being excluded and under separate T Nex contracts in the future. Currently, three health benefit options are available to TRICARE beneficiaries. In addition to a traditional indemnity option, participants may enroll in an HMO like plan with a point of service option or take advantage of reduced copayments by using a network of preferred providers. We have subcontracted with third parties to provide various administration and specialty services under the contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2002, TRICARE premium revenues were approximately $2.0 billion, or 17.9% of our total premiums and ASO fees. At December 31, 2002, we had 1,048,700 TRICARE ASO members for which the Department of Defense retains the risk of financing the cost of their health benefits. We obtained these members from our acquisition of Regions 2 and 5, and from two government programs that allow senior members to continue in the TRICARE program even after becoming Medicare eligible, which is normally age 65. The first of these programs, called TRICARE Senior Pharmacy, became effective April 1, 2001. Under this government administrative services program, senior TRICARE members receive certain pharmacy benefits not covered under Medicare. On October 1, 2001, the TRICARE For Life program became effective, and expanded coverage to include medical benefits as well. We are engaged by the Department of Defense to provide these administrative services through change orders to our existing TRICARE contracts. Once T Nex becomes effective, our participation in these ASO programs will allow us to competitively bid for certain of the services under separate contracts. Although we will not bid on the TRICARE for Life contract under T Nex, we may bid on other services under separate T Nex contracts. Anticipated changes to these benefits contracted separately contribute to the expected 20% decline in total TRICARE revenue discussed above. For the year ended December 31, 2002, TRICARE administrative services fees totaled $141.2 million, or 1.3% of our total premiums and ASO fees. Medicaid Product Medicaid is a federal program that is state operated to facilitate the delivery of health care services to low income residents. Each state that chooses to do so develops, through a state specific regulatory agency, a 7 Table of Contents Medicaid managed care initiative that must be approved by CMS. CMS requires that Medicaid managed care plans meet federal standards and cost no more than the amount that would have been spent on a comparable fee for service basis. States currently either use a formal proposal process in which they review many bidders before selecting one or award individual contracts to qualified bidders which apply for entry to the program. In either case, the contractual relationship with a state is generally for a one year period. Under these contracts, we receive a fixed monthly payment from a government agency for which we are required to provide health insurance coverage to enrolled members. Due to the increased emphasis on state health care reform and budgetary constraints, more states are utilizing a managed care product in their Medicaid programs. Effective July 1, 2002, we signed two contracts in Puerto Rico covering beneficiaries in two of the eight regions in Puerto Ricos Medicaid program. The term of each of these contracts is three years, subject to annual renewal options with the Health Insurance Administration in Puerto Rico. Our Medicaid contracts in Florida and Illinois generally are annual contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2002, premium revenues from our Medicaid products totaled $463.0 million, or 4.1% of our total premiums and ASO fees. At December 31, 2002, we had approximately 434,800 Medicaid members in Puerto Rico, or 86% of total Medicaid members, and 71,200 Medicaid members in Florida and Illinois, or 14% of total Medicaid members. The following table summarizes our medical membership at December 31, 2002, by market and product: Commercial Government Percent Of Total HMO PPO ASO Medicare + Choice Medicaid TRICARE Total (in thousands) Florida 170.6 60.4 12.5 228.8 54.2 414.1 940.7 14.2 % Illinois 303.7 243.2 87.1 58.8 17.0 76.3 786.0 11.8 Texas 214.8 262.8 29.5 24.3 531.3 8.0 Puerto Rico 17.6 46.9 5.1 434.8 504.3 7.6 Ohio 177.8 55.7 118.5 85.7 437.6 6.6 Kentucky 77.3 188.4 77.6 65.5 408.9 6.2 Wisconsin 86.1 40.5 190.7 29.6 347.1 5.2 Georgia 18.4 37.1 2.4 270.8 328.7 4.9 Virginia 1.6 0.3 171.3 173.2 2.6 North Carolina 18.9 3.0 139.6 161.4 2.4 Arizona 35.5 50.4 52.0 16.5 154.4 2.3 South Carolina 5.5 0.7 128.8 134.9 2.0 Tennessee 36.2 15.8 75.1 127.1 1.9 Indiana 6.0 30.1 31.1 37.2 104.4 1.6 Alabama 0.1 100.5 100.6 1.5 Michigan 33.8 2.9 54.7 91.4 1.4 Missouri/Kansas 39.3 16.5 6.2 15.7 4.6 82.3 1.2 Mississippi 4.2 0.3 73.0 77.5 1.2 Colorado 39.1 0.1 39.2 0.6 TRICARE ASO 1,048.7 1,048.7 15.8 Others 21.8 16.4 29.0 67.4 1.0 Totals 1,147.1 1,193.2 652.2 344.1 506.0 2,804.5 6,647.1 100.0 % Provider Arrangements We provide our members with access to health care services through our networks of health care providers with whom we have contracted, including hospitals and other independent facilities such as outpatient surgery centers, primary care physicians, specialist physicians, dentists and providers of ancillary health care services and facilities. We have approximately 425,000 contracts with health care providers participating in our networks, 8 Table of Contents which consist of approximately 298,700 physicians, 3,100 hospitals, and 122,000 ancillary providers and dentists. These ancillary services and facilities include ambulance services, medical equipment services, home health agencies, mental health providers, rehabilitation facilities, nursing homes, optical services and pharmacies. Our membership base and the ability to influence where our members seek care generally enable us to obtain contractual discounts with providers. We use a variety of techniques to provide access to effective and efficient use of health care services for our members. These techniques include the coordination of care for our members, product and benefit designs, hospital inpatient management systems, or HIMS, and enrolling members into various disease management programs. The focal point for health care services in many of our Medicare+Choice and HMO networks is the primary care physician who, under contract, provides services, and may control utilization of appropriate services, by directing or approving hospitalization and referrals to specialists and other providers. Some physicians may have arrangements under which they can earn bonuses when certain target goals relating to the provisions of patient care are met. Our HIMS programs use specially trained physicians to effectively manage the entire range of an HMO members medical care during a hospital admission and to effectively coordinate the members discharge and post discharge care. We have available a variety of disease management programs related to specific medical conditions such as congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, prenatal and premature infant care, asthma related illness, end stage renal disease, diabetes and breast cancer screening. We also may focus on certain rare conditions where disease management techniques benefit members in a more cost effective manner. We typically contract with hospitals on either a per diem rate, which is an all inclusive rate per day, a case rate, which is an all inclusive rate per admission, or at a discounted charge for inpatient hospital services. Outpatient hospital services are generally contracted at a flat rate by type of service or at a discounted charge. These contracts are often multi year agreements with rates that are adjusted for inflation annually based on the consumer price index or other nationally recognized inflation index. Outpatient surgery centers and other ancillary providers are typically contracted at flat rates per service provided or are reimbursed based upon a nationally recognized fee schedule such as the Medicare allowable fee schedule. Our contracts with physicians typically are automatically renewed each year, unless either party gives written notice to the other party of their intent to terminate the arrangement. Most of the physicians in our PPO networks and some of our physicians in our HMO networks are reimbursed based upon a fixed fee schedule, which typically provides for reimbursement based upon a percentage of the standard Medicare allowable fee schedule. Capitation For 8.8% of our December 31, 2002 medical membership, we contract with hospitals and physicians to accept financial risk for a defined set of HMO membership. In transferring this risk, we prepay these providers a monthly fixed fee per member, known as a capitation payment, to coordinate substantially all of the medical care for their capitated HMO membership, including some health benefit administrative functions and claims processing. For these capitated HMO arrangements, we generally agree to reimbursement rates that target a medical expense ratio ranging from 82% to 89%. Providers participating in hospital based capitated HMO arrangements generally receive a monthly payment for all of the services within their system for their HMO membership. Providers participating in physician based capitated HMO arrangements generally have subcontracted directly with hospitals and specialist physicians, and are responsible for reimbursing such hospitals and physicians for services rendered to their HMO membership. For 5.9% of our December 31, 2002 medical membership, we contract with physicians under risk sharing arrangements whereby physicians have assumed some level of risk for all or a portion of the medical costs of their HMO membership. Although these arrangements do include capitation payments for services rendered, we process substantially all of the claims under these arrangements. 9 Table of Contents Physicians under these types of arrangements typically have stop loss coverage so that a physicians financial risk for any single member is limited to a maximum amount on an annual basis. We remain financially responsible for health care services to our members in the event our providers fail to provide such services.

We also offer quality and outcome measurement and improvement programs such as the Health Plan Employer Data Information Sets, or HEDIS, which is used by employers, government purchasers and the National Committee for Quality Assurance, or NCQA, to evaluate HMOs based on various criteria, including effectiveness of care and member satisfaction. Physicians participating in our HMO networks must satisfy specific criteria, including licensing, patient access, office standards, after hours coverage and other factors. Most participating hospitals also meet accreditation criteria established by CMS and or the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, or JCAHO. Recredentialing of participating providers occurs every two to three years, depending on applicable state laws. Recredentialing of participating physicians includes verification of their medical license; review of their malpractice liability claims history; review of their board certification, if applicable; and review of any complaints, including any member appeals and grievances. Committees, composed of a peer group of physicians, review the applications of physicians being considered for credentialing and recredentialing. We request accreditation for certain of our HMO plans from NCQA and the American Accreditation Healthcare Commission/Utilization Review Accreditation Commission, or AAHC/URAC. Accreditation or external review by an approved organization is mandatory in the states of Florida and Kansas for licensure as an HMO. Accreditation specific to the utilization review process is also required in the state of Georgia for licensure as an HMO or PPO. Certain commercial businesses, like those impacted by United Auto Workers contracts and those where the request comes from the employer, require or prefer accredited health plans. NCQA performs reviews of standards for quality improvement, credentialing, utilization management, preventative health, and member rights and responsibilities. We continue to maintain accreditation in select markets through NCQA. Three markets maintain NCQA accredited status for all HMO product lines: Humana Health Plan of Ohio, Inc. in Cincinnati, Ohio (excellent); Humana Medical Plan, Inc. in north Florida (commendable), and central Florida (commendable). AAHC/URAC performs reviews of standards for utilization management, and for health plan standards in quality management, credentialing, rights and responsibilities, and network management. Seven markets have achieved URAC health plan accreditation for all HMO product lines: Humana Medical Plan, Inc. in north Florida, south Florida, central Florida (Daytona, Tampa and Orlando), Humana Health Plan of Ohio, Inc. in Cincinnati, Ohio, and Humana Health Plan, Inc. in Kentucky and in Kansas. The Atlanta market has URAC utilization management accreditation for HMO and PPO product lines. AAHC/URAC utilization management accreditation was received for Humana Military Healthcare Services, Inc., which administers the TRICARE program and for the Green Bay service center. Some of our HMO entities are unaccredited, because we sought accreditation only where regulatory requirements were in place, such as in Florida, which requires accreditation for HMO licensing, or in market areas where commercial groups use it as a variable in choosing carriers. As the requirements of accreditation have become less focused on factors under our control and more focused on other factors such as provider behavior, we have concluded that these programs do not add value for our customers. We are piloting ISO 9000 certification as an alternative to accreditation. ISO is the international standards organization, which has developed an international commercial set of certifications as to quality and process, called ISO 9000. At this time, two clinical programs within the Innovation Center of Humana have received ISO registration: transplant management and centralized clinical operations providing personal nurse services. 11 Table of Contents Sales and Marketing Individuals become members of our commercial HMOs and PPOs through their employers or other groups which typically offer employees or members a selection of health insurance products, pay for all or part of the premiums and make payroll deductions for any premiums payable by the employees. We attempt to become an employers or groups exclusive source of health insurance benefits by offering a variety of HMO, PPO and specialty products that provide cost effective quality health care coverage consistent with the needs and expectations of the employees or members. We use various methods to market our commercial, Medicare+Choice and Medicaid products, including television, radio, the Internet, telemarketing and mailings. At December 31, 2002, we used approximately 39,000 licensed independent brokers and agents and approximately 520 licensed employees to sell our commercial products. Many of our employer group customers are represented by insurance brokers and consultants who assist these groups in the design and purchase of health care products. We generally pay brokers a commission based on premiums, with commissions varying by market and premium volume. At December 31, 2002, we employed approximately 610 sales representatives, who are each paid a salary and or per member commission, to market our Medicare+Choice and Medicaid products in the continental U.S. We also employed approximately 330 telemarketing representatives who assisted in the marketing of Medicare+Choice and Medicaid products by making appointments for sales representatives with prospective members. Risk Management Through the use of internally developed underwriting criteria, we determine the risk we are willing to assume and the amount of premium to charge for our commercial products. In most instances, employer and other groups must meet our underwriting standards in order to qualify to contract with us for coverage. Small group reform laws in some states have imposed regulations which provide for guaranteed issue of certain health insurance products and prescribe certain limitations on the variation in rates charged based upon assessment of health conditions. Underwriting techniques are not employed in connection with Medicare+Choice products because CMS regulations require us to accept all eligible Medicare applicants regardless of their health or prior medical history. We also are not permitted to employ underwriting criteria for the Medicaid product, but rather we follow CMS and state requirements. In addition, with respect to our TRICARE business, we do not employ any underwriting techniques because we must accept all eligible beneficiaries who choose to participate. Competition The health benefits industry is highly competitive and contracts for the sale of commercial products are generally bid or renewed annually. Our competitors vary by local market and include other publicly traded managed care companies, national insurance companies and other HMOs and PPOs, including HMOs and PPOs owned by Blue Cross/Blue Shield plans. Many of our competitors have larger memberships and or greater financial resources than our health plans in the markets in which we compete. Our ability to sell our products and to retain customers is, or may be, influenced by such factors as benefits, pricing, contract terms, number and quality of participating physicians and other managed health care providers, utilization review, claims processing, administrative efficiency, relationships with agents, quality of customer service and accreditation results. Government Regulation Government regulation of health care products and services is a changing area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to issue regulations and interpret 12 Table of Contents and enforce laws and rules. Changes in applicable laws and regulations are continually being considered, and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically. These regulatory revisions could affect our operations and financial results. Also, it may become increasingly difficult to control medical costs if federal and state bodies continue to consider and enact significant and sometimes onerous managed care laws and regulations. Enforcement of health care fraud and abuse laws has become a top priority for the nations law enforcement entities. The funding of such law enforcement efforts has increased dramatically in the past few years and is expected to continue. The focus of these efforts has been directed at participants in federal government health care programs such as Medicare+Choice, Medicaid and the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, or FEHBP. We participate extensively in these programs and have continued our stringent regulatory compliance efforts for these programs. The programs are subject to very technical rules. When combined with law enforcement intolerance for any level of noncompliance, these rules mean that compliance efforts in this area continue to be challenging. We are subject to various governmental audits, investigations and enforcement actions. These include possible government actions relating to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, as amended, or ERISA, FEHBP, federal and state fraud and abuse laws, and other laws relating to Medicare+Choice, including adjusted community rating development, special payment status, and various other areas. Adjusted community rating development is the government defined rating formula used to justify the Medicare+Choice benefits we offer individuals eligible for Medicare benefits based on a particular community and certain other factors. Special payment status refers to, among others, Medicare+Choice members who are institutionalized, Medicaid eligible, or members who have contracted end stage renal disease. The Medicare+Choice plan receives a higher payment for members who qualify for one or more of these statuses. We are currently involved in various government investigations, audits and reviews, some of which are under ERISA, and the authority of state departments of insurance. On May 31, 2000, we entered into a five year Corporate Integrity Agreement with the Office of the Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services as part of a settlement of a Medicare overpayment issue arising from an audit by the Office of the Inspector General. Although any of the pending government actions could result in assessment of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions against us, including exclusion from participation in government programs, we do not believe the results of any of these actions, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Of our seven licensed and active HMO subsidiaries as of March 1, 2003, five are qualified under the Federal Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973, as amended. To obtain federal qualification, an HMO must meet certain requirements, including conformance with benefit, rating and financial reporting standards. In certain markets, and for certain products, we operate HMOs that are not federally qualified because this provides greater flexibility with respect to product design and pricing than is possible for federally qualified HMOs. As of March 1, 2003, Humana Medical Plan, Inc., Humana Health Plan of Texas, Inc., and Humana Health Plan, Inc. each hold CMS contracts under the Medicare+Choice program to sell Medicare HMO products in a total of six states. In addition, Humana Insurance Company holds a CMS contract under a Medicare+Choice pilot program to sell a private fee for service product in DuPage County, Illinois and a PPO product in Pinellas County, Florida. CMS conducts audits of HMOs qualified under its Medicare+Choice program at least biannually and may perform other reviews more frequently to determine compliance with federal regulations and contractual obligations. These audits include review of the HMOs administration and management, including management information and data collection systems, fiscal stability, utilization management and physician incentive arrangements, health services delivery, quality assurance, marketing, enrollment and disenrollment activity, claims processing, and complaint systems. 13 Table of Contents CMS regulations require submission of quarterly and annual financial statements. In addition, CMS requires certain disclosures to CMS and to Medicare+Choice beneficiaries concerning operations of a health plan contracted under the Medicare+Choice program. CMSs rules require disclosure to members upon request of information concerning financial arrangements and incentive plans between an HMO and physicians in the HMOs networks. These rules also require certain levels of stop loss coverage to protect contracted physicians against major losses relating to patient care, depending on the amount of financial risk they assume. The reporting of certain health care data contained in HEDIS is another important CMS disclosure requirement. Our Medicaid products are regulated by the applicable state agency in the state in which we sell a Medicaid product and by the Health Insurance Administration in Puerto Rico, in conformance with federal approval of the applicable state plan, and are subject to periodic reviews by these agencies. The reviews are similar in nature to those performed by CMS. Laws in each of the states and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico in which we operate our HMOs, PPOs and other health insurance related services regulate our operations, including the scope of benefits, rate formulas, delivery systems, utilization review procedures, quality assurance, complaint systems, enrollment requirements, claim payments, marketing and advertising. The HMO, PPO and other health insurance related products we offer are sold under licenses issued by the applicable insurance regulators. Under state laws, our HMOs and health insurance companies are audited by state departments of insurance for financial and contractual compliance, and our HMOs are audited for compliance with health services standards by respective state departments of health. Most states laws require such audits to be performed at least once every three years. Our licensed subsidiaries are subject to regulation under state insurance holding company and Commonwealth of Puerto Rico regulations. These regulations generally require, among other things, prior approval and or notice of new products, rates, benefit changes, and certain material transactions, including dividend payments, purchases or sales of assets, intercompany agreements and the filing of various financial and operational reports. Certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends, loans or other cash transfers to Humana Inc., our parent company, require minimum levels of equity, and limit investments to approved securities. The amount of dividends that may be paid to Humana Inc. by these subsidiaries, without prior approval by state regulatory authorities, is limited based on the entitys level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus. In most states, prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required. As of December 31, 2002, we maintained aggregate statutory capital and surplus of $1,006.9 million in our state regulated health insurance subsidiaries. Each of these subsidiaries was in compliance with applicable statutory requirements which aggregated $576.0 million. Although the minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume, product mix, and the quality of assets held, minimum requirements can vary significantly at the state level. Certain states rely on risk based capital requirements, or RBC, to define the required levels of equity. RBC is a model developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to monitor an entitys solvency. This calculation indicates recommended minimum levels of required capital and surplus and signals regulatory measures should actual surplus fall below these recommended levels. Some states are in the process of phasing in these RBC requirements over a number of years. If RBC were fully implemented by all states at December 31, 2002, each of our subsidiaries would be in compliance, and we would have $358.8 million of aggregate capital and surplus above the minimum level required under RBC. One TRICARE subsidiary under the Regions 3 and 4 contract with the Department of Defense is required to maintain current assets at least equivalent to its current liabilities. We were in compliance with this requirement at December 31, 2002. Our management works proactively to ensure compliance with all governmental laws and regulations affecting our business. 14 Table of Contents Health Care Reform There continue to be diverse legislative and regulatory initiatives at both the federal and state levels to address aspects of the nations health care system. Federal In 2000, Congress passed the Medicare, Medicaid and State Childrens Health Benefits Improvement and Protection Act, or BIPA, amending certain provisions of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, and certain provisions of the Medicare, Medicaid and State Childrens Health Insurance Program Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999. The Balanced Budget Act changed the way health plans are compensated for Medicare members by eliminating over five years amounts paid for graduate medical education, increasing the blend of national cost factors applied in determining local reimbursement rates over a six year phase in period and directing CMS to implement a risk adjusted mechanism on its monthly member payment to Medicare plans over the same period. These changes have had the effect of reducing reimbursement in high cost metropolitan areas with a large number of teaching hospitals. Congress has subsequently lengthened this timetable to allow the risk adjusted mechanism to be fully implemented by 2007. BIPA, among other things, enacted modest increases to the payment formula for Medicare+Choice plans. While we believe that these increases and modifications restore some Medicare+Choice reimbursement, pending legislative and regulatory initiatives could cause us to again consider increasing enrollee out of pocket costs, modifying benefits or exiting markets. On January 1, 2002, we exited our Medicare product in 5 counties in Kentucky and 1 county in Illinois affecting approximately 22,000 members. On January 1, 2003, we exited certain counties in several of our markets, affecting about 10,000 members. These county exits were the result, in part, of lower CMS reimbursement rates. We are working with CMS to develop other alternative offerings. For example, we are participating in a Medicare+Choice pilot program offering a private fee for service product in DuPage County, Illinois and a PPO product in Pinellas County, Florida. On November 21, 2000, the Department of Labor published its final regulation on claims and appeals review procedures under ERISA. The claims procedure regulation applies to all employee benefit plans governed by ERISA, whether benefits are provided through insurance products or are self funded. As a result, the new claims and appeals review regulation impacts nearly all employer and union sponsored health and disability plans, except church and government plans. Similar to legislation recently passed by many states, the new ERISA claims and appeals procedures impose shorter and more detailed procedures for processing and reviewing claims and appeals. According to the Department of Labor, however, its ERISA claims and appeals regulation does not preempt state insurance and utilization review laws that impose different procedures or time lines, unless complying with the state law would make compliance with the new ERISA regulation impossible. Unlike its state counterparts, the ERISA claims and appeals rule does not provide for independent external review to decide disputed medical questions. Instead, the federal regulation will generally make it easier for claimants to avoid state mandated internal and external review processes and to file suit in federal court. The new ERISA claims and appeals rules generally became effective July 1, 2002 or the first day of the first plan year beginning after July 1, 2002, whichever is later. In any case, health plans must comply with the new rules with respect to all claims filed on or after January 1, 2003. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, includes administrative provisions directed at simplifying electronic data interchange through standardizing transactions, establishing uniform health care provider, payer and employer identifiers and seeking protections for confidentiality and security of patient data. Under the new HIPAA standard transactions and code sets rules, we must make significant systems enhancements and invest in new technological solutions. The compliance date for standard transactions and code sets rules has been extended to October 17, 2003 based on our submission of a compliance plan, including work plan and implementation strategy to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Under the new HIPAA privacy rules, by April 14, 2003 we must comply with a variety of requirements concerning the use and disclosure of individuals protected health information, establish rigorous internal procedures to protect health information and enter into business associate contracts with those companies to whom protected health 15 Table of Contents information is disclosed. Regulations issued in February 2003 set standards for the security of electronic health information requiring compliance by April 21, 2005. Violations of these rules will subject us to significant penalties. Compliance with HIPAA regulations requires significant systems enhancements, training and administrative effort. The final rules do not provide for complete federal preemption of state laws, but rather preempt all inconsistent state laws unless the state law is more stringent. HIPAA could also expose us to additional liability for violations by our business associates. Further in 1999, Congress passed the Financial Services Modernization Act, or Gramm Leach Bliley Act, that includes provisions related to privacy standards for personal information to be implemented by both the federal government and the states. This law became effective in July 2001. Many states are currently enacting laws or regulations to implement the federal law. We are complying with such provisions. There are several other legislative proposals under consideration that include, among other things, a Patient Bill of Rights, expansion of a patients right to sue and mandatory external review of health plan coverage decisions. Under some versions of this bill, our exposure to large jury verdicts could be increased. In addition, Congress is evaluating proposals to include establishing additional protections for personal health information, tax credits for the uninsured, proposals to reduce the number of medical errors by health care providers and systems of care, and various state and federal purchasing plans to allow individuals and small employers to purchase health insurance. Also, Congress is evaluating proposals to expand Medicare benefits to cover prescription drugs for Medicare eligible seniors including a pharmacy discount card. Many of these proposals may require additional administrative costs to ensure compliance and we are currently assessing their cost and impact on premiums for the future. State We continue to encounter regulation on health care claims payment practices at the state level. This legislation and possible future regulation and oversight could expose us to additional liability and penalties. Supplemental legislation includes among other provisions claims submission content and electronic submission. We view electronic submission as a favorable development that will simplify claims interactions. A few states are considering proposals that place new limits on insurer contacts with hospitals and physicians. These proposals include provisions to expand payment disclosure, limit implementation of claims payment procedures, and extend an insurer payment liability where intermediaries fail to pay and restrict recoupment. Some states are proposing the creation of small employer pooled purchasing arrangements. Although these pooled purchasing arrangements may affect the small group market, most of the proposals require these purchasing arrangements to comply with the standard small group market regulations. Similar arrangements enacted in the early 1990s had a very limited affect on the small group insurance market. A limited number of states are considering additional restrictions on the use of health status in small group rating. Mandate free benefit plans are pending in a number of states. Some of these proposals could allow insurers more flexibility in the use of member cost sharing. There is activity in some states supporting an expansion of disclosure by hospitals, physicians and other health care providers of quality and charge data either directly to patients or to state agencies that must make it publicly available. Medical malpractice reform is receiving significant attention. Pending medical malpractice reform proposals differ substantially relative to the entities covered by the reforms. Since the substance of the reforms remains under discussion and the scope of covered entities has not been resolved in most states, management is unable to predict future activity under these laws. We are unable to predict how existing federal or state laws and regulations may be changed or interpreted, what additional laws or regulations affecting our businesses may be enacted or proposed, when and which of the proposed laws will be adopted or what effect any such new laws and regulations will have on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 16 Table of Contents Other Captive Insurance Company We bear general business risks associated with operating our company such as professional and general liability, employee workers compensation, and officer and director errors and omissions risks. Professional and general liability risks may include, for example, medical malpractice claims and disputes with members regarding benefit coverage. We retain these risks through our wholly owned, consolidated insurance subsidiary. We reduce exposure to our own general business risks by insuring levels of coverage for losses in excess of our retained limits with a number of third party insurance companies. We remain liable in the event these insurance companies are unable to pay their portion of the losses. In an effort to minimize credit risk, we insure our risks with a number of insurance companies having a long history of strong financial ratings. Beginning January 1, 2002, we reduced the amount of coverage purchased from third party insurance carriers and increased the amount of risk we retain due to substantially higher insurance rates. We provide a detail of the significant assets and liabilities related to our captive insurance subsidiary in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. Centralized Management Services We provide centralized management services to each health plan from our headquarters and service centers. These services include management information systems, product administration, financing, personnel, development, accounting, legal advice, public relations, marketing, insurance, purchasing, risk management, actuarial, underwriting and claims processing. Employees As of December 31, 2002, we had approximately 13,500 employees, including approximately 30 employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced any work stoppages and believe we have good relations with our employees. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES We own our principal executive office, which is located in the Humana Building, 500 West Main Street, Louisville, Kentucky 40202. In addition, we own buildings in Louisville, Kentucky, San Antonio, Texas, Green Bay, Wisconsin and Jacksonville, Florida, and lease facilities in Cincinnati, Ohio and Madison, Wisconsin, all of which are used for customer service and claims processing. We are in the process of consolidating the San Antonio, Texas, Jacksonville, Florida, and Madison, Wisconsin customer service center operations into the remaining four locations. Our Louisville and Green Bay facilities also perform enrollment processing and other corporate functions. We also own or lease medical centers ranging in size from approximately 1,500 to 80,000 square feet. We no longer operate most of these medical centers but, rather, lease them to their provider operators. Our administrative market offices are generally leased, with square footage ranging from approximately 700 to 89,000.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Securities Litigation In late 1997, three purported class action complaints were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida by former stockholders of Physician Corporation of America, or PCA, and certain of its former directors and officers. We acquired PCA by a merger that became effective on September 8, 1997. The three actions were consolidated into a single action entitled In re Physician Corporation of America Securities Litigation. The consolidated complaint alleges that PCA and the individual defendants knowingly or recklessly made false and misleading statements in press releases and public filings with respect to the financial and regulatory difficulties of PCAs workers compensation business. On May 5, 1999, plaintiffs moved for certification of the purported class, and on August 25, 2000, the defendants moved for summary judgment. On January 31, 2001, defendants were granted leave to file a third party complaint for declaratory judgment on insurance coverage. The defendants seek a determination that the defense costs and liability, if any, resulting from the class action defense are covered by an insurance policy issued by one insurer and, in the alternative, declaring that there is coverage under policies issued by two other insurers. On April 25, 2002, the Court dismissed the third party complaint without prejudice finding that it could be refiled in the future if the insurance claims are not otherwise resolved. On July 24, 2002, the Court denied the defendants motion for summary judgment and set the case on the Courts trial calendar for December 2, 2002. The Court subsequently postponed the trial. The Court is expected to set a date which is 90 days after it rules on the plaintiffs motion for class certification. Managed Care Industry Purported Class Action Litigation We are involved in several purported class action lawsuits that are part of a wave of generally similar actions that target the health care payer industry and particularly target managed care companies. As a result of action by the Judicial Panel on Multi District Litigation, most of the cases against us, as well as similar cases against other companies in the industry, have been consolidated in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, and are styled In re Managed Care Litigation. The cases include separate suits against us and five other managed care companies that purport to have been brought on behalf of members, which are referred to as the subscriber track cases, and a single action against us and eight other companies that purports to have been brought on behalf of providers, which is referred to as the provider track case. In the subscriber track cases, the plaintiffs seek a recovery under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, for all persons who are or were subscribers at any time during the four year period prior to the filing of the complaints. Plaintiffs also seek to represent a subclass of policyholders who purchased insurance through their employers health benefit plans governed by ERISA, and who are or were subscribers at any time during the six year period prior to the filing of the complaints. The complaints allege, among other things, that we intentionally concealed from members certain information concerning the way in which we conduct business, including the methods by which we pay providers. The plaintiffs do not allege that any of the purported practices resulted in denial of any claim for a particular benefit, but instead, claim that we provided the purported class with health insurance benefits of lesser value than promised. The complaints also allege an industry wide conspiracy to engage in the various alleged improper practices. On February 20, 2002, the Court issued its ruling on the defendants motions to dismiss the Second Consolidated Amended Complaint (the Amended Complaint). The Amended Complaint was filed on June 29, 2001, after the Court dismissed most of the claims in the original complaints, but granted leave to refile. In its February 20, 2002, ruling, the Court dismissed the RICO claims of ten of the sixteen named plaintiffs, including three of the four involving us, on the ground that the McCarran Ferguson Act prohibited their claims because they interfered with the state regulatory processes in the states in which they resided (Florida, New Jersey, California and Virginia). With respect to ERISA, the Court dismissed the misrepresentation claims of current members, finding that they have adequate remedies under the law and failed to exhaust administrative remedies. Claims for former members were not dismissed. The Court also refused to dismiss claims by all plaintiffs for breach of fiduciary duty arising from alleged interference with the doctor patient relationship by the use of so called gag clauses that assertedly prohibited doctors from freely communicating with members. The plaintiffs 18 Table of Contents sought certification of a class consisting of all members of our medical plans, excluding Medicare and Medicaid plans, for the period from 1990 to 1999. On September 26, 2002, the Court denied the plaintiffs request for class certification. On October 9, 2002, the plaintiffs asked the Court to reconsider its ruling on that issue. The Court denied the motion on November 25, 2002. The Court has set a trial date on the individual named plaintiffs claims for September 22, 2003. In the provider track case, the plaintiffs assert that we and other defendants improperly paid providers claims and downcoded their claims by paying lesser amounts than they submitted. The complaint alleges, among other things, multiple violations under RICO as well as various breaches of contract and violations of regulations governing the timeliness of claim payments. We moved to dismiss the provider track complaint on September 8, 2000, and the other defendants filed similar motions thereafter. On March 2, 2001, the Court dismissed certain of the plaintiffs claims pursuant to the defendants several motions to dismiss. However, the Court allowed the plaintiffs to attempt to correct the deficiencies in their complaint with an amended pleading with respect to all of the allegations except a claim under the federal Medicare regulations, which was dismissed with prejudice. The Court also left undisturbed the plaintiffs claims for breach of contract. On March 26, 2001, the plaintiffs filed their amended complaint, which, among other things, added four state or county medical associations as additional plaintiffs. Two of those, the Denton County Medical Society and the Texas Medical Association, purport to bring their actions against us, as well as against several other defendant companies. The Medical Association of Georgia and the California Medical Association purport to bring their actions against various other defendant companies. The associations seek injunctive relief only. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on April 30, 2001. On September 26, 2002, the Court granted the plaintiffs request to file a second amended complaint, adding additional plaintiffs, including the Florida Medical Association, which purports to bring its action against all defendants. On October 21, 2002, the defendants moved to dismiss the second amended complaint. The Court has not yet ruled. Also on September 26, 2002, the Court certified a global class consisting of all medical doctors who provided services to any person insured by any defendant from August 4, 1990, to September 30, 2002. The class includes two subclasses. A national subclass consists of medical doctors who provided services to any person insured by a defendant when the doctor has a claim against such defendant and is not required to arbitrate that claim. A California subclass consists of medical doctors who provided services to any person insured in California by any defendant when the doctor was not bound to arbitrate the claim. On October 10, 2002, the defendants asked the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit to review the class certification decision. On November 20, 2002, the Court of Appeals agreed to review the class issue. The District Court has ruled that discovery can proceed during the pendency of the request to the Eleventh Circuit, and the Eleventh Circuit rejected a request to halt discovery. The Court has set a trial date of December 8, 2003. Other The Academy of Medicine of Cincinnati, the Butler County Medical Society, the Northern Kentucky Medical Society and several physicians have filed antitrust suits against Aetna Health, Inc., Humana Health Plan of Ohio, Inc., Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield, and United Healthcare of Ohio, Inc., alleging that the defendants have conspired to fix the reimbursement rates paid to physicians in the Greater Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky region. The companion suits are filed in state courts in Ohio and Kentucky and allege violation, respectively, of the Ohio and Kentucky antitrust laws. Each suit seeks class certification, damages and injunctive relief. Plaintiffs cite no evidence that any such conspiracy existed, but base their allegations on assertions that physicians in the Greater Cincinnati region are paid less than physicians in other major cities in Ohio and Kentucky. The Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) and the Boone County Circuit Court (Kentucky) have denied motions by the defendants to compel arbitration or alternatively to dismiss. Defendants have filed notices 19 Table of Contents of appeal with respect to the orders denying arbitration. The Ohio court has agreed to stay proceedings pending resolution of the appeal, and a similar request has been filed with the Kentucky court. The plaintiffs have filed motions to certify a class in each case. The purported classes allegedly consist, respectively, of all physicians who have practiced medicine at any time since January 1, 1992, in a four county region in Southwestern Ohio or a three county region in Northern Kentucky. We intend to continue to defend these actions vigorously. Government Audits and Other Litigation and Proceedings In July 2000, the Office of the Florida Attorney General initiated an investigation, apparently relating to some of the same matters that are involved in the purported class action lawsuits described above. While the Attorney General has filed no action against us, he has indicated that he may do so in the future. On September 21, 2001, the Texas Attorney General initiated a similar investigation. These investigations are ongoing, and we have cooperated with the regulators in both states. On May 31, 2000, we entered into a five year Corporate Integrity Agreement, or CIA, with the Office of Inspector General, or OIG, of the Department of Health and Human Services. Under the CIA, we are obligated to, among other things, provide training, conduct periodic audits and make periodic reports to the OIG. In addition, our business practices are subject to review by various state insurance and health care regulatory authorities and federal regulatory authorities. There has been increased scrutiny by these regulators of the managed health care companies business practices, including claims payment practices and utilization management practices. We have been and continue to be subject to such reviews. Some of these have resulted in fines and could require changes in some of our practices and could also result in additional fines or other sanctions. We also are involved in other lawsuits that arise in the ordinary course of our business operations, including claims of medical malpractice (both for direct negligence and for vicarious liability for negligence of network providers), bad faith, nonacceptance or termination of providers, failure to disclose network discounts and various other provider arrangements, and challenges to subrogation practices. We also are subject to claims relating to performance of contractual obligations to providers and others, including failure to properly pay claims and challenges to the use of certain software products in processing claims. Pending state and federal legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims. In addition, some courts recently have issued decisions which could have the effect of eroding the scope of ERISA preemption, thereby exposing us to greater liability for medical negligence claims. Personal injury claims and claims for extracontractual damages arising from medical benefit denials are covered by insurance from our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary and excess carriers, except to the extent that claimants seek punitive damages, which may not be covered by insurance in certain states in which insurance coverage for punitive damages is not permitted. In addition, insurance coverage for all or certain forms of liability has become increasingly costly and may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future. Beginning January 1, 2002, we reduced the amount of coverage purchased from third party insurance carriers and increased the amount of risk we retain due to substantially higher insurance rates. We do not believe that any pending or threatened legal actions against us or audits by agencies will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the likelihood or outcome of current or future suits, like the purported class action lawsuits described above, or governmental investigations, cannot be accurately predicted with certainty. In addition, the increased litigation, which has accompanied the negative publicity and public perception of our industry, adds to this uncertainty. Therefore, such legal actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. ITEM 4.

Introduction Headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, Humana Inc. is one of the nations largest publicly traded health benefits companies, based on our 2002 revenues of $11.3 billion. We offer coordinated health insurance coverage and related services through a variety of traditional and Internet based plans for employer groups, government sponsored programs, and individuals. As of December 31, 2002, we had approximately 6.6 million members in our medical insurance programs, as well as approximately 1.6 million members in our specialty products programs. We have approximately 425,000 contracts with physicians, hospitals, dentists and other providers to provide health care to our members. In 2002, approximately 70% of our premiums and administrative services fees resulted from members located in Florida, Illinois, Texas, Kentucky, and Ohio. We derived approximately 44% of our premiums and administrative services fees from contracts with the federal government in 2002. Under two federal government contracts with the Department of Defense, we provide health insurance coverage to TRICARE members, accounting for approximately 19% of our total premiums and administrative services fees in 2002. Under one federal government contract with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, we provide health insurance coverage to approximately 228,400 Medicare+Choice members in Florida, accounting for approximately 16% of our total premiums and administrative services fees in 2002. We manage our business with two segments: Commercial and Government. The Commercial segment consists of members enrolled in products marketed to employer groups and individuals, and includes three lines of business: fully insured medical, administrative services only, or ASO, and specialty. The Government segment consists of members enrolled in government sponsored programs, and includes three lines of business: Medicare+Choice, Medicaid, and TRICARE. We identified our segments in accordance with the aggregation provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information which is consistent with information used by our Chief Executive Officer in managing our business. The segment information aggregates products with similar economic characteristics. These characteristics include the nature of customer groups and pricing, benefits and underwriting requirements. The results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes. We allocate all selling, general and administrative expenses, investment and other income, interest expense, and goodwill, but no other assets or liabilities, to our segments. Members served by our two segments generally utilize the same medical provider networks, enabling us to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers. Our segments also share overhead costs and assets. As a result, the profitability of each segment is interdependent. Our business strategy centers on increasing Commercial segment profitability while maintaining our existing strength in the Government segment. Our strategy to increase Commercial segment profitability focuses 23 Table of Contents on providing solutions for employers to the rising cost of health care through the use of innovative and consumer centric product designs which are supported by service excellence and industry leading electronic capabilities, including education, tools and technologies provided primarily through the Internet. The intent of our Commercial segment strategy is to enable us to further penetrate high potential commercial markets and to transform the traditional consumer experience for both employers and members to result in a high degree of consumer satisfaction, loyalty and brand awareness. We are in the process of reducing our administrative cost structure primarily to support our Commercial strategy. Restructuring Charge During the fourth quarter of 2002, we finalized a plan to reduce our administrative cost structure with the consolidation of seven customer service centers into four and an enterprise wide workforce reduction. The following table presents the components of the restructuring charge we recorded for the year ended December 31, 2002: 2002 Charge Cash Payments Non cash Balance at December 31, 2002 Expected Future Cash Outlays (in thousands) Severance and related employee benefits $ 32,105 $ 910 $ $ 31,195 $ 31,195 Long lived asset impairment 2,448 2,448 Leased equipment discontinuance costs 1,324 1,324 1,324 Total restructuring charges $ 35,877 $ 910 $ 2,448 $ 32,519 $ 32,519 Severance During the fourth quarter of 2002, we recorded severance and related employee benefit costs of $32.1 million ($19.6 million after tax) in connection with customer service center consolidation and an enterprise wide workforce reduction. Severance costs were estimated based upon the provisions of the Companys existing employee benefit plans and policies. The plan to reduce our administrative cost structure is expected to affect approximately 2,600 positions throughout the entire organization including customer service, claim administrations, clinical operations, provider network administration, as well as other corporate and field based positions. As part of the plan, we expect to hire approximately 300 employees to support newly consolidated operations, thereby resulting in a net reduction of approximately 2,300 employees. As of December 31, 2002, approximately 500 positions had been eliminated. We expect the remaining positions to be eliminated by December 31, 2003, with most of the severance being paid in 2003. As a result of these actions, we expect a reduction in historical compensation expense will improve our pretax results by approximately $70 million ($43 million after tax) in 2003 and $110 million ($67 million after tax) annually thereafter and after tax cash flows from operating activities by approximately $13 million in 2003 including estimated severance payments of approximately $30 million and $65 million annually thereafter. Long lived Asset Impairment Our decision to eliminate three customer service centers prompted a review during the fourth quarter of 2002 for the possible impairment of long lived assets used in these operations. We will continue to use some long lived assets associated with these customer service center operations until mid 2003, the expected completion date for consolidating these operations. We are currently evaluating alternatives with respect to future use of these long lived assets, including possible sale. Our impairment review indicated that future estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to our business supported by our San Antonio, Texas customer service operations were insufficient to recover the carrying value 24 Table of Contents of certain long lived assets, primarily buildings used in these operations. Accordingly, we adjusted the carrying value of these long lived assets to their estimated fair value resulting in a non cash impairment charge of $2.4 million ($1.5 million after tax). Estimated fair value was based on an independent third party appraisal of the buildings. By the end of the first quarter of 2003, we expect the estimated future undiscounted cash flow attributable to our business supported by our Jacksonville, Florida customer service operations will be insufficient to recover the carrying value of additional long lived assets, primarily a building used in our Florida operations. Accordingly, we expect to record a non cash impairment charge of approximately $17.2 million ($10.5 million after tax) during the first quarter of 2003. Additionally, we expect to record a non cash impairment charge of approximately $13.5 million during the first quarter of 2003 ($8.3 million after tax) related to accelerated depreciation of software we will cease using with these operations. As a result of these actions, we expect a reduction in historical depreciation and rent expense will improve our pretax results by approximately $5 million ($3 million after tax) in 2003 and $6 million ($4 million after tax) annually thereafter. The impact on operating cash flows is not expected to be material. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. We continuously evaluate our estimates and those critical accounting policies related primarily to medical cost and revenue recognition as well as accounting for impairments related to our investment securities, goodwill, and long lived assets. These estimates are based on knowledge of current events and anticipated future events, and accordingly, actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Medical Cost Recognition Medical costs include claim payments, capitation payments, allocations of certain centralized expenses and various other costs incurred to provide health insurance coverage to members, as well as estimates of future payments to hospitals and others for medical care provided prior to the balance sheet date. Capitation payments represent monthly contractual fees disbursed to primary care physicians and other providers who are responsible for providing medical care to members. We estimate the costs of our future medical claims and other medical expense payments using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon claim payment patterns, medical cost inflation, historical developments such as claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns, and other relevant factors, and record medical claims reserves for future payments. We continually review estimates of future payments relating to medical claims costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and make necessary adjustments to our reserves. Medical cost inflation, among other items, may significantly impact our estimate of medical costs. Medical cost inflationary trends today are substantially higher than other segments of the economy. In the early 1990s employer driven migration to HMO enrollment was popular and resulted in several years of very low medical cost trends. Today, there are very few economic forces existing to mitigate increases in the utilization of hospital and physician services, prescription drugs and new medical technologies, and the inflationary trend on the cost per unit for each of these expense components. Additionally, as we are realigning our operating model around our commercial strategy, we continue to reduce the level of traditional utilization management functions such as pre authorization of services, monitoring of inpatient admissions and requirements for physician referrals. Other external factors such as government mandated benefits or other regulatory changes, catastrophes and epidemics may also impact cost trends. 25 Table of Contents Any of the items above, or other unforeseen circumstances, may result in actual medical cost trends differing materially from our estimates and a relatively small variance between our estimates of medical cost trends and actual trends could have a material impact, either favorable or unfavorable, on the adequacy of our medical claims reserves and our overall financial position. For example, a 100 basis point, or 1 percent, change in the estimate of our medical and other expenses payable at December 31, 2002, which represents 39% of total liabilities, would require an adjustment of $11.4 million in a future period in which the revision in the estimate becomes known. A 100 basis point change in estimated medical expense trends would have changed annual pretax results of our Commercial segment by $48.7 million and our Government segment by $42.7 million in 2002. Note 5 in our consolidated financial statements presents a reconciliation of beginning and ending balances for medical and other expenses payable. The table includes the changes in estimates of medical claims payable subsequently recorded to each year. A summary of these changes in estimates and percentage of beginning medical claim reserves follows: Year ended December 31, Amount Percentage of Beginning Reserves Percentage of Medical Expenses Variance (in millions) 2002 $ 12.3 1.1 % 0.1 % Unfavorable development 2001 $ 23.4 1.8 % 0.3 % Favorable development 2000 $ 8.5 0.6 % 0.1 % Favorable development Revenue Recognition We generally establish one year commercial membership contracts with employer groups, subject to cancellation by the employer groups written notice. Our TRICARE contracts with the federal government and our contracts with various state Medicaid programs are generally multi year contracts subject to annual renewal provisions. Our Medicare+Choice contracts with the federal government renew annually. We bill and collect premium and administrative fee remittances from employer groups and some individual Medicare+Choice members monthly. We receive monthly premiums and administrative fees from the federal government and various states according to government specified reimbursement rates and various contractual terms. Premium revenues are recognized as income in the period members are entitled to receive services, and are net of estimated uncollectible amounts and retroactive membership adjustments. Retroactive membership adjustments result from enrollment changes not yet processed, or not yet reported by an employer group or the government. We routinely monitor the collectibility of specific accounts, the aging of receivables, historical retroactivity trends, as well as prevailing and anticipated economic conditions, and any required adjustments are reflected in current operations. Administrative services only fees, or ASO, are earned as services are performed. Administrative services fees cover the processing of claims, offering access to our provider networks and clinical programs, and responding to customer service inquiries from members of self funded employers. Under ASO contracts, self funded employers and, for TRICARE ASO, the Department of Defense, retain the risk of financing the cost of health benefits. Premium and ASO receivables are shown net of allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts and retroactive membership adjustments. Premiums and ASO fees received prior to the period members are entitled to receive services are recorded as unearned revenues. 26 Table of Contents TRICARE Revenues Base premium revenues as originally specified in our TRICARE contracts are recognized ratably throughout each contract year as eligible beneficiaries are entitled to receive services. TRICARE revenues also include estimates for amounts recoverable from the federal government as a result of bid price adjustments, or BPAs, and change orders. Under our TRICARE contracts, we retain the financial risk of contractual discounts in the provider networks, same store utilization of services and administrative overhead. However, the federal government retains the financial risk associated with changes in usage levels at military treatment facilities, or MTF, changes in the number of persons eligible for TRICARE benefits and medical unit cost inflation. BPAs are utilized to retroactively adjust premium revenues for the impact of the items for which the federal government retains risk. We work closely with the federal government to obtain and review eligibility and MTF workload data, and to quantify and negotiate amounts recoverable or payable under our contractual BPA requirements. We record revenues applicable to BPAs when these amounts are determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured. Because final settlement of BPAs occurs only at specified intervals, typically in excess of 6 months after the end of a contract year for our largest regions, cumulative amounts receivable or payable under BPAs may be outstanding in excess of a year. Amounts receivable or payable within a year are classified as premiums receivable or trade accounts payable and accrued expenses, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets. Amounts receivable or payable for longer than one year are classified as other long term assets or other long term liabilities, respectively. As a result of the events of September 11, 2001, the subsequent build up of military personnel to support military operations in Afghanistan and the continuing build up of military personnel surrounding other international tensions, the magnitude of BPA activity is currently much more significant than in prior years. TRICARE change orders occur when we perform services or incur costs under the directive of the federal government that were not originally specified in our contracts. Under federal regulations we are entitled to an equitable adjustment to the contract price, which results in additional premium revenues. Examples of items that have necessitated substantial change orders in recent years include congressionally legislated increases in the level of benefits for TRICARE beneficiaries and the administration of new government programs such as TRICARE for Life and TRICARE Senior Pharmacy. Like BPAs, we record revenue applicable to change orders when these amounts are determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured. Unlike BPAs, where settlement only occurs at specified intervals, change orders may be negotiated and settled at any time throughout the year. Total TRICARE premium and ASO fee receivables at December 31, 2002 and 2001 are as follows: December 31, 2002 2001 (in thousands) TRICARE premiums receivable: Base receivable $ 190,339 $ 164,621 Bid price adjustments (BPAs) 104,044 Change orders 1,400 1,431 Subtotal 295,783 166,052 Less: long term portion of BPAs (86,471 ) Total TRICARE premiums receivable $ 209,312 $ 166,052 TRICARE ASO fees receivable: Base receivable $ 7,205 $ 2,142 Change orders 56,230 16,992 Total $ 63,435 $ 19,134 27 Table of Contents Our TRICARE contracts also contain risk sharing provisions with the federal government to minimize any losses and limit any profits in the event that medical costs for which we are at risk differ from the levels targeted in our contracts. Amounts receivable from the federal government under such risk sharing provisions are included in the BPA receivable above, while amounts payable to the federal government under these provisions of approximately $23 million are included in trade accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheets. Investment Securities Investment securities totaled $1,694.6 million, or 37% of total assets at December 31, 2002. Debt securities totaled $1,637.5 million, or 97% of our total investment portfolio. The average duration of our debt securities was approximately 3 years and more than 95% of our debt securities were of investment grade quality with an average of AA by Standard & Poors at December 31, 2002. Most of the debt securities that are below investment grade are rated at the higher end of the non investment grade spectrum. Our investment policy limits investments in a single issuer and requires diversification among various asset types. Our investment securities are categorized as available for sale and, as a result, are stated at fair value. Fair value of publicly traded debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices. Non traded debt securities are priced independently by a third party vendor. Fair value of strategic venture capital debt and equity securities that are privately held, or where an observable quoted market price does not exist, are estimated using a variety of valuation methodologies. Such methodologies include reviewing the value ascribed to the most recent financing, comparing the security with securities of publicly traded companies in a similar line of business, and reviewing the underlying financial performance including estimating discounted cash flows. Unrealized holding gains and losses, net of applicable deferred taxes, are included as a component of stockholders equity until realized from a sale or impairment. Gross unrealized losses totaled $12.6 million, or 0.7% of our total investment portfolio at December 31, 2002 compared to $19.5 million, or 1.2% at December 31, 2001. We had no material unrealized loss on any one individual investment security or within any one industry at December 31, 2002. We regularly evaluate our investment securities for impairment. We consider factors affecting the investee, factors affecting the industry the investee operates within, and general debt and equity market trends. We consider the length of time an investments fair value has been below carrying value, the near term prospects for recovery to carrying value and our intent and ability to hold the investment until maturity or market recovery is realized. If and when a determination is made that a decline in fair value below the cost basis is other than temporary, the related investment is written down to its estimated fair value through earnings. The risks inherent in assessing the impairment of an investment include the risk that market factors may differ from our expectations; facts and circumstances factored into our assessment may change with the passage of time; or we may decide to subsequently sell the investment. The determination of whether a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary requires us to exercise significant diligence and judgment. The discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments. The current economic environment and recent volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of determining fair value and assessing investment impairment. The same influences tend to increase the risk of potentially impaired assets. Gross realized losses in 2002 included impairment losses of $19.6 million related to privately held investment securities after an evaluation indicated that a decline in fair value below the cost basis was other than temporary. Goodwill and Long lived Asset At December 31, 2002, goodwill and other long lived assets represented 28% of total assets and 79% of total stockholders equity. 28 Table of Contents Goodwill is no longer amortized but must be tested at least annually for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as the reporting unit and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. A reporting unit is one level below our Commercial and Government segments. The Commercial segments two reporting units consist of fully and self insured medical and specialty. The Government segments three reporting units consist of Medicare+Choice, TRICARE and Medicaid. Goodwill was assigned to the reporting unit that was expected to benefit from a specific acquisition. If goodwill was expected to benefit multiple reporting units, we allocated goodwill in connection with our transitional impairment test as of January 1, 2002 based upon the reporting units relative fair value. This process resulted in the allocation of $633.2 million of goodwill to the Commercial segment and $143.7 million of goodwill to the Government segment. Our long range business plan and annual planning process supports our goodwill impairment tests. These tests are based primarily on an evaluation of future discounted cash flows under several scenarios. We used a range of discount rates that correspond to our weighted average cost of capital. Key assumptions including changes in membership, premium yields, medical cost trends and certain government contract extensions are consistent with those utilized in our long range business plan and annual planning process. If these assumptions differ from actual, the estimates underlying our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected. Long lived assets consist of property and equipment and other intangible assets. These assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life, and are subject to impairment reviews. We periodically review long lived assets whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. In assessing recoverability, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine if an impairment loss may exist, and, if so, estimate fair value. We also must estimate and make assumptions regarding the useful life we assign to our long lived assets. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment losses or change the useful life, including accelerating depreciation for these assets. In 2002, we recognized long lived asset impairment losses of $2.4 million as a result of our decision to eliminate three customer service centers. We expect to recognize additional long lived asset impairment losses of approximately $30.7 million in 2003 related to these service center consolidation initiatives. See Restructuring Charge section and Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. Recent Transactions Acquisitions On May 31, 2001, we acquired the outstanding shares of common stock of a newly formed Anthem Health Insurance Company subsidiary responsible for administering TRICARE benefits in Regions 2 and 5 for $43.5 million in cash, net of direct transaction costs. During 2000, in separate transactions, we acquired a Houston based health plan, two operating shell entities for future business initiatives, and a hospital in patient management services firm for $76.3 million in cash, net of direct transaction costs. We accounted for each of these acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting and accordingly, our consolidated results of operations include the results of the acquired businesses from the date of acquisition. For each acquisition, we allocated the purchase price to net tangible and other intangible assets based upon their fair values. Any remaining value not assigned to net tangible or other intangible assets was then allocated to goodwill. Other intangible assets primarily relate to government, subscriber and provider contracts and the cost of the acquired licenses. Goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in connection with the acquisitions were $44.8 million in 2001 and $52.1 million in 2000. The other intangible assets are being amortized over periods ranging from 2 to 20 years, with a weighted average life of 5.7 years. Unaudited pro forma results of operations information have not been presented because the effects of these acquisitions, individually or in the aggregate, were not significant to our results of operations or financial position. 29 Table of Contents Divestitures During 2000, we completed transactions to divest our workers compensation, north Florida Medicaid and Medicare supplement businesses. We estimated and recorded a $117.2 million loss in 1999 related to these divestitures. There was no subsequent change in the estimated loss. Divested assets, consisting primarily of investment securities and reinsurance recoverables, totaled $651.9 million. Divested liabilities, consisting primarily of workers compensation and other reserves, totaled $437.6 million. Cash proceeds received in 2000 were $97.1 million, net of direct transaction costs. Revenue associated with these businesses prior to divestiture for 2000 totaled $102.9 million or less than 1% of our consolidated 2000 revenues. Pretax losses totaled $8.4 million in 2000 related to these businesses. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements On January 1, 2003, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146, Accounting for Exit or Disposal Activities, or Statement 146. Statement 146 addresses the recognition, measurement, and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities, including certain lease termination costs and severance type costs under a one time benefit arrangement rather than an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract. Statement 146 requires liabilities associated with exit and disposal activities to be expensed as incurred and will impact the timing of recognition for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. The effect of the adoption is dependent on exit or disposal activities, if any, initiated after December 31, 2002. In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, an interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and Rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34, or FIN 45. Fin 45 requires that upon issuance of a guarantee, the entity must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee. FIN 45 requires disclosure about each guarantee even if the likelihood of the guarantors having to make any payments under the guarantee is remote. The provisions for initial recognition and measurement are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees that are issued or modified after December 31, 2002. We do not expect the adoption of the recognition provision of FIN 45 will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The disclosure provisions of FIN 45 are effective for our December 31, 2002 financial statements. See Liquidity section and Note 12 in our consolidated financial statements for guarantee disclosures. In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB 51, or FIN 46. The primary objectives of FIN 46 are to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting right (variable interest entities, or VIEs) and how to determine when and which business enterprise should consolidate the VIE (the primary beneficiary). The provisions of FIN 46 are effective immediately for VIEs created after January 31, 2003 and no later than July 1, 2003 for VIEs created before February 1, 2003. In addition, FIN 46 requires that both the primary beneficiary and all other enterprises with a significant variable interest make additional disclosure in filings issued after January 31, 2003. The adoption of FIN 46 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In January 2003, the FASB issued Statement No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, or Statement 148. This Statement amends FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, Statement 148 amends the disclosure requirements of Statement 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. See Notes 2 and 9 in our consolidated financial statements for our stock option 30 Table of Contents accounting policy and required disclosures. As now required by Statement 148, these disclosures will be updated each reporting period beginning with the first quarter of 2003. Comparison of Results of Operations for 2002 and 2001 The following table presents certain financial data for our two segments: For the year ended December 31, 2002 2001 (in thousands, except ratios) Premium revenues: Fully insured $ 5,499,033 $ 4,941,888 Specialty 337,295 304,714 Total Commercial 5,836,328 5,246,602 Medicare+Choice 2,629,597 2,909,478 TRICARE 2,001,474 1,341,557 Medicaid 462,998 441,324 Total Government 5,094,069 4,692,359 Total $ 10,930,397 $ 9,938,961 Administrative services fees: Commercial $ 103,203 $ 84,204 Government 141,193 52,886 Total $ 244,396 $ 137,090 Medical expense ratios: Commercial 83.5 % 83.1 % Government 83.8 % 83.6 % Total 83.6 % 83.3 % SG&A expense ratios: Commercial 17.5 % 17.6 % Government 13.3 % 12.8 % Total 15.6 % 15.3 % Income (loss) before income taxes: Commercial $ (15,174 ) $ (2,013 ) Government 225,108 185,093 Total $ 209,934 $ 183,080 31 Table of Contents The following table presents our medical membership at December 31, 2002 and 2001: December 31, Change 2002 2001 Members Percentage Commercial segment medical members: Fully insured 2,340,300 2,301,300 39,000 1.7 % ASO 652,200 592,500 59,700 10.1 % Total Commercial 2,992,500 2,893,800 98,700 3.4 % Government segment medical members: Medicare+Choice 344,100 393,900 (49,800 ) (12.6 )% Medicaid 506,000 490,800 15,200 3.1 % TRICARE 1,755,800 1,714,600 41,200 2.4 % TRICARE ASO 1,048,700 942,700 106,000 11.2 % Total Government 3,654,600 3,542,000 112,600 3.2 % Total medical membership 6,647,100 6,435,800 211,300 3.3 % Overview Net income was $142.8 million, or $0.85 per diluted share in 2002, compared to net income of $117.2 million, or $0.70 per diluted share in 2001. The increase in earnings resulted primarily from premium revenues increasing more than operating costs in both our Commercial and Government segments and the non amortization of goodwill partially offset by the fourth quarter 2002 restructuring charge. Premium Revenues and Medical Membership Premium revenues increased 10.1% to $10.9 billion for 2002, compared to $9.9 billion for 2001. Higher premium revenues resulted primarily from significant commercial premium yields and an increase in TRICARE premiums. Premium yield represents the percentage increase in the average premium per member over the comparable period in the prior year. Items impacting premium yield include changes in premium rates, changes in government reimbursement rates, changes in geographic mix of membership, and changes in the mix of benefit plans selected by our membership. Commercial segment premium revenues increased 11.5% to $5.8 billion for 2002, compared to $5.2 billion for 2001. This increase resulted primarily from premium yields in the 12% to 14% range for 2002 on our fully insured commercial business. Additionally, our fully insured commercial medical membership increased 1.7% or 39,000 members, to 2,340,300 at December 31, 2002 compared to 2,301,300 at December 31, 2001. We have been pricing 2003 premiums using the assumption that medical cost trends will accelerate slightly and accordingly, anticipate 2003 Commercial premium yields in the 13% to 15% range. During 2003, we anticipate an increase in our fully insured commercial and administrative services (discussed below) medical membership of approximately 4% to 5%. Government segment premium revenues increased 8.5% to $5.1 billion for 2002, compared to $4.7 billion for 2001. This increase was primarily attributable to our TRICARE business, partially offset by a reduction in our Medicare+Choice membership. TRICARE premium revenues were $2.0 billion, an increase of $660 million, or 49.2% compared to 2001. $334 million of the increase in TRICARE premium revenues is attributable to the acquisition of Regions 2 and 5 on May 31, 2001, with the remainder of the increase attributable to the annual increase in our contractually determined base revenues and increases in premium revenues recorded as a result of bid price adjustments, or BPAs, and change orders. 32 Table of Contents Increasing premium revenues recorded in connection with BPAs resulted from an increase in the number of eligible TRICARE beneficiaries and a decrease in the use of military treatment facilities, or MTFs, by TRICARE beneficiaries. The number of TRICARE beneficiaries has increased as a result of the events of September 11, 2001, the subsequent build up of military personnel to support military operations in Afghanistan and the continuing build up of military personnel surrounding other international tensions. A decline in the usage of MTFs occurred for some periods after September 11, 2001 when certain MTFs were restricted by the Department of Defense resulting in a greater use of our provider network by retired military personnel and the dependents of both active duty and retired military personnel. Increasing premium revenues recorded in connection with change orders primarily resulted from expanded benefits for TRICARE beneficiaries as mandated by Congress which includes, among other items, a reduction of beneficiary out of pocket maximum cost and the elimination of certain copayments. Collectively, all of these actions resulted in higher medical expenses during 2002. Since these actions were not originally specified in our contracts, we were entitled to equitable revenue adjustments via the change order and bid price adjustment process. We recognized revenues related to these adjustments when the settlement amount became determinable and the collectibility was reasonably assured. Medicare+Choice premium revenues were $2.6 billion in 2002, a decrease of 9.6% from $2.9 billion in 2001. Medicare+Choice membership was 344,100 at December 31, 2002, compared to 393,900 at December 31, 2001, a decline of 49,800 members, or 12.6%. Premium yield was 5.6% for 2002. The decrease in membership was due to our exit of various counties on January 1, 2002, as well as attrition of some members selecting other plans in certain markets as a result of annual changes to benefit designs. Effective January 1, 2003, we exited several counties in some of our markets, affecting approximately 10,000 members. We expect that by the end of 2003 Medicare+Choice membership will be approximately 325,000 to 330,000 members. Administrative Services Fees Administrative services fees for 2002 were $244.4 million, an increase of $107.3 million from $137.1 million for 2001. For the Commercial segment, administrative services fees increased $19.0 million, or 22.6%, to $103.2 million. This increase corresponds to the higher level of ASO membership at December 31, 2002, which was 652,200 members, compared to 592,500 members at December 31, 2001 and also reflects an increase in the average fees received per member. Administrative services fees for the Government segment increased $88.3 million when comparing 2002 to 2001. $51 million of this increase was due to the TRICARE Regions 2 and 5 acquisition, with the remainder attributable to the implementation of the TRICARE for Life benefits program effective October 1, 2001. TRICARE for Life is a program for seniors where we provide medical benefit administrative services. Investment and Other Income Investment and other income totaled $86.4 million in 2002, a decrease of $32.4 million from $118.8 million in 2001. Net realized losses of $10.1 million in 2002 compared to net realized gains of $13.9 million in 2001. Net realized losses in 2002 included impairment losses of $19.6 million related to privately held venture capital investment securities after an evaluation indicated that a decline in fair value below the cost basis was other than temporary. Lower interest rates also decreased investment income $10.9 million in 2002 compared to 2001. The average yield on investment securities was 4.6% in 2002, declining from 5.1% in 2001. Medical Expense Total medical expenses as a percentage of premium revenues, or medical expense ratio, for 2002 was 83.6%, increasing 30 basis points from 83.3% for 2001. The Commercial segment medical expense ratio for 2002 was 83.5%, increasing 40 basis points from 83.1% for 2001. This increase primarily was due to the shift in the mix of our fully insured commercial medical 33 Table of Contents membership to a heavier concentration of larger group sizes. Large group commercial membership represents approximately 65% of our fully insured commercial membership at December 31, 2002 compared to 62% at December 31, 2001. Large group membership traditionally experiences a higher medical expense ratio and a lower selling, general and administrative expense ratio than does our small group membership. The Government segment medical expense ratio for 2002 was 83.8%, increasing 20 basis points from 83.6% for 2001. This increase primarily was attributable to TRICARE. As discussed previously, TRICARE medical expense increased due to expanded benefits for TRICARE beneficiaries mandated by Congress, an increase in eligible beneficiaries, and an increase in the use of Humanas provider network rather than military treatment facilities. Since these actions were not originally specified in our contracts or were for items that the Department of Defense retains financial risk, we were entitled to equitable revenue adjustments through the change order and bid price adjustment processes. These higher medical expenses combined with the associated higher premium revenues resulted in an overall increase in the Government medical expense ratio. SG&A Expense Total selling, general and administrative, or SG&A, expenses as a percentage of premium revenues and administrative services fees, or SG&A expense ratio, for 2002 was 15.6%, increasing 30 basis points from 15.3% for 2001. During the fourth quarter of 2002, we recorded $30.1 million of administrative expenses for a contingent contractual provider dispute and other items associated with our 1997 acquisition of Physician Corporation of America, or PCA. Of the total $30.1 million of administrative expenses, which amounts to a 30 basis point increase in the 2002 SG&A expense ratio, $28.4 million impacted our Commercial segment and $1.7 million impacted our Government segment. The Commercial segments SG&A expense ratio was 17.5% for 2002, decreasing 10 basis points from 2001 of 17.6%. The PCA items discussed above accounted for a 30 basis point increase in this ratio. The remaining 40 basis point decline in the SG&A ratio was driven primarily by the changing mix of members towards more larger group members and reductions in the number of our employees due to operational efficiencies gained from streamlining various processes through technology and other initiatives. Costs to distribute and administer our products to large group members are lower than that of small group members. The Government segments SG&A expense ratio was 13.3% for 2002, increasing 50 basis points compared to 12.8% in 2001. This increase resulted from a higher proportion of revenues generated from administrative services fees, primarily from the TRICARE Regions 2 and 5 acquisition and the implementation of the TRICARE for Life benefit programs effective October 1, 2001, as discussed above. ASO business carries a much higher SG&A ratio than fully insured business. We expect our total SG&A expense ratio to decline by approximately 80 basis points in 2003 due to our plan to realign our operating model around our commercial strategy and reductions in our administrative cost structure, including the consolidation of seven customer service centers into four and an enterprise wide workforce reduction. Depreciation and amortization was $120.7 million in 2002, a decrease of $40.8 million, or 25.3%, from $161.5 million in 2001. On a comparable basis, depreciation and amortization was $106.5 in 2001, excluding goodwill amortization expense. The $14.2 million increase in 2002 compared to 2001, as adjusted, results from capital expenditures primarily related to our technology initiatives and the TRICARE acquisition of Regions 2 and 5 on May 31, 2001. Interest Expense Interest expense was $17.3 million in 2002, a decrease of $8.0 million from $25.3 million in 2001. This decrease primarily resulted from lower interest rates. 34 Table of Contents Income Taxes Our effective tax rate in 2002 of 32% decreased 4% compared to the 36% effective tax rate in 2001. The lower effective tax rate in 2002 primarily resulted from the cessation of non deductible goodwill amortization on January 1, 2002, partially offset by higher state income taxes and a lower proportion of tax exempt investment income to pretax income. In addition, during 2002, the Internal Revenue Service completed their audit of all open years prior to 2000 which resulted in a favorable adjustment to the estimated accrual for income taxes of approximately $32.6 million. This was offset by an increase of approximately $24.5 million in the capital loss valuation allowance after we reevaluated probable capital gain realization in the allowable carryforward period based upon our capital gain experience beginning in 2000 and consideration of alternative tax planning strategies. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for a complete reconciliation to the federal statutory rate. We expect the effective tax rate for 2003 to increase to approximately 36% as a result of a lower proportion of tax exempt investment income to pretax income and because we are not currently anticipating any favorable adjustments resulting from the completion of any IRS tax examinations during 2003. Comparison of Results of Operations for 2001 and 2000 The following table presents certain financial data for our two segments: For the year ended December 31, 2001 2000 (in thousands, except ratios) Premium revenues: Fully insured $ 4,941,888 $ 5,263,602 Specialty 304,714 291,315 Total Commercial 5,246,602 5,554,917 Medicare+Choice 2,909,478 3,286,351 TRICARE 1,341,557 892,375 Medicaid 441,324 660,988 Total Government 4,692,359 4,839,714 Total $ 9,938,961 $ 10,394,631 Administrative services fees: Commercial $ 84,204 $ 86,298 Government 52,886 Total $ 137,090 $ 86,298 Medical expense ratios: Commercial 83.1 % 83.6 % Government 83.6 % 85.5 % Total 83.3 % 84.5 % SG&A expense ratios: Commercial 17.6 % 17.2 % Government 12.8 % 11.5 % Total 15.3 % 14.5 % Income (loss) before income taxes: Commercial $ (2,013 ) $ (7,954 ) Government 185,093 121,944 Total $ 183,080 $ 113,990 35 Table of Contents The following table presents our medical membership at December 31, 2001 and 2000: December 31, Change 2001 2000 Members Percentage Commercial segment medical members: Fully insured 2,301,300 2,545,800 (244,500 ) (9.6 )% ASO 592,500 612,800 (20,300 ) (3.3 )% Total Commercial 2,893,800 3,158,600 (264,800 ) (8.4 )% Government segment medical members: Medicare+Choice 393,900 494,200 (100,300 ) (20.3 )% Medicaid 490,800 575,600 (84,800 ) (14.7 )% TRICARE 1,714,600 1,070,300 644,300 60.2 % TRICARE ASO 942,700 942,700 100.0 % Total Government 3,542,000 2,140,100 1,401,900 65.5 % Total medical membership 6,435,800 5,298,700 1,137,100 21.5 % Overview Net income was $117.2 million, or $0.70 per diluted share in 2001, compared to net income of $90.1 million, or $0.54 per diluted share in 2000. This increase in earnings occurred despite an increase in our effective income tax rate from 21% in 2000 to 36% in 2001. The earnings increase resulted primarily from significant Medicare+Choice benefit reductions, improvements in determining appropriate premiums for our fully insured commercial medical membership (a process we refer to as pricing discipline) and divestitures of those products and markets that either lacked the prospect for long term profitability or no longer fit our strategic focus. Premium Revenues and Medical Membership Premium revenues decreased 4.4% to $9.9 billion for 2001, compared to $10.4 billion for 2000. This decrease was due to medical membership reductions from exiting numerous markets and products, partially offset by higher premium revenues from our TRICARE acquisition on May 31, 2001, and premium yields in our commercial and Medicare+Choice products. Commercial segment premium revenues decreased 5.6% to $5.2 billion for 2001, compared to $5.6 billion for 2000. This decrease was due to membership reductions partially offset by premium yields on our fully insured commercial business. Our fully insured commercial medical membership decreased 9.6% or 244,500 members, to 2,301,300 at December 31, 2001 compared to 2,545,800 at December 31, 2000, as we continued to focus on opportunities that satisfy our pricing criteria, and exit non core businesses. Government segment premium revenues decreased 3.0% to $4.7 billion for 2001, compared to $4.8 billion for 2000. This decrease was primarily attributable to reductions in our Medicare+Choice and Medicaid membership partially offset by higher Medicare+Choice premium yield in 2001, and higher premium revenues from our TRICARE acquisition on May 31, 2001. Medicare+Choice membership was 393,900 at December 31, 2001 compared to 494,200 at December 31, 2000, a decline of 100,300 members, or 20.3%. This decline in membership primarily was attributable to the exits from 45 Medicare counties on January 1, 2001. Medicaid membership was 490,800 at December 31, 2001 compared to 575,600 at December 31, 2000, a decline of 84,800 members. This decline resulted primarily from the divestiture of our north Florida, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Austin, San Antonio and Houston, Texas Medicaid businesses. For 2001, TRICARE premiums were $1.3 billion compared to $892.4 million for 2000, an increase of $449.2 million. Fully insured TRICARE membership increased by 644,300 members, or 60.2%, to 1,714,600 at December 31, 2001 compared to 1,070,300 at December 31, 2000 due to the TRICARE Regions 2 and 5 acquisition on May 31, 2001. This acquisition increased TRICARE fully insured medical members by approximately 648,000 members. 36 Table of Contents Administrative Services Fees Administrative services fees for 2001 were $137.1 million, an increase of $50.8 million from $86.3 million for 2000. This increase primarily was due to the TRICARE Regions 2 and 5 acquisition, and servicing medical benefits in an administrative capacity under a new TRICARE program for seniors, called TRICARE for Life, which began October 1, 2001. Investment and Other Income Investment and other income totaled $118.8 million in 2001, an increase of $3.8 million from $115.0 million in 2000. The increased investment and other income resulted from higher average invested balances partially offset by lower interest rates. Medical Expense Total medical expenses as a percentage of premium revenues, or medical expense ratio, for 2001 was 83.3%, decreasing 120 basis points from 84.5% for 2000. The improvement in the medical expense ratio primarily was due to significant benefit reductions in our Medicare+Choice product effective January 1, 2001, continued discipline in commercial pricing, and the exit of numerous higher cost markets and products during 2000. The Commercial segment medical expense ratio for 2001 was 83.1%, decreasing 50 basis points from 83.6% for 2000. The improvement in our Commercial medical expense ratio resulted primarily from exercising pricing discipline in our fully insured accounts. The Government segment medical expense ratio for 2001 was 83.6%, decreasing 190 basis points from 85.5% for 2000. This improvement primarily resulted from exiting 45 non core counties in our Medicare+Choice business with higher medical expense ratios on January 1, 2001, coupled with significant benefit design changes which also became effective on that date. SG&A Expense Total selling, general and administrative, or SG&A, expenses as a percentage of premium revenues and administrative services fees, or SG&A expense ratio, for 2001 was 15.3%, increasing 80 basis points from 14.5% in 2000. Similar increases occurred in the SG&A expense ratios of our Commercial and Government segments as indicated in the preceding table. These increases resulted from an increase in the mix of ASO membership, primarily from the TRICARE acquisition, and planned spending on infrastructure and technology initiatives. Depreciation and amortization was $161.5 million in 2001, an increase of $15.0 million, or 10.2%, from $146.5 million in 2000. This increase was the result of increased capital expenditures primarily related to our technology initiatives and the TRICARE acquisition on May 31, 2001. Interest Expense Interest expense was $25.3 million in 2001, a decrease of $3.3 million from $28.6 million in 2000. This decline was attributable to the impact from lower interest rates that were offset by higher average daily outstanding borrowings. A greater proportion of total debt outstanding during 2001 resulted from borrowings under our credit agreement, and later in the year under the 5 year senior notes issued in August 2001. These borrowings have longer maturities than borrowings under our commercial paper program, resulting in higher daily average outstanding borrowings in 2001 compared to 2000. As a result of this changing debt mix, daily cash in excess of our funding requirements was invested, causing higher average invested balances described above. 37 Table of Contents Income Taxes Our effective tax rate in 2001 was approximately 36% compared to a 21% effective tax rate in 2000. The lower effective tax rate in 2000 was the result of recognizing the benefit of capital loss carryforwards resulting from the sale of our workers compensation business. Liquidity The following table presents operating cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, excluding the effects of the timing of the Medicare+Choice premium receipts: For the years ended, 2002 2001 (in thousands) Cash flows provided by operating activities $ 321,408 $ 148,958 Timing of Medicare+Choice premium receipts 10,873 16,815 Normalized cash flows provided by operating activities $ 332,281 $ 165,773 The Medicare+Choice premium receipt is payable to us on the first day of each month. When the first day of a month falls on a weekend or holiday, we receive this payment at the end of the previous month. This receipt is significant, the timing of which can cause material fluctuation in operating cash flows. Normalized operating cash flows assume these monthly receipts were received in the month in which they are applicable, providing a better comparison. Normalized operating cash flows were $332.3 million in 2002, compared to $165.8 million in 2001, an increase of $166.5 million. This increase primarily was attributable to higher net income and an increase in medical and other expenses payable partially offset by higher TRICARE receivables. Medical and other expenses payable increased $55.7 million during 2002, primarily as a result of membership growth, the timing of our payment to our third party pharmacy benefit administrator, and increases in medical claims trend partially offset by a reduction in unprocessed claim inventories and a decrease in claim receipt cycle time. Medical and other expenses payable declined $179.5 million during 2001 due to reductions in both unprocessed claim inventories on hand and membership levels. Throughout 2001, and to a lesser extent during 2002, we reduced the level of unprocessed claim inventories, a direct result of our focused effort to improve service and operational efficiencies. The pace of claim inventory reduction slowed during 2002 to $33.1 million compared to $132.0 million for 2001. The following table presents the estimated valuation and number of unprocessed claims on hand. Claims on hand represent the estimated number of provider requests for reimbursement that have been received but not yet processed. Estimated Valuation Claims On Hand Number of Days Claims On hand (in thousands) December 31, 2000 $ 257,400 1,157,900 11.0 December 31, 2001 $ 125,400 518,100 5.0 December 31, 2002 $ 92,300 424,200 4.1 38 Table of Contents Total net premium and ASO receivables increased to $416.9 million, or 27.8%, during 2002 primarily related to TRICARE, as presented in the following table: December 31, Change 2002 2001 Dollars Percentage (in thousands) TRICARE: Base receivable $ 197,544 $ 166,763 $ 30,781 18.5 % Bid price adjustments (BPAs) 104,044 104,044 100.0 % Change orders 57,630 18,423 39,207 212.8 % 359,218 185,186 174,032 94.0 % Less: long term portion of BPAs (86,471 ) (86,471 ) 100.0 % TRICARE subtotal 272,747 185,186 87,561 47.3 % Commercial and other 174,309 179,621 (5,312 ) (3.0 )% Allowance for doubtful accounts (30,178 ) (38,539 ) 8,361 (21.7 )% Total net receivables $ 416,878 $ 326,268 $ 90,610 27.8 % TRICARE receivables increased primarily due to change orders and bid price adjustments previously discussed. We collect the TRICARE base receivables monthly in the ordinary course of business. The timing of BPA collections occurs at contractually specified intervals, typically in excess of 6 months after the end of a contract year for our largest regions. We classified a portion of the total BPA receivables associated with our Regions 3 and 4 TRICARE contract as long term because the federal government is not obligated to pay us the amounts until January 2004. We also have a BPA amount payable within one year under the Regions 3 and 4 contract of approximately $23 million at December 31, 2002, which is classified in trade accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheets. Change orders may be negotiated and settled at any time throughout the year. We expect to collect the change order receivable balance of $57.6 million no later than the second quarter of 2003. Due to the build up of military personnel and other items previously discussed, we expect TRICARE receivables to increase from the $359 million level at December 31, 2002 to a range of $415 million to $465 million at December 31, 2003. The allowance for doubtful accounts of $30.2 million at December 31, 2002, which relates entirely to commercial and other receivables, decreased from $38.5 million at December 31, 2001. This decline resulted from a reduction in past due accounts, improved collections and operating efficiencies related to the billing and enrollment system. Capital Expenditures Our ongoing capital expenditures relate primarily to our technology initiatives and administrative facilities necessary for activities such as claims processing, billing and collections, medical utilization review and customer service. Total capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, were $112.1 million in 2002, $115.5 million in 2001, and $135.1 million in 2000. Excluding acquisitions, we expect our total capital expenditures in 2003 to be approximately $105 million, most of which will be used for our technology initiatives and improvement of administrative facilities. Stock Repurchase Plan In July 2002, the Board of Directors authorized the use of up to $100 million in total for the repurchase of our common shares. The shares may be purchased from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market, by block purchases, or in privately negotiated transactions. We have engaged Lehman Brothers Inc. and Banc of America Securities, LLC to broker these transactions. As of December 31, 2002, we had purchased 6.4 million shares for an aggregate purchase price of $74.0 million, or $11.56 per share. Since December 31, 2002 and 39 Table of Contents through February 26, 2003, we had purchased 2.2 million more shares for an aggregate purchase price of $20.8 million, or $9.31 per share. The total remaining share repurchase authorization as of February 26, 2003 was $5.2 million. Debt The following table presents our short term and long term debt outstanding at December 31, 2002 and 2001: December 31, 2002 2001 (in thousands) Short term debt: Conduit commercial paper financing program $ 265,000 $ 263,000 Long term debt: Senior notes $ 334,368 $ 309,789 Other long term borrowings 5,545 5,700 Total long term debt $ 339,913 $ 315,489 Senior Notes The $300 million 7% senior, unsecured notes are due August 1, 2006. In order to hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of our $300 million 7% senior notes attributable to fluctuations in interest rates, we entered into interest rate swap agreements. Interest rate swap agreements, which are considered derivatives, are contracts that exchange interest payments on a specified principal amount, or notional amount, for a specified period. Our interest rate swap agreements exchange the 7% fixed interest rate under our senior notes for a variable interest rate, which was 3.06% at December 31, 2002. The $300 million swap agreements mature on August 1, 2006, and have the same critical terms as our senior notes. Changes in the fair value of the 7% senior notes and the swap agreements due to changing interest rates are assumed to offset each other completely, resulting in no impact to earnings from hedge ineffectiveness. Our swap agreements are recognized in our consolidated balance sheet at fair value with an equal and offsetting adjustment to the carrying value of our senior notes. The fair value of our swap agreements are estimated based on quoted market prices of comparable agreements and reflects the amounts we would receive (or pay) to terminate the agreements at the reporting date. At December 31, 2002, the $34.9 million fair value of our swap agreements is included in other long term assets. Likewise, the carrying value of our senior notes has been increased $34.9 million to its fair value. The counterparties to our swap agreements are major financial institutions with which we also have other financial relationships. Credit Agreements We maintain two unsecured revolving credit agreements consisting of a $265 million, 4 year revolving credit agreement and a $265 million, 364 day revolving credit agreement with a one year term out option. A one year term out option converts the outstanding borrowings, if any, under the credit agreement to a one year term loan upon expiration. The 4 year revolving credit agreement expires in October 2005. In October 2002, we renewed the 364 day revolving credit agreement which expires in October 2003, unless extended. There were no balances outstanding under either agreement at December 31, 2002. Under these agreements, at our option, we can borrow on either a competitive advance basis or a revolving credit basis. The revolving credit portion of both agreements bear interest at either a fixed rate or floating rate based on LIBOR plus a spread. The spread, which varies depending on our credit ratings, ranges from 80 to 125 basis points for our 4 year agreement, and 85 to 137.5 basis points for our 364 day agreement. We also pay an annual facility fee 40 Table of Contents regardless of utilization. This facility fee, currently 25 basis points, may fluctuate between 15 and 50 basis points, depending upon our credit ratings. The competitive advance portion of any borrowings under either credit agreement will bear interest at market rates prevailing at the time of borrowing on either a fixed rate or a floating rate basis, at our option. These credit agreements contain customary restrictive and financial covenants as well as customary events of default, including financial covenants regarding the maintenance of net worth, and minimum interest coverage and maximum leverage ratios. The terms of each of these credit agreements also include standard provisions related to conditions of borrowing, including a customary material adverse effect clause which could limit our ability to borrow. We have not experienced a material adverse effect and we know of no circumstances or events which would be reasonably likely to result in a material adverse effect. We do not believe the material adverse effect clause poses a material funding risk to Humana in the future. The minimum net worth requirement was $1,163.4 million at December 31, 2002 and increases by 50% of consolidated net income each quarter. The minimum interest coverage ratio is generally calculated by dividing interest expense into earnings before interest and tax expense, or EBIT. The maximum leverage ratio is generally calculated by dividing debt into earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, or EBITDA. EBIT and EBITDA used to calculate compliance with these financial covenants is based upon four consecutive quarters. The current minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.5, increases to 4.0 effective December 31, 2003. The current maximum leverage ratio of 2.75 declines to 2.5 effective December 31, 2003. At December 31, 2002, our net worth of $1,606.5 million, interest coverage ratio of 13.7, and leverage ratio of 1.7 were all in compliance with the applicable requirements. Additionally, we would have been in compliance assuming the more restrictive future financial covenant requirements were applicable at December 31, 2002. Commercial Paper Programs We maintain indirect access to the commercial paper market through our conduit commercial paper financing program. Under this program, a third party issues commercial paper and loans the proceeds of those issuances to us so that the interest and principal payments on the loans match those on the underlying commercial paper. The $265 million, 364 day revolving credit agreement supports the conduit commercial paper financing program of up to $265 million. The weighted average interest rate on our conduit commercial paper borrowings was 1.76% at December 31, 2002. The carrying value of these borrowings approximates fair value as the interest rate on the borrowings varies at market rates. We also maintain and may issue short term debt securities under a commercial paper program when market conditions allow. The program is backed by our credit agreements described above. Aggregate borrowing under both the credit agreements and commercial paper program cannot exceed $530 million. Other Borrowings Other borrowings of $5.5 million at December 31, 2002 represent financing for the renovation of a building, bear interest at 2% and are payable in various installments through 2014. Shelf Registration On October 8, 2002, we filed a universal shelf registration with the SEC to register debt or equity securities, from time to time, up to a total of $600 million, with the amount, price and terms to be determined at the time of the sale. Once it becomes effective, we will have the ability to use the net proceeds from any future sales of our securities for our operations and for other general corporate purposes, including repayment or refinancing of borrowings, working capital, capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions, or the repurchase of our outstanding securities. 41 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We are contractually obligated to make payments for years subsequent to December 31, 2002 as follows: Payments Due by Period Total 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years (in thousands) Debt $ 604,913 $ 265,623 $ 1,283 $ 335,482 $ 2,525 Operating leases 264,491 63,471 87,990 54,989 58,041 Total $ 869,404 $ 329,094 $ 89,273 $ 390,471 $ 60,566 Debt payments could be accelerated upon violation of debt covenants. We believe the likelihood of a debt covenant violation is remote. We lease facilities, computer hardware, and other equipment under long term operating leases that are noncancelable and expire on various dates through 2017. We sublease facilities or partial facilities to third party tenants for space not used in our operations which partially mitigates our operating lease commitments. An operating lease is a type of off balance sheet arrangement. Assuming we acquired the asset, rather than leased, we would have recognized a liability for the financing of these assets. See also Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. Our 5 year and 7 year airplane operating leases which are included above provide for a residual value guarantee of no more than $17.9 million at the end of the lease terms which expire December 29, 2004 for the 5 year leases and January 1, 2010 for the 7 year lease. We have the right to exercise a purchase option with respect to the leased equipment or the equipment can be sold to a third party. If we decide not to exercise our purchase option at the end of the lease, we must pay the lessor a maximum amount of $13.1 million related to the 5 year leases and $4.8 million related to the 7 year lease. The amount will be reduced by the net sales proceeds of the airplanes to a third party. A $3.5 million gain in connection with a 1999 sale/leaseback transaction is being deferred until the residual value guarantee is resolved at the end of the lease term. We do not believe that we will have any payment obligation at the end of the lease because we will exercise the purchase obligation, or the net proceeds from the sale of the airplanes will exceed the maximum amount payable to the lessor. We have $23.8 million in undrawn letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2002. Letters of credit totaling $10.9 million have been issued to ensure our payment to a beneficiary for assumed obligations of our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary related to pre 1993 professional liability risks for which the beneficiary remains directly liable. Other letters of credit totaling $12.9 million were issued to ensure our payment to various beneficiaries for miscellaneous contractual obligations. These letters of credit renew automatically on an annual basis unless the beneficiary otherwise notifies us. In February 2003, a $5.0 million letter of credit supporting miscellaneous contractual obligations of ours expired without renewal. Over the past 10 years, we have not had to fund any letters of credit. Through indemnity agreements approved by the state regulatory authorities, certain of our regulated subsidiaries generally are guaranteed by Humana Inc., our parent company, in the event of insolvency for (1) member coverage for which premium payment has been made prior to insolvency; (2) benefits for members then hospitalized until discharged; and (3) payment to providers for services rendered prior to insolvency. Other Liquidity Factors Our investment grade credit rating at December 31, 2002 was Baa3 according to Moodys Investors Services, Inc., or Moodys and BBB, according to Standard & Poors Corporation, or S&P. A downgrade to Ba2 or lower by Moodys and BB or lower by S&P would give the counterparty of one of our interest rate swap agreements with a $100 million notional amount, the right, but not the obligation, to cancel the interest rate swap agreement. If cancelled, we would pay or receive an amount based on the fair market value of the swap 42 Table of Contents agreement. Assuming this swap agreement had been cancelled on December 31, 2002, we would have received $34.9 million. Other than the swap agreement, adverse changes in our credit ratings will not create, increase, or accelerate any liabilities. Adverse changes in our credit rating will increase the rate of interest we pay and may impact the amount of credit available to us in the future. Related Parties No related party transactions had a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Certain immaterial related party transactions are discussed in our Proxy Statement for the meeting to be held May 15, 2003 see Certain Transactions with Management and Others. Regulatory Requirements Certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends, loans or other cash transfers to Humana Inc., our parent company, require minimum levels of equity, and limit investments to approved securities. The amount of dividends that may be paid to Humana Inc. by these subsidiaries, without prior approval by state regulatory authorities, is limited based on the entitys level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus. In most states, prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required. As of December 31, 2002, we maintained aggregate statutory capital and surplus of $1,006.9 million in our state regulated health insurance subsidiaries. Each of these subsidiaries was in compliance with applicable statutory requirements which aggregated $576.0 million. Although the minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume, product mix, and the quality of assets held, minimum requirements can vary significantly at the state level. Certain states rely on risk based capital requirements, or RBC, to define the required levels of equity. RBC is a model developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to monitor an entitys solvency. This calculation indicates recommended minimum levels of required capital and surplus and signals regulatory measures should actual surplus fall below these recommended levels. Some states are in the process of phasing in these RBC requirements over a number of years. If RBC were fully implemented by all states at December 31, 2002, each of our subsidiaries would be in compliance, and we would have $358.8 million of aggregate capital and surplus above the minimum level required under RBC. One TRICARE subsidiary under the Regions 3 and 4 contract with the Department of Defense is required to maintain current assets at least equivalent to its current liabilities. We were in compliance with this requirement at December 31, 2002. Future Liquidity Needs We believe that funds from future operating cash flows and funds available under our credit agreements and commercial paper program are sufficient to meet future liquidity needs. We also believe these sources of funds are adequate to allow us to fund selected expansion opportunities, as well as to fund capital requirements. Market Risk Sensitive Financial Instruments and Positions The level of our pretax earnings is subject to risk due to changes in investment income from our fixed income portfolio which is partially offset by both our debt position and the short term duration of the fixed income investment portfolio. We evaluated the impact on our investment income and debt expense resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100, 200 and 300 basis points over the next twelve month period, as reflected in the following table. The modeling technique used to calculate the pro forma net change considered the cash flows related to fixed income investments and debt, which are subject to interest rate changes during a prospective twelve month 43 Table of Contents period. This evaluation measures parallel shifts in interest rates and may not account for certain unpredictable events that may effect interest income, including, among others, unexpected changes of cash flow into and out of the portfolio, shifts in the asset mix between tax and tax exempt securities, and spread changes specific to various investment categories. In the past ten years, annual changes in 3 month LIBOR rates have exceeded 300 basis points twice, have not changed between 200 and 300 basis points and have changed between 100 and 200 basis points once. LIBOR was 1.38% at December 31, 2002. Our model assumed the maximum possible reduction in LIBOR could not exceed 138 basis points.

These publicly traded equity securities are held for purposes other than trading.

Government Contracts Our Medicare+Choice contracts with the federal government are renewed for a one year term each December 31 unless terminated 90 days prior thereto. Legislative proposals are being considered which may revise the Medicare+Choice programs current reimbursement rates. We are unable to predict the outcome of these proposals or the impact they may have on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. We currently are in negotiations with the Department of Defense to extend our TRICARE contracts that expire on April 30, 2003 for Regions 2 and 5 and June 30, 2003 for Regions 3 and 4. We believe we will be able to successfully extend our TRICARE contracts under substantially the same terms for one additional year plus a 44 Table of Contents one year renewal option which should continue our contracts through the new TRICARE Next Generation, or T Nex, transition described below. Historical pretax profit margins for our TRICARE business have generally ranged from 2 to 4 percent. We expect margins to continue in this range during 2003. The Department of Defense recently announced a plan to consolidate the total number of prime contracts from seven to three under the new T Nex program. The Department of Defense has stated that a bidder can be awarded only one prime contract, although a bidder would be allowed to secondarily participate in another contract. We submitted a bid in January 2003 to participate as a prime contractor for the South region. Additionally, we partnered with Aetna Government Health Plans, LLC, a subsidiary of Aetna, Inc. to participate as a subcontractor should Aetna Government Health Plans, LLC be awarded the North region. An announcement of the awards is expected in mid to late 2003 with transition to the new regions not expected until mid to late 2004. At this time we are unable to predict whether we will be awarded a contract, or the effective date of the contract. If we are a successful bidder on the South region, we do not expect a material change to our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, although TRICARE profits could decline slightly. TRICARE membership would not materially change from current levels. TRICARE revenues and expenses would decline by approximately 20% as a result of certain benefits, e.g. pharmacy, which are included under our current contract, being excluded and under separate T Nex contracts in the future. Effective July 1, 2002, we signed two contracts in Puerto Rico covering beneficiaries in two of the eight regions in Puerto Ricos Medicaid program, which represents 86% of our total Medicaid membership as of December 31, 2002. The term of each of these contracts is three years, subject to annual renewal options with the Health Insurance Administration in Puerto Rico. Our Medicaid contracts in Florida and Illinois generally are annual contracts. The loss of any of these government contracts or significant changes in these programs as a result of legislative action, including reductions in premium payments to us, or increases in member benefits without corresponding increases in premium payments to us, may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Legal Proceedings We are party to a variety of legal actions in the ordinary course of business, including employment matters, breach of contract actions, tort claims, and shareholder suits involving alleged securities fraud. A description of material legal actions in which we are currently involved is included under Legal Proceedings of Item 3 in Part 1. We cannot predict the outcome of these suits with certainty, and we are incurring expenses in defense of these matters. In addition, recent court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims. Therefore, these legal actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Cautionary Statements This document includes both historical and forward looking statements. The forward looking statements are made within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We intend such forward looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and we are including this statement for purposes of complying with these safe harbor provisions. We have based these forward looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events. These forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including, among other things, the information discussed below. In making these statements, we are not undertaking to address or update each factor in future filings or communications regarding our business or results. Our business is highly complicated, regulated and competitive with many different factors affecting results. 45 Table of Contents If the premiums we charge are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to our members, or if our estimates of medical claim reserves are inadequate, our profitability could decline. We use a significant portion of our revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to our members. These costs include claims payments, capitation payments, allocations of some centralized expenses and various other costs incurred to provide health insurance coverage to our members. These costs also include estimates of future payments to hospitals and others for medical care provided to our members. Generally, premiums in the health care business are fixed for one year periods. Accordingly, costs we incur in excess of our medical cost projections generally are not recovered in the contract year through higher premiums. We estimate the costs of our future medical claims and other expenses using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon claim payment patterns, medical inflation, historical developments, including claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns, and other relevant factors. We also record medical claims reserves for future payments. We continually review estimates of future payments relating to medical claims costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and make necessary adjustments to our reserves. However, increased utilization or unit cost, competition, government regulations and many other factors may and often do cause actual health care costs to exceed what was estimated and reflected in premiums. These factors may include: increased use of medical facilities and services, including prescription drugs; increased cost of such services; termination of capitation arrangements resulting in the transfer of membership to fee for service arrangements; changes or reductions of our utilization management functions such as preauthorization of services, concurrent review or requirements for physician referrals; catastrophes or epidemics; the introduction of new or costly treatments, including new technologies; medical cost inflation; new government mandated benefits or other regulatory changes; and increased use of health care, including doctors office visits and prescriptions resulting from terrorists attacks and subsequent terrorists threats, including bioterrorism. Failure to adequately price our products or estimate sufficient medical claim reserves may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. If we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives, our business could be materially adversely affected. Our future performance depends in large part upon our management teams ability to execute our strategy to position the company for the future. This strategy includes the growth of our Commercial segment business, introduction of new products and benefit designs, the successful implementation of our e business initiatives and the selection and adoption of new technologies. We believe that the adoption of new technologies will contribute toward a reduction in administrative costs as we more closely align our workforce with our membership. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our operational and strategic initiatives that are intended to position the company for future growth. Failure to implement this strategy may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 46 Table of Contents If we do not design and price our products properly and competitively, our membership and profitability could decline. We are in a highly competitive industry. Many of our competitors are more established in the health care industry and have a larger market share and greater financial resources than we do in some markets. In addition, other companies may enter our markets in the future. Contracts for the sale of commercial products are generally bid upon or renewed annually. While health plans compete on the basis of many factors, including service and the quality and depth of provider networks, we expect that price will continue to be a significant basis of competition. In addition to the challenge of controlling health care costs, we face competitive pressure to contain premium prices. Premium increases, introduction of new product designs, and our relationship with our providers in various markets, among others, could affect our membership levels. Other actions that could affect membership levels include the possible exit of Medicare+Choice service and the exit of commercial products in some markets. If we do not compete effectively in our markets, if membership does not increase as we expect, or if it declines, or if we lose accounts with favorable medical cost experience while retaining accounts with unfavorable medical cost experience, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. If we fail to manage prescription drug costs successfully, our financial results could suffer. In general, prescription drug costs have been rising over the past few years. These increases are due to the introduction of new drugs costing significantly more than existing drugs, direct consumer advertising by the pharmaceutical industry that creates consumer demand for particular brand name drugs, and members seeking medications to address lifestyle changes. In order to control prescription drug costs, we have implemented multi tiered copayment benefit designs for prescription drugs, including our four tiered copayment benefit design, Rx4. We are also evaluating other multi tiered designs. We cannot assure that these efforts will be successful in controlling costs. Failure to control these costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We are involved in various legal actions, which, if resolved unfavorably to us, could result in substantial monetary damages. We are a party to a variety of legal actions that affect our business, including employment and employment discrimination related suits, employee benefit claims, breach of contract actions, tort claims and shareholder suits involving alleged securities fraud. We and some of our competitors in the health benefits business are defendants in a number of purported class action lawsuits. These include separate suits against us and five of our competitors that purport to be brought on behalf of members of managed care plans, which we refer to as the subscriber track cases. In addition, there is a single action against us and eight of our competitors that purports to be brought on behalf of health care providers, which we refer to as the provider track case. These suits allege breaches of federal statutes, including ERISA and RICO. In addition, because of the nature of the health care business, we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations, including the design, management and offering of products and services. These include and could include in the future: claims relating to the denial of health care benefits; challenges to the use of some software products used in administering claims; medical malpractice actions; allegations of anti competitive and unfair business activities; 47 Table of Contents provider disputes over compensation and termination of provider contracts; disputes related to self funded business, including actions alleging claim administration errors; claims related to the failure to disclose some business practices; and claims relating to customer audits and contract performance. In some cases, substantial non economic or punitive damages as well as treble damages under the federal False Claims Act, RICO and other statutes may be sought. While we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities, other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance, insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded. In addition, some types of damages, like punitive damages, may not be covered by insurance, particularly in those jurisdictions in which coverage of punitive damages is prohibited. Insurance coverage for all or some forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future. A description of material legal actions in which we are currently involved is included under Legal Proceedings of Item 3 in Part I. We cannot predict the outcome of these suits with certainty, and we are incurring expenses in the defense of these matters. In addition, recent court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims. Therefore, these legal actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. As a government contractor, we are exposed to additional risks that could adversely affect our business or our willingness to participate in government health care programs. A significant portion of our revenues relates to federal, state and local government health care coverage programs, including the Medicare+Choice, Medicaid and TRICARE programs. These programs involve various risks, including: the possibility of reduced or insufficient government reimbursement in the future; the possibility that we will not be able to extend or renew any of the contracts relating to these programs. These contracts also are generally subject to frequent change, including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible to enroll, reduce the revenue we receive or increase our administrative or health care costs under those programs. We currently are in negotiations with the Department of Defense to extend our TRICARE contracts that expire on April 30, 2003 for Regions 2 and 5 and June 30, 2003 for Regions 3 and 4. We believe we will be able to successfully extend our TRICARE contracts under substantially the same terms for one additional year plus a one year renewal option which should continue our contracts through the new TRICARE Next Generation, or T Nex. In the event government reimbursement were to decline from projected amounts, our failure to reduce the health care costs associated with these programs could have a material adverse effect on our business. Changes to these government programs in the future may also affect our ability or willingness to participate in these programs. The loss of these contracts or significant changes in these programs as a result of legislative action, including reductions in payments or increases in benefits without corresponding increases in payments, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows; at December 31, 2002, under one of our CMS contracts, we provided health insurance coverage to approximately 228,400 members in Florida. This contract accounted for approximately 16% of our total premiums and ASO fees for the year ended December 31, 2002. The termination of this contract would likely have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows; higher comparative medical costs; 48 Table of Contents government regulatory and reporting requirements; higher marketing and advertising costs per member as a result of marketing to individuals as opposed to groups; the possibility of temporary or permanent suspension from participating in government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, if we are convicted of fraud or other criminal conduct in the performance of a health care program or if there is an adverse decision against us under the federal False Claims Act; and state budget constraints. Increased litigation and negative publicity could increase our cost of doing business. The managed care industry continues to receive significant negative publicity reflecting the public perception of the industry. This publicity and perception have been accompanied by increased litigation, including some large jury awards, legislative activity, regulation and governmental review of industry practices. These factors may adversely affect our ability to market our products or services, may require us to change our products or services, may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate and may require us to pay large judgments or fines. Any combination of these factors could further increase our cost of doing business and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Our industry is currently subject to substantial government regulation, which, along with possible increased governmental regulation or legislative reform, increases our costs of doing business and could adversely affect our profitability. The health care industry in general, and health management organizations, or HMOs, and preferred provider organizations, or PPOs, in particular, are subject to substantial federal and state government regulation, including: regulation relating to minimum net worth; licensing requirements; approval of policy language and benefits; mandated benefits and processes; provider compensation arrangements; member disclosure; premium rates; and periodic examinations by state and federal agencies. State regulations require our licensed, operating subsidiaries to maintain minimum net worth requirements and restrict some investment activities. Additionally, those regulations restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make dividend payments, loans, loan repayments or other payments to us. In recent years, significant federal and state legislation affecting our business has been enacted. State and federal governmental authorities are continually considering changes to laws and regulations applicable to us and are currently considering regulations relating to: mandatory benefits and products, including a Medicare pharmacy benefit or discount card; rules tightening time periods in which claims must be paid; patients bill of rights; 49 Table of Contents defining medical necessity; health insurance access; provider compensation and contract language; disclosure of provider fee schedules and other data impacting payments to providers; health plan liability to members who fail to receive appropriate care; disclosure and composition of physician networks; physicians ability to collectively negotiate contract terms with carriers, including fees; and mental health parity. All of these proposals could apply to us. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals or licenses or that legislative or regulatory changes will not have a material adverse effect on our business. Delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain required approvals, or moratoria imposed by regulatory authorities, could adversely affect our revenue or the number of our members, increase costs or adversely affect our ability to bring new products to market as forecasted. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or NAIC, has adopted risk based capital requirements, also known as RBC, which is subject to state by state adoption and to the extent implemented, sets minimum capitalization requirements for insurance and HMO companies. The NAIC recommendations for life insurance companies were adopted in all states and the prescribed calculation for HMOs has been adopted in most states in which we operate. The HMO rules may increase the minimum capital required for some of our subsidiaries. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, includes administrative provisions directed at simplifying electronic data interchange through standardizing transactions, establishing uniform health care provider, payer and employer identifiers and seeking protections for confidentiality and security of patient data. Under the new HIPAA standard transactions and code sets rules, we must make significant systems enhancements and invest in new technological solutions. The compliance date for standard transactions and code sets rules has been extended to October 17, 2003 based on our submission of a compliance plan, including work plan and implementation strategy to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Under the new HIPAA privacy rules, by April 14, 2003 we must comply with a variety of requirements concerning the use and disclosure of individuals protected health information, establish rigorous internal procedures to protect health information and enter into business associate contracts with those companies to whom protected health information is disclosed. Regulations issued in February 2003 set standards for the security of electronic health information requiring compliance by April 21, 2005. Violations of these rules will subject us to significant penalties. Compliance with HIPAA regulations requires significant systems enhancements, training and administrative effort. The final rules do not provide for complete federal preemption of state laws, but rather preempt all inconsistent state laws unless the state law is more stringent. HIPAA could also expose us to additional liability for violations by our business associates. Another area receiving increased focus in 2002 is the time in which various laws require the payment of health care claims. Many states already have legislation in place covering payment of claims within a specific number of days. However, due to provider groups advocating for laws or regulations establishing even stricter standards, procedures and penalties, we expect additional regulatory scrutiny and supplemental legislation with respect to claims payment practices. The provider sponsored bills are characterized by stiff penalties for late payment, including high interest rates payable to providers and costly fines levied by state insurance departments and attorneys general. This legislation and possible future regulation and oversight could expose our Company to additional liability and penalties. 50 Table of Contents On November 21, 2000, the Department of Labor published its final regulation on claims and appeals review procedures under ERISA. The claims procedure regulation applies to all employee benefit plans governed by ERISA, whether benefits are provided through insurance products or are self funded. As a result, the new claims and appeals review regulation impacts nearly all employer and union sponsored health and disability plans, except church and government plans. Similar to legislation recently passed by many states, the new ERISA claims and appeals procedures impose shorter and more detailed procedures for processing and reviewing claims and appeals. According to the Department of Labor, however, its ERISA claims and appeals regulation does not preempt state insurance and utilization review laws that impose different procedures or time lines, unless complying with the state law would make compliance with the new ERISA regulation impossible. Unlike its state counterparts, the ERISA claims and appeals rule does not provide for independent external review to decide disputed medical questions. Instead, the federal regulation will generally make it easier for claimants to avoid state mandated internal and external review processes and to file suit in federal court. The new ERISA claims and appeals rules generally became effective July 1, 2002 or the first day of the first plan year beginning after July 1, 2002, whichever is later. In any case, health plans must comply with the new rules with respect to all claims filed on or after January 1, 2003. We are also subject to various governmental audits and investigations. These can include audits and investigations by state attorneys general, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, the Office of the Inspector General of Health and Human Services, the Office of Personnel Management, the Department of Justice and state Departments of Insurance and Departments of Health. These activities could result in the loss of licensure or the right to participate in various programs, or the imposition of fines, penalties and other sanctions. In addition, disclosure of any adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could negatively affect our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services. If we fail to maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to our members, our business could be adversely affected. We contract with physicians, hospitals and other providers to deliver health care to our members. Our products encourage or require our customers to use these contracted providers. These providers may share medical cost risk with us or have financial incentives to deliver quality medical services in a cost effective manner. In any particular market, providers could refuse to contract with us, demand higher payments, or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs for us, less desirable products for customers and members or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. In some markets, some providers, particularly hospitals, physician/hospital organizations or multi specialty physician groups, may have significant market positions and negotiating power. In addition, physician or practice management companies, which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage, may, in some cases, compete directly with us. If these providers refuse to contract with us, use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be adversely affected. We currently are in negotiations with HCA Inc. regarding our contracts in Florida covering 30 hospitals, which expire on April 30, 2003. Although we have included estimated hospital rate increases in our Commercial premium rates and in our Medicare benefit designs, we are currently unable to predict the outcome of these negotiations, but believe such outcome will not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In some situations, we have contracts with individual or groups of primary care physicians for an actuarially determined, fixed, per member per month fee under which physicians are paid an amount to provide all required medical services to our members (i.e. capitation). The inability of providers to properly manage costs under these arrangements can result in the financial instability of these providers and the termination of their relationship 51 Table of Contents with us. In addition, payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members. The financial instability or failure of a primary care provider to pay other providers for services rendered could lead those other providers to demand payment from us, even though we have made our regular fixed payments to the primary provider. There can be no assurance that providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services, maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations. Our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries is restricted. Because we operate as a holding company, we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund the obligations of Humana Inc., the parent company. These subsidiaries generally are regulated by state departments of insurance. In most states, we are required to seek prior approval by these state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from these subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts, or, in some states, any amount. We are also required by law to maintain specific proscribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries. One TRICARE subsidiary under the Regions 3 and 4 contract with the Department of Defense is required to maintain assets at least equivalent to its current liabilities. In addition, we normally notify the state departments of insurance prior to making payments that do not require approval. ITEM 7a.

Introduction Headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, Humana Inc. is one of the nations largest publicly traded health benefits companies, based on our 2002 revenues of $11.3 billion. We offer coordinated health insurance coverage and related services through a variety of traditional and Internet based plans for employer groups, government sponsored programs, and individuals. As of December 31, 2002, we had approximately 6.6 million members in our medical insurance programs, as well as approximately 1.6 million members in our specialty products programs. We have approximately 425,000 contracts with physicians, hospitals, dentists and other providers to provide health care to our members. In 2002, approximately 70% of our premiums and administrative services fees resulted from members located in Florida, Illinois, Texas, Kentucky, and Ohio. We derived approximately 44% of our premiums and administrative services fees from contracts with the federal government in 2002. Under two federal government contracts with the Department of Defense, we provide health insurance coverage to TRICARE members, accounting for approximately 19% of our total premiums and administrative services fees in 2002. Under one federal government contract with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, we provide health insurance coverage to approximately 228,400 Medicare+Choice members in Florida, accounting for approximately 16% of our total premiums and administrative services fees in 2002. We manage our business with two segments: Commercial and Government. The Commercial segment consists of members enrolled in products marketed to employer groups and individuals, and includes three lines of business: fully insured medical, administrative services only, or ASO, and specialty. The Government segment consists of members enrolled in government sponsored programs, and includes three lines of business: Medicare+Choice, Medicaid, and TRICARE. We identified our segments in accordance with the aggregation provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information which is consistent with information used by our Chief Executive Officer in managing our business. The segment information aggregates products with similar economic characteristics. These characteristics include the nature of customer groups and pricing, benefits and underwriting requirements. The results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes. We allocate all selling, general and administrative expenses, investment and other income, interest expense, and goodwill, but no other assets or liabilities, to our segments. Members served by our two segments generally utilize the same medical provider networks, enabling us to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers. Our segments also share overhead costs and assets. As a result, the profitability of each segment is interdependent. Our business strategy centers on increasing Commercial segment profitability while maintaining our existing strength in the Government segment. Our strategy to increase Commercial segment profitability focuses 23 Table of Contents on providing solutions for employers to the rising cost of health care through the use of innovative and consumer centric product designs which are supported by service excellence and industry leading electronic capabilities, including education, tools and technologies provided primarily through the Internet. The intent of our Commercial segment strategy is to enable us to further penetrate high potential commercial markets and to transform the traditional consumer experience for both employers and members to result in a high degree of consumer satisfaction, loyalty and brand awareness. We are in the process of reducing our administrative cost structure primarily to support our Commercial strategy. Restructuring Charge During the fourth quarter of 2002, we finalized a plan to reduce our administrative cost structure with the consolidation of seven customer service centers into four and an enterprise wide workforce reduction. The following table presents the components of the restructuring charge we recorded for the year ended December 31, 2002: 2002 Charge Cash Payments Non cash Balance at December 31, 2002 Expected Future Cash Outlays (in thousands) Severance and related employee benefits $ 32,105 $ 910 $ $ 31,195 $ 31,195 Long lived asset impairment 2,448 2,448 Leased equipment discontinuance costs 1,324 1,324 1,324 Total restructuring charges $ 35,877 $ 910 $ 2,448 $ 32,519 $ 32,519 Severance During the fourth quarter of 2002, we recorded severance and related employee benefit costs of $32.1 million ($19.6 million after tax) in connection with customer service center consolidation and an enterprise wide workforce reduction. Severance costs were estimated based upon the provisions of the Companys existing employee benefit plans and policies. The plan to reduce our administrative cost structure is expected to affect approximately 2,600 positions throughout the entire organization including customer service, claim administrations, clinical operations, provider network administration, as well as other corporate and field based positions. As part of the plan, we expect to hire approximately 300 employees to support newly consolidated operations, thereby resulting in a net reduction of approximately 2,300 employees. As of December 31, 2002, approximately 500 positions had been eliminated. We expect the remaining positions to be eliminated by December 31, 2003, with most of the severance being paid in 2003. As a result of these actions, we expect a reduction in historical compensation expense will improve our pretax results by approximately $70 million ($43 million after tax) in 2003 and $110 million ($67 million after tax) annually thereafter and after tax cash flows from operating activities by approximately $13 million in 2003 including estimated severance payments of approximately $30 million and $65 million annually thereafter. Long lived Asset Impairment Our decision to eliminate three customer service centers prompted a review during the fourth quarter of 2002 for the possible impairment of long lived assets used in these operations. We will continue to use some long lived assets associated with these customer service center operations until mid 2003, the expected completion date for consolidating these operations. We are currently evaluating alternatives with respect to future use of these long lived assets, including possible sale. Our impairment review indicated that future estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to our business supported by our San Antonio, Texas customer service operations were insufficient to recover the carrying value 24 Table of Contents of certain long lived assets, primarily buildings used in these operations. Accordingly, we adjusted the carrying value of these long lived assets to their estimated fair value resulting in a non cash impairment charge of $2.4 million ($1.5 million after tax). Estimated fair value was based on an independent third party appraisal of the buildings. By the end of the first quarter of 2003, we expect the estimated future undiscounted cash flow attributable to our business supported by our Jacksonville, Florida customer service operations will be insufficient to recover the carrying value of additional long lived assets, primarily a building used in our Florida operations. Accordingly, we expect to record a non cash impairment charge of approximately $17.2 million ($10.5 million after tax) during the first quarter of 2003. Additionally, we expect to record a non cash impairment charge of approximately $13.5 million during the first quarter of 2003 ($8.3 million after tax) related to accelerated depreciation of software we will cease using with these operations. As a result of these actions, we expect a reduction in historical depreciation and rent expense will improve our pretax results by approximately $5 million ($3 million after tax) in 2003 and $6 million ($4 million after tax) annually thereafter. The impact on operating cash flows is not expected to be material. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. We continuously evaluate our estimates and those critical accounting policies related primarily to medical cost and revenue recognition as well as accounting for impairments related to our investment securities, goodwill, and long lived assets. These estimates are based on knowledge of current events and anticipated future events, and accordingly, actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Medical Cost Recognition Medical costs include claim payments, capitation payments, allocations of certain centralized expenses and various other costs incurred to provide health insurance coverage to members, as well as estimates of future payments to hospitals and others for medical care provided prior to the balance sheet date. Capitation payments represent monthly contractual fees disbursed to primary care physicians and other providers who are responsible for providing medical care to members. We estimate the costs of our future medical claims and other medical expense payments using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon claim payment patterns, medical cost inflation, historical developments such as claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns, and other relevant factors, and record medical claims reserves for future payments. We continually review estimates of future payments relating to medical claims costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and make necessary adjustments to our reserves. Medical cost inflation, among other items, may significantly impact our estimate of medical costs. Medical cost inflationary trends today are substantially higher than other segments of the economy. In the early 1990s employer driven migration to HMO enrollment was popular and resulted in several years of very low medical cost trends. Today, there are very few economic forces existing to mitigate increases in the utilization of hospital and physician services, prescription drugs and new medical technologies, and the inflationary trend on the cost per unit for each of these expense components. Additionally, as we are realigning our operating model around our commercial strategy, we continue to reduce the level of traditional utilization management functions such as pre authorization of services, monitoring of inpatient admissions and requirements for physician referrals. Other external factors such as government mandated benefits or other regulatory changes, catastrophes and epidemics may also impact cost trends. 25 Table of Contents Any of the items above, or other unforeseen circumstances, may result in actual medical cost trends differing materially from our estimates and a relatively small variance between our estimates of medical cost trends and actual trends could have a material impact, either favorable or unfavorable, on the adequacy of our medical claims reserves and our overall financial position. For example, a 100 basis point, or 1 percent, change in the estimate of our medical and other expenses payable at December 31, 2002, which represents 39% of total liabilities, would require an adjustment of $11.4 million in a future period in which the revision in the estimate becomes known. A 100 basis point change in estimated medical expense trends would have changed annual pretax results of our Commercial segment by $48.7 million and our Government segment by $42.7 million in 2002. Note 5 in our consolidated financial statements presents a reconciliation of beginning and ending balances for medical and other expenses payable. The table includes the changes in estimates of medical claims payable subsequently recorded to each year. A summary of these changes in estimates and percentage of beginning medical claim reserves follows: Year ended December 31, Amount Percentage of Beginning Reserves Percentage of Medical Expenses Variance (in millions) 2002 $ 12.3 1.1 % 0.1 % Unfavorable development 2001 $ 23.4 1.8 % 0.3 % Favorable development 2000 $ 8.5 0.6 % 0.1 % Favorable development Revenue Recognition We generally establish one year commercial membership contracts with employer groups, subject to cancellation by the employer groups written notice. Our TRICARE contracts with the federal government and our contracts with various state Medicaid programs are generally multi year contracts subject to annual renewal provisions. Our Medicare+Choice contracts with the federal government renew annually. We bill and collect premium and administrative fee remittances from employer groups and some individual Medicare+Choice members monthly. We receive monthly premiums and administrative fees from the federal government and various states according to government specified reimbursement rates and various contractual terms. Premium revenues are recognized as income in the period members are entitled to receive services, and are net of estimated uncollectible amounts and retroactive membership adjustments. Retroactive membership adjustments result from enrollment changes not yet processed, or not yet reported by an employer group or the government. We routinely monitor the collectibility of specific accounts, the aging of receivables, historical retroactivity trends, as well as prevailing and anticipated economic conditions, and any required adjustments are reflected in current operations. Administrative services only fees, or ASO, are earned as services are performed. Administrative services fees cover the processing of claims, offering access to our provider networks and clinical programs, and responding to customer service inquiries from members of self funded employers. Under ASO contracts, self funded employers and, for TRICARE ASO, the Department of Defense, retain the risk of financing the cost of health benefits. Premium and ASO receivables are shown net of allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts and retroactive membership adjustments. Premiums and ASO fees received prior to the period members are entitled to receive services are recorded as unearned revenues. 26 Table of Contents TRICARE Revenues Base premium revenues as originally specified in our TRICARE contracts are recognized ratably throughout each contract year as eligible beneficiaries are entitled to receive services. TRICARE revenues also include estimates for amounts recoverable from the federal government as a result of bid price adjustments, or BPAs, and change orders. Under our TRICARE contracts, we retain the financial risk of contractual discounts in the provider networks, same store utilization of services and administrative overhead. However, the federal government retains the financial risk associated with changes in usage levels at military treatment facilities, or MTF, changes in the number of persons eligible for TRICARE benefits and medical unit cost inflation. BPAs are utilized to retroactively adjust premium revenues for the impact of the items for which the federal government retains risk. We work closely with the federal government to obtain and review eligibility and MTF workload data, and to quantify and negotiate amounts recoverable or payable under our contractual BPA requirements. We record revenues applicable to BPAs when these amounts are determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured. Because final settlement of BPAs occurs only at specified intervals, typically in excess of 6 months after the end of a contract year for our largest regions, cumulative amounts receivable or payable under BPAs may be outstanding in excess of a year. Amounts receivable or payable within a year are classified as premiums receivable or trade accounts payable and accrued expenses, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets. Amounts receivable or payable for longer than one year are classified as other long term assets or other long term liabilities, respectively. As a result of the events of September 11, 2001, the subsequent build up of military personnel to support military operations in Afghanistan and the continuing build up of military personnel surrounding other international tensions, the magnitude of BPA activity is currently much more significant than in prior years. TRICARE change orders occur when we perform services or incur costs under the directive of the federal government that were not originally specified in our contracts. Under federal regulations we are entitled to an equitable adjustment to the contract price, which results in additional premium revenues. Examples of items that have necessitated substantial change orders in recent years include congressionally legislated increases in the level of benefits for TRICARE beneficiaries and the administration of new government programs such as TRICARE for Life and TRICARE Senior Pharmacy. Like BPAs, we record revenue applicable to change orders when these amounts are determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured. Unlike BPAs, where settlement only occurs at specified intervals, change orders may be negotiated and settled at any time throughout the year. Total TRICARE premium and ASO fee receivables at December 31, 2002 and 2001 are as follows: December 31, 2002 2001 (in thousands) TRICARE premiums receivable: Base receivable $ 190,339 $ 164,621 Bid price adjustments (BPAs) 104,044 Change orders 1,400 1,431 Subtotal 295,783 166,052 Less: long term portion of BPAs (86,471 ) Total TRICARE premiums receivable $ 209,312 $ 166,052 TRICARE ASO fees receivable: Base receivable $ 7,205 $ 2,142 Change orders 56,230 16,992 Total $ 63,435 $ 19,134 27 Table of Contents Our TRICARE contracts also contain risk sharing provisions with the federal government to minimize any losses and limit any profits in the event that medical costs for which we are at risk differ from the levels targeted in our contracts. Amounts receivable from the federal government under such risk sharing provisions are included in the BPA receivable above, while amounts payable to the federal government under these provisions of approximately $23 million are included in trade accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheets. Investment Securities Investment securities totaled $1,694.6 million, or 37% of total assets at December 31, 2002. Debt securities totaled $1,637.5 million, or 97% of our total investment portfolio. The average duration of our debt securities was approximately 3 years and more than 95% of our debt securities were of investment grade quality with an average of AA by Standard & Poors at December 31, 2002. Most of the debt securities that are below investment grade are rated at the higher end of the non investment grade spectrum. Our investment policy limits investments in a single issuer and requires diversification among various asset types. Our investment securities are categorized as available for sale and, as a result, are stated at fair value. Fair value of publicly traded debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices. Non traded debt securities are priced independently by a third party vendor. Fair value of strategic venture capital debt and equity securities that are privately held, or where an observable quoted market price does not exist, are estimated using a variety of valuation methodologies. Such methodologies include reviewing the value ascribed to the most recent financing, comparing the security with securities of publicly traded companies in a similar line of business, and reviewing the underlying financial performance including estimating discounted cash flows. Unrealized holding gains and losses, net of applicable deferred taxes, are included as a component of stockholders equity until realized from a sale or impairment. Gross unrealized losses totaled $12.6 million, or 0.7% of our total investment portfolio at December 31, 2002 compared to $19.5 million, or 1.2% at December 31, 2001. We had no material unrealized loss on any one individual investment security or within any one industry at December 31, 2002. We regularly evaluate our investment securities for impairment. We consider factors affecting the investee, factors affecting the industry the investee operates within, and general debt and equity market trends. We consider the length of time an investments fair value has been below carrying value, the near term prospects for recovery to carrying value and our intent and ability to hold the investment until maturity or market recovery is realized. If and when a determination is made that a decline in fair value below the cost basis is other than temporary, the related investment is written down to its estimated fair value through earnings. The risks inherent in assessing the impairment of an investment include the risk that market factors may differ from our expectations; facts and circumstances factored into our assessment may change with the passage of time; or we may decide to subsequently sell the investment. The determination of whether a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary requires us to exercise significant diligence and judgment. The discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments. The current economic environment and recent volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of determining fair value and assessing investment impairment. The same influences tend to increase the risk of potentially impaired assets. Gross realized losses in 2002 included impairment losses of $19.6 million related to privately held investment securities after an evaluation indicated that a decline in fair value below the cost basis was other than temporary. Goodwill and Long lived Asset At December 31, 2002, goodwill and other long lived assets represented 28% of total assets and 79% of total stockholders equity. 28 Table of Contents Goodwill is no longer amortized but must be tested at least annually for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as the reporting unit and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. A reporting unit is one level below our Commercial and Government segments. The Commercial segments two reporting units consist of fully and self insured medical and specialty. The Government segments three reporting units consist of Medicare+Choice, TRICARE and Medicaid. Goodwill was assigned to the reporting unit that was expected to benefit from a specific acquisition. If goodwill was expected to benefit multiple reporting units, we allocated goodwill in connection with our transitional impairment test as of January 1, 2002 based upon the reporting units relative fair value. This process resulted in the allocation of $633.2 million of goodwill to the Commercial segment and $143.7 million of goodwill to the Government segment. Our long range business plan and annual planning process supports our goodwill impairment tests. These tests are based primarily on an evaluation of future discounted cash flows under several scenarios. We used a range of discount rates that correspond to our weighted average cost of capital. Key assumptions including changes in membership, premium yields, medical cost trends and certain government contract extensions are consistent with those utilized in our long range business plan and annual planning process. If these assumptions differ from actual, the estimates underlying our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected. Long lived assets consist of property and equipment and other intangible assets. These assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life, and are subject to impairment reviews. We periodically review long lived assets whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. In assessing recoverability, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine if an impairment loss may exist, and, if so, estimate fair value. We also must estimate and make assumptions regarding the useful life we assign to our long lived assets. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment losses or change the useful life, including accelerating depreciation for these assets. In 2002, we recognized long lived asset impairment losses of $2.4 million as a result of our decision to eliminate three customer service centers. We expect to recognize additional long lived asset impairment losses of approximately $30.7 million in 2003 related to these service center consolidation initiatives. See Restructuring Charge section and Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. Recent Transactions Acquisitions On May 31, 2001, we acquired the outstanding shares of common stock of a newly formed Anthem Health Insurance Company subsidiary responsible for administering TRICARE benefits in Regions 2 and 5 for $43.5 million in cash, net of direct transaction costs. During 2000, in separate transactions, we acquired a Houston based health plan, two operating shell entities for future business initiatives, and a hospital in patient management services firm for $76.3 million in cash, net of direct transaction costs. We accounted for each of these acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting and accordingly, our consolidated results of operations include the results of the acquired businesses from the date of acquisition. For each acquisition, we allocated the purchase price to net tangible and other intangible assets based upon their fair values. Any remaining value not assigned to net tangible or other intangible assets was then allocated to goodwill. Other intangible assets primarily relate to government, subscriber and provider contracts and the cost of the acquired licenses. Goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in connection with the acquisitions were $44.8 million in 2001 and $52.1 million in 2000. The other intangible assets are being amortized over periods ranging from 2 to 20 years, with a weighted average life of 5.7 years. Unaudited pro forma results of operations information have not been presented because the effects of these acquisitions, individually or in the aggregate, were not significant to our results of operations or financial position. 29 Table of Contents Divestitures During 2000, we completed transactions to divest our workers compensation, north Florida Medicaid and Medicare supplement businesses. We estimated and recorded a $117.2 million loss in 1999 related to these divestitures. There was no subsequent change in the estimated loss. Divested assets, consisting primarily of investment securities and reinsurance recoverables, totaled $651.9 million. Divested liabilities, consisting primarily of workers compensation and other reserves, totaled $437.6 million. Cash proceeds received in 2000 were $97.1 million, net of direct transaction costs. Revenue associated with these businesses prior to divestiture for 2000 totaled $102.9 million or less than 1% of our consolidated 2000 revenues. Pretax losses totaled $8.4 million in 2000 related to these businesses. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements On January 1, 2003, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146, Accounting for Exit or Disposal Activities, or Statement 146. Statement 146 addresses the recognition, measurement, and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities, including certain lease termination costs and severance type costs under a one time benefit arrangement rather than an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract. Statement 146 requires liabilities associated with exit and disposal activities to be expensed as incurred and will impact the timing of recognition for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. The effect of the adoption is dependent on exit or disposal activities, if any, initiated after December 31, 2002. In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, an interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and Rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34, or FIN 45. Fin 45 requires that upon issuance of a guarantee, the entity must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee. FIN 45 requires disclosure about each guarantee even if the likelihood of the guarantors having to make any payments under the guarantee is remote. The provisions for initial recognition and measurement are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees that are issued or modified after December 31, 2002. We do not expect the adoption of the recognition provision of FIN 45 will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The disclosure provisions of FIN 45 are effective for our December 31, 2002 financial statements. See Liquidity section and Note 12 in our consolidated financial statements for guarantee disclosures. In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB 51, or FIN 46. The primary objectives of FIN 46 are to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting right (variable interest entities, or VIEs) and how to determine when and which business enterprise should consolidate the VIE (the primary beneficiary). The provisions of FIN 46 are effective immediately for VIEs created after January 31, 2003 and no later than July 1, 2003 for VIEs created before February 1, 2003. In addition, FIN 46 requires that both the primary beneficiary and all other enterprises with a significant variable interest make additional disclosure in filings issued after January 31, 2003. The adoption of FIN 46 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In January 2003, the FASB issued Statement No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, or Statement 148. This Statement amends FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, Statement 148 amends the disclosure requirements of Statement 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. See Notes 2 and 9 in our consolidated financial statements for our stock option 30 Table of Contents accounting policy and required disclosures. As now required by Statement 148, these disclosures will be updated each reporting period beginning with the first quarter of 2003. Comparison of Results of Operations for 2002 and 2001 The following table presents certain financial data for our two segments: For the year ended December 31, 2002 2001 (in thousands, except ratios) Premium revenues: Fully insured $ 5,499,033 $ 4,941,888 Specialty 337,295 304,714 Total Commercial 5,836,328 5,246,602 Medicare+Choice 2,629,597 2,909,478 TRICARE 2,001,474 1,341,557 Medicaid 462,998 441,324 Total Government 5,094,069 4,692,359 Total $ 10,930,397 $ 9,938,961 Administrative services fees: Commercial $ 103,203 $ 84,204 Government 141,193 52,886 Total $ 244,396 $ 137,090 Medical expense ratios: Commercial 83.5 % 83.1 % Government 83.8 % 83.6 % Total 83.6 % 83.3 % SG&A expense ratios: Commercial 17.5 % 17.6 % Government 13.3 % 12.8 % Total 15.6 % 15.3 % Income (loss) before income taxes: Commercial $ (15,174 ) $ (2,013 ) Government 225,108 185,093 Total $ 209,934 $ 183,080 31 Table of Contents The following table presents our medical membership at December 31, 2002 and 2001: December 31, Change 2002 2001 Members Percentage Commercial segment medical members: Fully insured 2,340,300 2,301,300 39,000 1.7 % ASO 652,200 592,500 59,700 10.1 % Total Commercial 2,992,500 2,893,800 98,700 3.4 % Government segment medical members: Medicare+Choice 344,100 393,900 (49,800 ) (12.6 )% Medicaid 506,000 490,800 15,200 3.1 % TRICARE 1,755,800 1,714,600 41,200 2.4 % TRICARE ASO 1,048,700 942,700 106,000 11.2 % Total Government 3,654,600 3,542,000 112,600 3.2 % Total medical membership 6,647,100 6,435,800 211,300 3.3 % Overview Net income was $142.8 million, or $0.85 per diluted share in 2002, compared to net income of $117.2 million, or $0.70 per diluted share in 2001. The increase in earnings resulted primarily from premium revenues increasing more than operating costs in both our Commercial and Government segments and the non amortization of goodwill partially offset by the fourth quarter 2002 restructuring charge. Premium Revenues and Medical Membership Premium revenues increased 10.1% to $10.9 billion for 2002, compared to $9.9 billion for 2001. Higher premium revenues resulted primarily from significant commercial premium yields and an increase in TRICARE premiums. Premium yield represents the percentage increase in the average premium per member over the comparable period in the prior year. Items impacting premium yield include changes in premium rates, changes in government reimbursement rates, changes in geographic mix of membership, and changes in the mix of benefit plans selected by our membership. Commercial segment premium revenues increased 11.5% to $5.8 billion for 2002, compared to $5.2 billion for 2001. This increase resulted primarily from premium yields in the 12% to 14% range for 2002 on our fully insured commercial business. Additionally, our fully insured commercial medical membership increased 1.7% or 39,000 members, to 2,340,300 at December 31, 2002 compared to 2,301,300 at December 31, 2001. We have been pricing 2003 premiums using the assumption that medical cost trends will accelerate slightly and accordingly, anticipate 2003 Commercial premium yields in the 13% to 15% range. During 2003, we anticipate an increase in our fully insured commercial and administrative services (discussed below) medical membership of approximately 4% to 5%. Government segment premium revenues increased 8.5% to $5.1 billion for 2002, compared to $4.7 billion for 2001. This increase was primarily attributable to our TRICARE business, partially offset by a reduction in our Medicare+Choice membership. TRICARE premium revenues were $2.0 billion, an increase of $660 million, or 49.2% compared to 2001. $334 million of the increase in TRICARE premium revenues is attributable to the acquisition of Regions 2 and 5 on May 31, 2001, with the remainder of the increase attributable to the annual increase in our contractually determined base revenues and increases in premium revenues recorded as a result of bid price adjustments, or BPAs, and change orders. 32 Table of Contents Increasing premium revenues recorded in connection with BPAs resulted from an increase in the number of eligible TRICARE beneficiaries and a decrease in the use of military treatment facilities, or MTFs, by TRICARE beneficiaries. The number of TRICARE beneficiaries has increased as a result of the events of September 11, 2001, the subsequent build up of military personnel to support military operations in Afghanistan and the continuing build up of military personnel surrounding other international tensions. A decline in the usage of MTFs occurred for some periods after September 11, 2001 when certain MTFs were restricted by the Department of Defense resulting in a greater use of our provider network by retired military personnel and the dependents of both active duty and retired military personnel. Increasing premium revenues recorded in connection with change orders primarily resulted from expanded benefits for TRICARE beneficiaries as mandated by Congress which includes, among other items, a reduction of beneficiary out of pocket maximum cost and the elimination of certain copayments. Collectively, all of these actions resulted in higher medical expenses during 2002. Since these actions were not originally specified in our contracts, we were entitled to equitable revenue adjustments via the change order and bid price adjustment process. We recognized revenues related to these adjustments when the settlement amount became determinable and the collectibility was reasonably assured. Medicare+Choice premium revenues were $2.6 billion in 2002, a decrease of 9.6% from $2.9 billion in 2001. Medicare+Choice membership was 344,100 at December 31, 2002, compared to 393,900 at December 31, 2001, a decline of 49,800 members, or 12.6%. Premium yield was 5.6% for 2002. The decrease in membership was due to our exit of various counties on January 1, 2002, as well as attrition of some members selecting other plans in certain markets as a result of annual changes to benefit designs. Effective January 1, 2003, we exited several counties in some of our markets, affecting approximately 10,000 members. We expect that by the end of 2003 Medicare+Choice membership will be approximately 325,000 to 330,000 members. Administrative Services Fees Administrative services fees for 2002 were $244.4 million, an increase of $107.3 million from $137.1 million for 2001. For the Commercial segment, administrative services fees increased $19.0 million, or 22.6%, to $103.2 million. This increase corresponds to the higher level of ASO membership at December 31, 2002, which was 652,200 members, compared to 592,500 members at December 31, 2001 and also reflects an increase in the average fees received per member. Administrative services fees for the Government segment increased $88.3 million when comparing 2002 to 2001. $51 million of this increase was due to the TRICARE Regions 2 and 5 acquisition, with the remainder attributable to the implementation of the TRICARE for Life benefits program effective October 1, 2001. TRICARE for Life is a program for seniors where we provide medical benefit administrative services. Investment and Other Income Investment and other income totaled $86.4 million in 2002, a decrease of $32.4 million from $118.8 million in 2001. Net realized losses of $10.1 million in 2002 compared to net realized gains of $13.9 million in 2001. Net realized losses in 2002 included impairment losses of $19.6 million related to privately held venture capital investment securities after an evaluation indicated that a decline in fair value below the cost basis was other than temporary. Lower interest rates also decreased investment income $10.9 million in 2002 compared to 2001. The average yield on investment securities was 4.6% in 2002, declining from 5.1% in 2001. Medical Expense Total medical expenses as a percentage of premium revenues, or medical expense ratio, for 2002 was 83.6%, increasing 30 basis points from 83.3% for 2001. The Commercial segment medical expense ratio for 2002 was 83.5%, increasing 40 basis points from 83.1% for 2001. This increase primarily was due to the shift in the mix of our fully insured commercial medical 33 Table of Contents membership to a heavier concentration of larger group sizes. Large group commercial membership represents approximately 65% of our fully insured commercial membership at December 31, 2002 compared to 62% at December 31, 2001. Large group membership traditionally experiences a higher medical expense ratio and a lower selling, general and administrative expense ratio than does our small group membership. The Government segment medical expense ratio for 2002 was 83.8%, increasing 20 basis points from 83.6% for 2001. This increase primarily was attributable to TRICARE. As discussed previously, TRICARE medical expense increased due to expanded benefits for TRICARE beneficiaries mandated by Congress, an increase in eligible beneficiaries, and an increase in the use of Humanas provider network rather than military treatment facilities. Since these actions were not originally specified in our contracts or were for items that the Department of Defense retains financial risk, we were entitled to equitable revenue adjustments through the change order and bid price adjustment processes. These higher medical expenses combined with the associated higher premium revenues resulted in an overall increase in the Government medical expense ratio. SG&A Expense Total selling, general and administrative, or SG&A, expenses as a percentage of premium revenues and administrative services fees, or SG&A expense ratio, for 2002 was 15.6%, increasing 30 basis points from 15.3% for 2001. During the fourth quarter of 2002, we recorded $30.1 million of administrative expenses for a contingent contractual provider dispute and other items associated with our 1997 acquisition of Physician Corporation of America, or PCA. Of the total $30.1 million of administrative expenses, which amounts to a 30 basis point increase in the 2002 SG&A expense ratio, $28.4 million impacted our Commercial segment and $1.7 million impacted our Government segment. The Commercial segments SG&A expense ratio was 17.5% for 2002, decreasing 10 basis points from 2001 of 17.6%. The PCA items discussed above accounted for a 30 basis point increase in this ratio. The remaining 40 basis point decline in the SG&A ratio was driven primarily by the changing mix of members towards more larger group members and reductions in the number of our employees due to operational efficiencies gained from streamlining various processes through technology and other initiatives. Costs to distribute and administer our products to large group members are lower than that of small group members. The Government segments SG&A expense ratio was 13.3% for 2002, increasing 50 basis points compared to 12.8% in 2001. This increase resulted from a higher proportion of revenues generated from administrative services fees, primarily from the TRICARE Regions 2 and 5 acquisition and the implementation of the TRICARE for Life benefit programs effective October 1, 2001, as discussed above. ASO business carries a much higher SG&A ratio than fully insured business. We expect our total SG&A expense ratio to decline by approximately 80 basis points in 2003 due to our plan to realign our operating model around our commercial strategy and reductions in our administrative cost structure, including the consolidation of seven customer service centers into four and an enterprise wide workforce reduction. Depreciation and amortization was $120.7 million in 2002, a decrease of $40.8 million, or 25.3%, from $161.5 million in 2001. On a comparable basis, depreciation and amortization was $106.5 in 2001, excluding goodwill amortization expense. The $14.2 million increase in 2002 compared to 2001, as adjusted, results from capital expenditures primarily related to our technology initiatives and the TRICARE acquisition of Regions 2 and 5 on May 31, 2001. Interest Expense Interest expense was $17.3 million in 2002, a decrease of $8.0 million from $25.3 million in 2001. This decrease primarily resulted from lower interest rates. 34 Table of Contents Income Taxes Our effective tax rate in 2002 of 32% decreased 4% compared to the 36% effective tax rate in 2001. The lower effective tax rate in 2002 primarily resulted from the cessation of non deductible goodwill amortization on January 1, 2002, partially offset by higher state income taxes and a lower proportion of tax exempt investment income to pretax income. In addition, during 2002, the Internal Revenue Service completed their audit of all open years prior to 2000 which resulted in a favorable adjustment to the estimated accrual for income taxes of approximately $32.6 million. This was offset by an increase of approximately $24.5 million in the capital loss valuation allowance after we reevaluated probable capital gain realization in the allowable carryforward period based upon our capital gain experience beginning in 2000 and consideration of alternative tax planning strategies. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for a complete reconciliation to the federal statutory rate. We expect the effective tax rate for 2003 to increase to approximately 36% as a result of a lower proportion of tax exempt investment income to pretax income and because we are not currently anticipating any favorable adjustments resulting from the completion of any IRS tax examinations during 2003. Comparison of Results of Operations for 2001 and 2000 The following table presents certain financial data for our two segments: For the year ended December 31, 2001 2000 (in thousands, except ratios) Premium revenues: Fully insured $ 4,941,888 $ 5,263,602 Specialty 304,714 291,315 Total Commercial 5,246,602 5,554,917 Medicare+Choice 2,909,478 3,286,351 TRICARE 1,341,557 892,375 Medicaid 441,324 660,988 Total Government 4,692,359 4,839,714 Total $ 9,938,961 $ 10,394,631 Administrative services fees: Commercial $ 84,204 $ 86,298 Government 52,886 Total $ 137,090 $ 86,298 Medical expense ratios: Commercial 83.1 % 83.6 % Government 83.6 % 85.5 % Total 83.3 % 84.5 % SG&A expense ratios: Commercial 17.6 % 17.2 % Government 12.8 % 11.5 % Total 15.3 % 14.5 % Income (loss) before income taxes: Commercial $ (2,013 ) $ (7,954 ) Government 185,093 121,944 Total $ 183,080 $ 113,990 35 Table of Contents The following table presents our medical membership at December 31, 2001 and 2000: December 31, Change 2001 2000 Members Percentage Commercial segment medical members: Fully insured 2,301,300 2,545,800 (244,500 ) (9.6 )% ASO 592,500 612,800 (20,300 ) (3.3 )% Total Commercial 2,893,800 3,158,600 (264,800 ) (8.4 )% Government segment medical members: Medicare+Choice 393,900 494,200 (100,300 ) (20.3 )% Medicaid 490,800 575,600 (84,800 ) (14.7 )% TRICARE 1,714,600 1,070,300 644,300 60.2 % TRICARE ASO 942,700 942,700 100.0 % Total Government 3,542,000 2,140,100 1,401,900 65.5 % Total medical membership 6,435,800 5,298,700 1,137,100 21.5 % Overview Net income was $117.2 million, or $0.70 per diluted share in 2001, compared to net income of $90.1 million, or $0.54 per diluted share in 2000. This increase in earnings occurred despite an increase in our effective income tax rate from 21% in 2000 to 36% in 2001. The earnings increase resulted primarily from significant Medicare+Choice benefit reductions, improvements in determining appropriate premiums for our fully insured commercial medical membership (a process we refer to as pricing discipline) and divestitures of those products and markets that either lacked the prospect for long term profitability or no longer fit our strategic focus. Premium Revenues and Medical Membership Premium revenues decreased 4.4% to $9.9 billion for 2001, compared to $10.4 billion for 2000. This decrease was due to medical membership reductions from exiting numerous markets and products, partially offset by higher premium revenues from our TRICARE acquisition on May 31, 2001, and premium yields in our commercial and Medicare+Choice products. Commercial segment premium revenues decreased 5.6% to $5.2 billion for 2001, compared to $5.6 billion for 2000. This decrease was due to membership reductions partially offset by premium yields on our fully insured commercial business. Our fully insured commercial medical membership decreased 9.6% or 244,500 members, to 2,301,300 at December 31, 2001 compared to 2,545,800 at December 31, 2000, as we continued to focus on opportunities that satisfy our pricing criteria, and exit non core businesses. Government segment premium revenues decreased 3.0% to $4.7 billion for 2001, compared to $4.8 billion for 2000. This decrease was primarily attributable to reductions in our Medicare+Choice and Medicaid membership partially offset by higher Medicare+Choice premium yield in 2001, and higher premium revenues from our TRICARE acquisition on May 31, 2001. Medicare+Choice membership was 393,900 at December 31, 2001 compared to 494,200 at December 31, 2000, a decline of 100,300 members, or 20.3%. This decline in membership primarily was attributable to the exits from 45 Medicare counties on January 1, 2001. Medicaid membership was 490,800 at December 31, 2001 compared to 575,600 at December 31, 2000, a decline of 84,800 members. This decline resulted primarily from the divestiture of our north Florida, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Austin, San Antonio and Houston, Texas Medicaid businesses. For 2001, TRICARE premiums were $1.3 billion compared to $892.4 million for 2000, an increase of $449.2 million. Fully insured TRICARE membership increased by 644,300 members, or 60.2%, to 1,714,600 at December 31, 2001 compared to 1,070,300 at December 31, 2000 due to the TRICARE Regions 2 and 5 acquisition on May 31, 2001. This acquisition increased TRICARE fully insured medical members by approximately 648,000 members. 36 Table of Contents Administrative Services Fees Administrative services fees for 2001 were $137.1 million, an increase of $50.8 million from $86.3 million for 2000. This increase primarily was due to the TRICARE Regions 2 and 5 acquisition, and servicing medical benefits in an administrative capacity under a new TRICARE program for seniors, called TRICARE for Life, which began October 1, 2001. Investment and Other Income Investment and other income totaled $118.8 million in 2001, an increase of $3.8 million from $115.0 million in 2000. The increased investment and other income resulted from higher average invested balances partially offset by lower interest rates. Medical Expense Total medical expenses as a percentage of premium revenues, or medical expense ratio, for 2001 was 83.3%, decreasing 120 basis points from 84.5% for 2000. The improvement in the medical expense ratio primarily was due to significant benefit reductions in our Medicare+Choice product effective January 1, 2001, continued discipline in commercial pricing, and the exit of numerous higher cost markets and products during 2000. The Commercial segment medical expense ratio for 2001 was 83.1%, decreasing 50 basis points from 83.6% for 2000. The improvement in our Commercial medical expense ratio resulted primarily from exercising pricing discipline in our fully insured accounts. The Government segment medical expense ratio for 2001 was 83.6%, decreasing 190 basis points from 85.5% for 2000. This improvement primarily resulted from exiting 45 non core counties in our Medicare+Choice business with higher medical expense ratios on January 1, 2001, coupled with significant benefit design changes which also became effective on that date. SG&A Expense Total selling, general and administrative, or SG&A, expenses as a percentage of premium revenues and administrative services fees, or SG&A expense ratio, for 2001 was 15.3%, increasing 80 basis points from 14.5% in 2000. Similar increases occurred in the SG&A expense ratios of our Commercial and Government segments as indicated in the preceding table. These increases resulted from an increase in the mix of ASO membership, primarily from the TRICARE acquisition, and planned spending on infrastructure and technology initiatives. Depreciation and amortization was $161.5 million in 2001, an increase of $15.0 million, or 10.2%, from $146.5 million in 2000. This increase was the result of increased capital expenditures primarily related to our technology initiatives and the TRICARE acquisition on May 31, 2001. Interest Expense Interest expense was $25.3 million in 2001, a decrease of $3.3 million from $28.6 million in 2000. This decline was attributable to the impact from lower interest rates that were offset by higher average daily outstanding borrowings. A greater proportion of total debt outstanding during 2001 resulted from borrowings under our credit agreement, and later in the year under the 5 year senior notes issued in August 2001. These borrowings have longer maturities than borrowings under our commercial paper program, resulting in higher daily average outstanding borrowings in 2001 compared to 2000. As a result of this changing debt mix, daily cash in excess of our funding requirements was invested, causing higher average invested balances described above. 37 Table of Contents Income Taxes Our effective tax rate in 2001 was approximately 36% compared to a 21% effective tax rate in 2000. The lower effective tax rate in 2000 was the result of recognizing the benefit of capital loss carryforwards resulting from the sale of our workers compensation business. Liquidity The following table presents operating cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, excluding the effects of the timing of the Medicare+Choice premium receipts: For the years ended, 2002 2001 (in thousands) Cash flows provided by operating activities $ 321,408 $ 148,958 Timing of Medicare+Choice premium receipts 10,873 16,815 Normalized cash flows provided by operating activities $ 332,281 $ 165,773 The Medicare+Choice premium receipt is payable to us on the first day of each month. When the first day of a month falls on a weekend or holiday, we receive this payment at the end of the previous month. This receipt is significant, the timing of which can cause material fluctuation in operating cash flows. Normalized operating cash flows assume these monthly receipts were received in the month in which they are applicable, providing a better comparison. Normalized operating cash flows were $332.3 million in 2002, compared to $165.8 million in 2001, an increase of $166.5 million. This increase primarily was attributable to higher net income and an increase in medical and other expenses payable partially offset by higher TRICARE receivables. Medical and other expenses payable increased $55.7 million during 2002, primarily as a result of membership growth, the timing of our payment to our third party pharmacy benefit administrator, and increases in medical claims trend partially offset by a reduction in unprocessed claim inventories and a decrease in claim receipt cycle time. Medical and other expenses payable declined $179.5 million during 2001 due to reductions in both unprocessed claim inventories on hand and membership levels. Throughout 2001, and to a lesser extent during 2002, we reduced the level of unprocessed claim inventories, a direct result of our focused effort to improve service and operational efficiencies. The pace of claim inventory reduction slowed during 2002 to $33.1 million compared to $132.0 million for 2001. The following table presents the estimated valuation and number of unprocessed claims on hand. Claims on hand represent the estimated number of provider requests for reimbursement that have been received but not yet processed. Estimated Valuation Claims On Hand Number of Days Claims On hand (in thousands) December 31, 2000 $ 257,400 1,157,900 11.0 December 31, 2001 $ 125,400 518,100 5.0 December 31, 2002 $ 92,300 424,200 4.1 38 Table of Contents Total net premium and ASO receivables increased to $416.9 million, or 27.8%, during 2002 primarily related to TRICARE, as presented in the following table: December 31, Change 2002 2001 Dollars Percentage (in thousands) TRICARE: Base receivable $ 197,544 $ 166,763 $ 30,781 18.5 % Bid price adjustments (BPAs) 104,044 104,044 100.0 % Change orders 57,630 18,423 39,207 212.8 % 359,218 185,186 174,032 94.0 % Less: long term portion of BPAs (86,471 ) (86,471 ) 100.0 % TRICARE subtotal 272,747 185,186 87,561 47.3 % Commercial and other 174,309 179,621 (5,312 ) (3.0 )% Allowance for doubtful accounts (30,178 ) (38,539 ) 8,361 (21.7 )% Total net receivables $ 416,878 $ 326,268 $ 90,610 27.8 % TRICARE receivables increased primarily due to change orders and bid price adjustments previously discussed. We collect the TRICARE base receivables monthly in the ordinary course of business. The timing of BPA collections occurs at contractually specified intervals, typically in excess of 6 months after the end of a contract year for our largest regions. We classified a portion of the total BPA receivables associated with our Regions 3 and 4 TRICARE contract as long term because the federal government is not obligated to pay us the amounts until January 2004. We also have a BPA amount payable within one year under the Regions 3 and 4 contract of approximately $23 million at December 31, 2002, which is classified in trade accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheets. Change orders may be negotiated and settled at any time throughout the year. We expect to collect the change order receivable balance of $57.6 million no later than the second quarter of 2003. Due to the build up of military personnel and other items previously discussed, we expect TRICARE receivables to increase from the $359 million level at December 31, 2002 to a range of $415 million to $465 million at December 31, 2003. The allowance for doubtful accounts of $30.2 million at December 31, 2002, which relates entirely to commercial and other receivables, decreased from $38.5 million at December 31, 2001. This decline resulted from a reduction in past due accounts, improved collections and operating efficiencies related to the billing and enrollment system. Capital Expenditures Our ongoing capital expenditures relate primarily to our technology initiatives and administrative facilities necessary for activities such as claims processing, billing and collections, medical utilization review and customer service. Total capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, were $112.1 million in 2002, $115.5 million in 2001, and $135.1 million in 2000. Excluding acquisitions, we expect our total capital expenditures in 2003 to be approximately $105 million, most of which will be used for our technology initiatives and improvement of administrative facilities. Stock Repurchase Plan In July 2002, the Board of Directors authorized the use of up to $100 million in total for the repurchase of our common shares. The shares may be purchased from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market, by block purchases, or in privately negotiated transactions. We have engaged Lehman Brothers Inc. and Banc of America Securities, LLC to broker these transactions. As of December 31, 2002, we had purchased 6.4 million shares for an aggregate purchase price of $74.0 million, or $11.56 per share. Since December 31, 2002 and 39 Table of Contents through February 26, 2003, we had purchased 2.2 million more shares for an aggregate purchase price of $20.8 million, or $9.31 per share. The total remaining share repurchase authorization as of February 26, 2003 was $5.2 million. Debt The following table presents our short term and long term debt outstanding at December 31, 2002 and 2001: December 31, 2002 2001 (in thousands) Short term debt: Conduit commercial paper financing program $ 265,000 $ 263,000 Long term debt: Senior notes $ 334,368 $ 309,789 Other long term borrowings 5,545 5,700 Total long term debt $ 339,913 $ 315,489 Senior Notes The $300 million 7% senior, unsecured notes are due August 1, 2006. In order to hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of our $300 million 7% senior notes attributable to fluctuations in interest rates, we entered into interest rate swap agreements. Interest rate swap agreements, which are considered derivatives, are contracts that exchange interest payments on a specified principal amount, or notional amount, for a specified period. Our interest rate swap agreements exchange the 7% fixed interest rate under our senior notes for a variable interest rate, which was 3.06% at December 31, 2002. The $300 million swap agreements mature on August 1, 2006, and have the same critical terms as our senior notes. Changes in the fair value of the 7% senior notes and the swap agreements due to changing interest rates are assumed to offset each other completely, resulting in no impact to earnings from hedge ineffectiveness. Our swap agreements are recognized in our consolidated balance sheet at fair value with an equal and offsetting adjustment to the carrying value of our senior notes. The fair value of our swap agreements are estimated based on quoted market prices of comparable agreements and reflects the amounts we would receive (or pay) to terminate the agreements at the reporting date. At December 31, 2002, the $34.9 million fair value of our swap agreements is included in other long term assets. Likewise, the carrying value of our senior notes has been increased $34.9 million to its fair value. The counterparties to our swap agreements are major financial institutions with which we also have other financial relationships. Credit Agreements We maintain two unsecured revolving credit agreements consisting of a $265 million, 4 year revolving credit agreement and a $265 million, 364 day revolving credit agreement with a one year term out option. A one year term out option converts the outstanding borrowings, if any, under the credit agreement to a one year term loan upon expiration. The 4 year revolving credit agreement expires in October 2005. In October 2002, we renewed the 364 day revolving credit agreement which expires in October 2003, unless extended. There were no balances outstanding under either agreement at December 31, 2002. Under these agreements, at our option, we can borrow on either a competitive advance basis or a revolving credit basis. The revolving credit portion of both agreements bear interest at either a fixed rate or floating rate based on LIBOR plus a spread. The spread, which varies depending on our credit ratings, ranges from 80 to 125 basis points for our 4 year agreement, and 85 to 137.5 basis points for our 364 day agreement. We also pay an annual facility fee 40 Table of Contents regardless of utilization. This facility fee, currently 25 basis points, may fluctuate between 15 and 50 basis points, depending upon our credit ratings. The competitive advance portion of any borrowings under either credit agreement will bear interest at market rates prevailing at the time of borrowing on either a fixed rate or a floating rate basis, at our option. These credit agreements contain customary restrictive and financial covenants as well as customary events of default, including financial covenants regarding the maintenance of net worth, and minimum interest coverage and maximum leverage ratios. The terms of each of these credit agreements also include standard provisions related to conditions of borrowing, including a customary material adverse effect clause which could limit our ability to borrow. We have not experienced a material adverse effect and we know of no circumstances or events which would be reasonably likely to result in a material adverse effect. We do not believe the material adverse effect clause poses a material funding risk to Humana in the future. The minimum net worth requirement was $1,163.4 million at December 31, 2002 and increases by 50% of consolidated net income each quarter. The minimum interest coverage ratio is generally calculated by dividing interest expense into earnings before interest and tax expense, or EBIT. The maximum leverage ratio is generally calculated by dividing debt into earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, or EBITDA. EBIT and EBITDA used to calculate compliance with these financial covenants is based upon four consecutive quarters. The current minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.5, increases to 4.0 effective December 31, 2003. The current maximum leverage ratio of 2.75 declines to 2.5 effective December 31, 2003. At December 31, 2002, our net worth of $1,606.5 million, interest coverage ratio of 13.7, and leverage ratio of 1.7 were all in compliance with the applicable requirements. Additionally, we would have been in compliance assuming the more restrictive future financial covenant requirements were applicable at December 31, 2002. Commercial Paper Programs We maintain indirect access to the commercial paper market through our conduit commercial paper financing program. Under this program, a third party issues commercial paper and loans the proceeds of those issuances to us so that the interest and principal payments on the loans match those on the underlying commercial paper. The $265 million, 364 day revolving credit agreement supports the conduit commercial paper financing program of up to $265 million. The weighted average interest rate on our conduit commercial paper borrowings was 1.76% at December 31, 2002. The carrying value of these borrowings approximates fair value as the interest rate on the borrowings varies at market rates. We also maintain and may issue short term debt securities under a commercial paper program when market conditions allow. The program is backed by our credit agreements described above. Aggregate borrowing under both the credit agreements and commercial paper program cannot exceed $530 million. Other Borrowings Other borrowings of $5.5 million at December 31, 2002 represent financing for the renovation of a building, bear interest at 2% and are payable in various installments through 2014. Shelf Registration On October 8, 2002, we filed a universal shelf registration with the SEC to register debt or equity securities, from time to time, up to a total of $600 million, with the amount, price and terms to be determined at the time of the sale. Once it becomes effective, we will have the ability to use the net proceeds from any future sales of our securities for our operations and for other general corporate purposes, including repayment or refinancing of borrowings, working capital, capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions, or the repurchase of our outstanding securities. 41 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We are contractually obligated to make payments for years subsequent to December 31, 2002 as follows: Payments Due by Period Total 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years (in thousands) Debt $ 604,913 $ 265,623 $ 1,283 $ 335,482 $ 2,525 Operating leases 264,491 63,471 87,990 54,989 58,041 Total $ 869,404 $ 329,094 $ 89,273 $ 390,471 $ 60,566 Debt payments could be accelerated upon violation of debt covenants. We believe the likelihood of a debt covenant violation is remote. We lease facilities, computer hardware, and other equipment under long term operating leases that are noncancelable and expire on various dates through 2017. We sublease facilities or partial facilities to third party tenants for space not used in our operations which partially mitigates our operating lease commitments. An operating lease is a type of off balance sheet arrangement. Assuming we acquired the asset, rather than leased, we would have recognized a liability for the financing of these assets. See also Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. Our 5 year and 7 year airplane operating leases which are included above provide for a residual value guarantee of no more than $17.9 million at the end of the lease terms which expire December 29, 2004 for the 5 year leases and January 1, 2010 for the 7 year lease. We have the right to exercise a purchase option with respect to the leased equipment or the equipment can be sold to a third party. If we decide not to exercise our purchase option at the end of the lease, we must pay the lessor a maximum amount of $13.1 million related to the 5 year leases and $4.8 million related to the 7 year lease. The amount will be reduced by the net sales proceeds of the airplanes to a third party. A $3.5 million gain in connection with a 1999 sale/leaseback transaction is being deferred until the residual value guarantee is resolved at the end of the lease term. We do not believe that we will have any payment obligation at the end of the lease because we will exercise the purchase obligation, or the net proceeds from the sale of the airplanes will exceed the maximum amount payable to the lessor. We have $23.8 million in undrawn letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2002. Letters of credit totaling $10.9 million have been issued to ensure our payment to a beneficiary for assumed obligations of our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary related to pre 1993 professional liability risks for which the beneficiary remains directly liable. Other letters of credit totaling $12.9 million were issued to ensure our payment to various beneficiaries for miscellaneous contractual obligations. These letters of credit renew automatically on an annual basis unless the beneficiary otherwise notifies us. In February 2003, a $5.0 million letter of credit supporting miscellaneous contractual obligations of ours expired without renewal. Over the past 10 years, we have not had to fund any letters of credit. Through indemnity agreements approved by the state regulatory authorities, certain of our regulated subsidiaries generally are guaranteed by Humana Inc., our parent company, in the event of insolvency for (1) member coverage for which premium payment has been made prior to insolvency; (2) benefits for members then hospitalized until discharged; and (3) payment to providers for services rendered prior to insolvency. Other Liquidity Factors Our investment grade credit rating at December 31, 2002 was Baa3 according to Moodys Investors Services, Inc., or Moodys and BBB, according to Standard & Poors Corporation, or S&P. A downgrade to Ba2 or lower by Moodys and BB or lower by S&P would give the counterparty of one of our interest rate swap agreements with a $100 million notional amount, the right, but not the obligation, to cancel the interest rate swap agreement. If cancelled, we would pay or receive an amount based on the fair market value of the swap 42 Table of Contents agreement. Assuming this swap agreement had been cancelled on December 31, 2002, we would have received $34.9 million. Other than the swap agreement, adverse changes in our credit ratings will not create, increase, or accelerate any liabilities. Adverse changes in our credit rating will increase the rate of interest we pay and may impact the amount of credit available to us in the future. Related Parties No related party transactions had a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Certain immaterial related party transactions are discussed in our Proxy Statement for the meeting to be held May 15, 2003 see Certain Transactions with Management and Others. Regulatory Requirements Certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends, loans or other cash transfers to Humana Inc., our parent company, require minimum levels of equity, and limit investments to approved securities. The amount of dividends that may be paid to Humana Inc. by these subsidiaries, without prior approval by state regulatory authorities, is limited based on the entitys level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus. In most states, prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required. As of December 31, 2002, we maintained aggregate statutory capital and surplus of $1,006.9 million in our state regulated health insurance subsidiaries. Each of these subsidiaries was in compliance with applicable statutory requirements which aggregated $576.0 million. Although the minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume, product mix, and the quality of assets held, minimum requirements can vary significantly at the state level. Certain states rely on risk based capital requirements, or RBC, to define the required levels of equity. RBC is a model developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to monitor an entitys solvency. This calculation indicates recommended minimum levels of required capital and surplus and signals regulatory measures should actual surplus fall below these recommended levels. Some states are in the process of phasing in these RBC requirements over a number of years. If RBC were fully implemented by all states at December 31, 2002, each of our subsidiaries would be in compliance, and we would have $358.8 million of aggregate capital and surplus above the minimum level required under RBC. One TRICARE subsidiary under the Regions 3 and 4 contract with the Department of Defense is required to maintain current assets at least equivalent to its current liabilities. We were in compliance with this requirement at December 31, 2002. Future Liquidity Needs We believe that funds from future operating cash flows and funds available under our credit agreements and commercial paper program are sufficient to meet future liquidity needs. We also believe these sources of funds are adequate to allow us to fund selected expansion opportunities, as well as to fund capital requirements. Market Risk Sensitive Financial Instruments and Positions The level of our pretax earnings is subject to risk due to changes in investment income from our fixed income portfolio which is partially offset by both our debt position and the short term duration of the fixed income investment portfolio. We evaluated the impact on our investment income and debt expense resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100, 200 and 300 basis points over the next twelve month period, as reflected in the following table. The modeling technique used to calculate the pro forma net change considered the cash flows related to fixed income investments and debt, which are subject to interest rate changes during a prospective twelve month 43 Table of Contents period. This evaluation measures parallel shifts in interest rates and may not account for certain unpredictable events that may effect interest income, including, among others, unexpected changes of cash flow into and out of the portfolio, shifts in the asset mix between tax and tax exempt securities, and spread changes specific to various investment categories. In the past ten years, annual changes in 3 month LIBOR rates have exceeded 300 basis points twice, have not changed between 200 and 300 basis points and have changed between 100 and 200 basis points once. LIBOR was 1.38% at December 31, 2002. Our model assumed the maximum possible reduction in LIBOR could not exceed 138 basis points.

These publicly traded equity securities are held for purposes other than trading.

Government Contracts Our Medicare+Choice contracts with the federal government are renewed for a one year term each December 31 unless terminated 90 days prior thereto. Legislative proposals are being considered which may revise the Medicare+Choice programs current reimbursement rates. We are unable to predict the outcome of these proposals or the impact they may have on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. We currently are in negotiations with the Department of Defense to extend our TRICARE contracts that expire on April 30, 2003 for Regions 2 and 5 and June 30, 2003 for Regions 3 and 4. We believe we will be able to successfully extend our TRICARE contracts under substantially the same terms for one additional year plus a 44 Table of Contents one year renewal option which should continue our contracts through the new TRICARE Next Generation, or T Nex, transition described below. Historical pretax profit margins for our TRICARE business have generally ranged from 2 to 4 percent. We expect margins to continue in this range during 2003. The Department of Defense recently announced a plan to consolidate the total number of prime contracts from seven to three under the new T Nex program. The Department of Defense has stated that a bidder can be awarded only one prime contract, although a bidder would be allowed to secondarily participate in another contract. We submitted a bid in January 2003 to participate as a prime contractor for the South region. Additionally, we partnered with Aetna Government Health Plans, LLC, a subsidiary of Aetna, Inc. to participate as a subcontractor should Aetna Government Health Plans, LLC be awarded the North region. An announcement of the awards is expected in mid to late 2003 with transition to the new regions not expected until mid to late 2004. At this time we are unable to predict whether we will be awarded a contract, or the effective date of the contract. If we are a successful bidder on the South region, we do not expect a material change to our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, although TRICARE profits could decline slightly. TRICARE membership would not materially change from current levels. TRICARE revenues and expenses would decline by approximately 20% as a result of certain benefits, e.g. pharmacy, which are included under our current contract, being excluded and under separate T Nex contracts in the future. Effective July 1, 2002, we signed two contracts in Puerto Rico covering beneficiaries in two of the eight regions in Puerto Ricos Medicaid program, which represents 86% of our total Medicaid membership as of December 31, 2002. The term of each of these contracts is three years, subject to annual renewal options with the Health Insurance Administration in Puerto Rico. Our Medicaid contracts in Florida and Illinois generally are annual contracts. The loss of any of these government contracts or significant changes in these programs as a result of legislative action, including reductions in premium payments to us, or increases in member benefits without corresponding increases in premium payments to us, may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Legal Proceedings We are party to a variety of legal actions in the ordinary course of business, including employment matters, breach of contract actions, tort claims, and shareholder suits involving alleged securities fraud. A description of material legal actions in which we are currently involved is included under Legal Proceedings of Item 3 in Part 1. We cannot predict the outcome of these suits with certainty, and we are incurring expenses in defense of these matters. In addition, recent court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims. Therefore, these legal actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Cautionary Statements This document includes both historical and forward looking statements. The forward looking statements are made within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We intend such forward looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and we are including this statement for purposes of complying with these safe harbor provisions. We have based these forward looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events. These forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including, among other things, the information discussed below. In making these statements, we are not undertaking to address or update each factor in future filings or communications regarding our business or results. Our business is highly complicated, regulated and competitive with many different factors affecting results. 45 Table of Contents If the premiums we charge are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to our members, or if our estimates of medical claim reserves are inadequate, our profitability could decline. We use a significant portion of our revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to our members. These costs include claims payments, capitation payments, allocations of some centralized expenses and various other costs incurred to provide health insurance coverage to our members. These costs also include estimates of future payments to hospitals and others for medical care provided to our members. Generally, premiums in the health care business are fixed for one year periods. Accordingly, costs we incur in excess of our medical cost projections generally are not recovered in the contract year through higher premiums. We estimate the costs of our future medical claims and other expenses using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon claim payment patterns, medical inflation, historical developments, including claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns, and other relevant factors. We also record medical claims reserves for future payments. We continually review estimates of future payments relating to medical claims costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and make necessary adjustments to our reserves. However, increased utilization or unit cost, competition, government regulations and many other factors may and often do cause actual health care costs to exceed what was estimated and reflected in premiums. These factors may include: increased use of medical facilities and services, including prescription drugs; increased cost of such services; termination of capitation arrangements resulting in the transfer of membership to fee for service arrangements; changes or reductions of our utilization management functions such as preauthorization of services, concurrent review or requirements for physician referrals; catastrophes or epidemics; the introduction of new or costly treatments, including new technologies; medical cost inflation; new government mandated benefits or other regulatory changes; and increased use of health care, including doctors office visits and prescriptions resulting from terrorists attacks and subsequent terrorists threats, including bioterrorism. Failure to adequately price our products or estimate sufficient medical claim reserves may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. If we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives, our business could be materially adversely affected. Our future performance depends in large part upon our management teams ability to execute our strategy to position the company for the future. This strategy includes the growth of our Commercial segment business, introduction of new products and benefit designs, the successful implementation of our e business initiatives and the selection and adoption of new technologies. We believe that the adoption of new technologies will contribute toward a reduction in administrative costs as we more closely align our workforce with our membership. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our operational and strategic initiatives that are intended to position the company for future growth. Failure to implement this strategy may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 46 Table of Contents If we do not design and price our products properly and competitively, our membership and profitability could decline. We are in a highly competitive industry. Many of our competitors are more established in the health care industry and have a larger market share and greater financial resources than we do in some markets. In addition, other companies may enter our markets in the future. Contracts for the sale of commercial products are generally bid upon or renewed annually. While health plans compete on the basis of many factors, including service and the quality and depth of provider networks, we expect that price will continue to be a significant basis of competition. In addition to the challenge of controlling health care costs, we face competitive pressure to contain premium prices. Premium increases, introduction of new product designs, and our relationship with our providers in various markets, among others, could affect our membership levels. Other actions that could affect membership levels include the possible exit of Medicare+Choice service and the exit of commercial products in some markets. If we do not compete effectively in our markets, if membership does not increase as we expect, or if it declines, or if we lose accounts with favorable medical cost experience while retaining accounts with unfavorable medical cost experience, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. If we fail to manage prescription drug costs successfully, our financial results could suffer. In general, prescription drug costs have been rising over the past few years. These increases are due to the introduction of new drugs costing significantly more than existing drugs, direct consumer advertising by the pharmaceutical industry that creates consumer demand for particular brand name drugs, and members seeking medications to address lifestyle changes. In order to control prescription drug costs, we have implemented multi tiered copayment benefit designs for prescription drugs, including our four tiered copayment benefit design, Rx4. We are also evaluating other multi tiered designs. We cannot assure that these efforts will be successful in controlling costs. Failure to control these costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We are involved in various legal actions, which, if resolved unfavorably to us, could result in substantial monetary damages. We are a party to a variety of legal actions that affect our business, including employment and employment discrimination related suits, employee benefit claims, breach of contract actions, tort claims and shareholder suits involving alleged securities fraud. We and some of our competitors in the health benefits business are defendants in a number of purported class action lawsuits. These include separate suits against us and five of our competitors that purport to be brought on behalf of members of managed care plans, which we refer to as the subscriber track cases. In addition, there is a single action against us and eight of our competitors that purports to be brought on behalf of health care providers, which we refer to as the provider track case. These suits allege breaches of federal statutes, including ERISA and RICO. In addition, because of the nature of the health care business, we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations, including the design, management and offering of products and services. These include and could include in the future: claims relating to the denial of health care benefits; challenges to the use of some software products used in administering claims; medical malpractice actions; allegations of anti competitive and unfair business activities; 47 Table of Contents provider disputes over compensation and termination of provider contracts; disputes related to self funded business, including actions alleging claim administration errors; claims related to the failure to disclose some business practices; and claims relating to customer audits and contract performance. In some cases, substantial non economic or punitive damages as well as treble damages under the federal False Claims Act, RICO and other statutes may be sought. While we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities, other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance, insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded. In addition, some types of damages, like punitive damages, may not be covered by insurance, particularly in those jurisdictions in which coverage of punitive damages is prohibited. Insurance coverage for all or some forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future. A description of material legal actions in which we are currently involved is included under Legal Proceedings of Item 3 in Part I. We cannot predict the outcome of these suits with certainty, and we are incurring expenses in the defense of these matters. In addition, recent court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims. Therefore, these legal actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. As a government contractor, we are exposed to additional risks that could adversely affect our business or our willingness to participate in government health care programs. A significant portion of our revenues relates to federal, state and local government health care coverage programs, including the Medicare+Choice, Medicaid and TRICARE programs. These programs involve various risks, including: the possibility of reduced or insufficient government reimbursement in the future; the possibility that we will not be able to extend or renew any of the contracts relating to these programs. These contracts also are generally subject to frequent change, including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible to enroll, reduce the revenue we receive or increase our administrative or health care costs under those programs. We currently are in negotiations with the Department of Defense to extend our TRICARE contracts that expire on April 30, 2003 for Regions 2 and 5 and June 30, 2003 for Regions 3 and 4. We believe we will be able to successfully extend our TRICARE contracts under substantially the same terms for one additional year plus a one year renewal option which should continue our contracts through the new TRICARE Next Generation, or T Nex. In the event government reimbursement were to decline from projected amounts, our failure to reduce the health care costs associated with these programs could have a material adverse effect on our business. Changes to these government programs in the future may also affect our ability or willingness to participate in these programs. The loss of these contracts or significant changes in these programs as a result of legislative action, including reductions in payments or increases in benefits without corresponding increases in payments, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows; at December 31, 2002, under one of our CMS contracts, we provided health insurance coverage to approximately 228,400 members in Florida. This contract accounted for approximately 16% of our total premiums and ASO fees for the year ended December 31, 2002. The termination of this contract would likely have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows; higher comparative medical costs; 48 Table of Contents government regulatory and reporting requirements; higher marketing and advertising costs per member as a result of marketing to individuals as opposed to groups; the possibility of temporary or permanent suspension from participating in government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, if we are convicted of fraud or other criminal conduct in the performance of a health care program or if there is an adverse decision against us under the federal False Claims Act; and state budget constraints. Increased litigation and negative publicity could increase our cost of doing business. The managed care industry continues to receive significant negative publicity reflecting the public perception of the industry. This publicity and perception have been accompanied by increased litigation, including some large jury awards, legislative activity, regulation and governmental review of industry practices. These factors may adversely affect our ability to market our products or services, may require us to change our products or services, may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate and may require us to pay large judgments or fines. Any combination of these factors could further increase our cost of doing business and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Our industry is currently subject to substantial government regulation, which, along with possible increased governmental regulation or legislative reform, increases our costs of doing business and could adversely affect our profitability. The health care industry in general, and health management organizations, or HMOs, and preferred provider organizations, or PPOs, in particular, are subject to substantial federal and state government regulation, including: regulation relating to minimum net worth; licensing requirements; approval of policy language and benefits; mandated benefits and processes; provider compensation arrangements; member disclosure; premium rates; and periodic examinations by state and federal agencies. State regulations require our licensed, operating subsidiaries to maintain minimum net worth requirements and restrict some investment activities. Additionally, those regulations restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make dividend payments, loans, loan repayments or other payments to us. In recent years, significant federal and state legislation affecting our business has been enacted. State and federal governmental authorities are continually considering changes to laws and regulations applicable to us and are currently considering regulations relating to: mandatory benefits and products, including a Medicare pharmacy benefit or discount card; rules tightening time periods in which claims must be paid; patients bill of rights; 49 Table of Contents defining medical necessity; health insurance access; provider compensation and contract language; disclosure of provider fee schedules and other data impacting payments to providers; health plan liability to members who fail to receive appropriate care; disclosure and composition of physician networks; physicians ability to collectively negotiate contract terms with carriers, including fees; and mental health parity. All of these proposals could apply to us. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals or licenses or that legislative or regulatory changes will not have a material adverse effect on our business. Delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain required approvals, or moratoria imposed by regulatory authorities, could adversely affect our revenue or the number of our members, increase costs or adversely affect our ability to bring new products to market as forecasted. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or NAIC, has adopted risk based capital requirements, also known as RBC, which is subject to state by state adoption and to the extent implemented, sets minimum capitalization requirements for insurance and HMO companies. The NAIC recommendations for life insurance companies were adopted in all states and the prescribed calculation for HMOs has been adopted in most states in which we operate. The HMO rules may increase the minimum capital required for some of our subsidiaries. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, includes administrative provisions directed at simplifying electronic data interchange through standardizing transactions, establishing uniform health care provider, payer and employer identifiers and seeking protections for confidentiality and security of patient data. Under the new HIPAA standard transactions and code sets rules, we must make significant systems enhancements and invest in new technological solutions. The compliance date for standard transactions and code sets rules has been extended to October 17, 2003 based on our submission of a compliance plan, including work plan and implementation strategy to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Under the new HIPAA privacy rules, by April 14, 2003 we must comply with a variety of requirements concerning the use and disclosure of individuals protected health information, establish rigorous internal procedures to protect health information and enter into business associate contracts with those companies to whom protected health information is disclosed. Regulations issued in February 2003 set standards for the security of electronic health information requiring compliance by April 21, 2005. Violations of these rules will subject us to significant penalties. Compliance with HIPAA regulations requires significant systems enhancements, training and administrative effort. The final rules do not provide for complete federal preemption of state laws, but rather preempt all inconsistent state laws unless the state law is more stringent. HIPAA could also expose us to additional liability for violations by our business associates. Another area receiving increased focus in 2002 is the time in which various laws require the payment of health care claims. Many states already have legislation in place covering payment of claims within a specific number of days. However, due to provider groups advocating for laws or regulations establishing even stricter standards, procedures and penalties, we expect additional regulatory scrutiny and supplemental legislation with respect to claims payment practices. The provider sponsored bills are characterized by stiff penalties for late payment, including high interest rates payable to providers and costly fines levied by state insurance departments and attorneys general. This legislation and possible future regulation and oversight could expose our Company to additional liability and penalties. 50 Table of Contents On November 21, 2000, the Department of Labor published its final regulation on claims and appeals review procedures under ERISA. The claims procedure regulation applies to all employee benefit plans governed by ERISA, whether benefits are provided through insurance products or are self funded. As a result, the new claims and appeals review regulation impacts nearly all employer and union sponsored health and disability plans, except church and government plans. Similar to legislation recently passed by many states, the new ERISA claims and appeals procedures impose shorter and more detailed procedures for processing and reviewing claims and appeals. According to the Department of Labor, however, its ERISA claims and appeals regulation does not preempt state insurance and utilization review laws that impose different procedures or time lines, unless complying with the state law would make compliance with the new ERISA regulation impossible. Unlike its state counterparts, the ERISA claims and appeals rule does not provide for independent external review to decide disputed medical questions. Instead, the federal regulation will generally make it easier for claimants to avoid state mandated internal and external review processes and to file suit in federal court. The new ERISA claims and appeals rules generally became effective July 1, 2002 or the first day of the first plan year beginning after July 1, 2002, whichever is later. In any case, health plans must comply with the new rules with respect to all claims filed on or after January 1, 2003. We are also subject to various governmental audits and investigations. These can include audits and investigations by state attorneys general, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, the Office of the Inspector General of Health and Human Services, the Office of Personnel Management, the Department of Justice and state Departments of Insurance and Departments of Health. These activities could result in the loss of licensure or the right to participate in various programs, or the imposition of fines, penalties and other sanctions. In addition, disclosure of any adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could negatively affect our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services. If we fail to maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to our members, our business could be adversely affected. We contract with physicians, hospitals and other providers to deliver health care to our members. Our products encourage or require our customers to use these contracted providers. These providers may share medical cost risk with us or have financial incentives to deliver quality medical services in a cost effective manner. In any particular market, providers could refuse to contract with us, demand higher payments, or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs for us, less desirable products for customers and members or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. In some markets, some providers, particularly hospitals, physician/hospital organizations or multi specialty physician groups, may have significant market positions and negotiating power. In addition, physician or practice management companies, which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage, may, in some cases, compete directly with us. If these providers refuse to contract with us, use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be adversely affected. We currently are in negotiations with HCA Inc. regarding our contracts in Florida covering 30 hospitals, which expire on April 30, 2003. Although we have included estimated hospital rate increases in our Commercial premium rates and in our Medicare benefit designs, we are currently unable to predict the outcome of these negotiations, but believe such outcome will not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In some situations, we have contracts with individual or groups of primary care physicians for an actuarially determined, fixed, per member per month fee under which physicians are paid an amount to provide all required medical services to our members (i.e. capitation). The inability of providers to properly manage costs under these arrangements can result in the financial instability of these providers and the termination of their relationship 51 Table of Contents with us. In addition, payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members. The financial instability or failure of a primary care provider to pay other providers for services rendered could lead those other providers to demand payment from us, even though we have made our regular fixed payments to the primary provider. There can be no assurance that providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services, maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations. Our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries is restricted. Because we operate as a holding company, we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund the obligations of Humana Inc., the parent company. These subsidiaries generally are regulated by state departments of insurance. In most states, we are required to seek prior approval by these state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from these subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts, or, in some states, any amount. We are also required by law to maintain specific proscribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries. One TRICARE subsidiary under the Regions 3 and 4 contract with the Department of Defense is required to maintain assets at least equivalent to its current liabilities. In addition, we normally notify the state departments of insurance prior to making payments that do not require approval. ITEM 7a.
