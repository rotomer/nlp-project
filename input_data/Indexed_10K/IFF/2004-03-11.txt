ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS) ORGANIZATION OF INFORMATION Managements Discussion and Analysis provides a narrative on the Companys operating performance, financial condition and liquidity and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements. It includes the following sections: o EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW o SALES COMMENTARY o OPERATING RESULTS o ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES o RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES o FINANCIAL CONDITION o MARKET RISK o CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND USE OF ESTIMATES o NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS o NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES o CAUTIONARY STATEMENT UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW The Company is a leading creator and manufacturer of flavor and fragrance compounds used to impart or improve the flavor or fragrance in a wide variety of consumer products. The precise size of the global market for flavors and fragrances is difficult to determine because the industry is highly fragmented, both geographically and along product lines; there are few publicly traded companies in the industry, limiting publicly available data; certain customers maintain in house capabilities fulfilling at least a portion of their flavor or fragrance needs; and the quality and depth of market information in developing regions of the world is limited. However, analysts generally estimate the flavor and fragrance market to be $11 $12 billion of which IFF represents 16%; the Companys nearest sized competitor is of similar size. The five largest companies in the industry represent 60 65% of the global market. Fragrance compounds are used in perfumes, cosmetics, toiletries, hair care products, deodorants, soaps, detergents and softeners as well as air care products. Major fragrance customers include the cosmetics industry, including perfume and toiletries manufacturers, and the household products industry, including manufacturers of soaps, detergents, household cleaners and air fresheners. Flavor products are sold to the food and beverage industries for use in consumer products such as prepared foods, beverages, dairy food and confectionery products. The Company is also a leading manufacturer of synthetic ingredients used in making fragrances. Approximately 50% of the Companys ingredient production is consumed internally; the balance of production is sold to third party customers. Changing social habits resulting from such factors as increases in personal income and dual earner households, leisure time, health concerns, urbanization and population growth stimulate demand for consumer products utilizing flavors and fragrances. These developments expand the market for products with finer fragrance quality, as well as the market for colognes and toiletries. Such developments also stimulate demand for convenience foods, soft drinks and low cholesterol and low fat food products that must conform to expected tastes. These developments necessitate the creation and development of flavors and fragrances and ingredients that are compatible with newly introduced materials and methods of application used in consumer products. 15 Flavors and fragrances are generally: o created for the exclusive use of a specific customer; o sold in solid or liquid form, in amounts ranging from a few kilograms to many tons depending on the nature of the end product in which they are used; o a small percentage of the volume and cost of the end product sold to the consumer; and o a major factor in consumer selection and acceptance of the product. Flavors and fragrances have similar economic and operational characteristics, including research and development, the nature of the creative and production processes, the manner in which products are distributed and the type of customer; many customers purchase both flavors and fragrances from the Company. A breakdown of sales by principal product category is depicted in the following graph. 2003 Sales by Category [GRAPH OMITTED] Ingredients 13% Fruit 5% Flavor compounds 40% Fine fragrance and toiletries 15% Functional fragrances 27% The Companys five largest customers comprise 29% of consolidated sales and its top thirty customers 53% of sales; these sales percentages have been fairly constant for several years. A key factor for success is inclusion on major customers core supplier lists opening opportunities to win new business. The Company is currently on the majority of core supplier lists of its major customers. The flavor and fragrance industry is impacted by macroeconomic factors in all product categories and geographic regions. In addition, pricing pressure placed on the Companys customers by large and powerful retailers and distributors is inevitably passed along to the Company, and its competitors. Success and growth in the industry is dependent upon creativity and innovation in meeting the many and varied needs of the customers products in a cost efficient and effective manner, and a consistently high level of timely service and delivery. Leadership in innovation and creativity serves to mitigate the impact of pricing pressure. The Company produces more than 35,000 unique compounds annually of which 60% are flavors and 40% fragrances. In addition, the Company continually creates new compounds to meet the many and varied characteristics and needs of its customers end products. No individual compound represents more than 1.5% of net sales. The development of fragrances and flavors is a complex artistic and technical process calling upon the combined knowledge and talents of creative perfumers and flavorists and application and research chemists. An important contribution to the creation of new fragrances and flavors is the development of new ingredients. The Company bears essentially all costs incurred in connection with the creation and development of new flavors and fragrances and such formulae are protected under trade secrecy. The Company is not materially dependent on any patents, trademarks or licenses. 16 The Companys strategic focus in the three year period 2001 2003 has been: o To integrate Bush Boake Allen Inc. (BBA), acquired in November 2000, and the Company, and to reorganize the integrated organization under two global umbrellas of business development and operations. Business Development encompasses consumer and market research, product category strategy, product development, global sales and marketing and technical application. Operations are responsible for the customer supply chain. Reorganization was necessary to streamline the Companys operations, eliminating costs and improving asset utilization, in view of persistent price pressure from many of the Companys customers. o To improve customer service, in terms of both on time deliveries and responsiveness to new product development initiatives, and to improve the win rate for new business with the Companys customers. o To critically evaluate the profitability and growth potential of the Companys product portfolio. o To revitalize and redirect research and development initiatives to those areas considered to be most likely, in the long term, to yield the greatest value to the Companys customers and shareholders. In the three year period ended December 2003, considerable progress against these strategic initiatives has been made. The BBA integration was completed quickly and associated savings exceeded the $70 million anticipated at the time the acquisition was announced. Customer service levels have improved to the point where on time deliveries exceed the 95% level, with further improvement targeted; as a result, the Company has been placed back on a number of core supplier lists it had not been on. The Company exited certain non core businesses, contributing to improved returns on sales and invested capital. The quality and depth of the Companys research and development efforts has improved significantly. In 2003, the Company patented fifteen new, commercially viable ingredients for use in flavors and fragrances; these ingredients will begin to be commercialized in flavor and fragrance compounds in 2004. Moving forward, the Company remains committed to: o Continuous improvement in operations and customer service supported by the global implementation of an enterprise requirements planning software package (SAP), and related initiatives. o Research and development efforts in those aspects of flavors and fragrances and associated delivery mechanisms which the Company has identified as most likely to drive profitable future growth. The Company anticipates that much of this research will be conducted internally, but such efforts may be augmented by joint research undertakings and through acquisition of technology. The next stage in setting strategic initiatives will require establishing priorities and making choices in order to provide the best opportunity for continuous improvement in shareholder value. SALES COMMENTARY Net sales for 2003, 2002 and 2001 were as follows: PERCENT PERCENT NET SALES 2003 CHANGE 2002 CHANGE 2001 Flavors .................... $ 866.5 7% $ 809.0 (3%) $ 835.7 Fragrances ................. 1,035.0 3% 1,000.2 (1%) 1,008.1 Total net sales ......... $ 1,901.5 5% $ 1,809.2 (2%) $ 1,843.8 In 2003, sales were favorably affected by the weakening of the U.S. dollar, most notably in comparison to the Euro, the Pound Sterling, the Australian dollar and the Japanese Yen; had 17 exchange rates remained the same during 2003 and 2002, net sales would have declined 2%. In 2002, sales were favorably affected by the weakening of the U.S. dollar, most notably against the Euro, the Japanese Yen and the Australian dollar; had exchange rates remained the same during 2002 and 2001, net sales would have declined 3%. The Company manages its operations by major geographical region; management considers destination sales to be a key measure of performance. Approximately 70% of the Companys sales are outside the United States. Although the Companys reported sales and earnings are affected by the weakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar, this has not had a long term effect on the underlying strength of the Companys business. 2003 Sales by Destination [GRAPH OMITTED] North America 29% Europe 40% Asia Pacific 16% Latin America 12% India 3% The following table summarizes reported sales on a geographic basis: PERCENT PERCENT SALES BY DESTINATION 2003 CHANGE 2002 CHANGE 2001 North America .............. $ 550.1 (4%) $ 570.9 (4%) $ 597.1 Europe ..................... 761.7 13% 671.4 2% 658.1 Asia Pacific ............... 311.9 7% 290.9 2% 286.2 Latin America .............. 223.6 (2%) 227.5 (11%) 256.5 India ...................... 54.2 12% 48.5 6% 45.9 Total net sales ......... $ 1,901.5 5% $ 1,809.2 (2%) $ 1,843.8 The Company acquired BBA effective November 3, 2000. BBA sales and operating results have been included in the Companys consolidated results from that date. In conjunction with the integration of IFF and BBA, and as part of a restructuring of the Companys operations, certain non core businesses (hereinafter referred to as the "non core businesses") were disposed of during 2002 and 2001. These non core businesses included the Companys fruit preparations business in North and Latin America, its North American concentrates business and a portion of the aroma chemicals business acquired in the BBA transaction. The non core businesses had combined net sales of $9.4 and $83.8 in 2002 and 2001, respectively, in the periods they were owned by the Company. The non core businesses were disposed of in a series of separately negotiated transactions with third parties; disposal of these businesses did not materially impact the Companys operating results. 18 Pro forma sales, excluding all sales associated with the non core businesses from 2002 and 2001, and the basis on which the Company measures its performance, would have been: PERCENT PRO FORMA PERCENT PRO FORMA NET SALES 2003 CHANGE 2002 CHANGE 2001 Flavors .................... $ 866.5 8% $ 799.6 1% $ 788.7 Fragrances ................. 1,035.0 3% 1,000.2 3% 971.3 Total net sales ......... $ 1,901.5 6% $ 1,799.8 2% $ 1,760.0 These pro forma sales on a geographic basis would have been: PERCENT PRO FORMA PERCENT PRO FORMA SALES BY DESTINATION 2003 CHANGE 2002 CHANGE 2001 North America .............. $ 550.1 (2%) $ 561.7 1% $ 554.9 Europe ..................... 761.7 13% 671.4 7% 627.8 Asia Pacific ............... 311.9 7% 290.8 3% 283.7 Latin America .............. 223.6 (2%) 227.4 (9%) 249.4 India ...................... 54.2 12% 48.5 10% 44.2 Total net sales ......... $ 1,901.5 6% $ 1,799.8 2% $ 1,760.0 2003 in Comparison to 2002 In 2003, net sales increased 6% in comparison to 2002 pro forma sales; had exchange rates remained the same during both years, 2003 sales would have declined 2%. Regional sales performance in 2003 was as follows: o North America flavor and fragrance sales declined 1% and 6%, respectively; in total the region declined 4%. Sales were impacted by weak economic conditions for much of the year, weak demand for fine fragrance, and the effect of ongoing customer efforts to reduce inventory levels. Fine fragrance, functional fragrance and chemical sales declined 8%, 4% and 8%, respectively. Excluding $9.4 of sales attributable to non core businesses disposed of from the 2002 comparative, flavor sales increased 3%. The flavor performance resulted from several new product introductions. o Local currency sales in Europe decreased 3%. The dollar increase benefited from the stronger Euro and Pound Sterling on translation of local currency results into the U.S. dollar. The local currency sales performance reflected persistent economic weakness throughout the European region. Local currency fragrance sales in Europe declined 5%, resulting in an increase of 12% in dollars; fragrance sales were weakest in aroma chemicals and functional fragrances, which declined 12% and 4%, respectively. Local currency sales in fine fragrance increased 3%, benefiting from several new product introductions. Flavor sales declined 1% in local currency, although this resulted in a 15% increase in dollar sales. o Asia Pacific sales increased 1% in local currency; the dollar increase benefited from the stronger Japanese Yen and, to a lesser extent, the Australian dollar on translation of local currency results into the U.S. dollar. Flavor sales declined 2% in local currency while increasing 4% in dollars. Fragrance sales increased 7% in local currency and 12% in dollars; the fragrance growth was driven by a number of new product introductions throughout the region, most notably in Thailand, Greater China and Indonesia. Sales were strongest in Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia and Greater China, with local currency increases of 25%, 14%, 9% and 6%, respectively. These strong performances were partially offset by persistent weakness in Japan and the Philippines where local currency sales declined 7% and 18%, respectively. o Latin America flavor sales increased 9%. The flavor sales performance was driven by increases of 80%, 31% and 19% in Central America, Argentina and Brazil, respectively, reflecting the benefit of new product introductions and, in Argentina, an improved economic environment. 19 Fragrance sales declined 5% with Central America, Mexico and Brazil declining 15%, 6% and 8%, respectively; Argentina fragrance sales increased 22%, benefiting from improved economic conditions. o India sales increased 9% in local currency. The performance was led by an 11% local currency increase in flavor sales; local currency fragrance sales grew 7%. India sales performance benefited from many new product introductions as well as the continued strength of the Indian and neighboring economies. 2002 in Comparison to 2001 In 2002, pro forma sales increased 2% in comparison to 2001 pro forma sales; had exchange rates remained the same during both years, 2002 pro forma sales would have increased 1%. Regional sales performance in 2002 was as follows: o North America flavor and fragrance sales declined 7% and 1%, respectively. The flavor sales decline resulted primarily from the sale of non core businesses in both 2002 and 2001. Excluding sales of $9.4 and $42.2 attributable to these businesses in 2002 and 2001, respectively, pro forma flavor sales increased 4% and fragrance sales were flat for the year, resulting in a 1% increase for the region. The pro forma flavor sales growth was driven by new product introductions. Fragrance sales were flat in all product categories. o Local currency sales in Europe decreased 2%. The reported dollar increase benefited from the stronger Euro on translation of local currency results into the U.S. dollar. Local currency sales were unfavorably affected by the loss of sales attributable to non core businesses disposed of in 2001. Excluding $30.3 of sales attributable to these non core businesses from the 2001 comparative, local currency fragrance sales increased 7% and sales for the region increased 3%. On a pro forma basis, local currency fragrance sales were strongest in aroma chemicals and fine fragrances, which increased 20% and 6%, respectively; functional fragrance sales were flat. Local currency flavor sales declined 3% although this resulted in a 1% increase in dollar sales. o Asia Pacific sales increased 2% in local currency. Excluding $2.5 of sales attributable to non core businesses from the 2001 comparative, sales increased 3%. Flavor sales increased 4% in both local currency and dollars; fragrance sales were flat in local currency and increased 1% in dollars. Sales performance was strongest in Vietnam, Thailand, South Korea and Greater China, with respective local currency increases of 49%, 14%, 10% and 6%. These strong performances were substantially offset by persistent weakness in Japan and Indonesia, where local currency sales declined 6% and 7%, respectively. o Latin America sales performance was affected by the loss of sales attributable to non core businesses disposed of in 2001, although the primary cause of the decline was the economic weakness that persisted throughout much of the region; excluding $7.1 of sales attributable to non core businesses from the 2001 comparative, sales declined 9%. Flavor sales decreased 16% while fragrances declined 6%. Modest growth in Mexico and Central America was more than offset by declines of 46% and 7% in Argentina and Brazil, respectively. o India sales increased 5% in local currency. Excluding $1.7 of sales attributable to non core businesses from the 2001 comparative, sales increased 10%. The performance was led by an 11% local currency increase in fragrance sales; local currency flavors sales grew 7%. India flavor and fragrance sales benefited from many new product introductions. 20 OPERATING RESULTS The percentage relationship of cost of goods sold and other operating expenses to reported sales is detailed in the following table. 2003 2002 2001 Cost of goods sold ........................... 57.5% 57.3% 57.7% Research and development expenses ............ 8.4% 8.0% 7.3% Selling and administrative expenses .......... 16.2% 16.9% 17.0% Cost of goods sold includes the cost of materials and manufacturing expenses; 65% 70% is the cost of raw materials. Research expenses are for the development of new and improved products, technical product support, compliance with governmental regulations, and help in maintaining relationships with customers who are often dependent on technological advances; such activities contribute significantly to the Companys business. Selling and administrative expenses support the Companys sales and operating levels. Segment profit, which excludes certain unallocated expenses, amortization of goodwill, and the effect of restructuring and other charges, was $370.3 in 2003, $355.1 in 2002 and $367.4 in 2001. The Company recorded restructuring and other charges of $42.4, $11.7 and $30.1 in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Operating profit totaled $285.8, $299.9 and $255.6 in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. 2003 in Comparison to 2002 In 2003, cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales remained comparable with 2002 levels. Product mix, mainly due to weakness in sales of higher margin fine fragrances, had a negative impact on margins. However, the impact of unfavorable sales mix was substantially offset by reduced manufacturing expenses. The reduction in these expenses resulted from realizing the full year benefit derived from the closure of various plants in the prior year; such closures were directly related to the integration of BBA into IFF. In addition, the Company undertook certain restructuring activities in 2003, eliminating 171 manufacturing positions; these actions saved approximately $3.5 in 2003, contributing 10 basis points to margin improvement. Research and development expenses increased to 8.4% of sales, consistent with the Companys stated intention to expand its research initiatives. The Company anticipates that research and development expenses will approximate 8.0 8.5% of sales for the next several years. Selling and administrative expenses declined to 16.2% of sales. The Company undertook certain restructuring activities in 2003, eliminating duplicate layers of management and certain corporate positions affecting 150 selling and administrative positions; these actions saved approximately $6.2, contributing 40 basis points in 2003. In 2003, costs of goods sold and selling and administrative expenses include $1.5 and $4.0, respectively, incurred in connection with the implementation of SAP; these costs relate to training and data conversion and are charged to operating expenses as incurred. Such costs are expected to continue in 2004 at the same level; implementation costs will begin to decline in 2005 as the project nears completion. 2002 in Comparison to 2001 Cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales declined slightly from 2001 levels. The decline resulted from improvement in product mix, mainly due to the disposal of the non core businesses, and the closure of certain manufacturing facilities in connection with the integration of BBA. In addition, the Company undertook certain restructuring activities, eliminating 127 manufacturing positions; these actions saved approximately $3.7 in 2002, contributing 20 basis points to margin improvement in 2002. These savings were partially offset by increased manufacturing expenses related to the Companys implementation of SAP and related initiatives, and the impact of the economic and currency disruption in Latin America which reduced the absorption of fixed manufacturing expenses and thus impacted profitability in that region. Total SAP related costs in manufacturing expenses approximated $1.7 in 2002; there were no similar expenses in 2001. 21 Research and development expenses increased as a percentage of sales in 2002, consistent with the Companys intention to increase its research initiatives. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales declined in 2002 compared to 2001 levels. The decline is a result of savings attributable to the integration of the Companys sales and administrative functions with those of BBA. In addition, the Company undertook certain restructuring activities, eliminating duplicate layers of management and certain corporate positions and affecting 21 selling and administrative positions; these actions saved approximately $0.8 in 2002. In 2002, selling and administrative expenses include $2.9 related to the implementation of SAP; there were no such expenses in 2001. Interest Expense Interest expense totaled $28.5, $37.0 and $70.4 in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Interest expense declined in each year as a result of reduced borrowing levels, a general decline in interest rates and the Companys interest rate and debt management initiatives. The average interest rate was 3.0%, 3.4% and 5.4% in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. More information on debt and interest rate management is contained in Note 9 and Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other (Income) Expense, Net Other (income) expense, net was $5.4 expense in 2003, $3.6 income in 2002 and $2.6 income in 2001. In 2003, the Company repurchased $200.7 of long term notes otherwise scheduled to mature in May 2006; purchases were made through a series of open market transactions, funded with commercial paper. The Company incurred a net loss of $4.2 in connection with the debt repurchase, which is included in Other (income) expense, net. Further details on the repurchase are contained in Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The increase in other income in 2002 compared to 2001 was principally due to favorable exchange results; exchange gains were $1.6, $2.3 and $1.9 in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Income Taxes The effective tax rate for 2003 was 31.5%, compared to 34.0% for 2002 and 38.2% for 2001. The lower rate in 2003 is the result of tax planning initiatives and the benefits of combining various IFF and BBA legal entities into a single tax structure. In 2003, the tax rate also benefited from restructuring and other charges, most of which were incurred in higher tax jurisdictions. The lower rate in 2002 resulted from the discontinuance of goodwill amortization; such goodwill was not deductible for purposes of determination of the Companys taxable income. The Company anticipates that its effective tax rate in 2004 will approximate 31.5%. ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES In 2003, the Company acquired 70% of the outstanding shares of Celessence International Ltd. (Celessence), a company engaged in the development and distribution of encapsulation and delivery systems for use in fragrance and other applications for $6.4. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase business combination. The principal Celessence asset is a process technology patent included in other intangible assets that is being amortized over its estimated remaining useful life. Celessence results, which are not material, are included in the consolidated results of the Company from acquisition date. Final allocation of the purchase price is not complete as of December 31, 2003 pending final valuation of the intangible asset. In November 2000, the Company acquired BBA; total consideration paid, including transaction costs, was $970.0. At acquisition date, BBA owned approximately 73% of its Indian subsidiary, BBA India Limited (BBAIL). During 2002, the Company acquired additional BBAIL shares, raising its ownership to 93%; cost of the acquired shares was $11.8. More details on the BBA acquisition are contained in Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company established accruals relating to the integration of BBA operations. Costs associated with these integration activities, relating mainly to employee separation and facility closures, were recorded as a component of purchase accounting; such costs did not directly impact current earnings. 22 Movements in acquisition accounting accruals were: ASSET EMPLOYEE RELATED RELATED AND OTHER TOTAL Balance January 1, 2001 ........... $ 4.1 $ 6.2 $ 10.3 Additional charges ................ 41.0 25.0 66.0 Cash and other costs ..............

At December 31, 2003 and 2002, goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $799.4 and $794.1, respectively. The principal changes in goodwill and intangible assets relate to the acquisition of Celessence. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 (FAS 142), Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. FAS 142 eliminates the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles and requires an evaluation of potential impairment upon adoption, and at least annually thereafter. FAS 142 also prescribes that other indefinite lived intangibles be included with goodwill. In 2002, certain intangibles were reclassified as indefinite lived intangibles in accordance with the provisions of FAS 142. The Company completed its annual assessments in 2003 and 2002, concluding that it has no impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets. Additional details are contained in Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company sold its concentrate business based in Oregon in June 2002 and recorded a restructuring and other charge of $4.3 related to employee separation and other disposal costs. Sales for the business up to the date of disposition were $9.4; operating profit was not significant. In October 2001, the Company sold its formulated fruit and vegetable preparation businesses in the United States and Brazil and recorded a restructuring and other charge of $7.4 related to employee separation and other disposal costs. Sales for the business up to the date of disposition were $23.0, with operating profit of approximately $2.2. In December 2001, the Company sold the U.K. based aroma chemicals business acquired as part of the BBA purchase. Sales for the business up to the date of disposition were $36.7, with operating profit of approximately $1.5. No gain or loss was recognized as a result of this transaction. Proceeds from the sales, which were not material, were used to reduce borrowings. RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES Since 1999, the Company has undertaken a series of actions associated with the closure of Company facilities and elimination of various employee positions. The actions undertaken in 1999 were initiated under a cost cutting program intended to streamline the Companys operations worldwide. The principal locations affected were the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and France, with lesser impact in various locations in Asia Pacific and Latin America; as a result the Company recorded pre tax charges of $40.9. Elements of the charges relating to accelerated depreciation on assets to be disposed of were recorded in cost of goods sold ($1.2), selling and administrative expenses ($2.3) and other income and expense ($4.5). The remaining actions related to employee separation and asset related costs associated with both write down and disposal actions resulted in restructuring and other charges of $32.9. Under these actions, 222 employees left the Company. As an element of the cost cutting program, the Company offered a voluntary early retirement incentive to certain U.S. based employees in the fourth quarter of 1999 with notification of acceptance 23 in the first quarter of 2000; 71 employees accepted, resulting in a pre tax charge of $9.3 in 2000. The early retirement program completed the cost cutting program undertaken in 1999 at an overall cost of $50.2. In mid 2000, senior management changed, after which the Company conducted a comprehensive analysis of its business development, research and development, and operating activities and associated staffing levels. In October 2000, the Company announced a significant reorganization entailing the elimination of multiple layers of management, closure of certain manufacturing facilities to improve capacity utilization, and the intended disposal of certain non core businesses. On completion, the reorganization was expected to yield annual savings approximating $25.0 to $30.0, a portion of which was to be reinvested in the business. At the time the plan was announced, it was anticipated that such actions would take place over the ensuing 24 months and incur expected costs of $90.0 $100.0. The integration of BBA into IFF, and the reorganization, proceeded concurrently. An element of the reorganization was a second voluntary early retirement program extended to U.S. based employees, which 85 employees accepted, resulting in pre tax charges of $14.5. An additional 41 employees were terminated by eliminating duplicate management positions at corporate, regional and affiliate locations, resulting in the Company recording pre tax charges of $17.5. In total, 197 employees were severed and the Company recorded pre tax charges totaling $41.3, comprised of: o The first early retirement plan $9.3; o The second early retirement plan $14.5; and o Other reorganization costs $17.5. During 2001, the Company sold its fruit preparation business in the United States and Brazil to a third party, and closed IFF operations in Hong Kong, South Africa, Chile, Venezuela, Kenya, Texas and Oregon. As a result, 465 employees were severed and the Company recorded pre tax charges totaling $30.1; $10.1 related to employee terminations and $20.0 related to location closures and asset write downs. During 2002, the Company closed IFF operations in Australia, discontinued fragrance compounding in Japan and sold its fruit concentrate business to a third party. As a result, 148 employees were severed and the Company recorded pre tax charges of $11.7; $4.3 related to employee severance and $7.4 related to location closures and asset write downs. In 2003, the Company completed the reorganization activities. These steps could only be undertaken upon completion of the integration of IFF and BBA which was completed in the fourth quarter of 2002. The actions eliminated duplicate employment functions and processes, including several senior corporate positions as well as regional and local levels. The Company eliminated 321 positions and recorded pre tax charges of $42.4; $38.0 related to employee terminations and $4.4 related to location closures and asset write downs. The 2003 asset related charges relate principally to final quantification of costs for previous actions taken. With respect to all restructuring and other charges: o Separation costs for the employees relate primarily to severance, outplacement and other benefit costs; o Asset write down charges relate to establishment of the new carrying value for assets held for sale or disposal; and o Other costs include lease termination costs and other reorganization expenses incurred to effect either the employee separation or location closure. Since October 2000, the Company recorded pre tax charges of $116.1 in comparison to the $90.0 $100.0 forecast at the time the plan was announced. The increase was due to additional actions taken in the final stages of the reorganization and the impact the weaker U.S. dollar had on the translation of the cost of actions undertaken outside the United States. 24 The charges discussed above exclude all charges associated with the integration of BBA into IFF where such costs were incurred in connection with the closure of BBA facilities or the elimination of BBA employees; all such costs were accounted for in the acquisition accounting as detailed in Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

FINANCIAL CONDITION Cash, cash equivalents and short term investments totaled $12.6 at December 31, 2003 compared to $15.2 and $48.9 at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Working capital totaled $376.6 at year end 2003, compared to $507.3 and $336.1 at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Gross additions to property, plant and equipment were $66.0, $81.8 and $52.0 in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and are expected to approximate $90.0 in 2004. 25 At December 31, 2003, the Company had $884.5 of debt outstanding, including deferred gains and mark to market adjustments on interest rate swap transactions approximating $38.0. Debt includes $499.3 of 6.45% Notes, maturing in May 2006. At December 2002, the Company had $700.0 of such Notes outstanding. During 2003, the Company repurchased $200.7 of the Notes. All repurchases were funded with commercial paper. The repurchases were intended to take full advantage of the Companys strong cash flows and to enable the Company to reduce long term debt prior to the Notes scheduled maturity in 2006. Interest expense will be reduced as a result of the shift to commercial paper borrowing. Based on current borrowing rates, the Company expects to save approximately $4.0 annually in interest expense as a benefit of replacing the Notes with commercial paper; interest expense savings in 2003 approximated $2.9. The Company does not anticipate additional repurchases of Notes prior to their scheduled maturity. In 2002, the Company entered into a five year Euro 350.0 (approximately $440.0 at December 31, 2003) multi currency revolving credit agreement. Prior to the third quarter of 2003, the five year Euro facility was characterized as long term debt; the Company employs this facility as a European wide working capital facility. At December 31, 2003, the Company had no borrowings under this facility. In 2002, the Company exercised an option under its existing $500.0 U.S. revolving credit facility and cancelled the $200.0 364 day portion of the agreement. The remaining $300.0 revolving credit facility extends to September 2006. The revolving credit agreement serves as backstop for the Companys commercial paper program; there have been no borrowings under this agreement. The Company compensates participating banks in the form of fees, the amounts of which are not material. At December 31, 2003, outstanding commercial paper totaled $162.9 at an average interest rate of 1.2% compared to $38.0 at December 31, 2002 at an average interest rate of 1.6%. Commercial paper maturities did not extend beyond January 22, 2004. In 2003, the Company sold its New York corporate headquarters to an unrelated third party for $91.0 in cash, concurrently, entering into a long term lease with respect to the space it occupies (approximately 40% of the building). The gain realized on the sale, after transaction costs, of $52.7, has been deferred and is being credited to income over the initial 27.5 year lease term. In 2002, the Company entered into agreements for the sale and leaseback of its Hazlet and South Brunswick, New Jersey facilities to an unrelated third party for $48.0 in cash. Concurrently, the Company entered into a long term lease with respect to the facilities. The gain realized on the sale, after transaction costs, of $26.7, has been deferred and is being credited to income over the initial 22 year lease term. In April 2000, the Company announced a plan to repurchase up to 7.5 million shares of its common stock. In September 2000, the Company increased its share repurchase program by $100.0. The Company completed the April 2000 program during 2001 and the September 2000 program in 2002. In October 2002, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of $100.0. Under these plans, the Company purchased 1.8 million shares, 2.3 million shares, and 3.0 million shares in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, at a total cost of $55.4, $72.3 and $71.2, respectively. Average per share cost of the shares acquired in 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $31.66, $31.52 and $23.60, respectively. Repurchases are made on the open market or through private transactions. At December 31, 2003, the Company had $42.0 remaining under its October 2002 repurchase plan, representing approximately 1.2 million shares based on a stock price of $35 per share. Repurchased shares are available for use in connection with the Companys employee benefit plans and for other general corporate purposes. The dividend paid per share in 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $.62, $.60 and $.60, respectively. In January and April 2003, the Company paid a quarterly cash dividend of $.15 per share to shareholders. In May 2003, the Company increased the annual dividend to $.64 per share, effective with the dividend paid in July 2003. The Companys intention is to pay dividends approximating 30% to 35% of yearly earnings. The Company paid dividends totaling $58.2, $56.8 and $57.6 in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The cumulative translation adjustment component of Accumulated other comprehensive income was ($45.2) at December 31, 2003, compared to ($138.2) at December 31, 2002. The change results 26 principally from the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro. The Minimum pension liability adjustment component of Accumulated other comprehensive income was ($82.8) at December 31, 2003, compared to ($75.0) at December 31, 2002. This change reflects lower pension asset values coupled with a reduction in the discount rate assumptions used to calculate pension liabilities. The accumulated loss on derivatives qualifying as hedges was ($3.7) at December 31, 2003 compared to a gain of $0.7 at December 31, 2002. Compliance with existing governmental requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment has not materially affected the Companys operations, earnings or competitive position. In 2003, the Company spent approximately $2.9 on capital projects and about $14.7 in operating expenses and governmental charges for the purpose of complying with such regulations. Expenditures for these purposes will continue for the foreseeable future. In addition, the Company is party to a number of proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act or similar state statutes. It is expected that the impact of any judgments in or voluntary settlements of such proceedings will not be material to the Companys financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. The following table indicates the amount of payments due within the time periods specified below under long term debt, current portion of long term debt included in Bank loans and current portion of long term debt, capital leases, operating leases and purchase obligations reflected on the Companys December 31, 2003 financial statements: PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD LESS THAN MORE THAN CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS(1) TOTAL 1 YEAR 2 3 YEARS 4 5 YEARS 5 YEARS Borrowings (See Note 9) ......... $ 653.6 $ 0.8 $ 511.3 $ 124.5 $ 17.0 Operating leases(2) ............. 276.1 18.2 29.3 20.8 207.8 Purchase obligations(3) ......... 9.7 0.2 9.5 Total ........................ $ 939.4 $ 19.2 $ 550.1 $ 145.3 $ 224.8 (1) Pension funding obligations are included in Note 14 Retirement Benefits. (2) Operating leases include facility and other lease commitments executed in the normal course of the Companys operations. Additional details concerning the Companys United States facilities are contained in Note 8 and details concerning the Companys worldwide aggregate lease facilities are contained in Note 17. (3) Purchase obligations are those commitments not recorded on the balance sheet. The Company anticipates that all financing requirements will be funded from operations and credit facilities currently in place. Cash flows from operations are sufficient to fund the Companys anticipated capital spending, dividends and other requirements including debt reduction; the Company anticipates reducing borrowings by approximately $100.0 in 2004; in comparison, borrowings were reduced by approximately $145.0 and $165.0 in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company may dispose of additional non core assets; any related net proceeds will be used primarily to reduce borrowings. MARKET RISK The Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. The Company evaluates and manages volatility relating to these exposures on a global basis to take advantage of netting opportunities that may exist. Identified net exposures are managed employing a number of techniques including but not limited to borrowings in local currencies and the use of certain derivative instruments. The Company operates on a global basis and, accordingly, is exposed to currency fluctuation related to the manufacture and sale of its products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The major foreign currencies involve the markets in the European Union, Mexico, Brazil, China, Indonesia, Australia and Japan, although all regions in the world are subject to foreign currency fluctuations versus the U.S. dollar and other cross currency rates. The Company actively monitors its foreign 27 currency exposures in all major markets in which it operates, and employs a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, including foreign currency hedging activities. The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts with the objective of reducing exposure to cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency receivables and payables, and with anticipated purchases of certain raw materials used in operations. These contracts, the counterparties to which are major international financial institutions, generally involve the exchange of one currency for a second currency at a future date, and have maturities which do not exceed six months. The notional amount and maturity dates of such contracts match those of the underlying transactions. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts approximating $178.0 and $131.4, respectively. The Company has designated these contracts as qualified fair value and cash flow hedges, as appropriate. Accordingly, the effective portion of any gain or loss on a derivative instrument reported as a cash flow hedge is reported as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income and recognized in earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The Company had no ineffective foreign currency forward contracts at December 31, 2003 or 2002. The Company employs various interest rate swaps and debt issuances with the objective of managing and optimizing its interest rate exposure. In 2001, the Company entered into certain interest swap agreements effectively converting the fixed coupon rate on its 6.45% Notes to a variable short term rate based on the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an interest markup. In response to changes in market conditions and the value of the swaps, and in 2003, in connection with the Companys debt repurchase, the Company periodically amended the swap agreements, changing the related interest spread. As a result of these amendments, the counterparty paid the Company $11.6, $56.5 and $19.9 in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, including accrued interest of $3.7, $6.5 and $3.3, respectively. The net realized gains on the swaps have been deferred, classified as a separate component of debt, and are amortized as a reduction in interest expense over the remaining term of the Notes. At December 31, 2003, the Company had terminated all swap agreements related to the Notes; as a result, the interest rate on the Notes, including amortization of the deferred swap gains, was 3.6% at December 31, 2003. The effective rate on the Notes at December 31, 2002 and 2001 was 3.4% and 3.7%, respectively. In 2002, the Company entered into certain interest swap agreements effectively converting the fixed rate on its long term Japanese Yen borrowings to a variable short term rate based on the Japanese Yen LIBOR rate plus an interest markup. These swaps are designated as qualified fair value hedges. During 2003 the Company amended the swaps and the counterparty paid the Company $3.0, including accrued interest of $0.5. These net gains have been deferred, and are classified as a separate component of debt and are being amortized over the remaining term of the debt. To the extent the Company has not received cash or otherwise amended or settled any swap agreements, any applicable mark to market adjustment relating to that swap is included as a separate component of debt. The Company had no ineffective interest rate swaps at December 31, 2003. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND USE OF ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to use judgment and to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses; actual results may differ from such estimates. The diversity of the Companys products, customers, geographic operations, sources of supply and markets reduces the risk that any one event would have a severe impact on the Companys operating results. The Company recognizes revenue when products are shipped and title and risk of loss transfer to the customer. The greatest complexity of the Companys business is in the area of research and development and creation of new products, for which all costs are expensed as incurred. Those areas requiring the greatest degree of management judgment or deemed most critical to the Companys financial reporting involve: o The periodic assessment of potential impairment of intangible assets acquired in business combinations; 28 o The evaluation of potential environmental and legal liabilities, where frequently changing rules, regulations and circumstances require constant reassessment of related practices and anticipated costs; o Determination of the various assumptions employed in the valuation of pension and retiree health care expense and associated obligations; o Recoverability and realization of assets, most notably in lesser developed areas of the world where fluctuating currencies and frequently unsettled economic conditions can create uncertainty; o The ongoing assessment of the valuation of inventory, given the large number of natural ingredients employed, the quality of which may be diminished over time; and o The determination of financial instruments employed as effective hedges of cash flows or market risk exposures. Management believes that full consideration has been given to all relevant circumstances that the Company may be currently subject to, and the financial statements accurately reflect managements best estimate of the results of operations, financial condition and cash flows of the Company for the years presented. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 146 (FAS 146), Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities was issued in June 2002. FAS 146 establishes accounting and reporting standards for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002, and requires such costs to be recognized when the liability is incurred and not at project initiation. The Company adopted the provisions of FAS 146 without material impact to reported results. SFAS No. 148 (FAS 148), Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure was issued in December 2002. FAS 148 provides alternate methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. The Company has elected to continue to use the intrinsic method of accounting for stock based awards to employees. No expense has been recognized for stock based compensation other than for restricted stock awards. The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, and No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. The Company has no investments in entities to which these interpretations apply. SFAS No. 149 (FAS 149), Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities was issued in April 2003. FAS 149 amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments under FAS 133. The Company adopted this standard without material impact to reported results. SFAS No. 132 (FAS 132), Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits was revised in December 2003. The revised version is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003. FAS 132, as revised, requires enhanced disclosures about defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets, obligations, cash flows, and net cost. The Company has complied with the expanded disclosure requirements prescribed by the revised standard. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES The discussion of the Companys historical results and its commentary regarding expected future results include and, where indicated, exclude the impact of sales attributable to certain non core businesses disposed of in 2002 and 2001, the impact of certain charges related to the Companys reorganization activities and the effects of exchange rate fluctuations. Such information is supplemental to information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and is not intended to represent a presentation in accordance with GAAP. In discussing its 29 historical and expected future results and financial condition, the Company believes it is meaningful for investors to be made aware of and to assist in a better understanding of, on a period to period basis, the impact of sales attributable to certain non core businesses disposed of in 2002 and 2001, the impact of exchange rate fluctuations and the impact such specifically identified charges have on operating results and financial condition. In addition, management considers each of these non GAAP measures to evaluate performance on a comparative period to period basis.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. In 2001, the Company entered into certain interest swap agreements effectively converting the fixed coupon rate on its 6.45% Notes to a variable short term rate based on the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an interest markup. In response to changes in market conditions and the value of the swaps and, in 2003, in connection with the Companys debt repurchase, the Company periodically amended the swap agreements, changing the related interest spread. As a result of these amendments, the counterparty paid the Company $11.6 million, $56.5 million and $19.9 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, including accrued interest of $3.7 million, $6.5 million and $3.3 million, respectively. The net realized gains on the swaps have been deferred, classified as a separate component of debt, and are amortized as a reduction in interest expense over the remaining term of the Notes. At December 31, 2003, the Company had terminated all swap agreements related to the Notes; as a result, the interest rate on the Notes, including amortization of the deferred swap gains, was 3.6% at December 31, 2003. The effective rate on the Notes at December 31, 2002 and 2001 was 3.4% and 3.7%, respectively. In 2002, the Company entered into certain interest swap agreements effectively converting the fixed rate on its long term Japanese Yen borrowings to a variable short term rate based on the Japanese Yen LIBOR rate plus an interest markup. These swaps are designated as qualified fair value hedges. During 2003, the Company amended the swap and the counterparty paid the Company $3.0 million, including accrued interest of $0.5 million. These net gains have been deferred, are classified as a separate component of debt and are being amortized over the remaining term of the debt. To the extent the Company has not received cash or otherwise amended or settled any swap agreement, any applicable mark to market adjustment relating to that swap is included as a separate component of debt. The Company had no ineffective interest rate swaps at December 31, 2003. The Company has executed a 10 year Yen U.S. dollar currency swap related to the purchase and sale of products between the U.S. and Japan. The annual notional value of this swap is approximately $5.0 million. Gains and losses related to this swap are recorded currently, and the mark to market adjustment related to the value of the swap is reflected as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts with the objective of reducing exposure to cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency receivables and payables, and with anticipated purchases of certain raw materials used in operations. These contracts, the counterparties to which are major international financial institutions, generally involve the exchange of one currency for a second currency at a future date, and have maturities not exceeding six months. The notional amount and maturity dates of such contracts match those of the underlying transactions. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of $178.0 million and $131.4 million, respectively. The Company has designated these contracts as qualified fair value and cash flow hedges, as appropriate. The Company had no ineffective foreign currency forward contracts at December 31, 2003 or 2002.
