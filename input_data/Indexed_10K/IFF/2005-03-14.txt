ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS) ORGANIZATION OF INFORMATION Managements Discussion and Analysis provides a narrative on the Companys operating performance, financial condition and liquidity and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements. It includes the following sections: o Executive Overview o Sales Commentary o Operating Results o Acquisitions and Divestitures o Restructuring and Other Charges o Financial Condition o Market Risk o Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates o New Accounting Standards o Non GAAP Financial Measures o Cautionary Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW The Company is a leading creator and manufacturer of flavor and fragrance compounds used to impart or improve the flavor or fragrance in a wide variety of consumer products. The precise size of the global market for flavors and fragrances is difficult to determine because the industry is highly fragmented, both geographically and along product lines; there are few publicly traded companies in the industry; certain customers maintain in house capabilities fulfilling a portion of their flavor or fragrance needs; and the quality and depth of market information in developing regions of the world is limited. Analysts generally estimate the global market to be $11 $12 billion of which IFF represents 16 17%; the Companys nearest sized competitor is of similar size. The five largest companies in the industry combined represent approximately 60 65% of the global market. Fragrance compounds are used in perfumes, cosmetics, toiletries, hair care products, deodorants, soaps, detergents and softeners as well as air care products. Major fragrance customers include the cosmetics industry, including perfume and toiletries manufacturers, and the household products industry, including manufacturers of soaps, detergents, household cleaners and air fresheners. Flavor products are sold to the food and beverage industries for use in consumer products such as prepared foods, beverages, dairy, food and confectionery products. The Company is also a leading manufacturer of synthetic ingredients used in making fragrances. Approximately 55% of the Companys ingredient production is consumed internally; the balance is sold to third party customers. Changing social habits resulting from such factors as increases in personal income and dual earner households, leisure time, health concerns, urbanization and population growth stimulate demand for consumer products utilizing flavors and fragrances. These developments expand the market for products with finer fragrance quality, as well as the market for colognes and toiletries. Such developments also stimulate demand for convenience foods, soft drinks and low fat food products that must conform to expected tastes. These developments necessitate the creation and development of flavors and fragrances and ingredients that are compatible with newly introduced materials and methods of application used in consumer products. 16 Flavors and fragrances are generally: o created for the exclusive use of a specific customer; o sold in solid or liquid form, in amounts ranging from a few kilograms to many tons depending on the nature of the end product in which they are used; o a small percentage of the volume and cost of the end product sold to the consumer; and o a major factor in consumer selection and acceptance of the product. Flavors and fragrances have similar economic and operational characteristics, including research and development, the nature of the creative and production processes, the manner in which products are distributed and the type of customer; many of the Companys customers purchase both flavors and fragrances. A breakdown of sales by principal product category is depicted in the following graph. The fruit business was disposed of in 2004; sales depicted below are for the period the fruit business was owned by the Company. 2004 Sales by Category [GRAPHIC OMITTED] [ ] 12% INGREDIENTS [ ] 3% FRUIT [ ] 42% FLAVOR COMPOUNDS [ ] 17% FINE FRAGRANCE AND TOILETRIES [ ] 26% FUNCTIONAL FRAGRANCES The Companys five largest customers comprise 30% of consolidated sales and its top thirty customers 53%; these percentages have been fairly constant for several years. No one customer accounts for more than 10% of sales. A key factor for success is inclusion on major customers core supplier lists opening opportunities to win new business. The Company is currently on the majority of core supplier lists of its major customers; participation in such lists is key to the Companys strategy for future growth. The flavor and fragrance industry is impacted by macroeconomic factors in all product categories and geographic regions. In addition, pricing pressure placed on the Companys customers by large and powerful retailers and distributors is inevitably passed along to the Company, and its competitors. Leadership in innovation and creativity mitigates the impact of pricing pressure. Success and growth in the industry is dependent upon creativity and innovation in meeting the many and varied needs of the customers products in a cost efficient and effective manner, and with a consistently high level of timely service and delivery. The Company produces more than 35,000 unique compounds, of which 60% are flavors and 40% fragrances. The Company continually creates new compounds to meet the changing characteristics and needs of its customers end products. No individual compound represents more than 1.5% of net sales. Development of fragrances and flavors is a complex artistic and technical process calling upon the combined knowledge and talents of creative perfumers and flavorists, and application and research chemists. An important contribution to the creation of new fragrances and flavors is the development of new ingredients. The Company bears essentially all costs incurred in connection with the creation and development of new flavors and fragrances and such formulae are protected under trade secrecy. The Company is not materially dependent on any patents, trademarks or licenses. 17 The Companys strategic focus in the three year period 2002 2004 has been: o To integrate Bush Boake Allen Inc. ("BBA"), acquired in November 2000, and to reorganize the integrated organization under two global umbrellas of Business Development and Operations. Business Development encompasses consumer and market research, product category strategy, product development, global sales and marketing and technical application. Operations are responsible for the customer supply chain. o To improve customer service, in terms of both on time deliveries and responsiveness to new product development initiatives, and to improve the win rate for new business with the Companys customers. o To critically evaluate the profitability and growth potential of the Companys product portfolio, and to focus on those categories and customers considered to be the best opportunities for long term profitable growth. o To focus research and development initiatives on those areas considered to be most likely, in the long term, to yield the greatest value to the Companys customers and shareholders. In the three year period ended December 31, 2004, considerable progress against these strategic initiatives was made. The BBA integration was completed quickly and associated savings exceeded those anticipated at the time the acquisition was announced. Customer service levels have improved to the point where on time deliveries exceed the 95% level, with further improvement targeted. The Company has exited certain non core businesses, contributing to improved returns on sales and invested capital; the last of these businesses was sold in 2004. The quality and depth of the Companys research and development efforts have improved significantly. In 2003 and 2004, the Company patented numerous new, commercially viable ingredients for use in flavors and fragrances; fifteen were patented in 2003 and nine in 2004. A number of these ingredients were used in flavor and fragrance compounds in 2004 and in 2005 2006 new product introductions will play an important role in meeting our growth objectives. Moving forward, the Company is committed to: o Continuous improvement in operations and customer service supported by the global implementation of the enterprise requirements planning software package ("SAP"), and related initiatives. o Research and development efforts in those aspects of flavors and fragrances and associated delivery mechanisms which the Company has identified as most likely to drive profitable future growth. The Company anticipates that much of this research will be conducted internally, but such efforts may be augmented by joint research undertakings and through acquisition of technology. An essential aspect of the overall research efforts is the Companys continued leadership in sensory science and consumer insight, enabling the creation of consumer preferred flavors and fragrances. As implementation of the strategy progresses, setting strategic initiatives requires regular establishment and reassessment of identified priorities and necessitates choices in order to provide the best opportunity for continuous improvement in shareholder value. 18 SALES COMMENTARY Net sales for 2004, 2003 and 2002 were as follows: PERCENT PERCENT NET SALES 2004 CHANGE 2003 CHANGE 2002 Flavors $ 910.6 5% $ 866.5 7% $ 809.0 Fragrances 1,123.1 9% 1,035.0 3% 1,000.2 Total net sales $ 2,033.7 7% $ 1,901.5 5% $ 1,809.2 The Company manages its operations by major geographical region and considers destination sales to be a key measure of performance. Although the Companys reported sales and earnings are affected by the weakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar, this has not had a long term effect on the underlying strength of the Companys business. 2004 Sales by Destination [GRAPHIC OMITTED] [ ] 29% NORTH AMERICA [ ] 39% EUROPE [ ] 17% ASIA PACIFIC [ ] 12% LATIN AMERICA [ ] 3% INDIA The Company acquired BBA effective November 3, 2000. In conjunction with the integration of BBA, and as part of restructuring the Company, certain non core businesses (hereinafter referred to as the "non core businesses") have been disposed of including the fruit preparations businesses in Europe, North and Latin America; the North American concentrates business and a portion of the aroma chemicals business acquired in the BBA transaction. The non core businesses were disposed of in a series of separately negotiated transactions with third parties; disposal of these businesses did not materially impact the Companys operating results. The North American concentrates business was disposed of in 2002 and the European fruit preparation business in 2004; the other non core businesses were disposed of in 2001. The following table summarizes reported sales on a geographic basis, and reflects adjustments, as appropriate, to exclude sales attributable to the non core businesses; adjusted sales are the basis on which the Company measures its operating performance: PERCENT PERCENT SALES BY DESTINATION 2004 CHANGE 2003 CHANGE 2002 North America $ 598.6 9% $ 550.1 (4%) $ 570.9 Europe 790.3 4% 761.7 13% 671.4 Asia Pacific 342.9 10% 311.9 7% 290.9 Latin America 238.6 7% 223.6 (2%) 227.5 India 63.3 17% 54.2 12% 48.5 Total net sales, as reported $2,033.7 7% $1,901.5 5% $1,809.2 Less: European fruit preparations (58.3) (92.3) (72.2) North American concentrates (9.4) Total net sales, as adjusted $1,975.4 9% $1,809.2 5% $1,727.6 19 Net sales below are adjusted to exclude all sales associated with the non core businesses: AS ADJUSTED PERCENT AS ADJUSTED PERCENT AS ADJUSTED NET SALES 2004 CHANGE 2003 CHANGE 2002 Flavors $ 852.3 10% $ 774.2 6% $ 727.4 Fragrances 1,123.1 9% 1,035.0 3% 1,000.2 Total net sales, as adjusted $ 1,975.4 9% $ 1,809.2 5% $ 1,727.6 2004 in Comparison to 2003 In 2004, sales totaled $2,033.7, increasing 7% over 2003. Reported sales were strongest in fragrances, led by a 13% increase in fine fragrance sales; sales of aroma chemicals and fragrances used in functional products each increased 7%. Reported sales benefited from the strengthening of various currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar; had exchange rates remained constant, sales would have increased 2% in comparison to the prior year. The sales performance was impacted by the disposition of the Companys European fruit preparations business, which was sold to Frutarom Industries Ltd. ("Frutarom") in the second half of the year. On an as adjusted basis, excluding sales attributable to the European fruit businesses from the 2004 and 2003 results, sales would have increased 5% in local currency and 9% in reported dollars. Flavor and fragrance sales increased in all geographic regions, although growth in Europe resulted from currency translation; sales performance by region was as follows: o North America fragrance sales grew 9% while flavor sales increased 8%; the region grew 9%, mainly driven by new wins. Fragrance sales increased in all categories, led by a 20% increase in aroma chemical sales, while fine and functional fragrance sales increased 6% and 7%, respectively. The aroma chemical sales increase was volume driven while growth in fine fragrances resulted from $7.0 in new wins. Functional fragrance sales realized new wins worth $16.0 partially offset by erosion in existing products of $6.0. Flavors reported new product introductions of $30.0 partially offset by volume and erosion in existing products. o European fragrance sales increased 8%, although this performance was partially offset by a 2% decline in flavor sales; in total, regional sales increased 4%. Reported sales benefited from the strength of the Euro and Pound Sterling; local currency sales declined 5%. Local currency fragrance sales declined 2%; fine fragrance sales increased 5% offset by a 1% decrease in sales of functional fragrances and a 10% decline in aroma chemical sales. The fine fragrance performance was driven by a number of new product wins. Fine and functional fragrances reported new product introductions of $40.0 partially offset by the effects of erosion in existing products. Local currency flavor sales declined 10%, mainly as a result of the disposition of the fruit preparations business. On an as adjusted basis, excluding sales attributable to the fruit business for 2004 and 2003, flavor sales would have increased 2% in local currency and 11% in reported dollars, mainly due to new wins. o Local currency sales in Asia Pacific increased 6%, resulting in a 10% increase in reported dollar sales. Local currency fragrance sales increased 3% in comparison to the prior year, resulting in a 7% increase in reported dollars driven by new wins of $6.0. Local currency flavor sales increased 7%, resulting in a 13% increase in reported dollars. The performance reflects the benefit of both new wins and volume increases in existing products. For the region, sales growth was strongest in Greater China, Vietnam, Indonesia and Taiwan, with respective local currency increases of 17%, 47%, 9% and 8%, while Japan sales grew 3%. o Latin American sales increased 7%; fragrance and flavor sales increased 9% and 3%, respectively. Sales growth was strongest in Venezuela, Central America, Argentina and Colombia which grew 33%, 15%, 12% and 9%, respectively. Fragrance sales growth was led by a 23% increase in aroma chemicals, while sales of fine and functional fragrances increased 12% and 6%, respectively. Fragrance sales were driven by new wins and volume increases while the flavor increase was mainly volume driven. 20 o India sales increased 15% in local currency and 17% in reported dollars. Local currency fragrance sales increased 12%, resulting in a 16% increase in reported dollars. Flavor sales increased 18% in local currency, resulting in a 19% increase in reported dollars. In both flavors and fragrances, the sales performance reflected the benefit of new wins. 2003 in Comparison to 2002 2003 sales increased 5% over 2002. Had exchange rates remained the same in both periods, sales would have declined 2%. In 2003, as adjusted sales increased 5% in comparison to 2002; had exchange rates remained the same during both years, 2003 as adjusted sales would have declined 2%. Sales performance by region was as follows: o North America flavor and fragrance sales declined 1% and 6%, respectively; in total, the region declined 4%. Sales were impacted by weak economic conditions for much of the year, weak demand for fine fragrance, and the effect of ongoing customer efforts to reduce inventory levels. Fine fragrance, functional fragrance and chemical sales declined 8%, 4% and 8%, respectively. Fine fragrance sales were impacted by erosion in certain core brands, partially offset by new wins which accounted for $9.0 in increased sales. Excluding $9.4 of sales attributable to non core businesses disposed of from the 2002 comparative, flavor sales increased 3%. The flavor performance benefited from new product introductions of $21.0. o Local currency sales in Europe decreased 3%. The dollar increase benefited from the stronger Euro and Pound Sterling on translation of local currency results into the U.S. dollar. The local currency sales performance reflected persistent economic weakness throughout the European region. Local currency fragrance sales in Europe declined 5%, resulting in a 12% increase in dollars; fragrance sales were weakest in aroma chemicals and functional fragrances, which declined 12% and 4%, respectively. European chemical volumes declined by 4% with the remainder of the decline attributable to product mix and lower selling prices. Local currency fine fragrance sales increased 3%; new wins increased sales by 11% although this performance was partially offset by declines in existing fragrance business. Flavor sales declined 1% in local currency, although this resulted in a 15% increase in dollar sales. o Asia Pacific sales increased 1% in local currency; the dollar increase benefited from the stronger Japanese Yen and Australian dollar on translation of local currency results into the U.S. dollar. Flavor sales declined 2% in local currency while increasing 4% in dollars. Fragrance sales increased 7% in local currency and 12% in dollars; the fragrance growth was driven by a number of new product introductions throughout the region, most notably in Thailand, Greater China and Indonesia. The new wins in the region accounted for an increase of approximately 10%; however erosion in the existing products was approximately 3%. Sales were strongest in Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia and Greater China, with local currency increases of 25%, 14%, 9% and 6%, respectively. These strong performances were partially offset by persistent weakness in Japan and the Philippines where local currency sales declined 7% and 18%, respectively. o Latin America flavor sales increased 9%. The flavor sales performance was driven by increases of 80%, 31% and 19% in Central America, Argentina and Brazil, respectively, reflecting the benefit of new product introductions and, in Argentina, an improved economic environment. In the region, volume levels excluding the new products decreased 1%. Fragrance sales declined 5% with Central America, Mexico and Brazil declining 15%, 6% and 8%, respectively; Argentina fragrance sales increased 22%. o India sales increased 9% in local currency and 12% in reported dollars. The performance was led by an 11% local currency increase in flavor sales and 12% in reported dollars; local currency fragrance sales grew 7% and 12% in reported dollars. India sales performance benefited from many new product introductions as well as the continued strength of the Indian and neighboring 21 economies. New wins accounted for two thirds of the flavor growth with volume increases responsible for the remainder. Fragrance growth was driven by new wins. OPERATING RESULTS The percentage relationship of cost of goods sold and other operating expenses to reported sales is detailed in the following table. 2004 2003 2002 Cost of goods sold 57.1% 57.5% 57.3% Research and development expenses 8.6% 8.4% 8.0% Selling and administrative expenses 16.8% 16.2% 16.9% Cost of goods sold includes the cost of materials and manufacturing expenses; raw materials constitute 65 70% of the total. Research expenses are for the development of new and improved products, technical product support, compliance with governmental regulations, and help in maintaining relationships with customers who are often dependent on technological advances. Selling and administrative expenses support the Companys sales and operating levels. Segment profit, which excludes the effect of restructuring and other charges, was $342.1 in 2004, $328.2 in 2003 and $311.6 in 2002. The Company recorded restructuring and other charges of $31.8, $42.4 and $11.7 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Operating profit totaled $310.3, $285.8 and $299.9 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 2004 in Comparison to 2003 Cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales declined 40 basis points compared with 2003. The improvement resulted from a combination of improved sales performance, and better product mix from improved fine fragrance sales and the disposition of the lower margin European fruit business. The Company benefited from the elimination of 48 manufacturing positions in North America and Europe which resulted in savings of approximately $2.1. The benefits of the improved sales performance and product mix were partially offset by poor operating performance by the European fruit business for the period of time owned by the Company, and by weak absorption of expenses resulting from the transfer of production from the Companys facility in Dijon, France, which is scheduled to close in 2005, to other manufacturing plants. Research and development ("R&D") expenses increased to 8.6% of sales, consistent with the Companys stated intention to expand its research initiatives. In 2005, R&D expenses are expected to be 9.0 9.2% of sales. This increase is mainly as a result of the elimination of the fruit preparations business; relative to other parts of the Companys business, fruit preparations required less R&D as a percentage of sales. Selling, General and Administrative ("SG&A") expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased to 16.8% from 16.2%; the increase resulted mainly from inclusion of $5.0 in equity compensation expense for which there was no comparable amount in the 2003 results, and higher expense accruals under the Companys incentive compensation plans, based on the improved sales and operating performance relative to 2003. The increase in Global Expenses, as reported in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, is mainly related to these expenses. In May 2004, the Company began using Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs"), rather than stock options, as an element of the Companys incentive compensation plans for all eligible U.S. based employees and a majority of eligible overseas employees; previously, options had not been expensed as permitted under applicable accounting guidance. Vesting of the RSUs for the Companys senior management is performance and time based; for the remainder of eligible employees, vesting is time based (generally over a three year period). In 2005, SG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales, are expected to increase somewhat from 2004 levels, mainly from inclusion of $12.0 $14.0 in equity compensation compared to the $5.0 of such expense in 2004. In 2004, cost of goods sold and SG&A include $1.4 and $3.8, respectively, incurred in connection with the implementation of SAP; these costs relate to training and data conversion and are charged to operating expenses as incurred. Such costs are expected to diminish in 2006 as the final implementations of SAP are 22 completed. Net income for 2004 increased 14% in comparison to the prior year; excluding the impact of restructuring and other charges in both years (see "Restructuring and Other Charges"), income increased 8% in comparison to the prior year. 2003 in Comparison to 2002 Cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales remained comparable with 2002 levels. Product mix, mainly weakness in sales of higher margin fine fragrances, had a negative impact on margins. However, the impact of unfavorable sales mix was substantially offset by reduced manufacturing expenses of approximately $3.5. The reduction in these expenses resulted from realizing the full year benefit from the closure of various plants in the preceding year; such closures were directly related to the integration of BBA into IFF. In addition, the Company undertook certain restructuring activities in 2003, eliminating 171 manufacturing positions; these actions saved approximately $3.5 in 2003. R&D expenses increased to 8.4% of sales, consistent with the Companys stated intention to expand its research initiatives. SG&A declined to 16.2% of sales. The Company undertook certain restructuring activities in 2003, eliminating duplicate layers of management and certain corporate positions affecting 150 selling and administrative positions; these actions saved approximately $6.2 in 2003. In 2003, cost of goods sold and SG&A include $1.5 and $4.0, respectively, incurred in connection with the implementation of SAP relating to training and data conversion which are charged to operating expenses as incurred. Interest Expense Interest expense totaled $24.0, $28.5 and $37.0 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Interest expense declined in each year as a result of reduced borrowing levels and the Companys interest rate and debt management initiatives. The average interest rate was 3.2%, 3.0% and 3.4% in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Interest expense is expected to decline 10 12% in 2005 due to reduced debt levels. More information on debt and interest rate management is contained in Note 9 and Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other (Income) Expense, Net Other (income) expense, net was $5.3 expense in 2004, $5.4 expense in 2003 and $3.6 income in 2002. In 2004, expense resulted primarily from exchange losses compared to exchange gains in 2003, and other non operating expenses. Exchange gains or (losses) were ($2.9), $1.6 and $2.3 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The exchange losses in 2004 were mainly the result of the Company having U.S. dollar positions in Europe and Latin America which resulted in exchange losses upon the weakening of the U.S. dollar in comparison to the Euro and other currencies. In 2003, the Company repurchased $200.7 of long term notes otherwise scheduled to mature in May 2006; purchases were made through a series of open market transactions, funded with commercial paper; as a result, the Company incurred a net loss of $4.2 which is included in Other (income) expense, net. Further details on the repurchase are contained in Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes The effective tax rate for 2004 was 30.2%, compared to 31.5% for 2003 and 34.0% for 2002. The declining rate over the three year period is primarily the result of tax planning initiatives and the benefit of combining various IFF and BBA legal entities into a single tax structure. In both 2004 and 2003, the tax rate also benefited from restructuring and other charges, most of which were incurred in higher tax jurisdictions. The Company anticipates that its effective tax rate in 2005 will approximate 31.2%. 23 The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "Act"), enacted on October 22, 2004, provides for a special one time tax deduction of 85% of dividends received on eligible repatriated foreign earnings. The deduction would result in an approximate 5.25% federal tax rate on these earnings. To qualify for the deduction, the earnings must be reinvested in the United States pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan established by the Chief Executive Officer and approved by the Board of Directors; certain other criteria in the Act must also be satisfied. The Company is evaluating whether it will repatriate foreign earnings under the repatriation provisions of the Act during the year ending December 31, 2005, and if so, the amount to be repatriated. The range of reasonably possible amounts the Company is considering for repatriation, which would be eligible for the temporary deduction, is $250.0 to $500.0. This repatriation may include amounts currently deemed indefinitely reinvested and amounts for which deferred taxes have been provided. The Company is awaiting the issuance of further regulatory guidance and passage of statutory technical corrections with respect to certain provisions in the Act prior to determining any amounts it will repatriate. The Company is not yet in a position to determine the impact of a qualifying repatriation, should it choose to make one, on its income tax expense for 2005, the amount of its indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings, or the amount of its deferred tax liability with respect to foreign earnings. The Company expects to determine the amounts and sources of foreign earnings to be repatriated, if any, during the second half of 2005. Acquisitions and Divestitures In 2004, the Company sold its European fruit preparations business. IFF had previously announced its intention to divest itself of this business which manufactures processed fruit and other natural product preparations used in a wide variety of food products, including baked goods and dairy products. Sales of fruit preparations in 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $58.3, $92.3 and $72.2; operating profit was $5.6, $12.4 and $6.3, respectively. IFF completed the sale of the German and Swiss businesses, comprising 70% of the total fruit business, in August 2004. The Company completed required consultations with the French employee works council and sold its French fruit preparations assets to Frutarom in October 2004. Proceeds from the sale, in total, were $40.0, including assumption of certain liabilities; cash proceeds were used to reduce borrowings. In 2003, the Company acquired 70% of the outstanding shares of Celessence International Ltd. ("Celessence"), a company engaged in the development and distribution of encapsulation and delivery systems for use in fragrance and other applications, for $6.4. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase business combination. The principal Celessence asset is a process technology patent included in other intangible assets that is being amortized over its estimated remaining useful life. Celessence results, which are not material, are included in the consolidated results of the Company from acquisition date. The Company sold its North American concentrate business in June 2002, recognizing a restructuring and other charge of $4.3 related to employee separation and other disposal costs. Sales for the business up to the date of disposition were $9.4; operating profit was not significant. In November 2000, the Company acquired BBA; total consideration paid, including transaction costs, was $970.0. At acquisition date, BBA owned approximately 73% of its Indian subsidiary, BBA India Limited ("BBAIL"). During 2002, the Company acquired additional BBAIL shares, raising its ownership to 93%; cost of the acquired shares was $11.8. More details on the BBA acquisition are contained in Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company established accruals relating to the integration of BBA; associated costs, relating mainly to employee separation and facility closures, were recorded as a component of purchase accounting and did not directly impact current earnings. 24 Movements in acquisition accounting accruals were: ASSET EMPLOYEE RELATED RELATED AND OTHER TOTAL Balance January 1, 2002 $ 13.8 $ 9.9 $ 23.7 Cash and other costs (7.8) (8.8) (16.6) Balance December 31, 2002 6.0 1.1 7.1 Cash and other costs (3.6) (1.1) (4.7) Balance December 31, 2003 2.4 2.4 Cash and other costs (2.4) (2.4) Balance December 31, 2004 $ $ $ At December 31, 2004 and 2003, goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $789.7 and $799.4, respectively. The Company completed its annual assessments in 2004, 2003 and 2002, concluding that it has no impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets. Additional details are contained in Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES Since 1999, the Company has undertaken a series of actions associated with the closure of Company facilities and elimination of various employee positions. As an element of this program, the Company offered a voluntary early retirement incentive to certain U.S. based employees in the fourth quarter of 1999 with notification of acceptance in the first quarter of 2000; 71 employees accepted, resulting in a pre tax charge of $9.3 in 2000. In mid 2000, senior management changed, after which the Company conducted a comprehensive analysis of its business development, research and development, and operating activities and associated staffing levels. In October 2000, the Company announced a significant reorganization entailing the elimination of multiple layers of management, closure of certain manufacturing facilities to improve capacity utilization, and the intended disposal of certain non core businesses. On completion, the reorganization was expected to yield annual savings approximating $25.0 to $30.0, a portion of which was to be reinvested in the business. The integration of BBA into IFF and the reorganization proceeded concurrently. An element of the reorganization was a second voluntary early retirement program extended to U.S. based employees, which 85 employees accepted, resulting in pre tax charges of $14.5. An additional 41 employees were terminated by eliminating duplicate management positions at corporate, regional and affiliate locations, resulting in the Company recording pre tax charges of $17.5. In total, 197 employees were severed and the Company recorded pre tax charges totaling $41.3, comprised of: o The first early retirement plan $9.3; o The second early retirement plan $14.5; and o Other reorganization costs $17.5. During 2001, the Company sold its fruit preparation business in the United States and Brazil, and closed IFF operations in Hong Kong, South Africa, Chile, Venezuela, Kenya, Texas and Oregon. As a result, 465 employees were severed and the Company recorded pre tax charges totaling $30.1; $10.1 related to employee terminations and $20.0 related to location closures and asset write downs. During 2002, the Company closed IFF operations in Australia, discontinued fragrance compounding in Japan and sold its fruit concentrate business. As a result, 148 employees were severed and the Company recorded pre tax charges of $11.7; $4.3 related to employee severance and $7.4 related to location closures and asset write downs. 25 In 2003, the Company further eliminated duplicate employment functions and processes, including several senior corporate positions as well as those at global, regional and local levels. The Company eliminated 321 positions and recorded pre tax charges of $42.4; $38.0 related to employee terminations and $4.4 related to location closures and asset write downs. The 2003 asset related charges related principally to final quantification of costs for previous actions taken. In 2004, the Company disposed of its European fruit preparations business. In addition, the Company closed its Canadian manufacturing facility and committed to the closure of its manufacturing facility in Dijon, France; the Dijon facility is scheduled to close in 2005, on completion of transfer of production to other plants. As a result, the Company eliminated 302 positions, and recognized pre tax charges of $31.8, of which $25.8 related to employee terminations and $6.0 to location closures and asset write downs, and other related reorganization actions; the asset related charges were net of gains of $16.3 related to the sale of the fruit businesses and Canadian facility. An additional 130 employees will leave the Company in 2005 on closure of Dijon. With respect to all restructuring and other charges: o Separation costs for the employees relate primarily to severance, outplacement and other benefit costs; o Asset write down charges relate to establishment of the new carrying value for assets held for sale or disposal; and o Other costs include lease termination costs and other reorganization expenses incurred to effect either the employee separation or location closure. The charges above exclude all charges associated with the integration of BBA where such costs were incurred in connection with the closure of BBA facilities or the elimination of BBA employees; all such costs were accounted for in the acquisition accounting as detailed in Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Positions eliminated by region in each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004 were: 2004 2003 2002 North America 56 81 91 Europe* 234 97 42 Asia Pacific 11 120 15 Latin America 1 19 India 4 Total 302 321 148 * Europe figures include 194 positions eliminated with the sale of the fruit business. Charges by region in each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004 were: 2004 2003 2002 North America $ 7.6 $ 20.2 $ 5.6 Europe 23.5 16.9 5.8 Asia Pacific 0.7 3.6 0.3 Latin America 1.3 India 0.4 Total $ 31.8 $ 42.4 $ 11.7 26 Movements in related accruals in each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004 were: ASSET EMPLOYEE RELATED RELATED AND OTHER TOTAL Balance January 1, 2002 $ 7.0 $ 0.7 $ 7.7 Additional charges 4.3 7.4 11.7 Cash and other costs (7.9) (7.7) (15.6) Balance December 31, 2002 3.4 0.4 3.8 Additional charges 38.0 4.4 42.4 Cash and other costs (21.8) (3.3) (25.1) Balance December 31, 2003 19.6 1.5 21.1 Additional charges* 25.8 22.3 48.1 Cash and other costs (17.2) (8.9) (26.1) Balance December 31, 2004 $ 28.2 $ 14.9 $ 43.1 * The asset related charges above exclude gains of $16.3 relating to the sale of the fruit businesses and Canadian facility which were offset against restructuring and other charges in determining Restructuring and other charges reported in 2004 of $31.8. The balance of the employee related liabilities are expected to be utilized by 2006 as obligations to affected employees are satisfied; the asset related charges will be utilized in 2006 on final decommissioning and disposal of the affected equipment. FINANCIAL CONDITION Cash, cash equivalents and short term investments totaled $33.0 at December 31, 2004 compared to $12.6 and $15.2 at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Working capital totaled $561.8 at year end 2004, compared to $376.6 and $507.3 at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The change in 2004 from 2003 is primarily related to reduced borrowing levels. Gross additions to property, plant and equipment were $70.6, $66.0 and $81.8 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and are expected to approximate $95.0 in 2005. At December 31, 2004, the Company had $684.9 of debt outstanding, including deferred gains and mark to market adjustments on interest rate swap transactions of $23.8. Debt includes $499.3 of 6.45% Notes, maturing in May 2006. At December 2002, the Company had $700.0 of Notes outstanding. During 2003, the Company repurchased $200.7 of the Notes. All repurchases were funded with commercial paper. The repurchases took advantage of the Companys strong cash flows and enabled the Company to reduce long term debt prior to the Notes scheduled maturity. Interest expense was reduced as a result of the shift to commercial paper borrowing. In 2003, interest expense declined $2.9, as a result of the replacement of the Notes with lower cost commercial paper and overseas borrowings; savings in 2004 approximated $5.5. The Company is developing plans for both short term financing and the potential issuance of additional notes or other long term instruments when the Notes mature in 2006. The Company has a $300.0 U.S. based revolving credit facility that will expire in September 2006. The revolving credit agreement serves as backstop for the Companys commercial paper program; there have been no borrowings under this agreement. The Company compensates participating banks in the form of fees, the amounts of which are not material. At December 31, 2004 there was no outstanding commercial paper compared to an outstanding balance of $162.9 at December 31, 2003 at an average interest rate of 1.2%. The Company has a five year Euro 350.0 (approximately $475.0 at December 31, 2004), multi currency revolving credit facility that will expire in July 2007. The Company employs this facility as a European wide working capital facility. The Company compensates participating banks in the form of fees, the amounts of which are not material. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had no borrowings under this facility. See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statement for additional details concerning the Companys credit facilities. 27 In 2003, the Company sold its New York corporate headquarters to an unrelated third party for $91.0 in cash; concurrently entering into a long term lease with respect to the space it occupies (approximately 40% of the building). The gain realized on the sale, after transaction costs, of $52.7, has been deferred and is being credited to income over the initial 27.5 year lease term. In 2002, the Company entered into agreements for the sale and leaseback of its Hazlet and South Brunswick, New Jersey facilities to an unrelated third party for $48.0 in cash. Concurrently, the Company entered into a long term lease with respect to the facilities. The gain realized on the sale, after transaction costs, of $26.7, has been deferred and is being credited to income over the initial 22 year lease term. In October 2002 and July 2004, the Companys Board of Directors authorized share repurchase programs of $100.0 each (approximately 2.4 million shares at the December 31, 2004 market price). Under various share repurchase programs, the Company repurchased 1.8 million shares in each of 2004 and 2003 and 2.3 million shares in 2002, at a cost of $66.5, $55.4 and $72.3, respectively. Average per share cost of shares acquired in 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $36.89, $31.66 and $31.52, respectively. The Company completed the October 2002 repurchase plan in August 2004 and as of December 31, 2004 had repurchased approximately 0.6 million shares under the July 2004 plan. Repurchases will be made from time to time on the open market or through private transactions as market and business conditions warrant. At December 31, 2004, the Company had $75.5 remaining under the July 2004 plan, representing approximately 1.8 million shares based on a stock price of $42.00 per share. Repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with the Companys employee benefit plans and for other general corporate purposes. The dividend paid per share in 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $.67, $.62 and $.60, respectively. In January and April 2004, the Company paid a quarterly cash dividend of $.16 per share to shareholders. In May 2004, the Company increased the annual dividend to $.70 per share, effective with the dividend paid in July 2004. The Companys intention is to pay dividends approximating 30 35% of yearly earnings. The Company paid dividends totaling $63.2, $58.2 and $56.8 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The cumulative translation adjustment component of Accumulated other comprehensive income was $8.2 at December 31, 2004, compared to ($45.2) at December 31, 2003. The change results principally from the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro, the Japanese Yen and the Australian dollar. The Minimum pension liability adjustment component of Accumulated other comprehensive income was ($110.7) at December 31, 2004, compared to ($82.8) at December 31, 2003. This change primarily reflects the effects of a reduction in the discount rate used to calculate pension liabilities. The accumulated loss on derivatives qualifying as hedges was ($5.7) at December 31, 2004 compared to ($3.7) at December 31, 2003. Compliance with existing governmental requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment has not materially affected the Companys operations, earnings or competitive position. In 2004, the Company spent $1.1 on capital projects and $14.1 in operating expenses and governmental charges for the purpose of complying with such regulations. Expenditures for these purposes will continue for the foreseeable future. In addition, the Company is party to a number of proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act or similar state statutes. It is expected that the impact of any judgments in or voluntary settlements of such proceedings will not be material to the Companys financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 28 At December 31, 2004, the Company has contractual payment obligations due within the time periods as specified in the following table: PAYMENTS DUE 2006 2008 2010 AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TOTAL 2005 2007 2009 THEREAFTER Borrowings (1) $ 661.5 $ 16.0 $ 499.4 $ 128.6 $ 17.5 Interest on borrowings (1) 64.7 36.0 23.5 4.2 1.0 Operating leases (2) 322.6 22.9 40.0 31.7 228.0 Purchase commitments (3) 31.6 31.5 0.1 Pension funding obligations (4) 67.0 51.6 2.2 2.2 11.0 Post retirement obligations (4) 38.9 3.5 6.4 7.1 21.9 Total $ 1,186.3 $ 161.5 $ 571.6 $ 173.8 $ 279.4 (1) See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of the Companys various borrowing facilities. (2) Operating leases include facility and other lease commitments executed in the normal course of the business. Additional details concerning the United States facilities are contained in Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and further details concerning worldwide aggregate operating leases are contained in Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (3) Purchase obligations and capital project commitments not recorded on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. (4) See Note 14 Retirement Benefits of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of the Companys retirement plans. Anticipated funding obligations are based on current actuarial assumptions. Funding requirements reported in the above table do not extend beyond 2014. The Company anticipates that all financing requirements will be funded from operations and credit facilities in place. The Company expects to be able to renew its credit facilities at terms comparable to its existing facilities. Cash flows from operations are currently expected to be sufficient to fund the Companys anticipated capital spending, dividends and other requirements including debt reduction for the next 12 18 months. The Company anticipates reducing borrowings by approximately $12.0 in 2005 as long term debt matures. In comparison, borrowings were reduced by approximately $185.0 and $145.0 in 2004 and 2003, respectively. MARKET RISK The Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. The Company evaluates and manages volatility relating to these exposures on a global basis to take advantage of netting opportunities that may exist. Identified net exposures are managed employing a number of techniques including, but not limited to, borrowings in local currencies and the use of certain derivative instruments. The Company operates on a global basis and, accordingly, is exposed to currency fluctuation related to the manufacture and sale of its products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The major foreign currencies involve the markets in the European Union, Mexico, Brazil, China, Indonesia, Australia and Japan, although all regions in the world are subject to foreign currency fluctuations versus the U.S. dollar and other cross currency rates. The Company actively monitors its foreign currency exposures in all major markets in which it operates, and employs a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, including foreign currency hedging activities. The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts with the objective of reducing exposure to cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency receivables and payables, and with anticipated purchases of certain raw materials used in operations. These contracts, the counterparties to which are major international financial institutions, generally involve the exchange of one currency for a second currency at a future date, and have maturities 29 which do not exceed six months. The notional amount and maturity dates of such contracts match those of the underlying transactions. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts approximating $383.2 and $178.0, respectively. The Company has designated these contracts as qualified fair value and cash flow hedges, as appropriate. Accordingly, the effective portion of any gain or loss on a derivative instrument reported as a cash flow hedge is reported as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income and recognized in earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The Company had no ineffective foreign currency forward contracts at December 31, 2004 or 2003. The Company employs various interest rate swaps and debt issuances with the objective of managing and optimizing its interest rate exposure. In 2001, the Company entered into certain interest swap agreements effectively converting the fixed coupon rate on its 6.45% Notes to a variable short term rate based on the London InterBank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus an interest markup. In response to changes in market conditions and the value of the swaps, and in 2003, in connection with the Companys debt repurchase, the Company periodically amended the swap agreements, changing the related interest spread. As a result of these amendments, the counterparty paid the Company $11.6 and $56.5 in 2003 and 2002, respectively, including accrued interest of $3.7 and $6.5, respectively. The net realized gains on the swaps have been deferred, classified as a separate component of debt, and are amortized as a reduction in interest expense over the remaining term of the Notes. Prior to December 31, 2003, the Company terminated all swap agreements related to the Notes; as a result, the interest rate on the Notes, including amortization of the deferred swap gains, was 3.4% at December 31, 2004. The effective rate on the Notes at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was 3.6% and 3.4%, respectively. In 2002, the Company entered into certain interest swap agreements effectively converting the fixed rate on its long term Japanese Yen borrowings to a variable short term rate based on the Japanese Yen LIBOR rate plus an interest markup. These swaps are designated as qualified fair value hedges. During 2003, the Company amended the swaps and the counterparty paid the Company $3.0, including accrued interest of $0.5. These net gains have been deferred, are classified as a separate component of debt and are being amortized over the remaining term of the debt. To the extent the Company has not received cash or otherwise amended or settled any swap agreements, any applicable mark to market adjustment relating to that swap is included as a separate component of debt. The Company had no ineffective interest rate swaps at December 31, 2004. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND USE OF ESTIMATES Preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and accompanying disclosures. These estimates are based on managements best judgment of current events and actions that the Company may undertake in the future. Actual results may ultimately differ from estimates, although management does not believe such changes will materially affect the financial statements in any individual year. Those areas requiring the greatest degree of management judgment or deemed most critical to the Companys financial reporting involve: The periodic assessment of potential impairment of intangible assets acquired in business combination. The Company currently has net intangible assets, including goodwill, of $789.7. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. In assessing its intangible assets, management uses the most current actual and forecasted operating data available, current market based assumptions and independent valuation experts. A two step approach is employed. The first step involves estimating the value of reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. The second step, if necessary, is to measure the value of the impairment loss, if one is determined to exist. Managements most subjective assumptions relate to the estimated/projected sales and operating growth values employed in the forecast. 30 The analysis and evaluation of collectibility of accounts receivable. The Company sells to large global and regional firms. The majority of sales are either made to order or products that the Company also employs in its own manufacturing process as a raw material. Judgment is required in assessing the realization of receivable balances, including assessment of the creditworthiness of the customers, and in evaluating varying circumstances that may impact the financial stability of a customer. Allowances for loss on collection are established based on currently available relevant facts, and are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information becomes available. The Companys historical experience indicates the allowance recorded has been sufficient to cover any reasonably expected potential loss with respect to its accounts receivable. The analysis and evaluation of income taxes. The Company accounts for taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 109, ("FAS 109"), Accounting for Income Taxes. Under FAS 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The provision for income taxes is based on domestic and international statutory income taxes rates and planning opportunities available in the various tax jurisdictions where the Company operates. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and tax positions. The Company may be challenged upon review by the applicable taxing authority and positions taken by the Company may not be sustained. The Company and its affiliates update these accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances. The evaluation of potential legal and environmental liabilities, where changing circumstances, rules and regulations require regular reassessment of related practices and anticipated costs. The Company is subject to certain legal claims regarding products and other matters, as well as environmental related matters. Significant management judgment is involved in determining when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the extent to which the liability can be reasonably estimated. The Company regularly assesses potential liabilities with respect to all legal claims based on the most recent available information, in consultation with outside counsel handling the defense of such matters, and other relevant independent experts. To the extent a liability is deemed to have been incurred and can be reasonably estimated, the Company recognizes a corresponding liability; if the estimated liability is a range, the Company recognizes that amount considered most likely, or in the absence of such a determination, the minimum expected liability. To the extent such claims are covered by various insurance policies, the Company separately evaluates the likelihood of recovery and accounts for any related insurance receivable. Critical management judgments involve determination as to whether a liability has been incurred, the extent of that liability, and any potential recovery under the Companys insurance coverage. The Company regularly evaluates its potential environmental exposure in terms of total estimated cost and also with respect to the viability of the other potentially responsible parties ("PRPs") associated with its exposure. The recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress and additional information becomes available. Critical management assumptions relate to expected total costs to remediate and the financial viability of PRPs to share such costs. Determination of the various assumptions employed in the valuation of pension and retiree health care expense and associated obligations. Amounts recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations. Inherent in such valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets, discount rates at which the liabilities could be settled, rates of increase in future compensation levels, mortality rates and health care cost trend rates. These assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In accordance with GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods. 31 With respect to the U.S. plans, the expected return on plan assets was determined based on an asset allocation model using the current benchmark allocation, real rates of return by asset class and an anticipated inflation rate. The benchmark asset allocation was: 5 15% in cash and fixed income investments expected to yield 1.6%; 15 25% employed in corporate and government bonds expected to yield 1.7 2.8%; and 65 75% in equity investments with a long term expected yield of 8.0 9.0%. The inflation rate assumed in the model was 2.5%. The plan has achieved a compound rate of return of 10.2% over the previous 15 years. The expected rate of return for the Non U.S. plans employs a similar set of criteria adapted for local investments, inflation rates and in certain cases specific government requirements. Discount rates used to determine future pension obligations of all plans are based on a review of long term bonds that receive a high rating by a recognized rating agency where the maturity of the bonds reasonably match the demographics of plan participants. The rate of compensation expense for all plans and the medical cost trend rate for the applicable U.S. plans are based on plan experience. Management establishes the assumptions concerning discount rates and actuarial assumptions based on current market conditions, including asset returns and other factors applicable under the circumstances. Changes in pension and other post employment benefits, and associated expenses, may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions. The impact that a .25% decrease in the discount rate or a 1% change in the medical cost trend rate would have on the Companys pension and other post employment benefit expense, as applicable, is discussed in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The ongoing assessment of the valuation of inventory, given the large number of natural ingredients employed, the quality of which may be diminished over time. The Company maintains between 40% and 55% of its inventory as raw materials, providing the greatest degree of flexibility in manufacture and use. Materials are evaluated based on shelf life, known uses and anticipated demand based on forecasted customer order activity and changes in product/sales mix. Management policy provides for an ongoing assessment of inventory with adjustments recorded when an item is deemed to be slow moving or obsolete. Management believes that full consideration has been given to all relevant circumstances that the Company may be currently subject to, and the financial statements accurately reflect managements best estimate of the results of operations, financial condition and cash flows of the Company for the years presented. Management has discussed the decision process and selection of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123 (R) ("FAS 123"), Share Based Payment was issued in December 2004. The standard is effective for the first reporting period beginning after June 15, 2005. FAS 123, as revised, supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. The Statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. The Company has three options available for implementation and is evaluating which option it will choose as well as the impact of adopting this standard under each option. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES The discussion of the Companys historical results and its commentary regarding expected future results include and, where indicated, exclude the impact of sales and operating results attributable to certain non core businesses disposed of in 2004 and 2002, the impact of certain restructuring and other charges as well as the effects of exchange rate fluctuations. Such information is supplemental to information presented in accordance with GAAP and is not intended to represent a presentation in accordance with GAAP. In discussing its historical and expected future results and financial condition, the Company believes it is meaningful for investors to be made aware of and to be assisted in a better understanding of, on a period to period comparative basis, the relative impact of restructuring and other charges, the impact of sales and operating results attributable to certain non core businesses disposed 32 of, and the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on operating results and financial condition. The Company believes this additional non GAAP information provides investors with an overall perspective of the period to period performance of the Companys core business. In addition, management considers each of these non GAAP measures to evaluate performance on a comparative period to period basis in terms of absolute performance and trend performance and expected future performance with respect to its core continuing business. CAUTIONARY STATEMENT UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 Statements in this Annual Report, which are not historical facts or information, are "forward looking statements" within the meaning of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward looking statements which may be identified by such words as "expect," "anticipate," "outlook," "guidance," "may," and similar forward looking terminology, involve significant risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause the actual results of the Company to be materially different from any future results expressed or implied by such forward looking statements, and there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from managements expectations. Such factors include, among others, the following: general economic and business conditions in the Companys markets, including economic, population health and political uncertainties; weather, geopolitical and region specific uncertainties; interest rates; the price and availability of raw materials; the Companys ability to implement its business strategy, including the achievement of anticipated cost savings, profitability and growth targets; the impact of currency fluctuation or devaluation in the Companys principal foreign markets and the success of the Companys hedging and risk management strategies; the impact of possible pension funding obligations and increased pension expense on the Companys cash flow and results of operations; and the effect of legal and regulatory proceedings, as well as restrictions imposed on the Company, its operations or its representatives by foreign governments; and the fact that the outcome of litigation is highly uncertain and unpredictable and there can be no assurance that the triers of fact or law, at either the trial level or at any appellate level, will accept the factual assertions, factual defenses or legal positions of the Company or its factual or expert witnesses in any such litigation or other proceedings. The Company intends its forward looking statements to speak only as of the time of such statements and does not undertake to update or revise them as more information becomes available or to reflect changes in expectations, assumptions or results. 33 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. In 2001, the Company entered into certain interest swap agreements effectively converting the fixed coupon rate on its 6.45% Notes to a variable short term rate based on the London InterBank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus an interest markup. In response to changes in market conditions and the value of the swaps and, in 2003, in connection with the Companys debt repurchase, the Company periodically amended the swap agreements, changing the related interest spread. As a result of these amendments, the counterparty paid the Company $11.6 million and $56.5 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively, including accrued interest of $3.7 million and $6.5 million, respectively. The net realized gains on the swaps have been deferred, classified as a separate component of debt, and are amortized as a reduction in interest expense over the remaining term of the Notes. Prior to December 31, 2003, the Company terminated all swap agreements related to the Notes; as a result, the interest rate on the Notes, including amortization of the deferred swap gains, was 3.4% at December 31, 2004. The effective rate on the Notes at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was 3.6% and 3.4%, respectively. In 2002, the Company entered into certain interest swap agreements effectively converting the fixed rate on its long term Japanese Yen borrowings to a variable short term rate based on the Japanese Yen LIBOR rate plus an interest markup. These swaps are designated as qualified fair value hedges. During 2003, the Company amended the swaps and the counterparty paid the Company $3.0 million, including accrued interest of $0.5 million. These net gains have been deferred, are classified as a separate component of debt and are being amortized over the remaining term of the debt. To the extent the Company has not received cash or otherwise amended or settled any swap agreements, any applicable mark to market adjustment relating to that swap is included as a separate component of debt. The Company had no ineffective interest rate swaps at December 31, 2004. The Company has executed a 10 year Yen U.S. dollar currency swap related to the purchase and sale of products between the U.S. and Japan. The annual notional value of this swap is approximately $5.0 million. Gains and losses related to this swap are recorded currently, and the mark to market adjustment related to the value of the swap is reflected as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts with the objective of reducing exposure to cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency receivables and payables, and with anticipated purchases of certain raw materials used in operations. These contracts, the counterparties to which are major international financial institutions, generally involve the exchange of one currency for a second currency at a future date, and have maturities not exceeding six months. The notional amount and maturity dates of such contracts match those of the underlying transactions. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of $383.2 million and $178.0 million, respectively. The Company has designated these contracts as qualified fair value and cash flow hedges, as appropriate. The Company had no ineffective foreign currency forward contracts at December 31, 2004 or 2003. The Company also uses derivative financial instruments to hedge foreign currency exposures resulting from firm purchase commitments or anticipated transactions, and classifies these as cash flow hedges. The Company generally enters into cash flow hedge contracts for periods ranging from three to twelve months. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income, and is reclassified into earnings as the transactions being hedged are recorded. The associated asset or liability on the open hedge is recorded in Other Assets or other liabilities as applicable. The foreign exchange gain recorded as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income that will be reflected in earnings in 2005 was $1.3 million, net of tax, at December 31, 2004; the prior year comparable amount was $1.4 million. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instruments was not material.
