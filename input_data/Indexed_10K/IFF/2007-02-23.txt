ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Organization of Information Managements Discussion and Analysis provides a narrative on the Companys operating performance, financial condition and liquidity and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements. It includes the following sections: &bull; Executive Overview &bull; Sales Commentary &bull; Operating Results &bull; Acquisitions and Divestitures &bull; Restructuring and Other Charges &bull; Equity Compensation Plans &bull; Financial Condition &bull; Market Risk &bull; Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates &bull; New Accounting Standards &bull; Non GAAP Financial Measures &bull; Cautionary Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 Executive Overview The Company is a leading creator and manufacturer of flavor and fragrance compounds used to impart or improve the flavor or fragrance in a wide variety of consumer products. The precise size of the global market for flavors and fragrances is difficult to determine because the industry is highly fragmented, both geographically and along product lines; there are few publicly traded companies in the industry; certain customers maintain in house capabilities fulfilling a portion of their flavor or fragrance needs; and the quality and depth of market information in developing regions of the world is limited. Analysts generally estimate the global market to be $11 &ndash; $12 billion of which IFF represents approximately 17% &ndash; 18%; the Companys nearest sized competitor is of similar size, although it is in the process of acquiring another flavor and fragrance supplier which will result in it being substantially larger than IFF. Currently, the five largest companies in the industry combined represent approximately 65% &ndash; 70% of the global market. Fragrance compounds are used in perfumes, cosmetics, toiletries, hair care products, deodorants, soaps, detergents and softeners as well as air care products. Major fragrance customers include the cosmetics industry, including perfume and toiletries manufacturers, and the household products industry, including manufacturers of soaps, detergents, household cleaners and air fresheners. Flavor products are sold to the food and beverage industries for use in consumer products such as prepared foods, beverages, dairy, food and confectionery products. The Company is also a leading manufacturer of synthetic ingredients used in making fragrances. Approximately 55% of the Companys ingredient production is consumed internally; the balance is sold to third party customers. Changing social habits resulting from such factors as changes in disposable income, leisure time, health concerns, urbanization and population growth stimulate demand for consumer products utilizing flavors and fragrances. These developments expand the market for products with finer fragrance quality, as well as the market for colognes and toiletries. Such developments also stimulate demand for convenience foods, soft drinks and low fat food products that must conform to expected tastes. These developments necessitate the creation and development of flavors and fragrances and ingredients that are compatible with newly introduced materials and methods of application used in consumer products. 18 Flavors and fragrances are generally: &bull; created for the exclusive use of a specific customer; &bull; sold in solid or liquid form, in amounts ranging from a few pounds to several tons depending on the nature of the end product in which they are used; &bull; a small percentage of the volume and cost of the end product sold to the consumer; and &bull; a major factor in consumer selection and acceptance of the product. Flavors and fragrances have similar economic and operational characteristics, including research and development, the nature of the creative and production processes, the manner in which products are distributed and the type of customer; many of the Companys customers purchase both flavors and fragrances. The flavor and fragrance industry is impacted by macroeconomic factors in all product categories and geographic regions. Such factors include the impact of currency on the price of raw materials and operating costs as well as on translation of reported results. In addition, pricing pressure placed on the Companys customers by large and powerful retailers and distributors is inevitably passed along to the Company, and its competitors. Leadership in innovation and creativity mitigates the impact of pricing pressure. Success and growth in the industry is dependent upon creativity and innovation in meeting the many and varied needs of the customers products in a cost efficient and effective manner, and with a consistently high level of timely service and delivery. The Company produces more than 31,000 unique compounds, of which approximately 60% are flavors and 40% fragrances. The Company continually creates new compounds to meet the changing characteristics and needs of its customers end products. No single compound represents more than 1% of net sales. Development of fragrances and flavors is a complex technical and artistic process calling upon the combined knowledge and talents of creative perfumers and flavorists, and application and research chemists. An important element of creation is the development of new ingredients. The Company bears essentially all costs incurred in connection with the creation and development of new flavors and fragrances and such formulae are generally protected under trade secrecy. The Company is not materially dependent on any patents, trademarks or licenses. The Companys strategic direction is defined by the following: &bull; Be a global leader in fragrances and flavors; and &bull; Provide our customers with differentiated solutions. The Companys plan to achieve this strategy is to: &bull; Implement a business unit focus that will align management and resources with the needs of its strategic customers and provide greater accountability; this will drive improved results. &bull; Focus its research and development efforts on those projects considered most likely to drive future profitable growth. The Company anticipates much of this research will be conducted internally, but such efforts may be augmented by joint research undertakings and through acquisition of technology. &bull; Provide quality products, safe and suitable for inclusion in its customers end products; an essential element is the consistent quality and safety of raw materials achieved through a combination of steps including but not limited to vendor certification and quality assurance testing. &bull; Continuously improving its operations and customer service supported by the global enterprise requirements planning software package (SAP), and related initiatives. &bull; Build a culture that attracts, retains and develops the best talent in the world. Our customers, stakeholders and employees expect the best. As implementation of our strategy progresses, setting strategic initiatives requires regular establishment and reassessment of priorities and necessitates choices in order to provide the best opportunity for continuous improvement in shareholder value. 19 Sales Commentary A breakdown of sales by principal product category is depicted in the graph below. 2006 Sales by Category The Companys five largest customers comprise 31% of consolidated sales and its top thirty customers 57%; these percentages have remained fairly constant for several years although sales to larger customers, as a percentage of total sales, are trending higher. No customer accounts for 10% or more of sales. A key factor for commercial success is inclusion on core supplier lists of strategic customers, opening opportunities to win new business. The Company is currently on the majority of core supplier lists of its strategic customers. Net sales for 2006, 2005 and 2004 were as follows (in millions): Net Sales 2006 Percent Change 2005 Percent Change 2004 Flavors $ 895 4 % $ 858 &minus;6 % $ 911 Fragrances 1,200 6 % 1,135 1 % 1,123 Total net sales $ 2,095 5 % $ 1,993 &minus;2 % $ 2,034 The Company currently manages its operations by major geographical region and considers destination sales a key performance measure. Although reported sales and earnings are affected by the weakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar, this has not had a long term effect on the underlying strength of the Companys business. 2006 Sales by Destination 20 In 2004, the Company disposed of its European fruit preparation business; disposal did not materially impact operating results. The following table summarizes sales on a geographic basis and reflects adjustments, as appropriate, to exclude sales attributable to the fruit business (in millions): Sales by Destination 2006 Percent Change 2005 Percent Change 2004 North America $ 612 7 % $ 572 &minus;4 % $ 599 Europe 758 3 % 739 &minus;6 % 790 Asia Pacific 362 4 % 348 2 % 343 Latin America 286 9 % 262 10 % 239 India 77 7 % 72 14 % 63 Total net sales, as reported 2,095 5 % 1,993 &minus;2 % 2,034 Less: European fruit preparations &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; (59 ) Total net sales, as adjusted $ 2,095 5 % $ 1,993 1 % $ 1,975 Net sales below are adjusted to exclude all sales associated with the fruit business (in millions): Net Sales 2006 Percent Change 2005 Percent Change As Adjusted 2004 Flavors $ 895 4 % $ 858 1 % $ 852 Fragrances 1,200 6 % 1,135 1 % 1,123 Total net sales, as adjusted $ 2,095 5 % $ 1,993 1 % $ 1,975 2006 in Comparison to 2005 In 2006, net sales increased 5% in both dollars and local currency compared to 2005. The sales performance was led by strong growth in fine fragrances driven primarily by new product introductions and continued success of existing creations. Flavor sales increased compared to 2005 due to a combination of new product introductions and volume growth. Regional and product category sales performance for 2006 compared to the prior year, in reported dollars and local currency, was as follows: 2006 vs. 2005 % Change in Sales by Region of Destination Fine Functional Ingredients TotalFragrances Flavors Total North America Reported 20 % 2 % 10 % 10 % 3 % 7 % Europe Reported 7 % 5 % &minus;4 % 4 % 1 % 3 % Local Currency 8 % 5 % &minus;3 % 4 % 1 % 3 % Latin America Reported 25 % 2 % 6 % 8 % 11 % 9 % Asia Pacific Reported 9 % 3 % 2 % 4 % 4 % 4 % Local Currency 8 % 2 % 4 % 4 % 5 % 4 % India Reported 2 % &minus;4 % 29 % 3 % 10 % 7 % Local Currency 2 % &minus;4 % 31 % 3 % 10 % 7 % Total Reported 13 % 3 % 3 % 6 % 4 % 5 % Local Currency 13 % 3 % 3 % 6 % 4 % 5 % &bull; North America fine fragrances and flavors increased primarily from new product introductions of $25 million and $21 million, respectively; functional fragrances new product introductions totaled $14 million, the benefit of which was partially offset by declines in volume. Ingredient sales growth was due to a combination of both volume and price. 21 &bull; European growth was strongest in Eastern Europe, Middle East, France, Italy and Spain. Fine and functional fragrance growth resulted from new product introductions of $33 million in each category, while the decline in ingredients was volume related. Flavor growth was the result of new product introductions of $11 million, partially offset by declines in volume. &bull; Latin America fine fragrance sales growth resulted from new product introductions of $14 million while functional fragrance product introductions of $9 million were partially offset by volume decreases. Ingredient sales growth resulted from new product introductions. Flavor sales were strong throughout the region, driven mainly by new product introductions of $8 million. &bull; Asia Pacific fragrance sales growth resulted mainly from new product introductions of $4 million; ingredients sales growth was mainly volume related. Flavor sales growth resulted mainly from new product introductions of $6 million and volume growth. &bull; India fragrance sales performance was mainly volume related in all categories. Flavor sales increased due to volume growth and new production introductions of approximately $5 million. 2005 in Comparison to 2004 In 2005, reported sales declined 2% in dollars and 3% in local currency compared to 2004. The sales performance was led by strong growth in fine fragrances driven mainly by new wins. Flavor sales comparisons in 2005 were impacted by the disposition, in the second half of 2004, of the Companys European fruit preparations business. On an as adjusted basis, excluding the $59 million in sales attributable to the fruit business from 2004 results, both 2005 consolidated sales and flavor sales would have increased 1% in dollars and been flat in local currency. Flavor sales, most notably in North America and Europe, were also unfavorably impacted by lower selling prices for naturals, mainly vanilla. Regional and product category sales performance for 2005 compared to the prior year, in reported dollars and local currency, was as follows: 2005 vs. 2004 % Change in Sales by Region of Destination Fine Functional Ingredients TotalFragrances Flavors Total North America Reported 4 % &minus;8 % 3 % &minus;1 % &minus;7 % &minus;4 % Europe Reported 14 % &minus;4 % &minus;6 % 2 % &minus;18 % &minus;6 % Local Currency 13 % &minus;6 % &minus;7 % &mdash; &minus;19 % &minus;8 % Latin America Reported 4 % 7 % 7 % 7 % 21 % 10 % Asia Pacific Reported 5 % &minus;5 % 3 % &minus;2 % 4 % 2 % Local Currency 4 % &minus;6 % 3 % &minus;2 % 3 % 1 % India Reported 11 % 18 % &minus;2 % 13 % 16 % 14 % Local Currency 11 % 17 % &minus;4 % 12 % 16 % 14 % Total Reported 9 % &minus;2 % &minus;2 % 1 % &minus;6 % &minus;2 % Local Currency 8 % &minus;2 % &minus;2 % 1 % &minus;7 % &minus;3 % &bull; North America fine fragrance growth resulted from $14 million in new product introductions, although this growth was partially offset by erosion of existing products of $10 million. Functional fragrance sales realized new product introductions of $10 million though such growth was offset by erosion in existing products of $20 million. Flavors reported new product introductions of $21 million offset by erosion in existing products. &bull; Europe fine fragrance sales in local currency increased 13%, driven primarily by new product introductions, while functional fragrances and ingredient sales declines were mainly volume related. Flavor sales declined due to the disposition of the fruit preparations business. On an as adjusted basis, excluding sales attributable to the fruit business from 2004 results, 2005 flavor sales would have been flat in dollars and decreased 1% in local currency. 22 &bull; Latin America fragrance sales growth resulted from new product introductions of $18 million; the ingredient sales increase was volume related. Flavor sales were strong throughout the region, driven mainly by new product introductions of $9 million and volume growth. &bull; Asia Pacific fine fragrance sales growth resulted mainly from new product introductions of $3 million and volume growth; variations in functional fragrance and ingredient sales were mainly volume related. Flavor sales growth resulted from new product introductions of $4 million and volume growth. &bull; India sales increased in both local currency and reported dollars. In both flavors and fragrances, the sales performance reflected the benefit of new product introductions and continued strong economic conditions. Operating Results The relationship of cost of goods sold and other operating expenses to net sales was as follows: 2006 2005 2004 Cost of goods sold 57.8 % 58.6 % 57.1 % Research and development expenses 8.9 % 9.0 % 8.6 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 16.8 % 17.0 % 16.8 % Cost of goods sold includes the cost of materials and manufacturing expenses; raw materials generally constitute 70% of the total. Research expenses are for the development of new and improved products, technical product support, compliance with governmental regulations, and help in maintaining relationships with customers who are often dependent on technological advances. Selling, general and administrative expenses support the Companys sales and operating levels. Segment profit, which excludes the effect of restructuring and other charges, was $332 million in 2006, $290 million in 2005 and $342 million in 2004. The Company recorded restructuring and other charges of $3 million, $23 million, and $32 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Operating profit totaled $329 million, $267 million and $310 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. See Note 13 for further details. 2006 in Comparison to 2005 Cost of goods sold, as a percentage of sales, decreased 80 basis points compared with 2005. The decline was mainly the result of the improved sales performance, leading to better absorption of manufacturing expenses, and favorable product mix. The Company also benefited from the elimination of 69 manufacturing positions, mainly in North America and Europe, which resulted in savings of $4 million. The average cost of raw materials purchased by the Company increased 2% &ndash; 3% in comparison to the prior year. Research and Development (R&D) expenses were 8.9% of sales; spending in 2007 is expected to remain at approximately 9.0% of sales. Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) expenses were 16.8% of sales compared to 17.0% in 2005. The 2005 results included $8 million relating to a product contamination matter; 2006 results reflect a benefit of $3 million insurance recovery related to this contamination matter. The Company benefited from the elimination of 129 positions, mainly in North America and Europe, which resulted in savings in SG&A expense of $8 million. The 2006 results also include $31 million in incentive compensation expense driven by improved sales and operating performance; 2005 results included $5 million of such expense. 2005 in Comparison to 2004 Cost of goods sold, as a percentage of sales, increased 150 basis points compared with 2004, mainly due to higher raw material costs which the Company was unable to fully recover through increased selling prices; overall, the average cost of raw materials purchased increased 5% &ndash; 6% in 23 comparison to the prior year. Cost of sales include $3 million attributable to a vendor supplied raw material contamination issue, primarily testing costs and the write off of affected materials. Cost of goods sold was also impacted by lower expense absorption attributable to the facility closure in Dijon and the cost of transfer of related production to other manufacturing locations; production at Dijon ceased in March 2005. Research and Development (R&D) expenses increased to 9.0% of sales, consistent with the Companys stated intention to expand its research initiatives. Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased to 17.0% from 16.8%. In 2005, SG&A expenses include $8 million related to the cost of customer damages attributable to the raw material contamination issue. The Company continues to seek full indemnification from its supplier, the suppliers insurers and, to the extent necessary, its own insurers, but no related insurance receivable was recorded in the 2005 results. These costs were partially offset by lower accruals under the Companys various incentive plans; the 2005 results include $5 million of such expense compared to $23 million in 2004. In 2005, cost of goods sold and SG&A include $2 million and $4 million, respectively, relating to the implementation of SAP; these costs relate to training and data conversion and are charged to operating expenses as incurred. Implementation of SAP was essentially complete at December 31, 2005. Interest Expense Interest expense totaled $26 million, $24 million and $24 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The average interest rate was 3.3%, 3.3% and 3.2% in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Additional details are contained in Note 9. Other (Income) Expense, Net Other (income) expense, net was $10 million income in 2006, $3 million income in 2005 and $5 million expense in 2004. In 2006, income resulted from gains on asset sales of $18 million, partially offset by higher exchange losses and other non operating expenses. In 2005, income resulted primarily from exchange gains and higher levels of interest income earned on higher cash balances. Exchange (losses) or gains were ($7) million, $3 million and ($3) million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The exchange losses in 2006 and 2004 were mainly the result of the Company having U.S. dollar positions in Europe and Latin America which resulted in exchange losses upon the weakening of the U.S. dollar in comparison to the Euro and other currencies. Income Taxes The effective tax rate for 2006, 2005 and 2004 was 27.7%, 21.6% and 30.2%, respectively. The effective tax rate fluctuates as a result of earnings in the countries in which the Company operates. The 2005 rate was significantly reduced due to a tax benefit associated with the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA) which provided for a one time tax deduction of 85% of dividends received on eligible repatriated foreign earnings. Tax expense in 2005 reflects a benefit of $25 million relating to the repatriation of $242 million of dividends under AJCA; excluding this benefit, the effective tax rate for 2005 would have been 31.6%. Acquisitions and Divestitures In 2004, the Company sold its European fruit preparations business which manufactured processed fruit and other natural product preparations used in a variety of food products. Sales of fruit preparations in 2004 were $59 million and operating profit was $6 million. Proceeds from the sale were $40 million, including assumption of certain liabilities; cash proceeds were used to reduce borrowings. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $746 million and $773 million, respectively. The Company completed its annual 24 assessments in 2006, 2005 and 2004, concluding that it has no impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets. Additional details are contained in Note 5. Restructuring and Other Charges With respect to the restructuring and other charges, (i) separation costs for employees relate primarily to severance, outplacement and other benefit costs; (ii) asset write down charges relate to establishment of the new carrying value for assets held for sale or disposal; and (iii) other costs include lease termination costs and other reorganization expenses incurred to effect either employee separation or location closure. In 2004, the Company disposed of its European fruit preparations business, closed its Canadian manufacturing facility and committed to the closure of its manufacturing facility in Dijon, France; the Dijon facility closed in 2005. In 2005, the Company undertook to eliminate 300 positions in manufacturing, selling, research and administration functions, principally in its European and North American regions. The majority of affected positions involved employee separation while the balance related to open positions that will not be filled. The Company anticipated recording pre tax restructuring charges of $25 million to $30 million relating primarily to employee separation expenses; $23 million was recognized in 2005 and $3 million was recorded in 2006. This plan is essentially complete. Annualized savings from these actions are approximately $16 $18 million. As a result of the actions described above, restructuring charges and positions eliminated (including those not replaced in the 2005 program) by region in each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006 were as follows (dollars in millions): Positions Eliminated Restructuring Charges 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 North America 83 140 56 $ 2 $ 10 $ 8 Europe 76 261 234 (1 ) 10 23 Asia Pacific 29 22 11 1 1 1 Latin America 5 4 1 &mdash; 1 &mdash; India 5 2 &mdash; 1 1 &mdash; Total 198 429 302 $ 3 $ 23 $ 32 Movements in accruals in each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006 were (in millions): Employee Related Asset Relatedand Other Total Balance January 1, 2004 $ 20 $ 1 $ 21 Additional charges 26 22 48 Cash and other costs (17 ) (9 ) (26 ) Balance December 31, 2004 29 14 43 Additional charges 22 1 23 Cash and other costs (21 ) (11 ) (32 ) Balance December 31, 2005 30 4 34 Additional charges (credits) 4 (1 ) 3 Cash and other costs (21 ) (1 ) (22 ) Balance December 31, 2006 $ 13 $ 2 $ 15 The 2004 asset related charges exclude gains of $16 million arising on the sale of the fruit businesses and the Canadian facility; such gains were considered in determining Restructuring and other charges of $32 million reported. The 2006 asset related credit resulted from a gain on disposition of the Dijon facility. The employee related liabilities are expected to be utilized by 2008 as obligations are satisfied; asset related charges are expected to be utilized in 2007 on final decommissioning and disposal of affected assets. 25 Equity Compensation Plans The Company has various equity plans under which the Companys officers, senior management, directors and other key employees may be granted the opportunity to acquire the Companys common stock or other forms of equity based awards. The equity compensation plans are more fully described in Note 12. Prior to 2006, the Company applied the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25) under which no compensation expense for stock options was recognized in net earnings, and provided the pro forma disclosures required by Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 123, Share Based Compensation (FAS 123). Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of FASB Statement No. 123(R) Share Based Payment (FAS 123(R)) which superceded FAS 123. The Company elected the modified prospective method, which requires cost measurement of stock based awards at fair value on the grant date and recognition of expense over the expected vesting term. Under this method, 2006 expense includes the portion vesting in the year for (1) all share based payments granted prior to, but not vested, as of January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of FAS 123, and (2) all share based payments granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of FAS 123(R). The Company will recognize the cost of all stock options on a straight line attribution basis over their respective vesting periods, net of estimated forfeitures. Compensation cost and the related tax benefit for unvested stock option awards issued prior to adoption of FAS 123(R) totaled $3 million and $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Results for prior periods have not been restated. Financial Condition Cash, cash equivalents and short term investments totaled $115 million at December 31, 2006 compared to $273 million and $33 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Working capital totaled $633 million at year end 2006 compared to ($11) million and $562 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 2005 working capital balance resulted from the classification of certain debt as current due to its maturity in May 2006; such debt was refinanced during 2006. The financial condition of the Company continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by substantial cash flow from operations and ready access to capital markets at competitive rates. Operating cash flow provides the primary source of funds for operating and capital needs as well as dividends paid to shareholders, and share repurchase activities. The Company currently anticipates cash flows from operations and credit facilities in place are sufficient to fund the Companys anticipated capital spending, dividends and other expected requirements for the next 12 &ndash; 18 months. Operating cash flow in 2006 was $263 million compared to $177 million and $296 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Operating cash flow increased in 2006 as a result of improved sales and operating results; net earnings adjusted for non cash items (primarily depreciation, amortization, and equity based compensation) was the primary source of operating cash flows. Improvements in inventory and current payables were sufficient to offset an increase in receivables; the increases in receivables and payables supported the business growth achieved in the year. Operating cash flow in 2005 declined compared to 2004 primarily as a result of the decline in both sales and operating results. The impact of the lower operating results was increased by unfavorable changes in both receivables and payables and a non cash adjustment to deferred income taxes related to the AJCA tax benefit. Net investing activities in 2006 utilized $31 million compared to $91 million and $31 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Investing cash outflows fluctuated, in part, due to the level of capital expenditures which totaled $58 million in 2006 compared to $93 million in 2005 and $71 million in 2004. Fluctuations in spending between years is subject to the timing and stage of completion of 26 capital projects. Spending in 2005 was higher, primarily as a result of significant projects involving a new chemical plant in China and a creative center in India; there were no major individual projects in either 2006 or 2004. Gross additions to property, plant and equipment are expected to approximate $70 million in 2007. In both 2006 and 2004, the Company realized significant cash proceeds from the sale of assets. The 2006 proceeds totaling $27 million, related principally to the sale of both land and buildings; to the extent such assets had been written down in connection with previous restructuring activities, any gain or loss on disposition was accounted for as part of the restructuring activities. The 2004 proceeds of $39 million resulted primarily from the disposition of the European Fruit Business. All sales were to third party investors and the Company retained no ownership interest in the disposed assets. Compliance with existing governmental requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment has not materially affected the Companys operations, earnings or competitive position. In 2006, the Company spent $4 million on capital projects and $16 million in operating expenses and governmental charges for the purpose of complying with such regulations. Expenditures for these purposes will continue for the foreseeable future. In addition, the Company is party to a number of proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act or similar state statutes. It is expected that the impact of any judgments in or voluntary settlements of such proceedings will not be material to the Companys financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. The dividend paid per share in 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $.74, $.72 and $.67, respectively. In January, April and July 2006, the Company paid a quarterly cash dividend of $.185 per share to shareholders. In October 2006, the Company announced a 14% increase in its quarterly dividend rate to $.21 per share effective with the dividend payable in January 2007. The Company paid dividends totaling $67 million, $68 million and $63 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The payment of dividends is determined by the Board in its discretion based on various factors, and there can be no assurance that any level of dividends will be paid. In 2004, 2005 and 2006, the Companys Board of Directors authorized share repurchase programs of $100 million, $200 million and $300 million, respectively. Under these programs, the Company repurchased 6.9 million, 2.6 million and 1.8 million shares in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively; spending on share repurchases in 2006, 2005 and 2004 totaled $271 million, $98 million and $67 million, respectively, at an average cost per share of $39.33, $38.01 and $36.89, respectively. At December 31, 2006, the Company had $206 million remaining under the October 2006 plan, representing approximately 4.2 million shares based on a stock price of $49.00 per share. Repurchased shares are available for use in connection with the Companys employee benefit plans and for other general corporate purposes. The cumulative translation adjustment component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) was ($32) million at December 31, 2006, compared to ($47) million at December 31, 2005. The change results principally from the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro, the Japanese Yen and the Australian dollar during 2006. The pension and postemployment liability adjustment component of Accumulated other comprehensive income was ($163) million at December 31, 2006; the Minimum pension liability adjustment was ($100) million at December 31, 2005; pensions are discussed in more detail in Note 14. The accumulated loss on derivatives qualifying as hedges was $2 million at December 31, 2006 compared to $3 million at December 31, 2005. The Company maintains a level of short term and long term debt after evaluating a number of factors, including cash flow from operations, anticipated capital expenditures, dividends and anticipated share repurchase activities, as well as the overall cost of capital. At December 31, 2006, total debt was $807 million, compared to $951 million and $685 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Total debt at December 31, 2005 increased in connection with the Companys plan to repatriate dividends under the AJCA provisions, and in anticipation of refinancing $500 million in Notes, which were scheduled to mature in May 2006; a portion of these Notes were refinanced by the issuance of $375 million of Senior Unsecured Notes in July 2006, with the remaining $125 million retired using available cash on hand. Additional details on debt are included in Note 9. 27 The Company supplements short term liquidity with access to capital markets, mainly through the issuance of commercial paper, and bank credit facilities. In 2005, the Company and certain subsidiaries entered into a revolving credit agreement (the Facility) with certain banks. The Facility provides for a five year US $350 million (Tranche A) and Euro 400 million (Tranche B) multi currency revolving credit facility. Tranche A is available for commercial paper backstop and general corporate purposes; Tranche B is available to European subsidiaries for general corporate purposes. Borrowings bear interest at an annual rate of LIBOR (London Inter Bank Offer Rate) (or in relation to any Euro denominated loans, EURIBOR, European Inter Bank Offer Rate) plus a margin, currently 20 basis points, linked to the Companys credit rating. The Company pays a commitment fee on the aggregate unused commitments and a utilization fee on amounts outstanding under the Facility; such fees are not material. As permitted by the Facility in 2006, the termination dates were extended by one year until November 23, 2011. The Company may request a second extension for one additional year. The Facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants, including requiring the Company to maintain, at the end of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of net debt for borrowed money to EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) in respect of the previous 12 month period of not more than 3.25 to 1. The Company has complied with this covenant at all times. In the event of default, the lenders may terminate the Facility and declare any principal amount then outstanding and all accrued interest, fees and other amounts immediately due and payable. Defaults under the Agreement which could result in the acceleration by the lenders of the obligations of the Company Parties include a change of control of the Company (as defined in the Facility) and certain acquisitions made in contemplation of a merger where as a direct result of the acquisition, the public debt rating of the Company quoted by Moodys or S&P (including any change in terms of its outlook) is a lower rating than its public debt rating immediately prior to such acquisition. Additional details regarding the Facility are in Note 9. In addition to the Facility, the Company and various subsidiaries had unused lines of credit totaling $701 million at December 31, 2006 compared to $641 million at December 31, 2005. The Companys Moodys and Standard & Poors (S&P) short term credit rating are P2 and A2, respectively; Moodys and S&Ps long term ratings are A3 and BBB+, respectively, with a neutral outlook. At December 31, 2006, the Company has contractual payment obligations as specified in the following table (in millions): Payments Due Contractual Obligations Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 andthereafter Borrowings(1) $ 807 $ 16 $ 163 $ 403 $ 225 Interest on borrowings(1) 206 36 68 58 44 Operating leases(2) 303 23 39 32 209 Purchase commitments(3) 14 14 &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; Pension funding obligations(4) 49 22 6 6 15 Post retirement obligations(4) 48 3 8 9 28 Total $ 1,427 $ 114 $ 284 $ 508 $ 521 (1) See Note 9 for a further discussion of the Companys various borrowing facilities. (2) Operating leases include facility and other lease commitments executed in the normal course of the business. Additional details concerning the United States facilities are contained in Note 8 and further details concerning worldwide aggregate operating leases are contained in Note 17. (3) Purchase obligations and capital project commitments not recorded on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. (4) See Note 14 for a further discussion of the Companys retirement plans. Anticipated funding obligations are based on current actuarial assumptions. Funding requirements reported in the above table do not extend beyond 2016 as the Company has not quantified any funding obligations past this point. 28 Market Risk The Company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. The Company evaluates and manages volatility relating to these exposures on a global basis to take advantage, where applicable, of netting opportunities that may exist. Identified net exposures are managed employing a number of techniques including, but not limited to, borrowings in local currencies and the use of certain derivative instruments. The Company operates on a global basis and is exposed to currency fluctuation related to the manufacture and sale of products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The major foreign currencies involve the markets in the European Union, Mexico, Brazil, China, Indonesia, Australia and Japan, although all regions are subject to foreign currency fluctuations. The Company actively monitors its foreign currency exposures in all major markets in which it operates, and employs a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, including foreign currency hedging activities. The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts with the objective of reducing exposure to cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency receivables and payables, and with anticipated purchases of certain raw materials used in operations. These contracts, the counterparties to which are major international financial institutions, generally involve the exchange of one currency for a second currency at a future date, and have maturities not exceeding six months. The notional amount and maturity dates of such contracts match those of the underlying transactions. The gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recorded in earnings at the same time as the transaction being hedged is recorded in earnings. The associated asset or liability on the open hedge instrument is recorded in Current Assets or Current Liabilities, as applicable. The Company has executed a 10 year Yen &ndash; U.S. dollar currency swap related to the monthly sale and purchase of products between the U.S. and Japan. The annual notional value of this swap is $5 million. Gains and losses related to this swap are recorded currently, and the mark to market adjustment related to the value of the swap is reflected as a component of AOCI. The Company entered into a $300 million Cross Currency Interest Rate Swap transaction to hedge a portion of its consolidated Euro net investment. The derivative was structured as a swap of floating USD LIBOR to floating EURIBOR, with both floating interest rates reset and paid semi annually, ensuring that the terms of the swap match identically. Because the derivative is structured as a floating to floating swap, the only value, other than that derived from changes in the foreign exchange (FX) spot rate, are interest rate accruals which are reset semi annually. Thus, these accruals are netted and booked in current earnings. Mark to market changes due to differences in the underlying FX rate are recorded in AOCI and provide an offset to the cumulative translation adjustment of the underlying Euro assets being hedged, which are also being valued based on changes in the FX spot rate. Effectiveness is assessed quarterly. At maturity, or if the swap is terminated early, any gain or loss will not be recorded to earnings, but will be recorded to AOCI until the Euro net investment is divested. Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates Preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) requires estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and accompanying disclosures. These estimates are based on managements best judgment of current events and actions that the Company may undertake in the future. Actual results may ultimately differ materially from estimates, although management does not believe such changes will materially affect the financial statements in any individual year. Those material areas requiring the greatest degree of management judgment or deemed most critical to the Companys financial reporting involve: The periodic assessment of potential impairment of intangible assets acquired in business combinations. Intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually. In assessing its intangible assets, management uses the most current actual and forecasted operating data available, current market based assumptions and independent valuation experts. A two step approach is employed. 29 The first step involves estimating the value of reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. The second step, if necessary, is to measure the value of the impairment loss, if any. Managements most subjective assumptions relate to the estimated/projected sales and operating growth values employed in the forecast. The analysis and evaluation of income taxes. The Company accounts for taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (FAS 109). Under FAS 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, based on tax laws as currently enacted. The provision for income taxes is based on statutory income tax rates and planning opportunities available in the various tax jurisdictions where the Company operates. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and tax positions. The Company may be challenged upon review by the applicable taxing authority and positions taken by the Company may not be sustained. The Company regularly updates these accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances. In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FAS 109 (FIN 48). The interpretation contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with FAS 109. The first step is to evaluate the tax positions for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution. In implementing FIN 48, the Company will need to evaluate individual tax benefits using these evaluation methods and will need to make judgments on how to disaggregate its various tax positions and then to analyze the tax positions. The Company is required to adopt FIN 48 at the beginning of 2007. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact of this interpretation, but does not believe its adoption will have a material impact on the Companys results or financial condition. The evaluation of potential legal and environmental liabilities, where changing circumstances, rules and regulations require regular reassessment of related practices and anticipated costs. The Company is subject to certain legal claims regarding products and other matters, as well as environmental related matters. Significant management judgment is involved in determining when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the extent to which it can be reasonably estimated. The Company regularly assesses potential liabilities with respect to all legal claims based on the most recent available information, in consultation with outside counsel handling the defense of such matters, and other relevant independent experts. To the extent a liability is deemed to have been incurred and can be reasonably estimated, the Company recognizes a corresponding accrual; if the reasonably estimated liability is a range, the Company recognizes that amount considered most likely, or in the absence of such a determination, the minimum reasonably expected liability. To the extent such claims are covered by insurance, the Company separately evaluates the likelihood of recovery and accounts for any related insurance receivable. Management judgments involve a determination as to whether a liability has been incurred, the reasonably estimated amount of that liability, and any potential insurance recovery. The Company regularly evaluates its potential environmental exposure in terms of total estimated cost and with respect to the viability of other potentially responsible parties (PRPs) associated with its exposure. Recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress and additional information becomes available. Critical management assumptions relate to expected total costs to remediate and the financial viability of PRPs to share such costs. Determination of the various assumptions employed in the valuation of pension and retiree health care expense and associated obligations. Amounts recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations. Inherent in such valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets, 30 discount rates at which the liabilities could be settled, rates of increase in future compensation levels, mortality rates and health care cost trend rates. These assumptions are updated annually. In accordance with GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods. With respect to the U.S. plans, the expected return on plan assets was determined based on an asset allocation model using the current benchmark allocation, real rates of return by asset class and an anticipated inflation rate. The benchmark asset allocation was: 10 &ndash; 20% in cash and fixed income investments expected to yield 1.0%; 10 &ndash; 20% employed in corporate and government bonds expected to yield 2.1%; and 65 &ndash; 75% in equity investments with a long term expected yield of 8.5 &ndash; 9.3%. The inflation rate assumed in the model was 2.5%. The plan has achieved a compound annual rate of return of 9.6% over the previous 20 years. The discount rate used for determining future pension obligations for each individual plan is based on a review of long term bonds that receive a high rating from a recognized rating agency. The discount rate was based on the internal rate of return for a portfolio of Moodys Aa3 rated high quality bonds with maturities that are consistent with the projected future benefit payment obligations of the plan. The rate of compensation increase for all plans and the medical cost trend rate for the applicable U.S. plans are based on plan experience. With respect to the non U.S. plans, the expected return on plan assets was determined based on an asset allocation model for each plan using an allocation designed to meet the needs of the plan or, in certain cases, specific government requirements, rates of return by asset class and an anticipated inflation rate. The discount rate used for determining future pension obligations for each plan is based on a review of long term bonds that receive a high rating from a recognized rating agency with durations comparable to that of the plan liabilities and other criteria appropriate for the local market. The rate of compensation increase is based on plan experience and expected increases. Management establishes the assumptions concerning discount rates and actuarial assumptions based on current market conditions, including asset returns and other factors applicable under the circumstances. Changes in pension and other post employment benefits, and associated expenses, may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions. The impact a .25% decrease in the discount rate or a 1% change in the medical cost trend rate would have on the Companys pension and other post employment benefit expense, as applicable, is discussed in Note 14. The ongoing assessment of the valuation of inventory, given the large number of natural ingredients employed, the quality of which may be diminished over time. The Company maintains between 40% and 55% of its inventory as raw materials, providing the greatest degree of flexibility in manufacture and use. Materials are evaluated based on shelf life, known uses and anticipated demand based on forecasted customer order activity and changes in product/sales mix. Company policy provides for an ongoing assessment of inventory with adjustments recorded when an item is deemed to be slow moving or obsolete. Determination of various assumptions employed in the calculation of Equity Compensation expense. Amounts recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements related to equity compensation are determined based on the number of awards and type of award as well as specific assumptions regarding expected life, stock price volatility, risk free interest rate and the dividend yield. These assumptions are employed in the Binomial lattice pricing model used to value certain awards. The Company changed its valuation model used for estimating the fair value of options/SSARs granted on January 1, 2006, from a Black Scholes option pricing model to a Binomial lattice pricing model. The Binomial model can accommodate a broader array of inputs, such as stock price volatility and interest rates. The Black Scholes model does not allow for incorporation of changes in such variables. The Company utilizes historical information to estimate expected term and forfeitures within the valuation model. The expected term of an option is based on historical exercise behavior, vesting terms and a contractual life of primarily ten years for options 31 and seven years for SSARs. The risk free interest rate for periods within the expected term of the award is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Expected volatility is based on an average of implied and historical volatility of the price of the Companys common stock over the calculated expected term. The Company anticipates paying cash dividends in the future and therefore uses an expected dividend yield in the valuation model; the cash dividend in effect at the time of grant was employed in this calculation. These assumptions are evaluated at each grant date. If factors change and the Company employs different assumptions for estimating share based compensation expense in future periods or if the Company decides to use a different valuation model, the future periods may differ significantly from what the Company has recorded in the current period and could materially affect operating income, net income and net income per share. Management believes that it has considered relevant circumstances that the Company may be currently subject to, and the financial statements accurately reflect managements best estimate of the results of operations, financial condition and cash flows of the Company for the years presented. Management has discussed the decision process and selection of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. New Accounting Standards In December 2004, the FASB issued FAS 123(R), which is effective for the first reporting period beginning after December 15, 2005. FAS 123(R) supersedes APB 25 and establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. Under FAS 123(R), the Company must determine the fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments, the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption. The Company is employing the Binomial lattice pricing model, and recognizes the cost of all employee stock options on a straight line basis over their respective vesting periods, net of estimated forfeitures. The Company adopted the new standard in 2006; adoption reduced 2006 annual earnings by $2 million based on unvested options outstanding. This impact does not contemplate awards issued, cancelled or forfeited in 2006 or the tax impact related to the initial adoption of this standard. Further details are included in Note 12. In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48 which clarifies the application of FAS 109 by prescribing the minimum threshold a tax position must meet before being recognized in the financial statements. Under FIN 48, the financial statement effect of a tax position is initially recognized when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of benefit, determined on a cumulative probability basis, that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority. FIN 48 is effective for years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact of this interpretation but does not believe its adoption will have a material impact on the Companys results or financial condition. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections (FAS 154). This Statement replaces Accounting Principles Board No. 20, Accounting Changes, and FASB Statement No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements, and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. FAS 154 is effective for years beginning after December 15, 2006. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (FAS 157). This standard defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements. FAS 157 is effective for years beginning after December 15, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this standard. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132R (FAS 158). This Statement requires an employer to recognize the over or under funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position 32 and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through AOCI. FAS 158 also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan at its year end. FAS 158 is effective for years ending after December 15, 2006 and the Company has implemented this standard using the prospective application approach. Further details are included in Note 14. In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108) effective at the end of the Companys 2006 operating year. The adoption of SAB 108 had no impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. Non GAAP Financial Measures To supplement the Companys financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, the Company uses, and has included in this report, certain non GAAP financial measures. These non GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. These non GAAP financial measures as disclosed by the Company may also be calculated differently from similar measures disclosed by other companies. To ease the use and understanding of such supplemental non GAAP financial measures, the Company includes the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and the reconciliation amount. The Company uses a non GAAP financial measure which excludes the results of its European fruit business disposed of in 2005 for preparing financial targets, internal budgets and operating plans, evaluating actual performance against targets and budget, assessing historical performance over reporting periods, and assessing operating performance against other companies. A material limitation is that 2005 results under GAAP in fact reflect the fruit business results. Management compensates for such limitation by clarifying that this measure is only one operating metric used for internal financial analysis and planning purposes and should not be considered in isolation, and by providing the corresponding GAAP financial measure. The Company uses the non GAAP financial measure which excludes the effect of the AJCA in evaluating actual performance. Management believes that given the unique nature of this item, including this information, without the impact of repatriation, in the prior year period is more representative of the Companys performance and may assist investors in evaluating the Companys period to period financial results and tax rate in a manner consistent with how management evaluates this. The Company also discloses, and management internally monitors, the sales performance of international operations on a basis that eliminates the positive or negative effects that result from translating foreign currency sales into U.S. dollars. Management uses this constant dollar measure because it believes that it enhances the assessment of the sales performance of its international operations and the comparability between reporting periods. Cautionary Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 Statements in this Annual Report, which are not historical facts or information, are forward looking statements within the meaning of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward looking statements which may be identified by such words as expect, believe, anticipate, outlook, may, and similar terms or variations thereof. Such forward looking statements, involve significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from any future results or conditions expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from managements expectations.

The Company intends its forward looking statements to speak only as of the time of this report and does not undertake to update or revise any such statements as more information becomes available or to reflect changes in expectations, assumptions or results. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts with the objective of reducing exposure to cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency receivables and payables, and with anticipated purchases of certain raw materials used in operations. These contracts, the counterparties to which are major international financial institutions, generally involve the exchange of one currency for a second currency at a future date, and have maturities not exceeding six months. The Company also uses derivative financial instruments to hedge foreign currency exposures resulting from forecasted purchase commitments. The Company enters into these hedge contracts generally for periods ranging from one to three months. The gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recorded in earnings at the same time as the transaction being hedged is recorded in earnings. The associated asset or liability related to the open hedge instrument is recorded in Current Assets or Current Liabilities, as applicable. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The Company has executed a 10 year Yen &ndash; U.S. dollar currency swap related to the monthly sale and purchase of products between the U.S. and Japan. The annual notional value of this swap is $5 million. Gains and losses related to this swap are recorded currently, and the mark to market adjustment related to the value of the swap is reflected as a component of AOCI. In 2002, the Company entered into certain interest rate swap agreements effectively converting the fixed rate on its long term Japanese Yen borrowings to a variable short term rate based on the Japanese Yen LIBOR rate plus an interest markup. These swaps are designated as qualified fair value hedges. The net gains have been deferred, are classified as a separate component of debt and are being amortized over the remaining term of the debt. To the extent the Company has not received cash or otherwise amended or settled any swap agreements, any applicable mark to market adjustment relating to that swap is included as a separate component of debt. The Company had no ineffective interest rate swaps at December 31, 2006. In January 2006, the Company entered into a $300 million Cross Currency Interest Rate Swap transaction to hedge a portion of its consolidated Euro net investment. The derivative was structured as a swap of floating USD LIBOR to floating EURIBOR, with both floating interest rates reset and paid semi annually, ensuring that the terms of the swap match identically. Because the derivative is structured as a floating to floating swap, the only value, other than that derived from changes in the foreign exchange (FX) spot rate, are interest rate accruals which are reset semi annually. These accruals are netted and booked in current earnings. Mark to market changes due to differences in the underlying FX rate are recorded in AOCI and provide an offset to the cumulative translation adjustment of the underlying Euro assets being hedged, which are also being valued based on changes in the FX spot rate. Effectiveness is assessed quarterly. At maturity, or if the swap is terminated early, any gain or loss will not be recorded to earnings, but will be recorded to AOCI until the Euro net investment is divested. The Company uses foreign currency rate and interest rate sensitive instruments to hedge a certain portion of its existing and forecasted transactions. The Company expects that any change in value for the hedging instrument would be offset by a change in value related to the underlying transaction. The Companys hedges of its foreign currency exposure are not designed to and therefore cannot entirely eliminate the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on the Companys consolidated 34 financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Companys foreign currency swaps were analyzed at year end to determine their sensitivity to exchange rate changes. Based on the outstanding balance of the Companys net investment hedge at December 31, 2006, a hypothetical 10% change (either an increase or a decrease) in rates denominating this hedge, would not represent a material potential change in earnings. Based on the outstanding balance of the other financial instruments at December 31, 2006, a hypothetical 10% change (either an increase or a decrease) in FX rates prevailing at that date, sustained for up to a year, would not represent a material potential change in fair value, earnings or cash flows. At December 31, 2006, the Company had $807 million of debt outstanding including $375 million of Senior Notes, $304 million in bank and other borrowings and $128 million in long term Japanese Yen denominated debt. Borrowings and interest rate swaps were analyzed at year end to determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes. Based on the outstanding balance of all these financial instruments at December 31, 2006, a hypothetical 10% change (either an increase or a decrease) in interest rates prevailing at that date, sustained for one year, would not represent a material potential change in fair value, earnings or cash flows.
