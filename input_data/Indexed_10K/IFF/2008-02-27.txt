ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. (UNLESS INDICATED OTHERWISE, DOLLARS IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS) Organization of Information Managements Discussion and Analysis provides a narrative on our operating performance, financial condition and liquidity and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements. It includes the following sections: &bull; Executive Overview &bull; Sales Commentary &bull; Consolidated Operating Results &bull; Goodwill and Intangible Assets &bull; Restructuring and Other Charges &bull; Income Taxes &bull; Retirement Benefits &bull; Financial Condition &bull; Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates &bull; New Accounting Standards &bull; Non GAAP Financial Measures &bull; Cautionary Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 Executive Overview We are a leading creator and manufacturer of flavor and fragrance compounds used to impart or improve the flavor or fragrance in a wide variety of consumer products. The precise size of the global market for flavors and fragrances is difficult to determine because the industry is highly fragmented, both geographically and along product lines; there are a limited number of publicly traded companies in the industry; certain customers maintain in house capabilities fulfilling a portion of their flavor or fragrance needs; and the quality and depth of market information in developing regions of the world is limited. Analysts generally estimate the global market to be $11 $12 billion of which IFF represents 17 19%; the largest competitor in the industry has approximately a 25% market share. Currently, the largest companies in the industry combined represent approximately 65% of the global market. Effective January 1, 2007, IFF reorganized into two units that reflect our flavor and fragrance businesses. Approximately 44% of our 2007 net sales were flavor compounds. Flavor compounds are sold to the food and beverage industries for use in consumer products such as prepared foods, beverages, dairy, food and confectionery products. The remaining 56% of sales, representing the fragrances business unit, were in three fragrance categories: functional fragrances, including fragrance compounds for personal care (e.g., soaps) and household products (e.g., detergents and cleaning agents); fine fragrance and beauty care, including perfumes, colognes and toiletries; and ingredients, consisting of synthetic ingredients that can be combined with other materials to create unique functional and fine fragrance compounds. Major fragrance customers include the cosmetics industry, including perfume and toiletries manufacturers, and the household products industry, i ncluding manufacturers of soaps, detergents, fabric care, household cleaners and air fresheners. Approximately 55% of our ingredient production is consumed internally; the balance is sold to third party customers. Changing social habits resulting from such factors as changes in disposable income, leisure time, health concerns, urbanization and population growth stimulate demand for consumer products utilizing flavors and fragrances. These developments expand the market for products with finer fragrance quality, as well as the 16 Table of Contents market for colognes and toiletries. Such developments also stimulate demand for convenience foods, soft drinks and low fat and organic food products that must conform to expected tastes. These developments necessitate the creation and development of flavors and fragrances and ingredients that are compatible with newly introduced materials and methods of application used in consumer products. Flavors and fragrances are generally: &bull; created for the exclusive use of a specific customer; &bull; sold in solid, powder or liquid form, in amounts ranging from a few pounds to several tons depending on the nature of the end product in which they are used; &bull; a small percentage of the volume and cost of the end product sold to the consumer; and &bull; a major factor in consumer selection and acceptance of the product. The flavor and fragrance industry is impacted by macroeconomic factors in all product categories and geographic regions. Such factors include the impact of currency on the price of raw materials and operating costs as well as on translation of reported results. In addition, pricing pressure placed on our customers by large and powerful retailers and distributors is inevitably passed along to us, and our competitors. Leadership in innovation and creativity mitigates the impact of pricing pressure. Success and growth in the industry is dependent upon creativity and innovation in meeting the many and varied needs of the customers products in a cost efficient and effective manner, and with a consistently high level of timely service and delivery. We produce more than 33,000 unique compounds, of which approximately 60% are flavors and 40% fragrances. We continually create new compounds to meet the changing characteristics and needs of our customers end products. No single compound represents more than 1.5% of net sales. Development of fragrances and flavors is a complex artistic and technical process calling upon the combined knowledge and talents of creative perfumers and flavorists, and application and research chemists. An important element of creation is the development of new ingredients. We bear essentially all costs incurred in connection with the creation and development of new flavors and fragrances and such formulae are generally protected under trade secrecy. We are not materially dependent on any patents, trademarks or licenses. Our strategic direction is defined by the following: &bull; Be a global leader in fragrances and flavors. &bull; Provide our customers with differentiated solutions. Our plan to achieve this strategy is to: &bull; Execute on our business unit focus that will align management and resources with the needs of our strategic customers and provide greater accountability; this will drive improved results. &bull; Focus our research and development efforts on projects considered most likely to drive future profitable growth. We anticipate much of this research will be conducted internally, but such efforts may be augmented by joint research undertakings and through acquisition of technology. &bull; Provide quality, safe and suitable products, for inclusion in our customers end products; an essential element is the consistent assurance of the quality and safety of raw materials through a combination of steps including but not limited to vendor certification and quality assurance testing. &bull; Continuously improving our operations and customer service, and related initiatives. &bull; Build a culture that attracts, retains and develops the best talent in the world. Our customers, stakeholders and employees expect the best. As implementation of the strategy progresses, setting strategic initiatives requires regular establishment and reassessment of priorities and necessitates choices in order to provide the best opportunity for continuous improvement in shareholder value. 17 Table of Contents Sales Commentary A breakdown of sales by principal product category is depicted in the graph below. 2007 Sales by Category Our five largest customers comprise 32% of consolidated sales and our top 30 customers 57%; these percentages have remained fairly constant for several years although sales to larger customers are trending higher. We have one customer that accounts for 11% of our sales. A key factor for commercial success is inclusion on the strategic customers core supplier lists, opening opportunities to win new business. We are on the core supplier lists of a majority of our strategic customers. Net sales by business unit for 2007, 2006 and 2005 were as follows: Net Sales 2007 Percent Change 2006 Percent Change 2005 Flavors $ 1,006 12 % $ 895 4 % $ 858 Fragrances 1,271 6 % 1,200 6 % $ 1,135 Total net sales $ 2,277 9 % $ 2,095 5 % $ 1,993 2007 Sales by Destination We currently manage our operations by business unit but consider destination sales a supplemental performance measure. Although reported sales and earnings are affected by the weakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar, this has not had a long term effect on the underlying strength of our business. 18 Table of Contents Net sales by destination for 2007, 2006 and 2005 were as follows: Sales by Destination 2007 Percent Change 2006 Percent Change 2005 EAME(1) $ 850 12 % $ 758 3 % $ 739 North America 630 3 % 612 7 % 572 Greater Asia 491 12 % 439 5 % 420 Latin America 306 7 % 286 9 % 262 Total net sales, as reported $ 2,277 9 % $ 2,095 5 % $ 1,993 (1) Europe, Africa and Middle East 2007 in Comparison to 2006 Sales totaled $2,277 million, up 9% from 2006; flavor and fragrance sales increased 12% and 6%, respectively. 2007 sales benefited from the generally weaker U.S. dollar and at comparable exchange rates would have increased 5% over the prior year. Flavors Business Unit Flavors delivered strong sales performance across all regions &ndash; most notably in Latin America, Greater Asia and Europe &ndash; and in virtually all categories, particularly beverages and savory. Fragrances Business Unit Total Fragrance sales increased by 6% for the year and were driven by continued growth in Fine and Beauty Care of 8% and Ingredients of 9%, despite a decline in Ingredients pricing. Foreign exchange accounted for 4% of the sales increase. Sales By Region and Category Regional and product category sales performance for 2007 compared to the prior year, in reported dollars and local currency, was as follows: 2007 vs. 2006 Percent Change in Sales by Region of Destination Fine & Beauty Care Functional Ingredients Total Frag.

Ingredients volume growth was partially offset by pricing declines. The decline in Functional fragrances was mainly volume related. Flavors sales growth was driven by new product introductions of $20 million mainly in the beverage and savory categories. &bull; EAME flavor sales growth resulted mainly from new product introductions of $25 million. Functional fragrance growth was strong primarily due to new product introductions of $23 million partially offset by volume declines and to a lesser extent lower pricing. The growth in fine fragrance related to new product introductions of $28 million was offset by volume declines. Ingredients sales growth was volume related, partially offset by lower pricing. 19 Table of Contents &bull; Latin America sales growth reflects strong performances in both flavors and fine fragrances. Flavors growth was driven by new product introductions of $21 million. Fine fragrances sales growth is largely attributable to new product introductions of $9 million. Functional fragrance performance was primarily volume related in the fabric care category; we saw some reversal of this trend in the fourth quarter as a result of new product introductions. Ingredients sales performance was largely due to volume increases partially offset by price declines. &bull; Greater Asia sales growth was driven by new product introductions of $35 million in flavors. Fragrance sales growth was driven by fine fragrances as a result of new product introductions of $4 million. 2006 in Comparison to 2005 In 2006, sales increased 5% in both reported dollars and local currency compared to 2005. Foreign exchange had no impact on sales growth over 2005. Flavors Business Unit Flavors sales grew by 4% driven by new product introductions and volume growth most notably in Latin America. Fragrances Business Unit Total Fragrance sales increased by 6% for the year and were driven by continued growth in Fine and Beauty Care of 13% primarily as a result of new product introductions. Sales By Region and Category Regional and product category sales performance for 2006 compared to the prior year, in reported dollars and local currency, was as follows: 2006 vs. 2005 % Change in Sales by Region of Destination Fine & Beauty Care Functional Ingredients Total Frag.

Functional fragrances new product introductions totaled $14 million, the benefit of which was partially offset by declines in volume. Ingredient sales growth was due to a combination of both volume and price. &bull; EAME growth was strongest in Eastern Europe, Middle East, France, Italy and Spain. Fine and functional fragrance growth resulted from new product introductions of $33 million, in each category, while the decline in ingredients was volume related. Flavor growth was the result of new product introductions of $11 million, partially offset by declines in volume. &bull; Latin America fine fragrance sales growth resulted from new product introductions of $14 million while functional fragrance product introductions of $9 million were partially offset by volume decreases. Ingredient sales growth resulted from new product introductions. Flavor sales were strong throughout the region, driven mainly by new product introductions of $8 million. &bull; Greater Asia fragrance sales growth resulted mainly from new product introductions of $4 million and volume growth in India; ingredients sales growth was mainly volume related. Flavor sales growth resulted from new product introductions of $11 million and volume growth. 20 Table of Contents Consolidated Operating Results The percentage relationship of cost of goods sold and other operating expenses to reported sales is detailed as follows: 2007 2006 2005 Cost of goods sold 58.2 % 57.8 % 58.6 % Research and development expenses 8.7 % 8.9 % 9.0 % Selling and administrative expenses 16.5 % 16.8 % 17.0 % Cost of goods sold includes the cost of materials and manufacturing expenses; raw materials generally constitute 70% of the total. Research and development expenses are for the development of new and improved products, technical product support, compliance with governmental regulations, and help in maintaining relationships with customers who are often dependent on technological advances. Selling and administrative expenses support our sales and operating levels. 2007 in Comparison to 2006 Cost of goods sold, as a percentage of sales, was 58.2% compared with 57.8% in 2006. This increase was mainly as a result of product mix, notably higher sales of fragrance ingredients and flavor compounds. Lower selling prices for fragrance ingredients, some impact of higher material costs and under absorption of manufacturing costs at a new fragrance ingredient facility in China, which scaled up production in 2007, also contributed to the increase. The average cost of raw materials increased 2 3% over the prior year. Research and Development expense, as a percentage of sales, was 8.7%, comparable to the prior year levels. Selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 16.5% in the current period compared to 16.8% in the prior year period, reflecting good cost control and the benefit of headcount reductions that occurred in the first half of 2006. Selling and administrative expenses in 2007 include $4 million of business transformation costs to enable us to better leverage our global SAP software platform; such costs are not expected to recur in 2008. The 2006 results also included the benefit of a $3 million insurance recovery related to a 2005 product contamination matter; excluding the insurance recovery, 2006 Selling and administrative expenses would have been 16.9% of sales for the year. Interest Expense In 2007, interest expense totaled $42 million, increasing 63% compared to 2006, due to higher borrowings incurred in connection with share repurchase activities. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the share repurchase activities. Average cost of debt was 4.5% for 2007 compared to 3.3% in 2006. Other (Income) Expense, Net Other (income) expense, net in 2007 increased $1 million over the prior year, mainly due to favorable exchange results and higher interest income as a result of higher interest rates. Other income included $11 million and $15 million, in 2007 and 2006, respectively, primarily related to gains on asset sales. Income Taxes The effective tax rate was 24.8% in 2007 as compared to a rate of 27.7% in the prior year. Both the 2007 and 2006 rates benefited from favorable tax rulings with respect to prior years; excluding the benefit of these rulings from both years, the 2007 effective tax rate would have been 27.8% compared to a rate of 28.8% for 2006. The lower effective tax rate for the current year was largely the result of a greater percentage of consolidated pre tax earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. Operating Results by Business Unit We evaluate the performance of business units based on operating profit before gains/losses on the disposition of assets, interest expense, other income (expense), net and income taxes. See Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the reconciliation to Income before taxes. 21 Table of Contents Flavors Business Unit In 2007, Flavors operating profit of $187 million or 18.6%, as a percentage of sales, increased as compared to $153 million or 17.1% in 2006. The amount reported in 2006 benefited from a $3 million insurance recovery related to a 2005 product contamination matter; excluding the insurance recovery from the prior year comparative, Flavors profitability would have increased an additional 30 basis points over 2006. This profitability improvement was primarily driven by margin improvement enabled by strong sales growth, favorable product mix, increased absorption of manufacturing expenses and good cost control. Fragrances Business Unit In 2007, Fragrance operating profit of $210 million or 16.5%, as a percentage of sales, declined from the $212 million or 17.7% reported in 2006. Profitability was negatively impacted by lower selling prices of fragrance ingredients, higher material costs and underabsorption of manufacturing costs related to scaling up the China facility in 2007. Global Expenses Global expenses represent corporate and headquarters related expenses which include legal, finance, human resources and other administrative expenses that are not allocated to an individual business unit, as well as gains on asset sales and a pension curtailment charge. In 2007, Global expenses increased $9 million to $27 million from $18 million incurred in 2006. In 2007, Global expenses included approximately $6 million of curtailment loss as a result of changes to the U.S. defined benefit pension plan and approximately $11 million related to gains on asset sales. The 2006 expenses included approximately $15 million of other income primarily related to gains on asset sales. 2006 in Comparison to 2005 Cost of goods sold, as a percentage of sales, decreased 80 basis points compared with 2005, mainly as a result of the improved sales performance leading to better absorption of manufacturing expenses, and favorable product mix. We also benefited from the elimination of 69 manufacturing positions in 2005, mainly in North America and Europe, which resulted in savings of $4 million. The average cost of raw materials increased 2 3% over the prior year. Research and development expenses were 8.9% of sales, in line with our objective of spending approximately 9% of revenues on research and development annually. Selling and administrative expenses were 16.8% of sales compared to 17.0% in 2005. The 2005 results included $8 million relating to a product contamination matter; 2006 results reflect the benefit of a $3 million insurance recovery related to this contamination matter. We benefited from the elimination of 129 positions, mainly in North America and Europe, which resulted in savings of $8 million. The 2006 period also included $31 million in incentive compensation expense driven by improved sales and operating performance; the 2005 results included $5 million of such expense. Interest Expense Interest expense totaled $26 million and $24 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The average interest rate remained at 3.3% for both years. The interest rate for each period reflects our debt and interest rate management plans. Additional details are contained in Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other (Income) Expense, Net Other (income) expense, net was $10 million of income in 2006 and $3 million of expense in 2005. In 2006, income resulted from gains on asset sales of $18 million, partially offset by higher exchange losses and other non operating expenses. In 2005, income resulted primarily from exchange gains and higher levels of interest income earned on higher cash balances. Exchange (losses) or gains were $(7) million and $3 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The exchange losses in 2006 were mainly the result of having U.S. dollar positions in Europe and Latin America which resulted in exchange losses upon the weakening of the U.S. dollar in comparison to the Euro and other currencies. 22 Table of Contents Income Taxes The effective tax rate for 2006 was 27.7% and 21.6% for 2005. Our effective tax rate fluctuates as a result of earnings in the countries in which we operate. The 2005 rate was significantly reduced as a result of a tax benefit associated with the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA), which provided for a special one time tax deduction of 85% of dividends received on eligible repatriated foreign earnings. Tax expense in 2005 reflects a benefit of $25 million relating to our repatriation of $242 million of dividends under the provisions of AJCA. Excluding the benefit of AJCA, the effective tax rate for 2005 would have been 31.6%. Operating Results by Business Unit Flavors Business Unit Flavors operating profit of $153 million or 17.1%, as a percentage of sales, increased as compared to $108 million or 12.6% in 2005. The 2005 results included $8 million relating to a product contamination matter; 2006 results reflect the benefit of a $3 million insurance recovery related to this contamination matter. The 2005 results also included approximately $6 million of restructuring charges. This profitability improvement was partially the result of increased sales volume leading to better absorption of manufacturing expenses, and favorable product mix. Selling and administrative expenses declined substantially from 2005 largely as a result of a reduction in headcount related to the restructuring more fully described below, while research and development expenses remained constant with 2005. Offsetting the benefit of the headcount reduction was approximately a $6 million increase in incentive compensation as a result of impro ved operating results. Fragrances Business Unit Fragrance operating profit of $212 million increased from the $187 million reported in 2005, with a corresponding increase in operating profit, as a percentage of sales, to 17.7% in 2006 from 16.4% in 2005. The 2005 results included approximately $10 million in restructuring charges compared to $3 million in 2006. Higher sales volume led to increased absorption of manufacturing expenses, which was partially offset by higher raw material costs, resulting in improved profitability. Spending on research and development remained fairly constant between the two years while selling and administrative expenses declined as a result of the headcount reduction related to the restructuring discussed below. Offsetting the benefit of the headcount reduction was approximately a $10 million increase in incentive compensation as a result of improved operating results. Global Expenses The Global expense caption represents corporate and headquarters related expenses which include legal, finance, human resources and other administrative expenses that are not allocated to individual business unit, as well as gains on asset sales. Global expenses increased by $9 million in 2006 over 2005, primarily due to approximately $11 million of additional incentive compensation in 2006. 2005 Global expenses included $7 million in restructuring charges. 23 Table of Contents Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2007 and 2006, goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $733 million and $746 million, respectively. We completed our annual assessments in 2007 and 2006 concluding there was no impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets. Additional details are contained in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We perform a goodwill impairment test on at least an annual basis or more frequently in certain circumstances, by assessing the fair value of our reporting units based upon both discounted cash flow and comparison of multiples of comparable companies. We deem goodwill to be impaired if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value. We completed our annual assessments in 2007 and 2006, concluding there was no impairment of goodwill. Other intangible assets include patents, trademarks and other intellectual property, valued at acquisition, primarily through independent appraisals, which are amortized on a straight line basis over periods ranging from 7 to 20 years. We review our other intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in business conditions indicate that their full carrying value may not be recovered. Restructuring and Other Charges With respect to the restructuring and other charges: &bull; Separation costs for employees relate primarily to severance, outplacement and other benefit costs; &bull; Asset write down charges relate to establishment of the new carrying value for assets held for sale or disposal; and &bull; Other costs include lease termination costs and other reorganization expenses incurred to effect either the employee separation or location closure. In 2005, we undertook to eliminate 300 positions in manufacturing, selling, research and administration functions, principally in our European and North American operating regions. The majority of affected positions involve employee separation while the balance related to open positions that are not expected to be filled. We recorded pre tax restructuring charges relating primarily to employee separation expenses of $23 million in 2005 and $3 million in 2006. This plan is essentially complete. Annual savings from these actions approximated $16 $18 million. Positions eliminated, including those not replaced by the 2005 program, and charges by business segment in 2006 and 2005 are detailed in the table below; there were no such actions undertaken in 2007 nor charges incurred.

Income Taxes In September 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, which clarifies the application of FAS 109 by prescribing the minimum threshold a tax position must meet before being recognized in the financial statements. The adoption of FIN 48 did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Retirement Benefits In 2007, we amended our U.S. salaried qualified and non qualified pension plans under which accrual of future benefits was suspended for all participants that did not meet the rule of 70 (age plus years of service equal at least 70) at December 31, 2007. As a result of this suspension, we recorded a curtailment loss of $5.9 million to recognize a portion of the unrecognized prior service costs associated with years of service no longer expected to be rendered and credited as service under the plans. We also introduced an enhanced defined contribution plan for those employees affected by the pension curtailment that will become effective January 1, 2008. As a result of these events, we expect to realize a net annual cost savings of approximately $4 million beginning in 2008. Financial Condition Cash, cash equivalents and short term investments totaled $152 million at December 31, 2007 compared to $115 million and $273 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Working capital totaled $652 million at year end 2007 compared to $633 million and ($11) million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in working capital was primarily related to increases in accounts receivable and inventories partially offset by an increase of $137 million in current debt largely as a result of borrowings that mature in November 2008. The 2005 working capital balance resulted from the classification of certain debt as current due to its maturity in May 2006; such debt was refinanced during 2006. Gross additions to property, plant and equipment were $66 million, $58 million and $93 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and are expected to approximate $90&nbs p;million in 2008. Our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by substantial cash flow from operations and ready access to capital markets at competitive rates. Operating cash flow provides the primary source of funds for operating and capital needs as well as dividends paid to shareholders and share repurchase activities. We anticipate that cash flows from operations and availability under our existing credit facilities are expected to be sufficient to fund our currently anticipated capital spending and other currently expected cash requirements for at least the next eighteen months. Operating cash flow in 2007 was $314 million compared to $282 million and $177 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Operating cash flows in 2006 were revised from the $263 million previously reported. Amounts 25 Table of Contents previously reported had been reduced by the purchase of investments of $18 million and deferred financing costs totaling $1 million that were determined to be more appropriately classified as investing and financing activities, respectively; 2005 operating cash flows were unaffected by the revision. The increase in operating cash flow in 2007 compared to the prior year was primarily the result of higher net income; net earnings adjusted for non cash items (primarily depreciation, amortization, and equity based compensation) was the primary source of operating cash flows. Operating cash flow increased in 2006 as compared to 2005 as a result of improved sales and operating results; net earnings adjusted for non cash items (primarily depreciation, amortization and equity based compensation) was the primary source of operating cash flows. Improvements in inventory and current payables were sufficient to offset an increase in receivables; the increases in receivables and payables supported the business growth achieved in 2006. Net investing activities in 2007 utilized $51 million compared to $48 million and $91 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The 2006 cash used in investing activities increased $18 million as a result of revising the cash flow for certain investing and financing activities as discussed above. Investing cash outflows increased primarily due to purchase of investments of $13 million partially offset by proceeds from investment sales of $10 million. In 2007 and 2006, we realized cash proceeds from the sale of assets. In both years, the proceeds related to the sale of land and buildings; to the extent such assets had been written down in connection with previous restructuring activities, any gain or loss on disposition was accounted for as part of the restructuring activities. All transactions were with third party investors and we retained no ownership interest in any of the disposed assets. Compliance with existing governmental requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment has not materially affected our operations, earnings or competitive position. In 2007, we spent $3 million on capital projects and $18 million in operating expenses and governmental charges for the purpose of complying with such regulations. Expenditures for these purposes will continue for the foreseeable future. In addition, we are party to a number of proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act or similar state statutes. It is expected that the impact of any judgments in or voluntary settlements of such proceedings will not be material to our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. The dividend paid per share in 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $.86, $.74 and $.72, respectively. In January, April and July 2007, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $.21 per share to shareholders. In July 2007, we announced a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend rate to $.23 per share effective with the dividend payable in October 2007. We paid dividends totaling $77 million, $67 million and $68 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005. Our current intention is to pay dividends approximating 30 &minus; 35% of yearly earnings; however, the payment of dividends is determined by the Board at its discretion based on various factors, and no assurance can be provided as to future dividends. We supplement short term liquidity with access to capital markets, mainly through the issuance of commercial paper, and with bank credit facilities. In 2005, we, including certain subsidiaries, entered into a revolving credit agreement (the Facility) with certain banks. The Facility provides for a five year U.S. $350 million (Tranche A) and Euro 400 million (Tranche B) multi currency revolving credit facility. Tranche A is available to IFF for commercial paper backstop and general corporate purposes; Tranche B is available to both IFF and the European subsidiaries for general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the Facility bear interest at an annual rate of LIBOR (London Inter Bank Offer Rate) (or in relation to any Euro denominated loans, EURIBOR, European Inter Bank Offer Rate) plus a margin, currently 20 basis points, linked to our credit rating. We pay a commitmen t fee on the aggregate unused commitments and a utilization fee based on amounts outstanding under the Facility; such fees are not material. As permitted by the Facility, in 2007, the termination dates were extended by one year until November 23, 2012. The Facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants customary in a facility of this type, including a covenant requiring us to maintain, at the end of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of net debt for borrowed money to EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) in respect of the previous 12 month period of not more than 3.25 to 1. We have complied with this covenant at all times. In addition, including our subsidiaries, we had unused lines of credit totaling $846 million at December 31, 2007 compared to $701 million at December 31, 2006. 26 Table of Contents At December 31, 2007, we had $1,213 million of debt outstanding. On September 27, 2007, we issued $500 million of Senior Unsecured Notes (Senior Notes &minus; 2007) in four series under the Note Purchase Agreement (NPA): (i) $250 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% Series A Senior Notes due September 27, 2017, (ii) $100 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.35% Series B Notes due September 27, 2019, (iii) $50 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.50% Series C Notes due September 27, 2022 and (iv) $100 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.79% Series D Notes due September 27, 2027. Proceeds were used primarily to fund repurchases of IFF stock (discussed below). Under the NPA, we may at any time, with notice, prepay all or a portion equal to or greater than 10% of the Notes, for an amount equal to the principal, accrued interest and a make whole prepayment premium as calculated under the NPA. We may also prepay the Senior Notes &minus; 2007 solely for the principal and accrued interest thereon in connection with certain asset sales. We will be required to make an offer to prepay the Senior Notes &minus; 2007 following a change in control (as defined in the NPA) for an amount equal to the principal and accrued interest but without a make whole or other premium. In contemplation of this debt issuance, we entered into interest rate hedge contracts, with a notional amount of $400 million to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. The contracts were designated as hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in the long term benchmark interest rates and the credit spread. We recorded a $1.6 million gain on the settlement of these interest rate hedge contracts, which coincided with the issuance of the long term fixed rate debt. For additional information regarding this transaction, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Pursuant to the NPA, we are required to maintain a consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA ratio of 3.5:1 (as calculated under the NPA), provided that such ratio may exceed 3.5:1 (but not 4:1) upon the payment of certain additional interest and provided further that such ratio does not exceed 3.5:1 for more than eight consecutive quarters. In addition, we are required not to permit the aggregate amount of our subsidiaries debt to exceed 20% of our consolidated total assets as calculated under the NPA, with certain exceptions. We, including our subsidiaries, will not incur any liens, subject to certain permitted categories of liens and a general lien allowance of $120 million. We also made certain affirmative and negative covenants relating to the operation of our business; material events such as asset sales and mergers, and the pari passu ranking of the Senior Notes 2007. As a result of the additional debt, Moodys and Standard & Poors (S&P) affirmed their short term credit rating for IFF at P2 and A2, respectively, and Moodys and S&P adjusted their long term rating to Baa1 and BBB, respectively, with a stable outlook. During the first six months of 2007, under a share repurchase program of $300 million authorized in October 2006 (the October 2006 Plan), we repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares at a cost of $81 million; at June 30, 2007, we had approximately $125 million remaining under the October 2006 Plan. In July 2007, the October 2006 Plan was terminated and superseded by a new program authorized by our Board to repurchase up to 15% or $750 million worth of our outstanding common stock, whichever is less (the July 2007 Plan). In September 2007, under the July 2007 Plan, we entered into two agreements to purchase shares of our common stock under a $450 million accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program. On September 28, 2007, we paid $450 million in exchange for an initial delivery of 7.6 million shares under the ASR, representing 90% of the shares that could have been purchased, based on the prior closing price of our stock. The remaining 10%, or $45 million, not used in the initial settlement will be included in the determination of the cost of the shares purchased on completion of the ASR and was reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Balance sheet as a reduction to Capital in excess of par value. On completion of the ASR, which is expected to be by the end of the second quarter of 2008, we may receive additional shares or may be required to pay cash or additional shares at our option, based on the volume weighted average price (VWAP) of the common stock during the agreement term. For additional information regarding these transactions, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Proceeds from the $500 million Senior Notes &mdash; 2007 described above funded the payment. In the year ended December 31, 2007, we purchased 10.2 million shares at a cost of $532 million. In the year ended December 31, 2006, we purchased 6.9 million shares at a cost of $271 million. 27 Table of Contents At December 31, 2007, we have contractual payment obligations due within the time periods as specified in the following table: Payments Due Contractual Obligations Total 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 and thereafter Borrowings(1) $ 1,213 $ 153 $ 50 $ 276 $ 734 Interest on borrowings(1) 571 63 120 109 279 Operating leases(2) 293 24 41 34 194 Purchase commitments(3) 19 19 &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; Pension funding obligations(4) 20 16 1 1 2 Post retirement obligations(4) 49 4 8 9 28 Total $ 2,165 $ 279 $ 220 $ 429 $ 1,237 (1) See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our various borrowing facilities. (2) Operating leases include facility and other lease commitments executed in the normal course of the business. Additional details concerning the United States facilities are contained in Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and further details concerning worldwide aggregate operating leases are contained in Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (3) Purchase obligations and capital project commitments are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. (4) See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our retirement plans. Anticipated funding obligations are based on current actuarial assumptions. Minimum funding requirements reported in the above table do not extend beyond 2016. Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As disclosed in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and accompanying disclosures. These estimates are based on managements best judgment of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future. Actual results may ultimately differ from estimates. Those areas requiring the greatest degree of management judgment or deemed most critical to our financial reporting involve: The periodic assessment of potential impairment of intangible assets acquired in business combinations. We currently have net intangible assets, including goodwill, of $733 million. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually. In assessing goodwill, management uses the most current actual and forecasted operating data available, and current market based assumptions. A two step approach is employed. The first step involves estimating the value of reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. The second step, if necessary, is to measure the value of the impairment loss, if any. Managements most subjective assumptions relate to the estimated/projected sales and operating growth values employed in the forecast. The analysis and evaluation of income taxes. We account for taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (FAS 109). Under FAS 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, based on tax laws as currently enacted. The provision for income taxes is based on statutory income taxes rates and planning opportunities available in the various tax jurisdictions where we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and tax positions. We may be challenged upon review by the applicable taxing authority and positions taken by us may not be sustained. We regularly update these accr uals in light of changing facts and circumstances. In 2007, we adopted SFAS No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FAS 109 (FIN 48). As a result of adopting FIN 48, we recognized a $1 million increase in Other liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and a corresponding cumulative effect adjustment to Retained earnings. Also as prescribed by FIN 48, certain tax related amounts in the Consolidated Balance Sheet are classified differently than in prior periods. Amounts receivable from various tax jurisdictions are now included in Other current assets and tax reserves previously classified as accrued taxes on income are now included in Other liabilities. 28 Table of Contents The evaluation of potential legal and environmental liabilities, where changing circumstances, rules and regulations require regular reassessment of related practices and anticipated costs. We are subject to certain legal claims regarding products and other matters, as well as environmental related matters. Significant management judgment is involved in determining when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the extent to which it can be reasonably estimated. We regularly assesses potential liabilities with respect to all legal claims based on the most recent available information, in consultation with outside counsel handling the defense of such matters. To the extent a liability is deemed to have been incurred and can be reasonably estimated, we recognize a corresponding liability; if the reasonably estimated liability is a range, we recognize that amount considered most likely, or in the absence of such a determination, the minimum reasonably expected liability. To the extent such claims are covered by various insurance policies, we separately evaluate the likelihood of recovery and account for any related insurance receivable. Management judgments involve determination as to whether a liability has been incurred, the reasonably estimated amount of that liability, and any potential insurance recovery. We regularly evaluate potential environmental exposure in terms of total estimated cost and the viability of other potentially responsible parties (PRPs) associated with our exposure. Recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress and additional information becomes available. Critical management assumptions relate to expected total costs to remediate and the financial viability of PRPs to share such costs. Determination of the various assumptions employed in the valuation of pension and retiree health care expense and associated obligations. Amounts recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations. Inherent in such valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets, discount rates at which the liabilities could be settled, rates of increase in future compensation levels, mortality rates and health care cost trend rates. These assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In accordance with GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, affect expense recognized and obligations record ed in future periods. With respect to the U.S. plans, the expected return on plan assets was determined based on an asset allocation model using the current benchmark allocation, real rates of return by asset class and an anticipated inflation rate. The benchmark asset allocation was: 10 &minus; 20% in cash and fixed income investments expected to yield 1.0%; 10 &minus; 20% employed in corporate and government bonds expected to yield 2.1%; and 65 &minus; 75% in equity investments with a long term expected yield of 8.5 &minus; 9.3%. The inflation rate assumed in the model was 2.5%. The plan has achieved a compounded annual rate of return of 9.6% over the previous 20 years. The expected annual rate of return for the non U.S. plans employs a similar set of criteria adapted for local investments, inflation rates and in certain cases specific government requirements. The discount rate used for determining future pension obligations for each individual plan is based on a review of long ter m bonds that receive a high rating from a recognized rating agency. Additionally, for the U.S. plans, the discount rate was based on the internal rate of return for a portfolio of Moodys Aa3 rated high quality bonds with maturities that are consistent with the projected future benefit payment obligations of the plan. The rate of compensation increase for all plans and the medical cost trend rate for the applicable U.S. plans are based on plan experience. Management establishes the assumptions concerning discount rates and actuarial assumptions based on current market conditions, including asset returns and other factors applicable under the circumstances. Changes in pension and other post employment benefits, and associated expenses, may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions. The impact that a .25% decrease in the discount rate or a 1% change in the medical cost trend rate would have on our pension and other post employment benefit expense, as applicable, is discussed in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The ongoing assessment of the valuation of inventory, given the large number of natural ingredients employed, the quality of which may be diminished over time. We maintain between 40% and 55% of our inventory as raw materials, providing the greatest degree of flexibility in manufacture and use. Materials are evaluated based on shelf life, known uses and anticipated demand based on forecasted customer order activity and changes in product/sales mix. Management policy provides for an ongoing assessment of inventory with adjustments recorded when an item is deemed to be slow moving or obsolete. 29 Table of Contents Determination of various assumptions employed in the calculation of equity compensation expense. Amounts recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements related to equity compensation are determined based on the number of awards and type of award as well as specific assumptions regarding expected life, stock price volatility, risk free interest rate, termination rates, exercise multiple and the dividend yield. These assumptions are employed in the Binomial model used to value certain awards. Management establishes the assumptions based on current market conditions and historical trends related to the equity awards. We changed our valuation model used for estimating the fair value of options granted after January 1, 2006, from a Black Scholes option pricing model to a Binomial lattice pricing model. This change was made in order to provide a better estimate of fair value since the Binomial model is a more flexible method for valuing employee stock options than the Black Scholes model. The flexibility of the simulated Binomial model stems from the ability incorporate inputs that change over time, such as volatility and interest rates, and to allow for actual exercise behavior of option holders. We are using an average of implied and historical volatility while the expected term assumption was determined based on historical patterns. Developing the assumptions used in the Binomial model requires significant judgment on our part and, generally, may involve analyzing available historical data, considering whether historical data is relevant to predicting future behavior, making appropriate adjustments to historical data for future expectations, supplementing or replacing company specific historical data with data from other supportable sources and appropriately weighting each of the inputs. These assumptions are evaluated at each grant date. If factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating share based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model, the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect operating income, net income and net income per share. We believe that we have considered relevant circumstances that we may be currently subject to, and the financial statements accurately reflect our best estimate of the results of our operations, financial condition and cash flows for the years presented. We have discussed the decision process and selection of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. New Accounting Standards In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157 (FAS 157), Fair Value Measurements. This Statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements. FAS 157 is effective for years beginning after December 15, 2007. We are currently assessing the impact of this interpretation, but we do not believe its adoption will have a material impact on our results or financial condition. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159 The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Liabilities &mdash; Including an amendment of FASB No. 115 (FAS 159). This standard allows companies to elect, at specific election dates, to measure eligible financial assets and liabilities at fair value that are not otherwise required to be measured at fair value. If a company elects the fair value option, subsequent changes in that items fair value must be recognized in current earnings. FAS 159 is effective for years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (FAS 141(R)). In FAS 141(R), the FASB retained the fundamental requirements of Statement No. 141 to account for all business combinations using the acquisition method (formerly the purchase method) and for an acquiring entity to be identified in all business combinations. However, the new standard requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction; establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed; and requires the acquirer to disclose to investors and other users all of the information they need to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination. FAS 141(R) is effective for annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We have not yet determined the impact, if any, that FAS 141(R) will have on our results of operations or financial position. Non GAAP Financial Measures The discussion of our historical results include and, where indicated, exclude the benefit of a 2006 insurance recovery relating to a product contamination issue, certain favorable tax rulings with respect to prior years and the 30 Table of Contents impact of repatriation of certain dividends from foreign subsidiaries under the AJCA, as well as the effects of exchange rate fluctuations. Such information is supplemental to information presented in accordance with GAAP and is not intended to represent a presentation in accordance with GAAP. In discussing our historical and expected future results and financial condition, we believe it is meaningful for investors to be made aware of and to be assisted in a better understanding of, on a period to period comparative basis, such matters as the 2006 insurance recovery relating to a product contamination issue, repatriation of certain dividends from foreign subsidiaries under AJCA, certain favorable tax rulings with respect to prior years as well as the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on operating results and financial condition. We believe such additional non GAAP information provides investors with an overall perspective of the period to period performance of our core business. In addition, management in ternally reviews each of these non GAAP measures to evaluate performance on a comparative period to period basis in terms of absolute performance, trends and expected future performance with respect to its core continuing business. A material limitation of these non GAAP measures is that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts, an insurance recovery includes actual cash inflows, and the benefit from favorable tax rulings and AJCA reflect actual accounting and cash benefits realized; and we compensate for such limitations by presenting the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. These non GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Cautionary Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 Statements in this Annual Report, which are not historical facts or information, are forward looking statements within the meaning of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. We operate on a global basis and are exposed to currency fluctuation related to the manufacture and sale of our products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The major foreign currencies involve the markets in the European Union, Great Britain, Mexico, Brazil, China, Indonesia, Australia and Japan, although all regions are subject to foreign currency fluctuations versus the U.S. dollar. We actively monitor our foreign currency exposures in all major markets in which we operate, and employ a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, including foreign currency hedging activities. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts with the objective of reducing exposure to cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency receivables and payables, and with anticipated purchases of certain raw materials used in operations. These contracts, the counterparties to which are major international financial institutions, generally i nvolve the exchange of one 31 Table of Contents currency for a second currency at a future date, and have maturities not exceeding six months. The notional amount and maturity dates of such contracts match those of the underlying transactions. The gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recorded in earnings at the same time as the transaction being hedged is recorded in earnings. In February 2003, we executed a 10 year Yen &minus; U.S. dollar currency swap related to the monthly sale and purchase of products between the U.S. and Japan, which is designated as a cash flow hedge. The annual notional value of this swap is approximately $5 million. The associated asset or liability on the open hedge instrument is recorded in Current Assets or Current Liabilities, as applicable. Gains and losses related to this swap are recorded currently, and the mark to market adjustment related to the value of the swap is reflected as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI). In addition to the foreign exchange forward contracts noted above, we use non U.S. dollar borrowings and foreign exchange swap agreements, to hedge the foreign currency exposures of our net investment in certain foreign affiliates, primarily in the European Union. These foreign exchange swap agreements are designated as hedges of net investments. In September 2007 and January 2006, we entered into a $250 million and a $300 million Cross Currency Interest Rate Swap, respectively, to hedge a portion of our consolidated EUR net investment. The derivative was structured as a swap of floating USD LIBOR to floating EURIBOR, with both floating interest rates reset and paid semi annually. Because the derivative is structured as a floating to floating swap, the only value, other than that derived from changes in the spot Foreign Exchange (FX) rate, are interest rate accruals which are reset semi annually. These accruals are netted and booked in curren t earnings. Mark to market changes due to differences in the underlying FX rate are recorded in AOCI and provide an offset to the cumulative translation adjustment of the underlying Euro net investments being hedged. Effectiveness is assessed quarterly. At maturity, or if the swaps are terminated early, any gain or loss will not be recorded to earnings, but will be recorded to AOCI until the EUR net investment is divested. We use derivative instruments as part of our interest rate risk management strategy. The derivative instruments used are comprised principally of fixed to floating rate interest rate swaps. In September 2007, we entered into a $250 million interest rate swap agreement effectively converting the fixed rate on our long term U.S. dollar borrowings to a variable short term rate based on USD LIBOR rate plus markup. In addition, in 2005, we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements effectively converting the fixed rate on our long term Japanese Yen borrowings to a variable short term rate based on the Japanese Yen LIBOR rate plus markup. These swaps are designated as qualified fair value hedges. Swap contracts are generally held to maturity and are intended to create an appropriate balance of fixed and floating rate debt. To the extent we have not received cash or otherwise amended or settled any swap agreements, any applicable mark to market adjust ment relating to that swap is included as a separate component of debt. The following table summarizes our derivatives outstanding as of December 31, 2007. These swaps were all effective under FAS 133. Notional Amount 300,000,000 250,000,000 15,150,000,000 50,000,000 250,000,000 Currency USD USD JPY USD USD Description Cross Currency Interest Rate Swap (USD/EUR) Cross Currency Interest Rate Swap (USD/EUR) Interest Rate Swap 10 Year Cross Currency Swap (JPY/USD) Interest Rate Swap Hedged risk Foreign Exchange Risk(1) Foreign Exchange Risk(1) The risk of changes in fair value attributable to interest rate risk(2) The variability of cash flows attributable to foreign exchange risk(3) The risk of changes in fair value attributable to interest rate risk(2) Method used to test for effectiveness: (1) Quarterly hedge effectiveness is tested using spot to spot methodology. We use a hypothetical derivative on an after tax basis, and ensure that the hedged amount is less then the designated Euro net investment. We ensure that the terms of the hedging instrument have not changed and perform a review of counterparty creditworthiness. (2) Changes in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged are expected to be completely offset by the 32 Table of Contents hedging derivative because the critical terms of the Interest Rate Swap and the hedged debt match (i.e., the currency, notional amount, timing and date of interest payments). Quarterly hedge effectiveness testing includes ensuring the terms of the hedging instrument and the debt have not changed and reviewing counterparty creditworthiness. (3) Changes in cash flow attributable to the risk being hedged are expected to be completely offset by the hedging derivative because the critical terms of the Cross Currency Swap and the forecasted transaction match (i.e., the currency, notional amount and timing). Quarterly hedge effectiveness testing includes reviewing counterparty creditworthiness, ensuring the probability of hedged forecasted transactions has not changed and ensuring the terms of the hedging instrument have not changed. We have established a centralized reporting system to evaluate the effects of changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and other relevant market risks. Our risk management procedures include the monitoring of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures and hedge positions utilizing statistical analyses of cash flows, market value and sensitivity analysis. However, the use of these techniques to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of their accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions. Market exposures are evaluated using a sensitivity model that is intended to measure the potential 10% loss in interest rate and foreign exchange financial instruments, assuming adverse market conditions occur. Historical interest rates and foreign exchange rates are used to estimate the volatility and correlation of future rates. The estimated maximum potential one day loss in fair value of interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments, calculated using the sensitivity model, is not material to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in 2007, 2006 and 2005. The estimated maximum yearly loss in earnings due to interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments, calculated utilizing the sensitivity model, is not material to our results of operations in 2007, 2006 and 2005. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets. The foreign currency and interest rate swap contracts existing during 2007 and 2006 were entered into for the purpose of seeking to mitigate the risk of certain specific adverse currency and interest rate risks. As a result of these financial instruments, we reduced financial risk in exchange for foregoing any gain (reward) that might have occurred if the markets moved favorably. In using these contracts, management exchanged the risks of the financial markets for counterparty risk. Counterparty risk arises from the inability of a counterparty to meet its obligations. To mitigate counterparty risk, we entered into derivative contracts with major leading financial institutions that have credit ratings equal to or better than our credit rating.
