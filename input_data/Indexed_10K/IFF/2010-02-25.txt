ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. (UNLESS INDICATED OTHERWISE, DOLLARS IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS) Organization of Information Managements Discussion and Analysis provides a narrative on our operating performance, financial condition and liquidity and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements. It includes the following sections: Executive Overview Sales Commentary Consolidated Operating Results Goodwill and Intangible Assets Restructuring and Other Charges Income Taxes Postretirement Benefits Financial Condition Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates New Accounting Standards Non GAAP Financial Measures Cautionary Statement Under The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 Executive Overview We are a leading creator and manufacturer of flavor and fragrance compounds used to impart or improve the flavor or fragrance in a wide variety of consumer products. The precise size of the global market for flavors and fragrances is difficult to determine because the industry is highly fragmented, both geographically and along product lines; there are a limited number of publicly traded companies in the industry; certain customers maintain in house capabilities fulfilling a portion of their flavor or fragrance needs; and the quality and depth of market information in developing regions of the world is limited. Analysts generally estimate the global market to be $15 billion of which IFF represents 16%; the largest competitor in the industry has approximately a 25% market share. IFF is one of the top four companies, which together represent approximately 70% of the flavors and fragrances industry. IFF is organized into two units that reflect our flavor and fragrance businesses. Approximately 46% of our 2009 net sales were flavor compounds. Flavor compounds are sold to the food and beverage industries for use in consumer products such as prepared foods, beverages, dairy, food and confectionery products. The remaining 54% of sales, representing the fragrance business unit, were in three fragrance categories: functional fragrances, including fragrance compounds for personal care (e.g., soaps) and household products (e.g., detergents and cleaning agents); fine fragrance and beauty care, including perfumes, colognes and toiletries; and ingredients, consisting of natural and synthetic ingredients that can be combined with other materials to create unique functional and fine fragrance compounds. Major fragrance customers include the cosmetics industry, including perfume and toiletries manufacturers, and the household products industry, including manufacturers of soaps, detergents, fabric care, household cleaners and air fresheners. Approximately 55% of our ingredient production is consumed internally; the balance is sold to third party customers. The under pinning of structural growth for the flavor and fragrance industry are population growth, an expanding middle class and technology. Changing social habits resulting from such factors as increases in 19 Table of Contents personal income, leisure time, health and wellness and urbanization stimulate demand for consumer products utilizing flavors and fragrances. These developments also drive the creation and development of new molecules, technologies and or solutions that facilitate and improve the end use consumption of flavors and fragrances in consumer products. Flavors and fragrances are generally: created for the exclusive use by a specific customer; sold in powder or liquid form, in amounts ranging from a few pounds to several tons depending on the nature of the end product in which they are used; a small percentage of the volume and cost of the end product sold to the consumer; and a major factor in consumer selection and acceptance of the product. The flavors and fragrances industry is impacted by macroeconomic factors in all product categories and geographic regions. Such factors include the impact of currency on the price of raw materials and operating costs as well as on translation of reported results. In addition, IFF is susceptible to margin pressures due to customers cost improvement programs and input cost increases. However, these pressures can often be mitigated through a combination of product reformulation, sourcing strategies and material substitution plus internal cost containment efforts, and the development of innovative and streamlined solutions and processes. We produce more than 33,000 unique compounds, of which approximately 60% are flavors and 40% fragrances. We continually create new compounds to meet the changing characteristics and needs of our customers end products. No single compound represents more than 2% of net sales. Development of flavors and fragrances is a complex artistic and technical process calling upon the combined knowledge and talents of creative perfumers and flavorists, and application and research chemists. An important element of creation is the development of new ingredients. We bear essentially all costs incurred in connection with the creation and development of new flavors and fragrances and such formulae are generally protected under trade secrecy. We are not materially dependent on any patents, trademarks or licenses. IFFs success in the flavors and fragrances industry is driven by our ability to create unique sensory experiences that meet evolving consumer needs and expectations. These solutions are delivered in a cost efficient manner in conjunction with world class customer service. STRATEGIC DRIVERS To increase shareholder value, we pursue and develop a value creation model that encompasses three main elements: investing in research & development to identify and commercialize new, innovative materials and delivery systems; maintaining a deep understanding of both consumer preferences and consumer product brands; and excellence in our creative capabilities. Our goal is to deliver differentiated solutions that enable our customers brands to win in the marketplace. In order to pursue these strategies, our organization is focused on ensuring that we efficiently create, produce, and sell unique, superior, and economically competitive products through our world class integration of research and development, consumer insight, creativity, via excellence in execution. We believe we are well positioned to achieve success by targeting strategically important global and regional customers in both developed and emerging markets; attracting, developing and retaining top talent; investing in research and development; and fostering a culture of innovation, accountability and continuous improvement. CHANGE IN MANAGEMENT Effective September 30, 2009, Robert Amen resigned as Chairman of the Board of Directors (Chairman) and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Company. Douglas D. Tough, currently a Company Board member, 20 Table of Contents assumed the position of non executive Chairman effective October 1, 2009 and will assume the position of executive Chairman and CEO on March 1, 2010. Pending Mr. Toughs assumption of his title and duties as CEO, beginning October 1, 2009 the Company established a temporary Office of the CEO, which is comprised of three current Company executives, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Berryman; Group President, Fragrances, Nicolas Mirzayantz; and Group President, Flavors, Hernan Vaisman. Each of these executives remains in their current positions while carrying out their Office of the CEO responsibilities. The Office of the CEO reports to the Board of Directors. Sales Commentary A breakdown of sales by principal product category is depicted in the graph below. 2009 Sales by Category Our five largest customers comprise 33% of consolidated sales and our top 30 customers 57%; these percentages have remained fairly constant for several years, although sales to larger customers are trending higher. We have one customer that accounts for 11% of our sales. A key factor for commercial success is inclusion on the strategic customers core supplier lists, opening opportunities to win new business. We are on the core supplier lists of a large majority of our strategic customers. Net sales by business unit for 2009, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: Net Sales 2009 PercentChange 2008 PercentChange 2007 Flavors $ 1,081 1 % $ 1,092 9 % $ 1,006 Fragrances 1,245 4 % 1,297 2 % 1,271 Total net sales $ 2,326 3 % $ 2,389 5 % $ 2,277 2009 Sales by Destination We manage our operations by global business units but utilize destination sales as a supplemental performance measure and indicator of underlying market trends. Although reported sales and earnings are affected by the weakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar, this has not had a long term effect on the underlying competitiveness of our business. 21 Table of Contents Net sales by destination for 2009, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: Sales by Destination 2009 PercentChange 2008 PercentChange 2007 EAME(1) $ 808 11 % $ 907 6 % $ 858 North America 600 0 % 601 4 % 630 Greater Asia 575 5 % 547 13 % 483 Latin America 343 3 % 334 9 % 306 Total net sales, as reported $ 2,326 3 % $ 2,389 5 % $ 2,277 (1) Europe, Africa and Middle East 2009 in Comparison to 2008 Sales for 2009 totaled $2,326 million, decreasing 3% from the prior year period of $2,389 million, as Flavor sales declined 1% and Fragrance sales decreased 4%. Foreign exchange had a 3% negative impact on reported sales during 2009 as the U.S. dollar was stronger during the first three quarters of 2009 versus the comparable year ago period. Market conditions improved during the second half of 2009, as global economic conditions strengthened and customer inventory levels stabilized. Local currency (LC) sales increased over 2% during both the third and fourth quarters compared to a decline of 3% during the first six months of 2009. Flavors Business Unit Flavor sales decreased 1% for 2009 compared to 2008 as the effects of a stronger U.S. dollar, soft demand and inventory corrections in Europe and customer specific losses in Latin America more than offset new wins, solid demand and price increases in North America and Greater Asia. Excluding the impact of currencies, sales for the Flavors business increased over 2% during 2009 compared to 2008. Fragrances Business Unit Fragrance sales decreased 4% for 2009 compared to 2008 reflecting double digit LC sales declines for Fine Fragrances, as consumers reduced discretionary spending and the industry significantly reduced inventories across the supply chain. These headwinds were partially offset by solid growth and new wins in beauty care, toiletries and substantially all functional fragrance categories. Excluding the impact of currencies, sales for the Fragrances business declined 1% during 2009 compared to 2008. Sales by Region and Category Regional and product category sales performance for 2009 compared to 2008, in reported dollars and local currency, was as follows: % Change in Sales 2009 vs 2008 Fine &Beauty Care Functional Ingredients TotalFrag. Flavors Total North America Reported 14% 1% 5% 3% 3% 0% EAME Reported 24% 3% 11% 13% 7% 11% Local Currency 18% 2% 6% 8% 0% 5% Latin America Reported 8% 4% 2% 5% 0% 3% Local Currency 9% 5% 1% 5% 4% 5% Greater Asia Reported 17% 14% 1% 12% 1% 5% Local Currency 20% 16% 3% 13% 4% 7% Total Reported 12% 3% 4% 4% 1% 3% Local Currency 8% 5% 2% 1% 2% 0% 22 Table of Contents Local Currency Sales Drivers North America sales were flat as the erosion and volume declines in Fine Fragrance and Flavors compounds offset more than $40 million in new product introductions, plus modest price realization in Flavors and Functional Fragrance. Ingredient sales growth was mainly attributable to cost driven price increases. EAME sales declines in LC were driven by de stocking and weak underlying demand for Fine Fragrances and Ingredients that more than offset solid win performance in Functional Fragrances. Flavor sales were effectively flat as new wins in Savory and Confectionary plus pricing were offset by customer inventory reductions across most categories. Latin America sales growth was 5% in LC led by near double digit growth in the Fine Fragrances and Beauty Care and solid performance in the Functional Fragrances and Flavors categories. The growth was primarily driven by new product introductions of approximately $15 million combined with price increases across both businesses. Greater Asia LC sales growth was largely driven by more than $15 million in new product introductions in Fabric and Hair Care, combined with approximately $10 million in new product introductions in Flavors which more than offset the effects of customer inventory reductions in the Ingredients category supply chain. 2008 in Comparison to 2007 Sales totaled $2,389 million for 2008, up 5% from 2007; Flavor and Fragrance sales increased 9% and 2%, respectively. 2008 sales benefited from the generally weaker U.S. dollar and at comparable exchange rates would have increased 2% over the prior year. Flavors Business Unit Flavor sales increased 9% for 2008 based on new wins across all regions, particularly in the beverage category, led by a 21% increase in Latin America. Excluding the impact of currencies, sales growth for the Flavors business was 6%. Fragrances Business Unit Fragrance sales increased 2%. Excluding the impact of currencies, Fragrance sales declined 1% as strong growth in emerging markets was offset by weakness in the U.S. market. New product introductions of fragrance compounds were offset by volume declines primarily in the U.S. and EAME. Ingredient sales benefited from price increases, partially offset by volume declines as part of a product rationalization initiative and weaker economies in the U.S. and EAME. Sales By Region and Category Regional and product category sales performance for 2008 compared to the prior year, in reported dollars and local currency, was as follows: % Change in Sales 2008 vs 2007 Fine &Beauty Care Functional Ingredients TotalFrag.

Weak economic conditions and significant slowdown in customer order activity led to volume declines in fine and functional fragrance compounds and ingredients. Fine fragrance sales were also negatively impacted by customer inventory corrections in the first half of the year. Flavors sales in EAME were up as new product introductions of $22 million were partially offset by volume declines. Fine and functional fragrance new product introductions of $18 million and $15 million were offset by volume declines. Price increases in ingredients were offset by volume declines. Latin America flavors sales were strong throughout the region, driven mainly by new product introductions of $19 million. Fragrance sales growth was driven by new product introductions of $10 million offset by volume decreases, primarily in functional. Ingredients sales benefited from higher volumes coupled with price increases. Greater Asia sales growth in Flavors was driven by new product introductions of $16 million plus volume and price increases. Fragrance sales benefited from new product introductions of $25 million, partially offset by volume declines. Consolidated Operating Results The percentage relationship of cost of goods sold and other operating expenses to reported sales is detailed as follows: 2009 2008 2007 Cost of goods sold 59.8% 59.4% 58.2% Research and development expenses 8.3% 8.8% 8.6% Selling and administrative expenses 16.2% 16.0% 16.5% Cost of goods sold includes the cost of materials and manufacturing expenses; raw materials generally constitute 70% of the total. Research and development expenses are for the development of new and improved products, technical product support, compliance with governmental regulations, and help in maintaining relationships with customers who are often dependent on technological advances. Selling and administrative expenses support our sales and operating levels. 2009 in Comparison to 2008 Cost of goods sold, as a percentage of sales, was 59.8% in 2009 compared with 59.4% in 2008. This increase reflects higher input costs, a weaker sales mix principally related to Fine Fragrance and slightly lower absorption that could only be partially offset by cost recovery, and productivity and margin improvement efforts, including pricing. Research and development (R&D) expenses were down $15.5 million in 2009 compared to the prior year, mainly due to increased foreign R&D credits of $8 million driven by program enhancements and additional qualifying expenditures. The remaining reduction was due to tight cost control on applied research and development and the effects of a stronger U.S. dollar, partially offset by higher incentive compensation. During 2008 and the first nine months of 2009, these credits were previously recognized as a reduction of tax expense. Selling and administrative expenses (S&A), as a percentage of sales, increased to 16.2% of sales during 2009 as compared to 16.0% during 2008. The 2009 results include $6.3 million of employee separation costs and expenses related to the change in CEO whereas the 2008 amount included the benefit of a $2.6 million insurance recovery related to a prior period product liability claim offset by $3.4 million for employee separation costs. Excluding these items, S&A declined $11 million and would have been flat at 15.9% as a percentage of sales. The reduction in S&A dollars reflects a stronger U.S. currency and cost reduction efforts, which more than offset higher pension expense, higher incentive compensation expense, and provision for product claims. 24 Table of Contents Interest Expense During 2009, interest expense totaled $61.8 million as compared to $74.0 million in 2008. The 2009 decrease reflects a lower average borrowing cost, the elimination of a cross currency interest rate swap during the second half of 2008 and debt repayments during 2009. The 2009 amount includes $4 million of interest paid on the close out of a cross currency interest rate swap classified as a net investment hedge. Average cost of debt was 5.5% for 2009 compared to 6.1% in 2008. Other (Income) Expense, Net Other expense during 2009 was $1.9 million compared to other income of $2.8 million in 2008. Approximately 50% of the change was mainly due to year over year changes in foreign exchange gains/(losses) on trade receivables and payables during the year. During 2008, the Company recognized foreign exchange gains, primarily during the fourth quarter, as a result of the rapid strengthening of the U.S. dollar (USD) during the period of financial turmoil. During 2009, we saw a general weakening trend for the USD that has resulted in a higher level of foreign exchange losses on trade receivables and payables. The remaining change was due to less favorable mark to market adjustments on our investments. Income Taxes The effective tax rate for the year 2009 was 29.3% compared to 19.1% during 2008. The 2008 period included a $23 million reduction in tax expense related primarily to prior period tax settlements versus $2 million during 2009. The 2009 results include $6 million of tax expense due to the recognition of out of period tax adjustments arising from periods 2006 and prior. The Company did not adjust the prior periods as it concluded that such adjustments were not material to the prior periods consolidated financial statements or to the current year. Excluding these items from both periods, as well as the previously discussed restructuring charges, the tax rate for 2009 was 27.4% compared to 27.5% for 2008. The change reflects $3 million of higher repatriation costs on foreign earnings offset by a net reduction of valuation allowances on certain deferred assets and the mix of earnings between high and low tax jurisdictions. Operating Results by Business Unit We evaluate the performance of business units based on operating profit before gains/losses on the disposition of assets, interest expense, other (income) expense, net and income taxes. See Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the reconciliation to Income before taxes. Flavors Business Unit In 2009, Flavors operating profit totaled $208 million or 19.3% of sales, compared to $198 million or 18.1% of sales in 2008. The operating profit improvement reflects increased prices, ongoing cost discipline, and cost recovery and margin improvement efforts, which more than offset higher input costs and negative currency impacts. The 2008 amount included $3.5 million of restructuring expenses versus $0.6 million in 2009. Fragrances In 2009, Fragrance operating profit was $171 million or 13.7% of sales, compared to $202 million or 15.6% of sales in 2008. The 2008 figure has been revised to reflect R&D credits that were previously reflected as a reduction of tax expense. The 2009 amount includes $18 million of restructuring related expenses compared to $4 million in 2008. During 2009, as part of the rationalization of our European fragrance manufacturing footprint, we decided to close our Fragrance compounding facility in Ireland and partially close our ingredients plant in the United Kingdom (UK). In addition, we eliminated 60 positions to improve profitability. The decline in profit was driven by significantly lower volumes in Fine Fragrances and Ingredients, higher input costs and unfavorable mix, partially offset by improved pricing, margin recovery efforts, lower overhead expenses, and $8 million of additional R&D credits versus the prior year. Excluding the restructuring charges, operating profit margins declined 70 basis points over the comparable prior year period. 25 Table of Contents Global Expenses Global expenses represent corporate and headquarters related expenses which include legal, finance, human resources and other administrative expenses that are not allocated to an individual business unit. In 2009, Global expenses were $39 million compared to $45 million during 2008. In 2009, Global expenses included $6 million of employee separation costs associated with the change in CEO. Global expenses in 2008 included approximately $10 million of restructuring charges and $3 million of employee separation costs and $2 million of implementation costs related to our global shared service structure, partially offset by a $3 million insurance recovery related to prior period product liability claim. Excluding these items, global expenses were flat, indicative of strict cost control measures that offset inflationary pressure. 2008 in Comparison to 2007 Cost of goods sold, as a percentage of sales, was 59.4% compared with 58.2% in 2007. This increase was mainly the result of higher input costs and lower absorption of manufacturing expenses, most notably in North America fragrance compounds. These factors were partially offset by internal efficiencies, reformulation and material substitution efforts. Product mix, notably lower sales of fine and beauty care compounds, also impacted cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales. Research and development expense, as a percentage of sales, was 8.8%. This increase over the prior year period reflects increasing investments in customer applications and basic research. Selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, was 16.0% in the current period compared to 16.5% in the prior year period. The 2008 results included the benefit of a $3 million insurance recovery related to a 2005 product contamination matter offset by $3 million of employee separation costs. The 2007 results included $4 million of business transformation costs that enabled us to better leverage our global SAP software platforms. The decline in selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, is mainly attributable to lower incentive compensation. This was partially offset by $2 million related to the implementation of our global shared service structure. Interest Expense Interest expense totaled $74 million compared to $42 million in 2007, due to higher borrowings incurred in connection with the 2007 share repurchase activities as well as a wider spread between the LIBOR (London InterBank Offer Rate) and EURIBOR (European InterBank Offer Rate) interest rates applicable to our interest rate swaps. Average cost of debt was 6.1% for 2008 compared to 4.5% in 2007. Other (Income) Expense, Net Other income was $3 million in 2008 as compared to $11 million in 2007. Other income in 2007 included $11 million related to gains on asset sales. Income Taxes The effective tax rate was 19.1% in 2008 as compared to a rate of 25.3% in the prior year. The lower tax rate in 2008 primarily reflects the benefit of $23 million in higher tax settlements related to prior years versus $10 million during the 2007 period. The decrease in 2008 also benefits from a higher proportion of earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. Operating Results by Business Unit We evaluate the performance of business units based on operating profit before gains/losses on the disposition of assets, interest expense, other (income) expense, net and income taxes. See Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the reconciliation to Income before taxes. 26 Table of Contents Flavors Business Unit In 2008, Flavors operating profit totaled $198 million, or 18.1% as a percentage of sales, compared to $187 million or 18.6% in 2007. The 2008 amount includes $3.5 million of restructuring expenses. Excluding the restructuring charge, profitability was comparable year over year as strong sales growth augmented by lower incentive compensation expense was partially offset by unfavorable product mix. Fragrance Business Unit In 2008, Fragrance operating profit of $202 million, or 15.6% as a percentage of sales, declined from the $212 million or 16.7% reported in 2007. The 2008 amount includes $4.4 million of restructuring expenses. The decline in profit was driven by unfavorable absorption of manufacturing expenses from the shortfall in sales in North America, as well as unfavorable mix, with declining fine fragrance sales, partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense. Global Expenses Global expenses represent corporate and headquarters related expenses which include legal, finance, human resources and other administrative expenses that are not allocated to an individual business unit, as well as gains on asset sales and a pension curtailment charge. In 2008, Global expenses were $45 million as compared to $27 million in 2007. In 2008, Global expenses included approximately $10 million of restructuring charges, $3 million of employee separation costs and $2 million of implementation costs related to our global shared service structure, partially offset by a $3 million insurance recovery related to a 2005 product contamination. Global expenses in 2007 included a $6 million curtailment loss related to changes to the U.S. defined benefit pension plan and $11 million related to the gains on asset sales. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2009 and 2008, goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $721 million and $727 million, respectively. Additional details are contained in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We perform a goodwill impairment test on at least an annual basis, or more frequently in certain circumstances, by assessing the fair value of our reporting units based upon both discounted cash flow and comparison of multiples of comparable companies. We deem goodwill to be impaired if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value. We completed our annual assessments in 2009 and 2008, concluding there was no impairment of goodwill. Other intangible assets include patents, trademarks and other intellectual property, valued at acquisition, primarily through independent appraisals, which are amortized on a straight line basis over periods ranging from 6 to 20 years. We review our other intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in business conditions indicate that their full carrying value may not be recovered. Restructuring and Other Charges Restructuring and other charges primarily consist of separation costs for employees including severance, outplacement and other benefit costs. The Company recorded a net pre tax charge of $4.1 million during the second quarter ended June 30, 2009. This amount includes $6.6 million for severance and related costs associated with the elimination of approximately 70 positions globally, less a $2.5 million reduction to previously recorded provisions. The reduction in prior reserves was attributable to lower estimated benefit costs on severance paid as well as fewer position eliminations requiring severance. 27 Table of Contents During September 2009, as part of the rationalization of our European fragrance manufacturing footprint, the Company announced that it had initiated a collective consultation process with employees regarding the closure of its Fragrances compounding facility in Drogheda, Ireland, as well as the partial closure of its Fragrance Ingredients plant in Haverhill, UK. The Company has completed both consultation processes and has communicated its intent to proceed with the closures. The Company has now completed the negotiations with the Haverhill employee representatives and is actively engaged in the negotiation process with the employee representatives in Ireland to determine actual employee separation benefits. As a result of these plans, approximately 140 employees will be terminated. During the third and fourth quarters of 2009, the Company recorded a provision for severance costs of $12.2 million to Restructuring and other charges in our Consolidated Statement of Income, based on reasonable expectations of separation benefits. We expect to conclude the negotiations in early 2010 and will record any necessary adjustment then. The Company also recorded $1.0 million of accelerated depreciation on certain related assets and other restructuring related costs. Other restructuring costs discussed above will be recorded as incurred as the Company moves forward with implementation. In addition, as part of our continual focus to optimize our European operations, the Flavors segment recorded a provision for contract termination costs of $1.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. We expect to incur total costs related to this restructuring plan of approximately $22 $29 million, consisting primarily of $11 $15 million of employee termination costs, $8 $10 million in plant shutdown and business transition costs and $3 $4 million in asset impairments and or accelerated depreciation of related fixed assets. While some cost savings could be realized in the latter half of 2010, the estimated annual cost savings benefit of $17 $20 million is not expected to be fully realized until 2011. In 2008, as part of our business transformation initiative to enable us to better leverage our global SAP software platform, we implemented a plan to centralize transaction processing in a global shared service structure that resulted in the elimination of 127 positions globally, largely in the finance area. As a result of these actions, we recognized a pre tax charge of approximately $7 million in 2008 related to employee separation costs and $2 million in implementation costs. The implementation costs were included in selling and administrative expenses in 2008. In addition, we incurred a pre tax charge of approximately $12 million in the fourth quarter 2008 principally related to a performance improvement plan covering 91 positions across a variety of activities globally. Annual savings from these 2008 initiatives is expected to be approximately $14 million, realization of which began in 2009. Positions eliminated and charges, net of reversal, by business segment in 2009 and 2008 are detailed in the table below; there were no such actions undertaken in 2007.

Income Taxes Effective utilization of the cash generated by our international operations is a critical component of our tax strategy. Strategic dividend repatriation from foreign subsidiaries creates U.S. taxable income, which enables us to recognize deferred tax assets. Pursuant to ASC 740 Income Taxes, we establish a valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Historically, we have provided a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets resulting from state net operating losses and state credits, as well as selective non U.S. affiliates net operating losses. The changes in the valuation allowances from December 31, 2008 are primarily attributable to the current period net operating losses and currency translation adjustments. Postretirement Benefits In 2007, we recorded a curtailment loss of $5.9 million to recognize a portion of the unrecognized prior service costs associated with years of service no longer expected to be rendered and credited as service under the plans as a result of an amendment to the U.S. salaried qualified and non qualified pension plans. We also introduced an enhanced defined contribution plan for those employees affected by the pension curtailment that became effective January 1, 2008. Financial Condition Cash and cash equivalents totaled $80 million at December 31, 2009 compared to $178 million at December 31, 2008. Working capital totaled $643 million at year end 2009 compared to $751 million at December 31, 2008. The 2009 decrease in working capital was primarily related to improvements associated with inventory management, past due balances on receivables and standardized processing of payables. Gross additions to property, plant and equipment were $67 million, $85 million and $66 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and are expected to approximate 4% of sales in 2010. The planned increase in 2010 is mainly attributable to investments needed to support growth in emerging markets. Our financial condition continues to be strong, as evidenced by substantial cash flow from operations and substantial drawdown capacity of approximately $500 million on our multi year revolving credit facility. Operating cash flow provides the primary source of funds for operating and capital needs as well as dividends paid to shareholders and share repurchase activities. We anticipate that cash flows from operations and 29 Table of Contents availability under our existing credit facilities are sufficient to fund our capital spending and other cash requirements for at least the next eighteen months. We regularly assess our capital structure, including both current and long term debt instruments, as compared to our cash generation and investment needs in order to provide ample flexibility. Operating cash flow in 2009 was $292 million compared to $221 million and $314 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The improvement in operating cash flows during 2009 was led by the reduction of our inventories, which was driven by our internal process improvement initiatives combined with better operating discipline over receivables and payables. We expect to make additional operational gains in working capital management going forward. Operating cash flows in 2008 benefited from the receipt of $18 million on termination of an interest rate swap. The decrease in other assets and liabilities was driven by long term incentive plan payments, lower deferred taxes, and pension and other postretirement payments. Net investing activities in 2009 utilized $81 million compared to $90 million and $51 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The reduction in 2009 funds used compared to 2008 reflects a $20 million decline in capital spending, partially offset by a $14 million payment to terminate a net investment hedge in Europe. Compliance with existing governmental requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment has not materially affected our operations, earnings or competitive position. In 2009 and 2008, we spent $4 million in each year on capital projects and $17 million and $19 million, respectively, in operating expenses and governmental charges for the purpose of complying with such regulations. Expenditures for these purposes will continue for the foreseeable future. In addition, we are party to a number of proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act or similar state statutes. It is expected that the impact of any judgments in or voluntary settlements of such proceedings will not be material to our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. The dividend paid per share in 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $1.00, $.94 and $.86, respectively. In January 2009, April 2009, July 2009 and October 2009 we funded a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share to shareholders. In January, April and July 2008, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $.23 per share to shareholders. We paid dividends totaling $79 million, $75 million and $77 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007. Our current intention is to pay dividends approximating 30 35% of yearly earnings; however, the payment of dividends is determined by the Board of Directors (Board) at its discretion based on various factors, and no assurance can be provided as to future dividends. We supplement short term liquidity with access to capital markets, mainly through bank credit facilities and issuance of commercial paper. In 2005, IFF, including certain subsidiaries, entered into a revolving credit agreement (the Facility) with certain banks. The Facility provides for a U.S. $350 million (Tranche A) and Euro 400 million (Tranche B) multi currency revolving credit facility. Tranche A is available to IFF for commercial paper backstop and general corporate purposes; Tranche B is available to both IFF and the European subsidiaries for general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the Facility bear interest at an annual rate of LIBOR (or in relation to any Euro denominated loans, EURIBOR) plus a margin, currently 25 basis points, linked to our credit rating. We pay a commitment fee on the aggregate unused commitments and a utilization fee based on amounts outstanding under the Facility; such fees are not material. The Facility expires on November 23, 2012. During 2008 the maximum amount of outstanding commercial paper was $30 million. We did not issue commercial paper during 2009. At December 31, 2009, we had $1,012 million of debt outstanding compared to $1,256 million outstanding at December 31, 2008. We regularly assess our capital structure, including both current and long term debt instruments, as compared to our cash generation and investment needs in order to provide ample flexibility. In that connection, in December 2009 we prepaid, without penalty, the remaining outstanding balance (approximately $151 million) of our Japanese Yen loan 2008, which was scheduled to mature in 2011. Total debt repayments during 2009 amounted to approximately $240 million. 30 Table of Contents In October 2008, we closed out a $250 million USD LIBOR to EURIBOR interest rate swap and a $250 million fixed to floating interest rate swap at no cost. Additionally, in February 2009 we terminated a $300 million USD LIBOR to EURIBOR interest rate swap which required us to make a payment of $16 million. See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Item 7A below) for additional information regarding these transactions. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we repurchased 75,000 shares on the open market at a cost of $2 million or an average of $26.22 per share. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased .7 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $30 million on the open market. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we repurchased 2.6 million shares of our common stock in the open market at a cost of $127 million, plus an additional 7.6 million shares under the ASR. In July 2007, our Board authorized us to repurchase up to 15% or $750 million worth of our then outstanding common stock, whichever is less. In September 2007, under the July 2007 Plan, we entered into two agreements to purchase shares of our common stock under a $450 million accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program. The ASR concluded in June 2008. Total aggregate shares repurchased under the ASR program were 9.7 million shares at an average purchase price of $46.53. The ASR was primarily funded through the issuance of $500 million of Senior Unsecured Notes (Senior Notes 2007) in four series under a Note Purchase Agreement. See Note 8, Borrowings, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these notes. The Facility contains the most restrictive covenant requiring us to maintain, at the end of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of net debt for borrowed money to adjusted EBITDA in respect of the previous 12 month period of not more than 3.25 to 1. At December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants. At December 31, 2009 our Net Debt/adjusted EBITDA(1) was 2.08 to 1 as defined by the debt agreements, well below the financial covenants of existing outstanding debt. Failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under these agreements would constitute default and would allow the lenders to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the related agreement. If such acceleration were to occur, we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness. We would likely have to seek amendments under the agreements for relief from the financial covenants or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity, and or asset sales, if necessary. We may be unable to amend the agreements or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturities are accelerated. (1) Adjusted EBITDA and Net Debt, which are non GAAP measures used for these covenants, are calculated in accordance with the definition in the debt agreements. In this context, these measures are used solely to provide information on the extent to which we are in compliance with debt covenants and may not be comparable to adjusted EBITDA and Net Debt used by other companies. Reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA to net income and net debt to total debt are as follows: 12 Months EndedDecember 31, (In Millions) 2009 2008 Net income $ 195.5 $ 229.6 Interest expense 61.8 74.0 Income taxes 81.0 54.3 Depreciation 72.3 69.8 Amortization 6.2 6.2 Specified items 24.6 22.9 Adjusted EBITDA $ 441.4 $ 456.8 31 Table of Contents December 31, (In Millions) 2009 2008 Total debt $ 1,011.5 $ 1,255.7 Adjustments: Deferred gain on interest rate swaps (15.0 ) (16.9 ) Cash and cash equivalents (80.1 ) (178.5 ) Net debt $ 916.4 $ 1,060.3 At December 31, 2009, we had contractual payment obligations due within the time periods as specified in the following table: Payments Due Contractual Obligations (In Millions) Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 andthereafter Borrowings(1) $ 997 $ 77 $ 195 $ 100 $ 625 Interest on borrowings(1) 428 53 95 83 197 Operating leases(2) 296 28 47 37 184 Purchase commitments(3) 5 5 Pension funding obligations(4) 51 19 10 6 16 Postretirement obligations(4) 64 6 11 12 35 Total $ 1,841 $ 188 $ 358 $ 238 $ 1,057 (1) See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our various borrowing facilities. (2) Operating leases include facility and other lease commitments executed in the normal course of the business. Additional details concerning the United States facilities are contained in Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and further details concerning worldwide aggregate operating leases are contained in Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (3) Purchase obligations and capital project commitments are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. (4) See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our retirement plans. Anticipated funding obligations are based on current actuarial assumptions. Minimum funding requirements reported in the above table do not extend beyond 2019. The table above does not include $65 million of the total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and approximately $10 million of associated accrued interest. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows, the Company is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid. Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As disclosed in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and accompanying disclosures. These estimates are based on managements best judgment of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future. Actual results may ultimately differ from estimates. Those areas requiring the greatest degree of management judgment or deemed most critical to our financial reporting involve: The periodic assessment of potential impairment of intangible assets acquired in business combinations. We currently have net intangible assets, including goodwill, of $721 million. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually. In assessing goodwill, management uses the most current actual and forecasted operating data available, and current market based assumptions. A two step approach is 32 Table of Contents employed. The first step involves estimating the value of reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. The second step, if necessary, is to measure the value of the impairment loss, if any. Managements most subjective assumptions relate to the estimated/projected sales and operating growth values employed in the forecast. The analysis and evaluation of income taxes. We account for taxes in accordance with ASC 740. Under ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, based on tax laws as currently enacted. The provision for income taxes is based on statutory income tax rates and planning opportunities available in the various tax jurisdictions where we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and tax positions. We may be challenged upon review by the applicable taxing authority and positions taken by us may not be sustained. We regularly update these accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances. In 2007, we adopted guidance presented in ASC 740 (formally FIN 48). As a result of this guidance, we recognized a $1 million increase in Other liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and a corresponding cumulative effect adjustment to Retained earnings. The evaluation of potential legal and environmental liabilities, where changing circumstances, rules and regulations require regular reassessment of related practices and anticipated costs. We are subject to certain legal claims regarding products and other matters, as well as environmental related matters. Significant management judgment is involved in determining when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the extent to which it can be reasonably estimated. We regularly assess potential liabilities with respect to all legal claims based on the most recent available information, in consultation with outside counsel handling the defense of such matters. To the extent a liability is deemed to have been incurred and can be reasonably estimated, we recognize a corresponding liability; if the reasonably estimated liability is a range, we recognize that amount considered most likely, or in the absence of such a determination, the minimum reasonably expected liability. To the extent such claims are covered by various insurance policies, we separately evaluate the likelihood of recovery and account for any related insurance receivable. Management judgments involve determination as to whether a liability has been incurred, the reasonably estimated amount of that liability, and any potential insurance recovery. We regularly evaluate potential environmental exposure in terms of total estimated cost and the viability of other potentially responsible parties (PRPs) associated with our exposure. Recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress and additional information becomes available. Critical management assumptions relate to expected total costs to remediate and the financial viability of PRPs to share such costs. Determination of the various assumptions employed in the valuation of pension and retiree health care expense and associated obligations. Amounts recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations. Inherent in such valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets, discount rates at which the liabilities could be settled, rates of increase in future compensation levels, mortality rates and health care cost trend rates. These assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In accordance with GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods. We consider a number of factors in determining and selecting assumptions for the overall expected long term rate of return on plan assets. We consider the historical long term return experience of our assets, the current and expected allocation of our plan assets, and expected long term rates of return. We derive these expected long term rates of return with the assistance of our investment advisors. We base our expected allocation of plan assets on a diversified portfolio consisting of domestic and international equity securities, fixed income, real estate, and alternative asset classes. 33 Table of Contents We consider a variety of factors in determining and selecting our assumptions for the discount rate at December 31. For the U.S. plans, the discount rate was based on the internal rate of return for a portfolio of Moodys Aaa, Aa, and Merrill Lynch AAA AA high quality bonds with maturities that are consistent with the projected future benefit payment obligations of the plan. The rate of compensation increase for all plans and the medical cost trend rate for the applicable U.S. plans are based on plan experience. With respect to the U.S. plans, the expected return on plan assets was determined based on an asset allocation model using the current target allocation, real rates of return by asset class and an anticipated inflation rate. The target asset allocation consists of approximately: 60 65% in equity securities and 35 40% in fixed income securities. The inflation rate assumed in the model was 2.5%. The plan has achieved a compounded annual rate of return of approximately 8% over the previous 20 years. At December 31, 2009, the actual asset allocation was: 67% in equity securities; 30% in fixed income securities; and 3% in cash. The expected annual rate of return for the non U.S. plans employs a similar set of criteria adapted for local investments, inflation rates and in certain cases specific government requirements. The target asset allocation, for the non U.S. plans, consists of approximately: 55 60% in fixed income securities, 30 35% in equity securities; 5 10% in real estate; and up to 5% in cash. At December 31, 2009, the actual asset allocation was: 57% in fixed income investments; 30% in equity investments; 11% in real estate investments; and 2% in cash. Management establishes the assumptions concerning discount rates and actuarial assumptions based on current market conditions, including asset returns and other factors applicable under the circumstances. Changes in pension and other post employment benefits, and associated expenses, may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions. The impact that a .25% decrease in the discount rate or a 1% change in the medical cost trend rate would have on our pension and other post employment benefit expense, as applicable, is discussed in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The ongoing assessment of the valuation of inventory, given the large number of natural ingredients employed, the quality of which may be diminished over time. We maintain between 40% and 55% of our inventory as raw materials, providing the greatest degree of flexibility in manufacture and use. Materials are evaluated based on shelf life, known uses and anticipated demand based on forecasted customer order activity and changes in product/sales mix. Management policy provides for an ongoing assessment of inventory with adjustments recorded when an item is deemed to be slow moving or obsolete. Determination of various assumptions employed in the calculation of equity compensation expense. Amounts recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements related to equity compensation are determined based on the number of awards and type of award as well as specific assumptions regarding expected life, stock price volatility, risk free interest rate, termination rates, exercise multiple and the dividend yield. These assumptions are employed in the Binomial model used to value certain awards. Management establishes the assumptions based on current market conditions and historical trends related to the equity awards. Developing the assumptions used in the Binomial model requires significant judgment on our part and, generally, may involve analyzing available historical data, considering whether historical data is relevant to predicting future behavior, making appropriate adjustments to historical data for future expectations, supplementing or replacing company specific historical data with data from other supportable sources and appropriately weighting each of the inputs. These assumptions are evaluated at each grant date. If factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating share based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model, the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect operating income, net income and net income per share. We believe that we have considered relevant circumstances that we may be currently subject to, and the financial statements accurately reflect our best estimate of the results of our operations, financial condition and cash flows for the years presented. We have discussed the decision process and selection of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 34 Table of Contents New Accounting Standards In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued its FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (the Codification or ASC). The Codification became the single source of authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities. The Codification now supersedes then existing accounting and reporting standards such as FASB Statements, FASB Staff Positions (FSP) and Emerging Issues Task Force Abstracts. The Codification, which is effective for our financial statements beginning with our third quarter of 2009, impacts only our financial statement reference disclosures and does not change application of GAAP. In May 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which sets forth general standards of accounting for and the disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date, but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. This guidance was effective beginning with our second quarter of 2009 and has not had a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In that regard, we have performed an evaluation of subsequent events through February 25, 2010, which is the date the financial statements were issued. In April 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance requiring disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments in annual and interim reporting periods of publicly traded companies. The quarterly disclosures are intended to provide financial statement users with more timely information about the effects of current market conditions on an entitys financial instruments that are not otherwise reported at fair value. This guidance is effective for interim reporting periods beginning with our second quarter of 2009. The adoption of this guidance had no impact on our financial position or results of operations. As of December 31, 2009, we adopted new authoritative guidance which expands the disclosure requirements related to the plan assets of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans with the intent to provide users of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of: (i) how investment allocation decisions are made, including the investment policies and strategies used, (ii) the major categories of plan assets, (iii) the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets, (iv) the effect of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) on changes in plan assets and (v) significant concentrations of risk within plan assets. The additional disclosures required by this guidance are included in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As of January 1, 2009 we adopted new authoritative guidance issued by the FASB which requires us to classify our noncontrolling interest in consolidated subsidiaries (previously referred to as minority interest) as a separate component of Shareholders Equity. Through December 31, 2008, such noncontrolling interest had been included in Other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Any applicable (income) expense attributable to the noncontrolling interest is included in Other (income) expense, net in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Income due to its immateriality and, as such, is not included separately in comprehensive income. As of January 1, 2009 we adopted new authoritative guidance issued by the FASB which amends and expands previously required disclosure requirements about derivative instruments and hedging activities. The new guidance requires enhanced disclosures regarding the objectives and strategies for using derivatives, how derivative instruments are accounted for, and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance and cash flows. The adoption of the new guidance had no impact on our financial position or results of operations. The additional disclosures required by this guidance are included in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As of January 1, 2009 we adopted new authoritative guidance issued by the FASB related to participating securities granted in share based payment transactions. This guidance considers unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) as participating securities and requires them to be included in the computation of basic earnings per share pursuant 35 Table of Contents to the two class method described in the Codification. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements and is explained in detail in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Non GAAP Financial Measures The Company uses non GAAP financial operating measures which exclude: employee separation costs (including costs associated with the change in the Chief Executive Officer position in 2009) and restructuring charges (including costs associated with the Companys ongoing restructuring efforts in Europe in 2009); benefits of favorable tax rulings and settlements relating to prior years; the benefit of an insurance recovery, costs for the implementation of the global shared services structure in 2008 and the gain on the sale of land and a curtailment charge resulting from changes made to our U.S. defined benefit pension plan in 2007. In addition, in certain instances, we exclude the effects of exchange rate fluctuations when discussing our historical performance. The Company also discloses, from time to time, non GAAP effective tax rates, which exclude the effect of the benefits of tax rulings relating to prior periods, as additional information in seeking to assess and compare our tax rates without the benefit of those tax rulings. Such information is supplemental to information presented in accordance with GAAP and is not intended to represent a presentation in accordance with GAAP. In discussing our historical and expected future results and financial condition, we believe it is meaningful for investors to be made aware of and to be assisted in a better understanding of, on a period to period comparative basis, of financial amounts both including and excluding these identified items, as well as the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on operating results and financial condition. We believe such additional non GAAP information provides investors with an overall perspective of the period to period performance of our core business. In addition, management internally reviews each of these non GAAP measures to evaluate performance on a comparative period to period basis in terms of absolute performance, trends and expected future performance with respect to our core continuing business. A material limitation of these non GAAP measures is that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts, restructuring charges, employee separation costs and implementation costs include actual cash outlays, an insurance recovery is an actual cash recovery and benefits from favorable tax rulings and settlements reflect actual accounting and cash benefits realized; and we compensate for such limitations by presenting the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. These non GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Cautionary Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 Statements in this Annual Report, which are not historical facts or information, are forward looking statements within the meaning of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward looking statements are based on managements current assumptions, estimates and expectations. Certain of such forward looking information may be identified by such terms as expect, anticipate, believe, outlook, guidance, may and similar terms or variations thereof. All information concerning future revenues, tax rates or benefits, interest and other savings, earnings and other future financial results or financial position, constitutes forward looking information. Such forward looking statements are based on a series of expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections about the Company, are not guarantees of future results or performance, and involve significant risks, uncertainties and other factors, including assumptions and projections, for all forward periods. Actual results of the Company may differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. Such factors include, among others, the following: general economic and business conditions in the Companys markets, especially given the current disruption in global economic conditions, including economic and recessionary pressures; energy and commodity prices; decline in consumer confidence and spending; significant fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar; population health and political uncertainties, and the difficulty in projecting the short and long term effects of global economic conditions; movements in interest rates; continued volatility and deterioration of the capital and credit markets, including continued disruption in the commercial paper market, and any adverse impact on our cost of and access to capital and credit; fluctuations in the price, quality and availability of raw materials; the Companys ability to implement its business strategy, including the achievement of anticipated cost savings, profitability and growth targets; the 36 Table of Contents impact of currency fluctuation or devaluation in the Companys principal foreign markets, especially given the current disruptions to such currency markets, and the impact on the availability, effectiveness and cost of the Companys hedging and risk management strategies; the outcome of uncertainties related to litigation; the impact of possible pension funding obligations and increased pension expense on the Companys cash flow and results of operations; and the effect of legal and regulatory proceedings, as well as restrictions imposed on the Company, its operations or its representatives by U.S. and foreign governments. The Company intends its forward looking statements to speak only as of the time of such statements and does not undertake or plan to update or revise them as more information becomes available or to reflect changes in expectations, assumptions or results. The Company can give no assurance that such expectations or forward looking statements will prove to be correct. An occurrence of, or any material adverse change in, one or more of the risk factors or risks and uncertainties referred to in this report or included in our other periodic reports filed with the Commission could materially and adversely impact our operations and our future financial results. Any public statements or disclosures by IFF following this report that modify or impact any of the forward looking statements contained in or accompanying this report will be deemed to modify or supersede such outlook or other forward looking statements in or accompanying this report. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. We operate on a global basis and are exposed to currency fluctuation related to the manufacture and sale of our products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The major foreign currencies involve the markets in the European Union, Great Britain, Mexico, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Australia and Japan, although all regions are subject to foreign currency fluctuations versus the U.S. dollar. We actively monitor our foreign currency exposures in all major markets in which we operate, and employ a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, including foreign currency hedging activities. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts with the objective of reducing exposure to cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency receivables and payables, and with anticipated purchases of certain raw materials used in operations. These contracts, the counterparties to which are major international financial institutions, generally involve the exchange of one currency for a second currency at a future date, and have maturities not exceeding six months. The notional amount and maturity dates of such contracts match those of the underlying transactions. The gain or loss on the hedging instrument and services is recorded in earnings at the same time as the transaction being hedged is recorded in earnings. In February 2003, we executed a 10 year Yen U.S. dollar currency swap related to the monthly sale and purchase of products and services between the U.S. and Japan, which is designated as a cash flow hedge. The annual notional value of this swap is approximately $5 million. The associated asset or liability on the open hedge instrument is recorded in Current assets or Current liabilities, as applicable. Gains and losses related to this swap are recorded currently, and the mark to market adjustment related to the value of the swap is reflected as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI). In addition to the foreign exchange forward contracts noted above, we have used non U.S. dollar borrowings and foreign exchange swap agreements, to hedge the foreign currency exposures of our net investment in certain foreign affiliates, primarily in the European Union. These foreign exchange swap agreements are designated as hedges of net investments. In September 2007 and January 2006, we entered into a $250 million and a $300 million Cross Currency Interest Rate Swap, respectively, to hedge a portion of our consolidated EUR net investment. The derivative was structured as a swap of floating USD LIBOR to floating EURIBOR, with both floating interest rates reset and paid semi annually. Because the derivative is structured as a floating to floating swap, the only value, other than that derived from changes in the spot Foreign Exchange (FX) rate, are interest rate accruals which are reset semi annually. These accruals are netted and booked in current earnings. Mark to market changes due to differences in the underlying FX rate are recorded in AOCI and provide an offset to the cumulative translation adjustment of the underlying Euro net investments being hedged. In October 2008, we closed out the $250 million USD LIBOR to EURIBOR interest rate swap at no cost. In February 2009 we terminated the $300 million USD LIBOR to EURIBOR interest rate swap which required us to make a payment of $16 million. As this swap was designated as a net investment hedge, $12 million of the loss was deferred in AOCI where it will remain until the Euro net investment is divested and $4 million was included as a component of interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2009. We use derivative instruments as part of our interest rate risk management strategy. The derivative instruments used are comprised principally of fixed to floating rate interest rate swaps. In September 2007, we entered into a $250 million interest rate swap agreement effectively converting the fixed rate on our long term U.S. dollar borrowings to a variable short term rate based on USD LIBOR rate plus markup. In March 2008, we realized an $18 million gain on termination of this swap, which has been deferred and is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the related debt. During 2008, we entered into a similar interest rate swap and then in October 2008 we liquidated this position at no cost. In addition, in 2005, we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements effectively converting the fixed rate on our long term Japanese Yen borrowings to a variable short term rate based on the Japanese Yen TIBOR rate plus markup. These swaps are designated as qualified fair value hedges. In November 2008, the portion of these swaps related to the 13.3 billion Yen notes refinanced, expired. Swap contracts are generally held to maturity and are intended to create an appropriate balance of fixed and floating rate debt. To the extent we have not received cash or otherwise amended or settled any swap agreements, any applicable mark to market adjustment relating to that swap is included as a separate component of debt. 38 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our derivatives outstanding as of December 31, 2009. These swaps were all effective under ASC 815. Notional amount 1,818,000,000 50,000,000 Currency JPY USD Description Interest Rate Swap 10 Year Cross Currency Swap (JPY/USD) Hedged risk The risk of changes in fair value attributable to interest rate risk(1) The variability of cash flows attributable to foreign exchange risk(2) Method used to test for effectiveness: (1) Changes in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged are expected to be completely offset by the hedging derivative because the critical terms of the Interest Rate Swap and the hedged debt match (i.e., the currency, notional amount, timing and date of interest payments). Quarterly hedge effectiveness testing includes ensuring the terms of the hedging instrument and the debt have not changed and reviewing counterparty creditworthiness. (2) Changes in cash flow attributable to the risk being hedged are expected to be completely offset by the hedging derivative because the critical terms of the Cross Currency Swap and the forecasted transaction match (i.e., the currency, notional amount and timing). Quarterly hedge effectiveness testing includes reviewing counterparty creditworthiness, ensuring the probability of hedged forecasted transactions has not changed and ensuring the terms of the hedging instrument have not changed. We have established a centralized reporting system to evaluate the effects of changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and other relevant market risks. Our risk management procedures include the monitoring of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures and hedge positions utilizing statistical analyses of cash flows, market value and sensitivity analysis. However, the use of these techniques to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of their accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions. Market exposures are evaluated using a sensitivity model that is intended to measure the potential 10% loss in interest rate and foreign exchange financial instruments, assuming adverse market conditions occur. Historical interest rates and foreign exchange rates are used to estimate the volatility and correlation of future rates. The estimated maximum potential one day loss in fair value of interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments, calculated using the sensitivity model, is not material to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in 2009, 2008 and 2007. The estimated maximum yearly loss in earnings due to interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments, calculated utilizing the sensitivity model, is not material to our results of operations in 2009, 2008 and 2007. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets. The foreign currency and interest rate swap contracts existing during 2008 and 2007 were entered into for the purpose of seeking to mitigate the risk of certain specific adverse currency and interest rate risks. As a result of these financial instruments, we reduced financial risk in exchange for foregoing any gain (reward) that might have occurred if the markets moved favorably. In using these contracts, management exchanged the risks of the financial markets for counterparty risk. Counterparty risk arises from the inability of a counterparty to meet its obligations. To mitigate counterparty risk, we entered into derivative contracts with major leading financial institutions that have credit ratings equal to or better than our credit rating.
