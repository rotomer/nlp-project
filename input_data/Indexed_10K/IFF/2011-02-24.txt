ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. (UNLESS INDICATED OTHERWISE, DOLLARS IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS) Organization of Information Managements Discussion and Analysis provides a narrative on our operating performance, financial condition and liquidity and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements. It includes the following sections: Executive Overview Sales Commentary Consolidated Operating Results Goodwill and Intangible Assets Restructuring and Other Charges Income Taxes Financial Condition Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates New Accounting Standards Non GAAP Financial Measures Cautionary Statement Under The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 Executive Overview We are a leading creator and manufacturer of flavor and fragrance compounds used to impart or improve the flavor or fragrance in a wide variety of consumer products. The precise size of the global market for flavors and fragrances is difficult to determine because the industry is highly fragmented, both geographically and along product lines; there are a limited number of publicly traded companies in the industry; certain customers maintain in house capabilities fulfilling a portion of their flavor or fragrance needs; and the quality and depth of market information in developing regions of the world is limited. Analysts generally estimate the global market to be $15 $16 billion of which IFF represents 16% 17%; the largest competitor in the industry has approximately a 25% market share. IFF is one of the top four companies, which together represent approximately 70% of the flavors and fragrances industry. IFF is organized into two units that reflect our flavor and fragrance businesses. Approximately 46% of our 2010 net sales were flavor compounds. Flavor compounds are sold to the food and beverage industries for use in consumer products such as prepared foods, beverages, dairy, food and confectionery products. The remaining 54% of sales, representing the fragrance business unit, were in three fragrance categories: functional fragrances, including fragrance compounds for personal care (e.g., soaps) and household products (e.g., detergents and cleaning agents); fine fragrance and beauty care, including perfumes, colognes and toiletries; and ingredients, consisting of natural and synthetic ingredients that can be combined with other materials to create unique functional and fine fragrance compounds. Major fragrance customers include the cosmetics industry, including perfume and toiletries manufacturers, and the household products industry, including manufacturers of soaps, detergents, fabric care, household cleaners and air fresheners. Approximately 55% of our ingredient production is consumed internally; the balance is sold to third party customers. The under pinning of structural growth for the flavor and fragrance industry are population growth, an expanding middle class and technology. Changing social habits resulting from such factors as increases in personal income, leisure time, health and wellness and urbanization stimulate demand for consumer products utilizing flavors and fragrances, especially in the emerging markets. These developments also drive the creation and development of new molecules, technologies and or solutions that facilitate and improve the end use consumption of flavors and fragrances in consumer products. 19 Table of Contents Flavors and fragrances are generally: created for the exclusive use by a specific customer; sold in powder or liquid form, in amounts ranging from a few pounds to several tons depending on the nature of the end product in which they are used; a small percentage of the volume and cost of the end product sold to the consumer; and a major factor in consumer selection and acceptance of the product. The flavors and fragrances industry is impacted by macroeconomic factors in all product categories and geographic regions. Such factors include the impact of currency on the price of raw materials and operating costs as well as on translation of reported results. In addition, IFF is susceptible to margin pressures due to customers cost improvement programs and input cost increases. However, these pressures can often be mitigated through a combination of price realization, product reformulation, sourcing strategies and material substitution plus internal cost containment efforts, and the development of innovative and streamlined solutions and processes. We produce more than 34,000 unique compounds, of which more than half is flavors. We continually create new compounds to meet the changing characteristics and needs of our customers end products. No single compound represents more than 2% of net sales. Development of flavors and fragrances is a complex artistic and technical process calling upon the combined knowledge and talents of creative perfumers and flavorists, and application and research chemists. An important element of creation is the development of new ingredients. We bear essentially all costs incurred in connection with the creation and development of new flavors and fragrances and such formulae are generally protected under trade secrecy. We are not materially dependent on any patents, trademarks or licenses. IFFs success in the flavors and fragrances industry is driven by our ability to create unique sensory experiences that meet evolving consumer needs and expectations. These solutions are delivered in a cost efficient manner in conjunction with world class customer service. STRATEGIC DRIVERS To increase shareholder value, we pursue and develop a value creation model that encompasses three main elements: investing in research development to identify and commercialize new, innovative materials and delivery systems; maintaining a deep understanding of both consumer preferences and consumer product brands; and excellence in our creative capabilities. Our goal is to deliver differentiated solutions that enable our customers brands to win in the marketplace. In order to pursue these strategies, our organization is focused on ensuring that we efficiently create, produce, and sell unique, superior, and economically competitive products through our world class integration of research and development, consumer insight, customer intimacy, creativity, and operational excellence. We believe we are well positioned to achieve success by targeting strategically important global and regional customers in both developed and emerging markets; attracting, developing and retaining top talent; investing in research and development; and fostering a culture of innovation, accountability, cost discipline and continuous improvement. CHANGE IN MANAGEMENT During the interim period from October 1, 2009 through February 28, 2010, the Company operated using temporary office of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Company, which was comprised of Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Berryman; Group President Fragrances, Nicolas Mirzayantz; and Group President, Flavors, Hernan Vaisman. Each of these executives remained in their then current positions while carrying out their Office of the CEO responsibilities. The Office of the CEO reported to the Board of Directors. On March 1, 2010 Douglas D. Tough assumed the position of Chairman of the Board of Directors (Chairman) and CEO. 20 Table of Contents Effective December 31, 2010, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, Dennis Meany retired from the Company. Since Mr. Meanys retirement, our CEO has assumed direct oversight for the legal functions and our Executive Vice President, Head of Supply Chain, has assumed direct oversight for the regulatory functions. Sales Commentary A breakdown of sales by principal product category is depicted in the graph below. 2010 Sales by Category Our five largest customers comprise 32% of consolidated sales and our top 25 customers comprise 52%; these percentages have remained fairly constant for several years. We have one customer that accounts for 10% of our sales. A key factor for commercial success is inclusion on the strategic customers core supplier lists, opening opportunities to win new business. We are on the core supplier lists of a large majority of our strategic customers. Net sales by business unit for 2010, 2009 and 2008 were as follows: Percent Percent Net Sales 2010 Change 2009 Change 2008 Fragrances $ 1,420 14 % $ 1,245 4 % $ 1,297 Flavors 1,203 11 % 1,081 1 % 1,092 Total net sales $ 2,623 13 % $ 2,326 3 % $ 2,389 2010 Sales by Destination We manage our operations by global business units but utilize destination sales as a supplemental performance measure and indicator of underlying market trends. Although reported sales and earnings are affected by the weakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar, this has not had a long term effect on the underlying competitiveness of our business. 21 Table of Contents Net sales by destination for 2010, 2009 and 2008 were as follows: Percent Percent Sales by Destination 2010 Change 2009 Change 2008 EAME(1) $ 897 11 % $ 808 11 % $ 907 Greater Asia 677 18 % 575 5 % 547 North America 651 8 % 600 0 % 601 Latin America 398 16 % 343 3 % 334 Total net sales, as reported $ 2,623 13 % $ 2,326 3 % $ 2,389 (1) Europe, Africa and Middle East 2010 in Comparison to 2009 Sales for 2010 totaled $2,623 million, an increase of 13% from $2,326 million in 2009. The significant acceleration of growth (13% in Local Currency; LC terms) reflects strong commercial performance in both businesses, higher volumes, including the effects of re stocking in developed markets, most notably in the first half of the year and stronger sales mix for both businesses. Sales from new wins accounted for half of the LC sales gains. In addition, higher volumes were driven by a broad based recovery in demand and lower base period comparisons in 2009 (primarily in Fine Fragrances, Ingredients, and Home Care). Foreign currency movements had only a minor impact on year over year sales growth, although there was volatility from quarter to quarter. Flavors Business Unit On a reported basis Flavor sales increased 11%; excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, LC sales for the Flavors business increased 10% from the prior year period. Almost 60% of year over year gain was driven by higher volume (including some elements of re stocking) with the remaining due to sales from new business. Solid growth was experienced across all product categories, led by double digit LC growth in our Beverage and Confectionery categories and near double digit growth in the others. Our regional growth was driven by EAME and Greater Asia which benefited from result of higher volumes and net new business particularly in the Beverage, Confectionery, and Savory categories. Growth in both regions benefited from continued investments to strengthen our commercial and development capabilities. Sales in North America were up 6% due to higher volume and new business in Beverages and Confectionery. Latin America had solid growth, up 6% in LC as new business wins and volume recovery in Confectionery and Savory more than offset the effects of non strategic business lost last year. Overall growth was led by solid double digit growth in emerging markets of 14%, which represent 47% of Flavors overall sales. Fragrances Business Unit Fragrance sales increased significantly, up 14% on a reported basis and 16% in LC terms. Approximately 60% of the improvement was driven by sales from new wins with our customers with the balance attributable to increased volume (including the benefit of weaker prior year base sales in Fine Fragrance and Ingredients). The volume gains reflect a bounce back in demand supported by increased customer promotional activities, mainly in Fine Fragrance, lower base period comparisons and re stocking in the developed markets. Overall, Fine Beauty Care LC sales increased 26% versus last year, driven by significant gains in new business, a recovery in demand (including effects of re stocking), and low prior year activity levels. LC Functional Fragrance sales increased 7%, driven by double digit gains in Home Care resulting from new business and solid growth in our Fabric Care category. Ingredient LC sales increased 18% driven by a recovery in demand, weaker year ago activity and customer success within certain specialty grades. All regions delivered double digit LC sales gains, led by Latin America (Fine Beauty and Ingredients) and EAME (Fine Fragrance and Functional). Greater Asias growth was led by strong Functional and Hair Care category sales, whereas North America was mainly driven by higher Fine Fragrance sales. Overall growth was well balanced, with both emerging and developed markets delivering double digit LC gains, although emerging market growth was strongest at 18%. 22 Table of Contents Sales by Region and Category Regional and product category sales performance for 2010 compared to 2009, in reported dollars and local currency, was as follows: % Change in Sales 2010 vs 2009 Fine Beauty Care Functional Ingredients Total Frag. Flavors Total North America Reported 11 % 2 % 23 % 11 % 6 % 8 % EAME Reported 25 % 1 % 12 % 12 % 10 % 11 % Local Currency 31 % 6 % 17 % 17 % 13 % 15 % Latin America Reported 44 % 5 % 14 % 20 % 10 % 16 % Local Currency 40 % 5 % 14 % 18 % 6 % 14 % Greater Asia Reported 22 % 19 % 11 % 18 % 17 % 18 % Local Currency 20 % 17 % 10 % 17 % 12 % 14 % Total Reported 24 % 6 % 15 % 14 % 11 % 13 % Local Currency 26 % 7 % 18 % 16 % 10 % 13 % Local Currency Sales Drivers North America Fine Beauty sales growth was driven by 16% growth in Fine Fragrance associated with general demand recovery (including some elements of re stocking) as well as weaker year ago comparison levels (mostly in the first half of the year) combined with good market success for new business launches. The strong performance in Ingredients reflects broad based volume gains, re stocking and weak market conditions last year. Functional Fragrance sales increased as strong new business wins across all categories more than offset volume erosion in Fabric Care, with the strongest gain within the Home Care category. Double digit growth in Beverages (volume) and Confectionery (net new wins) categories led the growth in the Flavors business, with Savory also contributing solid growth. EAME delivered strong sales gains across all categories (except Personal Wash), led by new business and demand recovery in Fine Fragrance, Ingredients and Fabric Care plus net new wins and higher volume for Flavors, notably within the Beverage category, which grew 27%. The Flavors business also benefited from double digit growth in Confectionery and Dairy. Re stocking also supported growth in the developed countries within the region across most categories. Latin Americas sales performance was led by general recovery in demand and new business in Fine Fragrance, which grew 50%. Double digit growth in Beauty Care, Confectionery, Dairy and Savory categories more than offset the effect of non strategic Flavors business lost last year. The Functional Fragrance category improvement benefited from both new business and volume recovery in Home Care and Fabric Care. Greater Asia delivered double digit LC sales growth in all categories. Fine Beauty Care gains were driven by demand recovery and new business wins in Hair Care and Toiletries. Fine Fragrances growth of 40% also benefited from demand recovery and a weaker prior year base. Within Functional Fragrances, Fabric, Home Care and Personal Wash all achieved double digit gains reflecting both strong commercial performance and solid demand growth. Flavor sales growth was driven by new product introductions and volume growth mainly in Savory, Beverage and Confectionery, with all major categories producing double digit gains. 2009 in Comparison to 2008 Sales for 2009 totaled $2,326 million, decreasing 3% from the prior year period of $2,389 million, as Flavor sales declined 1% and Fragrance sales decreased 4%. Foreign exchange had a 3% negative impact on reported sales during 2009 as the U.S. dollar was stronger during the first three quarters of 2009 versus the comparable year ago period. Market conditions improved during the second half of 2009, as global economic conditions strengthened and customer inventory levels stabilized. LC sales increased over 2% during both the third and fourth quarters compared to a decline of 3% during the first six months of 2009. 23 Table of Contents Flavors Business Unit Flavor sales decreased 1% for 2009 compared to 2008 as the effects of a stronger U.S. dollar, soft demand and inventory corrections in Europe and customer specific losses in Latin America more than offset new wins, solid demand and price increases in North America and Greater Asia. Excluding the impact of currencies, sales for the Flavors business increased over 2% during 2009 compared to 2008. Fragrances Business Unit Fragrance sales decreased 4% for 2009 compared to 2008 reflecting double digit LC sales declines for Fine Fragrances, as consumers reduced discretionary spending and the industry significantly reduced inventories across the supply chain. These headwinds were partially offset by solid growth and new wins in beauty care, toiletries and substantially all functional fragrance categories. Excluding the impact of currencies, sales for the Fragrances business declined 1% during 2009 compared to 2008. Sales by Region and Category Regional and product category sales performance for 2009 compared to 2008, in reported dollars and local currency, was as follows: % Change in Sales 2009 vs 2008 Fine Beauty Care Functional Ingredients Total Frag. Flavors Total North America Reported 14 % 1 % 5 % 3 % 3 % 0 % EAME Reported 24 % 3 % 11 % 13 % 7 % 11 % Local Currency 18 % 2 % 6 % 8 % 0 % 5 % Latin America Reported 8 % 4 % 2 % 5 % 0 % 3 % Local Currency 9 % 5 % 1 % 5 % 4 % 5 % Greater Asia Reported 17 % 14 % 1 % 12 % 1 % 5 % Local Currency 20 % 16 % 3 % 13 % 4 % 7 % Total Reported 12 % 3 % 4 % 4 % 1 % 3 % Local Currency 8 % 5 % 2 % 1 % 2 % 0 % Local Currency Sales Drivers North America sales were flat as the erosion and volume declines in Fine Fragrance and Flavors compounds offset more than $40 million in new product introductions, plus modest price realization in Flavors and Functional Fragrances. Ingredient sales growth was mainly attributable to cost driven price increases. EAME sales declines in LC were driven by de stocking and weak underlying demand for Fine Fragrance and Ingredients that more than offset solid win performance in Functional Fragrances. Flavor sales were effectively flat as new wins in Savory and Confectionary plus pricing were offset by customer inventory reductions across most categories. Latin America sales growth was 5% in LC led by near double digit growth in the Fine Fragrances and Beauty Care and solid performance in the Functional Fragrances and Flavors categories. The growth was primarily driven by new product introductions of approximately $15 million combined with price increases across both businesses. Greater Asia LC sales growth was largely driven by more than $15 million in new product introductions in Fabric and Hair Care, combined with approximately $10 million in new product introductions in Flavors which more than offset the effects of customer inventory reductions in the Ingredients category supply chain. 24 Table of Contents Consolidated Operating Results The percentage relationship of cost of goods sold and other operating expenses to reported sales is detailed as follows: 2010 2009 2008 Cost of goods sold 58.3 % 59.8 % 59.4 % Research and development expenses 8.3 % 7.9 % 8.2 % Selling and administrative expenses 17.1 % 16.8 % 16.8 % Cost of goods sold includes the cost of materials and manufacturing expenses; raw materials generally constitute 70% of the total. Research and development expenses are for the development of new and improved products, technical product support, compliance with governmental regulations, and help in maintaining relationships with customers who are often dependent on technological advances. Selling and administrative expenses support our sales and operating levels. 2010 in Comparison to 2009 Cost of goods sold, as a percentage of sales, decreased to 58.3% in 2010 compared to 59.8% during 2009. The improvement in 2010 versus the prior year period reflects favorable input costs, combined with better absorption resulting from higher volumes, continued margin recovery efforts, and a stronger sales mix. This improvement was partially offset by inventory write offs and transition costs associated with the rationalization of our Fragrance and Ingredients operations in Europe. Research and development (RD) expenses increased approximately $34 million from the prior year. The increase was due to growth driven incentive compensation accruals of $15 million and lower RD tax credits of $5 million. The remaining increase was due to higher basic research, targeted investments to support strategic growth initiatives, and lower prior period base comparison resulting from some curtailment in 2009 spend due to the then prevailing economic crisis. Selling and administrative expenses (SA), as a percentage of sales, increased slightly to 17.1% of sales compared to 16.8% for 2009. Overall spending increased $57 million versus the prior year, mainly driven by higher provisions for incentive compensation of $36 million. The remaining variance was due to planned investments and volume related activity to support growth, contingency related costs and fees, and lower prior period base spending in 2009 due to the prevailing economic crisis. The 2009 results include approximately $6 million of severance and related costs, primarily associated with the change in CEO. Interest Expense During 2010, interest expense totaled $49 million compared to $62 million in 2009. The 2009 amount includes $4 million of interest paid on the close out of a cross currency interest rate swap classified as a net investment hedge. The additional reduction versus 2009 reflects certain debt repayments of more than $210 million made during the second half of 2009. Average cost of debt was 5.0% for the 2010 period compared to 5.5% in 2009. Other Expense (Income), Net Other expense was $8 million in 2010 versus other income of $2 million in 2009, approximately 50% of which relates to losses on foreign exchange transactions. The remaining change is principally attributable to higher provisions for non controlling interest in consolidated subsidiaries and miscellaneous non operating expenses. Income Taxes The effective tax rate for the year 2010 was 26.7% compared to 29.3% during 2009. The year over year decrease reflects the mix of earnings across the countries in which the Company operates, an adjustment to provisions for tax reserves, and lower repatriation costs. The 2009 results include $6 million of tax expense due to the recognition of out of period tax adjustments arising from periods 2006 and prior, and was also impacted by the higher level of restructuring costs which carried lower tax benefits. 25 Table of Contents Operating Results by Business Unit We evaluate the performance of business units based on operating profit before interest expense, other expense (income), net and income taxes. See Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the reconciliation to Income before taxes. Flavors Business Unit In 2010, Flavors operating profit totaled $243 million, or 20.2% as a percentage of sales, compared to $208 million or 19.3% in 2009. The improvement in profitability was mainly driven by a 100 basis point (bps) improvement in gross margin resulting from strong sales growth and better absorption, improving input costs, and the benefits of our margin improvement initiatives, partially offset by higher tolling costs associated with some outsourcing of work. Research, selling and administrative costs (RSA) were down 10 bps as a percentage of sales. Higher overall RSA expenses were due to targeted investments in business development, growth driven incentive compensation costs, and product liability and other contingency claims. Fragrances Business Unit Fragrances operating profit for 2010 was $235 million, or 16.5% as a percentage of sales, compared to $171 million or 13.7% reported in 2009. The 2010 period includes $10 million of restructuring related charges related to the rationalization of our European fragrance manufacturing footprint compared to $18 million in the prior year period. Excluding restructuring charges in each period, operating profit increased more than $56 million to $245 million (17.3% of sales) versus $189 million (15.1% of sales) during 2009. The improvement in profit was driven by a 200 bps increase in gross margin resulting from higher volumes and net win performance, favorable input costs, and the benefits of ongoing profit improvement initiatives, which were partially offset by inventory write offs and transition costs associated with the rationalization of our Fragrances and Ingredients operations in Europe. RSA as a percentage of sales improved 150 bps due to positive cost leverage on our higher volume. Higher overall RSA expenses were due to increased incentive compensation expense, lower RD credits and investments in business development. Global Expenses Global expenses represent corporate and headquarters related expenses which include legal, finance, human resources and other administrative expenses that are not allocated to an individual business unit. In 2010, Global expenses were $61 million compared to $39 million during 2009. The increase in Global expenses is mainly due to higher incentive compensation of $22 million with the balance mainly related to litigation related provisions and costs. In 2009, Global expenses included $6 million of employee separation costs associated with the change in CEO. 2009 in Comparison to 2008 Cost of goods sold, as a percentage of sales, was 59.8% in 2009 compared with 59.4% in 2008. This increase reflects higher input costs, a weaker sales mix principally related to Fine Fragrance and slightly lower absorption that could only be partially offset by cost recovery, and productivity and margin improvement efforts, including pricing. RD expenses were down $12.1 million in 2009 compared to the prior year, mainly due to increased foreign RD credits of $8 million driven by program enhancements and additional qualifying expenditures. The remaining reduction was due to tight cost control on applied research and development and the effects of a stronger U.S. dollar, partially offset by higher incentive compensation. During 2008 and the first nine months of 2009, these credits were previously recognized as a reduction of tax expense. SA, as a percentage of sales, was 16.8% during 2009 and 2008. The 2009 results include $6.0 million of employee separation costs and expenses related to the change in CEO whereas the 2008 amount included the benefit of a $2.6 million insurance recovery related to a prior period product liability claim offset by $3.4 million for employee separation costs. Excluding these items, SA declined $15 million and would have been 16.5% as a percentage of sales in 2009 compared to 16.7% in 2008. The reduction in SA dollars reflects a stronger U.S. currency and cost reduction efforts, which more than offset higher pension expense, higher incentive compensation expense, and provision for product claims. 26 Table of Contents Interest Expense During 2009, interest expense totaled $61.8 million as compared to $74.0 million in 2008. The 2009 decrease reflects a lower average borrowing cost, the elimination of a cross currency interest rate swap during the second half of 2008 and debt repayments during 2009. The 2009 amount includes $4 million of interest paid on the close out of a cross currency interest rate swap classified as a net investment hedge. Average cost of debt was 5.5% for 2009 compared to 6.1% in 2008. Other Expense (Income), Net Other expense during 2009 was $1.9 million compared to other income of $2.8 million in 2008. Approximately 50% of the change was mainly due to year over year changes in foreign exchange gains/(losses) on trade receivables and payables during the year. During 2008, the Company recognized foreign exchange gains, primarily during the fourth quarter, as a result of the rapid strengthening of the U.S. dollar (USD) during the period of financial turmoil. During 2009, we saw a general weakening trend for the USD that has resulted in a higher level of foreign exchange losses on trade receivables and payables. The remaining change was due to less favorable mark to market adjustments on our investments. Income Taxes The effective tax rate for the year 2009 was 29.3% compared to 19.1% during 2008. The 2008 period included a $23 million reduction in tax expense related primarily to prior period tax settlements versus $2 million during 2009. The 2009 results include $6 million of tax expense due to the recognition of out of period tax adjustments arising from periods 2006 and prior. The Company did not adjust the prior periods as it concluded that such adjustments were not material to the prior periods consolidated financial statements or to the current year. Excluding these items from both periods, as well as the previously discussed restructuring charges, the tax rate for 2009 was 27.4% compared to 27.5% for 2008. The change reflects $3 million of higher repatriation costs on foreign earnings offset by a net reduction of valuation allowances on certain deferred assets and the mix of earnings between high and low tax jurisdictions. Operating Results by Business Unit We evaluate the performance of business units based on operating profit before interest expense, other expense (income), net and income taxes. See Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the reconciliation to Income before taxes. Flavors Business Unit In 2009, Flavors operating profit totaled $208 million or 19.3% of sales, compared to $198 million or 18.1% of sales in 2008. The operating profit improvement reflects increased prices, ongoing cost discipline, and cost recovery and margin improvement efforts, which more than offset higher input costs and negative currency impacts. The 2008 amount included $3.5 million of restructuring expenses versus $0.6 million in 2009. Fragrances Business Unit In 2009, Fragrances operating profit was $171 million or 13.7% of sales, compared to $202 million or 15.6% of sales in 2008. The 2008 figure has been revised to reflect RD credits that were previously reflected as a reduction of tax expense. The 2009 amount includes $18 million of restructuring related expenses compared to $4 million in 2008. During 2009, as part of the rationalization of our European fragrance manufacturing footprint, we decided to close our Fragrance compounding facility in Ireland and partially close our ingredients plant in the United Kingdom (UK). In addition, we eliminated 60 positions to improve profitability. The decline in profit was driven by significantly lower volumes in Fine Fragrances and Ingredients, higher input costs and unfavorable mix, partially offset by improved pricing, margin recovery efforts, lower overhead expenses, and $8 million of additional RD credits versus the prior year. Excluding the restructuring charges, operating profit margins declined 70 bps over the comparable prior year period. 27 Table of Contents Global Expenses Global expenses represent corporate and headquarters related expenses which include legal, finance, human resources and other administrative expenses that are not allocated to an individual business unit. In 2009, Global expenses were $39 million compared to $45 million during 2008. In 2009, Global expenses included $6 million of employee separation costs associated with the change in CEO. Global expenses in 2008 included approximately $10 million of restructuring charges and $3 million of employee separation costs and $2 million of implementation costs related to our global shared service structure, partially offset by a $3 million insurance recovery related to prior period product liability claim. Excluding these items, global expenses were flat, indicative of strict cost control measures that offset inflationary pressure. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At December 31, 2010 and 2009, goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $714 million and $721 million, respectively. Additional details are contained in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other intangible assets include patents, trademarks and other intellectual property, valued at acquisition, primarily through independent appraisals, which are amortized on a straight line basis over periods ranging from 6 to 20 years. We review our other intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in business conditions indicate that their full carrying value may not be recovered. Restructuring and Other Charges Restructuring and other charges primarily consist of separation costs for employees including severance, outplacement and other benefit costs. The Company recorded a net pre tax charge of $4.1 million during the second quarter ended June 30, 2009. This amount included $6.6 million for severance and related costs associated with the elimination of approximately 70 positions globally, less a $2.5 million reduction to previously recorded provisions. The reduction in prior reserves was attributable to lower estimated benefit costs on severance paid as well as fewer position eliminations requiring severance. During September 2009, as part of the rationalization of our European fragrance manufacturing footprint, the Company announced that it had initiated a collective consultation process with employees regarding the closure of its Fragrances compounding facility in Drogheda, Ireland, as well as the partial closure of its Fragrance Ingredients plant in Haverhill, UK. The Company has completed both consultation processes and has communicated its intent to proceed with the closures. The Company completed the negotiations with the Haverhill employee representatives during the fourth quarter of 2009. The Company has completed its negotiations with the Drogheda, Ireland employee representatives regarding separation benefits related to the closure of the Companys compounding facility at that location during the third quarter 2010. Based upon the period end estimates regarding the separation agreements, the Company increased its provision for severance costs by approximately $4 million in 2010. The balance of the restructuring charges in 2010 was mainly due to accelerated depreciation and other restructuring related costs pertaining to the rationalization of our Fragrances and Ingredients operations in Europe. The Company ceased its operations at the Drogheda plant as of September 30, 2010. The Company is currently working with the Trustees of the pension plan regarding various aspects associated with the funding requirements for the plan, which it expects to conclude in the first quarter of 2011. We expect to incur total costs related to this restructuring plan of approximately $34 million, consisting primarily of $18 million of employee termination costs, $12 million in plant shutdown and business transition costs and $4 million in accelerated depreciation of related fixed assets. The increase from our prior estimate reflects projected higher inventory write offs and transition costs associated with a more complex operating environment, due to higher activity levels, and potential incremental pension settlement costs. 28 Table of Contents Inception to date, we have recorded total expenses of $30.8 million relating to this plan, of which $24.5 million was recorded to restructuring and other charges and $6.3 million recorded to costs of sales and research, selling and administrative expenses. Positions eliminated and charges, net of reversal, by business segment in 2010, 2009 and 2008 are detailed in the table below: Restructuring Charges ( In Thousands) Positions Affected 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 Flavors $ $ 637 $ 3,538 7 36 Fragrances 10,077 18,046 4,396 (10 ) 200 38 Global (382 ) 10,278 5 144 Total $ 10,077 $ 18,301 $ 18,212 (10 ) 212 218 Movements in related accruals during 2008, 2009 and 2010 are as follows: Asset Related Employee and (In Millions) Related Other Total Balance January 1, 2008 $ 3 $ $ 3 Additional charges, net of reversal 18 18 Payments and other (6 ) (6 ) Balance December 31, 2008 15 15 Additional charges, net of reversal 17 1 18 Payments and other (13 ) (13 ) Non cash charges (1 ) (1 ) Balance December 31, 2009 19 19 Additional charges, net of reversal 4 6 10 Payments and other (19 ) (1 ) (20 ) Non cash charges (5 ) (5 ) Balance December 31, 2010 $ 4 $ $ 4 The remaining employee related liabilities are expected to be utilized by 2011 as obligations are satisfied. Income Taxes Effective utilization of the cash generated by our international operations is a critical component of our tax strategy. Strategic dividend repatriation from foreign subsidiaries creates U.S. taxable income, which enables us to recognize deferred tax assets. Pursuant to ASC 740 Income Taxes, we establish a valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Historically, we have provided a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets resulting from state net operating losses and state credits, as well as selective non U.S. affiliates net operating losses. The changes in the valuation allowances from December 31, 2009 are primarily attributable to the increase in amortizable intangibles in non U.S. affiliates. 29 Table of Contents Financial Condition Cash and cash equivalents totaled $131 million at December 31, 2010 compared to $80 million at December 31, 2009. Working capital totaled $664 million at year end 2010 compared to $644 million at December 31, 2009. The 2010 increase in working capital reflects sharply higher commercial activity, the build up of contingency stocks related to the European rationalization plan and higher inventory levels needed to meet customer requirements. Accounts receivable was up slightly due to higher commercial activity, which was partially offset by reductions in past due balances. The increase in our current liabilities was driven by higher trade payables, mainly due to the higher commercial activity and a more disciplined approach in our purchase to pay process, and increased accruals for income taxes and incentive compensation. Gross additions to property, plant and equipment were $106 million, $67 million and $85 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and are expected to approximate 4% 5% of sales in 2011. The increase in capital expenditures is mainly attributable to investments needed to support growth in emerging markets and certain capacity expansions in critical process technologies. Our financial condition continues to be strong, as evidenced by substantial cash flow from operations and substantial drawdown capacity of approximately $818 million on our multi year revolving credit facility. Operating cash flow provides the primary source of funds for operating and capital needs as well as dividends paid to shareholders. We anticipate that cash flows from operations and availability under our existing credit facilities are sufficient to fund our capital spending and other cash requirements for at least the next eighteen months. We regularly assess our capital structure, including both current and long term debt instruments, as compared to our cash generation and investment needs in order to provide ample flexibility. As discussed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, at December 31, 2010, we had entered into various guarantees and had undrawn outstanding letters of credit from financial institutions. These arrangements were entered into in connection with normal business operations and based on the current facts and circumstances they are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. Operating cash flow in 2010 was $315 million compared to $292 million and $221 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The improvement in operating cash flows during 2010 as compared to 2009 reflects higher earnings in the current year period, partially offset by the higher core working capital (receivables plus inventory, minus payables) discussed above. We began to see the benefits of our internal process improvement initiatives for our core working capital efficiency in the second half of 2009. We expect to make additional operational gains in working capital management going forward. The improvement in operating cash flows during 2009 as compared to 2008 was led by the reduction of our inventories, which was driven by our internal process improvement initiatives combined with better operating discipline over receivables and payables. Operating cash flows in 2008 benefited from the receipt of $18 million on termination of an interest rate swap. The decrease in other assets and liabilities was driven by long term incentive plan payments, lower deferred taxes, and pension and other postretirement payments. Net investing activities in 2010 utilized $107 million compared to $81 million and $90 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in investing activities in 2010 resulted from capital investments to support capacity requirements in emerging markets as well as key technologies, primarily in the Flavors business. The reduction in 2009 funds used compared to 2008 reflects a $20 million decline in capital spending, partially offset by a $14 million payment to terminate a net investment hedge related to our investment in Europe. Compliance with existing governmental requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment has not materially affected our operations, earnings or competitive position. In 2010 and 2009, we spent $6 million and $4 million, respectively, on capital projects and $18 million and $17 million, respectively, in operating expenses and governmental charges for the purpose of complying with such regulations. Expenditures for these purposes will continue for the foreseeable future. In addition, we are party to a number of proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act or similar state statutes. It is expected that the impact of any judgments in or voluntary settlements of such proceedings will not be material to our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 30 Table of Contents The dividend paid per share in 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $1.04, $1.00 and $0.94, respectively. In January 2010 and April 2010 we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share to shareholders and in July 2010 and October 2010, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.27 per share to shareholders. In January 2009, April 2009, July 2009 and October 2009 we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share to shareholders. In January, April, July and October 2008, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share to shareholders. We paid dividends totaling $81 million, $79 million and $75 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our current intention is to pay dividends approximating 30% 35% of yearly earnings; however, the payment of dividends is determined by the Board of Directors (Board) at its discretion based on various factors, and no assurance can be provided as to future dividends. No shares were repurchased during the year ended December 31, 2010. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we repurchased 75,000 shares on the open market at a cost of $2 million or an average of $26.22 per share. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased 700,000 shares of our common stock at a cost of $30 million on the open market. In July 2007, our Board authorized us to repurchase up to 15% or $750 million worth of our then outstanding common stock, whichever is less. In September 2007, under the July 2007 Plan, we entered into two agreements to purchase shares of our common stock under a $450 million accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program. The ASR concluded in June 2008. Total aggregate shares repurchased under the ASR program were 9.7 million shares at an average purchase price of $46.53. The ASR was primarily funded through the issuance of $500 million of Senior Unsecured Notes in four series under a Note Purchase Agreement. See Note 8, Borrowings, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these notes. We supplement short term liquidity with access to capital markets, mainly through bank credit facilities and issuance of commercial paper. In 2005, IFF, including certain subsidiaries, entered into a revolving credit agreement (the Facility) with certain banks. The Facility provides for a U.S. $350 million (Tranche A) and Euro 400 million (Tranche B) multi currency revolving credit facility. Tranche A is available to IFF for commercial paper backstop and general corporate purposes; Tranche B is available to both IFF and the European subsidiaries for general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the Facility bear interest at an annual rate of LIBOR (or in relation to any Euro denominated loans, EURIBOR) plus a margin, currently 25 bps, linked to our credit rating. We pay a commitment fee on the aggregate unused commitments; such fee is not material. The Facility expires on November 23, 2012. During 2008 the maximum amount of outstanding commercial paper was $30 million. We did not issue commercial paper during 2010 and 2009. As of December 31, 2010 we had total borrowings under the Facility of $61 million. The amount which we are able to draw down on under the Facility is limited by financial covenants as described in more detail below. At December 31, 2010 we had a remaining overall borrowing capacity of $840 million. However, our drawdown capacity on the Facility was limited to $818 million based on existing balances outstanding under the Facility at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2010, we had $922 million of debt outstanding compared to $1,012 million outstanding at December 31, 2009. We regularly assess our capital structure, including both current and long term debt instruments, as compared to our cash generation and investment needs in order to provide ample flexibility. In that connection, in December 2009 we prepaid, without penalty, the remaining outstanding balance (approximately $151 million) of our Japanese Yen loan, which was scheduled to mature in 2011. Total debt repayments during 2010 amounted to $103 million as compared to $238 million in 2009. In 2011 we have principal debt repayments related to our 2006 Series B note of $100 million and Japanese Yen note of $22 million. In February 2009 we terminated a $300 million USD LIBOR to EURIBOR interest rate swap which required us to make a payment of $16 million. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these transactions. The Facility contains the most restrictive covenant requiring us to maintain, at the end of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of net debt for borrowed money to adjusted EBITDA in respect of the previous 12 month period of not more than 3.25 to 1. 31 Table of Contents At December 31, 2010 and 2009 we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants. At December 31, 2010 our Net Debt/adjusted EBITDA (1) was 1.56 to 1 as defined by the debt agreements, well below the financial covenants of existing outstanding debt. Failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under these agreements would constitute default and would allow the lenders to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the related agreement. If such acceleration were to occur, we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness. We would likely have to seek amendments under the agreements for relief from the financial covenants or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity, and or asset sales, if necessary. We may be unable to amend the agreements or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturities are accelerated. (1) Adjusted EBITDA and Net Debt, which are non GAAP measures used for these covenants, are calculated in accordance with the definition in the debt agreements. In this context, these measures are used solely to provide information on the extent to which we are in compliance with debt covenants and may not be comparable to adjusted EBITDA and Net Debt used by other companies. Reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA to net income and net debt to total debt are as follows: 12 Months Ended December 31, (In Millions) 2010 2009 Net income $ 263.6 $ 195.5 Interest expense 48.7 61.8 Income taxes 96.0 81.0 Depreciation 73.1 72.3 Amortization 6.1 6.2 Specified items (1) 10.1 24.6 Adjusted EBITDA $ 497.6 $ 441.4 (1) Specified items for the 12 months ended December 31, 2010 of $10.1 million consist of restructuring charges. Specified items for the 12 months ended December 31, 2009 of $24.6 million consist principally of restructuring charges ($18.3 million) and employee separation costs ($6.3 million). December 31, (In Millions) 2010 2009 Total Debt $ 921.6 $ 1,011.5 Adjustments: Deferred gain on interest rate swaps (12.9 ) (15.0 ) Cash and cash equivalents (131.3 ) (80.1 ) Net Debt $ 777.4 $ 916.4 32 Table of Contents At December 31, 2010, we had contractual payment obligations due within the time periods as specified in the following table: Payments Due Contractual Obligations 2016 and (In Millions) Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 thereafter Borrowings (1) $ 909 $ 134 $ 150 $ $ 625 Interest on borrowings (1) 373 49 88 79 157 Operating leases (2) 270 25 44 37 164 Purchase commitments (3) 15 15 Pension funding obligations (4) 78 26 52 Postretirement obligations (5) 75 6 13 15 41 Total $ 1,720 $ 255 $ 347 $ 131 $ 987 (1) See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our various borrowing facilities. (2) Operating leases include facility and other lease commitments executed in the normal course of the business, including sale leaseback obligations included in Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Further details concerning worldwide aggregate operating leases are contained in Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (3) Purchase obligations and capital project commitments are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. (4) See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our retirement plans. Anticipated funding obligations are based on current actuarial assumptions. The projected contributions beyond fiscal year 2013 are not currently determinable. (5) Amounts represent expected future benefit payments for our postretirement benefit plans. The table above does not include $64 million of the total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and approximately $11 million of associated accrued interest. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows, the Company is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid. Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As disclosed in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and accompanying disclosures. These estimates are based on managements best judgment of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future. Actual results may ultimately differ from estimates. Those areas requiring the greatest degree of management judgment or deemed most critical to our financial reporting involve: The periodic assessment of potential impairment of intangible assets acquired in business combinations. We currently have net intangible assets, including goodwill, of $714 million. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually. In assessing the potential for impairment of goodwill, management uses the most current actual and forecasted operating data available and current market based assumptions in accordance with the criteria in ASC 350 Intangibles Goodwill and Other. We identified two reporting units, the Flavors reporting unit and the Fragrances reporting unit. These reporting units were determined based on the level at which the performance is measured and reviewed. We perform a goodwill impairment test on an annual basis or more frequently in certain circumstances. We utilize the two step approach, by assessing the fair value of our reporting units based on discounted cash flows. In addition, we utilize external market data of comparable companies to assess the reasonableness of the cash flows indicated values. There have been no significant changes to the methodologies used for valuing goodwill since the prior year. We deem goodwill to be impaired if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of November 30, 2010, which indicated no impairment of goodwill, as the estimated fair values substantially exceeded the carrying values of each of our reporting units. In addition, there were no triggering events which required asset impairment reviews and the undiscounted cash flows associated with other long lived intangible assets. 33 Table of Contents The analysis and evaluation of income taxes. We account for taxes in accordance with ASC 740 Income Taxes. Under ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, based on tax laws as currently enacted. The provision for income taxes is based on statutory income tax rates and planning opportunities available in the various tax jurisdictions where we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and tax positions. We may be challenged upon review by the applicable taxing authority and positions taken by us may not be sustained. We regularly update these accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances. The evaluation of potential legal and environmental liabilities, where changing circumstances, rules and regulations require regular reassessment of related practices and anticipated costs. We are subject to certain legal claims regarding products and other matters, as well as environmental related matters. Significant management judgment is involved in determining when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the extent to which it can be reasonably estimated. We regularly assess potential liabilities with respect to all legal claims based on the most recent available information, in consultation with outside counsel handling the defense of such matters. To the extent a liability is deemed to have been incurred and can be reasonably estimated, we recognize a corresponding liability; if the reasonably estimated liability is a range, we recognize that amount considered most likely, or in the absence of such a determination, the minimum reasonably estimated liability. To the extent such claims are covered by various insurance policies, we separately evaluate the likelihood of recovery and account for any related insurance receivable. Management judgments involve determination as to whether a liability has been incurred, the reasonably estimated amount of that liability, and any potential insurance recovery. We regularly evaluate potential environmental exposure in terms of total estimated cost and the viability of other potentially responsible parties (PRPs) associated with our exposure. Recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress and additional information becomes available. Critical management assumptions relate to expected total costs to remediate and the financial viability of PRPs to share such costs. Determination of the various assumptions employed in the valuation of pension and retiree health care expense and associated obligations. Amounts recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations. Inherent in such valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets, discount rates at which the liabilities could be settled, rates of increase in future compensation levels, mortality rates and health care cost trend rates. These assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In accordance with GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods. We consider a number of factors in determining and selecting assumptions for the overall expected long term rate of return on plan assets. We consider the historical long term return experience of our assets, the current and expected allocation of our plan assets, and expected long term rates of return. We derive these expected long term rates of return with the assistance of our investment advisors. We base our expected allocation of plan assets on a diversified portfolio consisting of domestic and international equity securities, fixed income, real estate, and alternative asset classes. 34 Table of Contents We consider a variety of factors in determining and selecting our assumptions for the discount rate at December 31. For the U.S. plans, the discount rate was based on the internal rate of return for a portfolio of Moodys Aaa, Aa, and Merrill Lynch AAA AA high quality bonds with maturities that are consistent with the projected future benefit payment obligations of the plan. The rate of compensation increase for all plans and the medical cost trend rate for the applicable U.S. plans are based on plan experience. With respect to the U.S. plans, the expected return on plan assets was determined based on an asset allocation model using the current target allocation, real rates of return by asset class and an anticipated inflation rate. The target asset allocation consists of approximately: 60% 65% in equity securities and 35% 40% in fixed income securities. The inflation rate assumed in the model was 2.5%. The plan has achieved a compounded annual rate of return of approximately 8% over the previous 20 years. At December 31, 2010, the actual asset allocation was: 64% in equity securities; 35% in fixed income securities; and 1% in cash. The expected annual rate of return for the non U.S. plans employs a similar set of criteria adapted for local investments, inflation rates and in certain cases specific government requirements. The target asset allocation, for the non U.S. plans, consists of approximately: 55% 60% in fixed income securities; 30% 35% in equity securities; 5% 10% in real estate; and up to 5% in cash. At December 31, 2010, the actual asset allocation was: 55% in fixed income investments; 30% in equity investments; 11% in real estate investments; and 4% in cash. Management establishes the assumptions concerning discount rates and actuarial assumptions based on current market conditions, including asset returns and other factors applicable under the circumstances. Changes in pension and other post employment benefits, and associated expenses, may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions. The impact that a .25% decrease in the discount rate or a 1% change in the medical cost trend rate would have on our pension and other post employment benefit expense, as applicable, is discussed in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The ongoing assessment of the valuation of inventory, given the large number of natural ingredients employed, the quality of which may be diminished over time. We maintain approximately 50% of our inventory as raw materials, providing the greatest degree of flexibility in manufacture and use. Materials are evaluated based on shelf life, known uses and anticipated demand based on forecasted customer order activity and changes in product/sales mix. Management policy provides for an ongoing assessment of inventory with adjustments recorded when an item is deemed to be slow moving or obsolete. Determination of various assumptions employed in the calculation of equity compensation expense. Amounts recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements related to equity compensation are determined based on the number of awards and type of award as well as specific assumptions regarding expected life, stock price volatility, risk free interest rate, termination rates, exercise multiple and the dividend yield. These assumptions are employed in the Binomial model used to value certain awards. Management establishes the assumptions based on current market conditions and historical trends related to the equity awards. Developing the assumptions used in the Binomial model requires significant judgment on our part and, generally, may involve analyzing available historical data, considering whether historical data is relevant to predicting future behavior, making appropriate adjustments to historical data for future expectations, supplementing or replacing company specific historical data with data from other supportable sources and appropriately weighting each of the inputs. These assumptions are evaluated at each grant date. If factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating share based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model, the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect operating income, net income and net income per share. 35 Table of Contents We believe that we have considered relevant circumstances that we may be currently subject to, and the financial statements accurately reflect our best estimate of the results of our operations, financial condition and cash flows for the years presented. We have discussed the decision process and selection of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. New Accounting Standards In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued authoritative guidance revising certain disclosure requirements concerning fair value measurements. The guidance requires an entity to disclose separately significant transfers into and out of Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy and to disclose the reasons for such transfers. It will also require the presentation of purchases, sales, issuances and settlements within Level 3 on a gross basis rather than a net basis. These new disclosure requirements were effective for our first quarter of 2010, except for the additional disclosure of Level 3 activity, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010. We did not have any such transfers into and out of Levels 1 and 2 during the year ended December 31, 2010. Non GAAP Financial Measures The Company uses non GAAP financial operating measures which exclude: employee separation costs (including costs associated with the change in the Chief Executive Officer position in 2009) and restructuring charges (including costs associated with the Companys ongoing restructuring efforts in Europe in 2009 and 2010); benefits of favorable tax rulings and settlements relating to prior years; the benefit of an insurance recovery and costs for the implementation of the global shared services structure in 2008. In addition, in certain instances, we exclude the effects of exchange rate fluctuations when discussing our historical performance. The Company also discloses, from time to time, non GAAP effective tax rates, which exclude the effect of the benefits of tax rulings relating to prior periods, as additional information in seeking to assess and compare our tax rates without the benefit of those tax rulings. Such information is supplemental to information presented in accordance with GAAP and is not intended to represent a presentation in accordance with GAAP. In discussing our historical and expected future results and financial condition, we believe it is meaningful for investors to be made aware of and to be assisted in a better understanding of, on a period to period comparative basis, of financial amounts both including and excluding these identified items, as well as the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on operating results and financial condition. We believe such additional non GAAP information provides investors with an overall perspective of the period to period performance of our core business. In addition, management internally reviews each of these non GAAP measures to evaluate performance on a comparative period to period basis in terms of absolute performance, trends and expected future performance with respect to our core continuing business. A material limitation of these non GAAP measures is that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts, restructuring charges, employee separation costs and implementation costs include actual cash outlays, an insurance recovery is an actual cash recovery and benefits from favorable tax rulings and settlements reflect actual accounting and cash benefits realized; and we compensate for such limitations by presenting the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. These non GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Cautionary Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 Statements in this Annual Report, which are not historical facts or information, are forward looking statements within the meaning of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward looking statements are based on managements current assumptions, estimates and expectations. Certain of such forward looking information may be identified by such terms as expect, anticipate, believe, outlook, guidance, may and similar terms or variations thereof. All information concerning future revenues, tax rates or benefits, interest and other savings, earnings and other future financial results or financial position, constitutes forward looking information. Such forward looking statements are based on a series of expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections about the Company, are not guarantees of future results or performance, and involve significant risks, uncertainties and other factors, including assumptions and projections, for all forward periods. Actual results of the Company may differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. Such factors include, among others, the following: general economic and business conditions in the Companys markets, especially given the current disruption in global economic conditions, including economic and recessionary pressures; energy and commodity prices; decline in consumer confidence and spending; significant fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar; population health and political uncertainties, and the difficulty in projecting the short and long term effects of global economic conditions; movements in interest rates; continued volatility and 36 Table of Contents deterioration of the capital and credit markets, including continued disruption in the commercial paper market, and any adverse impact on our cost of and access to capital and credit; fluctuations in the price, quality and availability of raw materials; the Companys ability to implement its business strategy, including the achievement of anticipated cost savings, profitability and growth targets; the impact of currency fluctuation or devaluation in the Companys principal foreign markets, especially given the current disruptions to such currency markets, and the impact on the availability, effectiveness and cost of the Companys hedging and risk management strategies; the outcome of uncertainties related to litigation; the impact of possible pension funding obligations and increased pension expense on the Companys cash flow and results of operations; and the effect of legal and regulatory proceedings, as well as restrictions imposed on the Company, its operations or its representatives by U.S. and foreign governments. The Company intends its forward looking statements to speak only as of the time of such statements and does not undertake or plan to update or revise them as more information becomes available or to reflect changes in expectations, assumptions or results. The Company can give no assurance that such expectations or forward looking statements will prove to be correct. An occurrence of, or any material adverse change in, one or more of the risk factors or risks and uncertainties referred to in this report or included in our other periodic reports filed with the Commission could materially and adversely impact our operations and our future financial results. Any public statements or disclosures by IFF following this report that modify or impact any of the forward looking statements contained in or accompanying this report will be deemed to modify or supersede such outlook or other forward looking statements in or accompanying this report. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. We operate on a global basis and are exposed to currency fluctuation related to the manufacture and sale of our products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The major foreign currencies involve the markets in the European Union, Great Britain, Mexico, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Australia and Japan, although all regions are subject to foreign currency fluctuations versus the U.S. dollar. We actively monitor our foreign currency exposures in all major markets in which we operate, and employ a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, including foreign currency hedging activities. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts with the objective of reducing exposure to cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency receivables and payables, and with anticipated purchases of certain raw materials used in operations. These contracts, the counterparties to which are major international financial institutions, generally involve the exchange of one currency for a second currency at a future date, and have maturities not exceeding twelve months. The notional amount and maturity dates of such contracts match those of the underlying transactions. The gain or loss on the hedging instrument and services is recorded in earnings at the same time as the transaction being hedged is recorded in earnings. We have also used non U.S. dollar borrowings and foreign currency forward contracts, to hedge the foreign currency exposures of our net investment in certain foreign affiliates, primarily in the European Union. We use derivative instruments as part of our interest rate risk management strategy. The derivative instruments used are comprised principally of fixed to floating rate interest rate swaps. We have established a centralized reporting system to evaluate the effects of changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and other relevant market risks. Our risk management procedures include the monitoring of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures and hedge positions utilizing statistical analyses of cash flows, market value and sensitivity analysis. However, the use of these techniques to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of their accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions. Market exposures are evaluated using a sensitivity model that is intended to measure the potential 10% loss in interest rate and foreign currency forward contracts, assuming adverse market conditions occur. Historical interest rates and foreign exchange rates are used to estimate the volatility and correlation of future rates. The estimated maximum potential one day loss in fair value of interest rate or foreign currency forward contracts, calculated using the sensitivity model, is not material to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in 2010. The estimated maximum yearly loss in earnings due to interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments, calculated utilizing the sensitivity model, is not material to our results of operations in 2010. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets. 37 Table of Contents
