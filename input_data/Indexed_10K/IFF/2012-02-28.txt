ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. (UNLESS INDICATED OTHERWISE, DOLLARS IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS) Overview We create, manufacture and supply flavors and fragrances for the food, beverage, personal care and household products industries. Our flavors and fragrances are individual ingredients or compounds of a large number of ingredients that are blended, mixed or reacted together to produce proprietary formulas created by our perfumers and flavorists. Flavors are the key building blocks that impart taste in processed food and beverage products and play a significant role in determining consumer preference of the end products in which they are used. While we are a global leader, our flavors business is regional in nature, with different formulas that reflect local tastes and ingredients. As a leading creator of flavors, we help our customers deliver on the promise of delicious and healthy foods and drinks that appeal to consumers. Our Flavors business is divided into four categories of products: (1) Savory, (2) Beverages, (3) Sweet, pharmaceutical and oral care (Sweet), and (4) Dairy. Our fragrances are a key component in the worlds finest perfumes and best known consumer brands, including beauty care, fabric care, personal wash and home care products. Our Fragrances business is divided into three categories of products: (1) Fine Fragrance and Beauty Care, (2) Functional Fragrances and (3) Fragrance Ingredients. Development of new flavors and fragrances is driven by a variety of sources including requests from our customers, who are in need of a specific flavor or fragrance for use in a new or modified consumer product, or as a result of internal initiatives stemming from our Consumer Insights program. Our product development team works in partnership with our scientists and researchers to optimize the consumer appeal of the flavor or fragrance. It then becomes a collaborative process between our researchers, our product development team and our customers to perfect the flavor or fragrance so that it is ready to be included in the final consumer product. Our top 25 customers comprised 53% of total sales in 2011; these percentages have remained fairly constant for several years. A key factor for commercial success is inclusion on the strategic customers core supplier lists, opening opportunities to win new business. We are on the core supplier lists of a large majority of our strategic customers. Growth in the global flavors and fragrances market is generally aligned with global population trends, GDP growth and gains in per capita disposable income. The flavor and fragrance market is estimated to be approximately $16 $17 billion; however the exact size of the global market is not available due to fragmentation of data. The top four companies are estimated to comprise approximately 70% of the total estimated sales in the global flavors and fragrances sub segment of the broader market. Leveraging our balanced portfolio of business categories and geographic diversity, sales in 2011 grew 6% on a reported basis and 4% in local currency (LC) terms in spite of the market and macro economic challenges we faced. Flavors continued to achieve strong LC growth of 9% for the full year 2011. The Flavors growth more than offset a 1% decline in LC sales for our Fragrances business. The LC decline for Fragrances reflects very challenging comparable performance in 2010 (with record LC growth of 16%), market weakness in discretionary categories (primarily Fine Fragrances) and price driven volumes declines in Ingredients. Overall, our 2011 results continued to be driven by our strong emerging market presence that represented 46% of total sales and experienced 8% LC growth in 2011. From a geographic perspective, all four regions delivered LC growth in 2011; led by Greater Asia, which now represents our second largest region, with 6% LC growth. 25 Table of Contents 2011 Sales by Business Unit Sales by Destination (DOLLARS IN MILLION) 2011 Percentof sales 2010 Percentof sales 2009 Percentof sales Europe, Africa and Middle East (EAME) $ 957 34 % $ 897 34 % $ 808 35 % Greater Asia (GA) 745 27 % 677 26 % 575 24 % North America (NOAM) 678 24 % 651 25 % 600 26 % Latin America (LA) 408 15 % 398 15 % 343 15 % Total net sales, as reported $ 2,788 $ 2,623 $ 2,326 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW Reported sales for 2011 increased 6% year over year as both Flavors and Fragrances benefited from new business performance and price increases that more than offset price driven volume declines in Ingredients and volume erosion in Fragrance compounds. Exchange rate variations accounted for 2% of the year over year sales increase. The effect of exchange rates can vary by business and region depending upon the mix of sales by destination country as well as the relative percentage of local sales priced in U.S. dollars versus local currencies. LC sales growth of 4% in 2011 was consistent with our long term strategic target of 4% 6% growth, despite the record LC growth achieved in 2010 of 13%. For 2012, we believe that our LC growth will be towards the low end of our long term target as global GDP growth is expected to be relatively weak. We will experience a much larger drag on Flavor sales growth in 2012 as compared to 2011 associated with the exiting of under performing business and demand in Ingredients is still expected to be weak. In particular, LC growth in the first quarter of 2012 will be especially challenged given that this was the strongest quarter during 2011. On a long term basis we expect that sales growth for the industry will generally be in line with the underlying assumptions that support our long term strategic goals, albeit with some risk in the near term given the continuing global economic uncertainty. Changing social habits resulting from increased disposable income, improved focus on personal health and wellness awareness should help drive growth of our consumer product customers business, especially in the emerging markets we have targeted, such as India and China. Gross margins were down year over year as higher raw material costs more than offset the benefits from price increases realized during the course of 2011, operational improvements in Flavors and the benefits associated with the European Fragrance rationalization. We expect to continue to see year over year increases in raw material costs, especially in the early part of 2012 as we are comparing to the lowest levels of 2011. While we made progress during the course of 2011 in compensating for higher input costs through price increases, there was a substantial gap for the realization of these increases, primarily within Fragrances. We will continue to pursue additional price realization and other cost savings initiatives in 2012 that should enable us to offset the pricing gap over the course of the year. Operating profit increased $11.4 million to $427.7 million (15.3% of sales) in 2011 compared to $416.4 million (15.9% of sales). We were able to compensate for the significant gross margin pressure in 2011 by maintaining a strict cost discipline, including the benefits associated with lower incentive compensation. As a 26 Table of Contents result, adjusted operating profit, excluding the effects of restructuring charges in 2011 and 2010 and the Mane patent litigation settlement in 2011, increased $48.0 million to $474.4 million (17.0% of sales) in 2011 as compared to $426.4 million (16.3% of sales) in 2010. In December 2011, we recorded a charge to cover a restructuring which involved a reduction in workforce across Fragrances, Flavors and Corporate functions as well as a realignment of responsibilities in our Fragrances business unit. We expect to realize approximately $9.0 million in savings during 2012 as a result of this restructuring initiative. The savings generated will principally benefit the Functional Fragrance activities within the Company. This category was one of the improvement opportunities identified during our 2010 strategic assessment process. Despite the near term challenges we faced during 2011, we continued to execute against the strategic priorities identified during our 2010 assessment. In particular, ensuring that we have adequate resources and capabilities in place to support planned growth in emerging markets through investments and key technologies was the primary driver within the $127 million (4.6% of sales) of capital spending during 2011. In 2012, we again expect capital spending to approach 5% as we continue to prioritize investments in emerging markets and Flavors. Cash flows from operations were $189.2 million or 6.8% of sales in 2011 as compared to $315.1 million or 12% of sales during 2010. The decrease in cash generation was primarily driven by the year over year impact of incentive compensation payments and accruals, a $40.0 million patent litigation settlement payment in the fourth quarter and higher tax payments in 2011 associated with the strong 2010 results.

R&D expenses relate to the development of new and improved products, technical product support and compliance with governmental regulations. S&A expenses include expenses necessary to support our commercial activities and administrative expenses principally associated with staff groups that support our overall operating activities. 2011 IN COMPARISON TO 2010 Sales Sales for 2011 totaled $2.8 billion, an increase of 6% from the prior year. Excluding currency impacts, LC sales grew by 4%, driven principally by new business and the realization of price increases that were implemented to mitigate the effects of higher raw material costs. LC sales growth was primarily driven by the realization of price increases across both business units, while new win performance was largely offset by volume declines in the second half of 2011, mainly in Fragrances. Overall LC growth was driven by 8% growth in the emerging markets. Flavors Business Unit On a reported basis, Flavor sales increased 12%; excluding the impact of foreign currency, LC sales for the Flavors business increased 9% versus the prior year period. The increase was driven by new business with our customers, followed by the realization of price increases and growth in the underlying demand for our customers products. Sales growth in 2011 includes the impact of exiting approximately $6 million of less profitable non strategic business. LC growth was led by double digit gains in Savory and Beverages and single digit gains in Sweet (Confectionery), all of which benefited from new business, higher volumes and realization of price increases. Regionally, the business benefited from double digit growth in NOAM and EAME whereas GA had high single digit LC growth. The improvement in EAME reflects growth in all categories led by near or double digit gains in Savory, Beverage and Sweet. EAME performance continues to be led by our performance in the emerging market countries within the region. Sales in NOAM were led by double digit gains in Savory and Beverage. LC growth in GA was driven by double digit gains in Beverages and Dairy followed by high single digit gains in Sweet. LA LC growth of 4% was driven by double digit gains in Sweet and Dairy as well as mid single digit growth in Savory. Globally, Flavors growth was led by double digit growth in emerging markets. Fragrances Business Unit The Fragrances business experienced a 1% increase in reported sales and was down 1% in LC terms compared to 16% LC sales growth during 2010. New business wins and the realization of price increases were more than offset by declines in existing business, most notably in Ingredients and Fine Fragrances. Year over year 2011 LC sales performance was led by double digit growth in Home Care along with low single digit gains in Beauty Care and Fabric Care categories. Offsetting these gains was a 9% decline in Ingredients compared to an 18% increase during 2010. LC growth within the regions was led by GA at 2%, mainly due to new business and slightly higher volumes, notably within the Fabric Care which had double digit LC gains. All other regions were flat to slightly down reflecting gains in Hair Care and Home Care that were largely offset by volume erosion in Fine Fragrances in North America as well as declines in Ingredients in all regions. Global growth was led by single digit growth in emerging markets which represented more than 40% of total Fragrance sales. 28 Table of Contents Sales Performance by Region and Category % Change in Sales 2011 vs 2010 Fine &Beauty Care Functional Ingredients TotalFrag.

Fine & Beauty Care sales declined 3% reflecting very strong year ago comparables of +11% (including re stocking benefits in 2010). Functional Fragrance sales were up 3% versus last year as new business wins and volume gains in Home Care offset lower volumes on existing business in Fabric Care and Personal Wash. EAME LC growth was led by 10% growth in Flavors resulting from double digit growth in Savory along with high single digit growth in Beverage and Sweet. This growth was mainly due to new business within our emerging markets in the region, as well as the realization of price increases and volume. Fine & Beauty Care delivered 1% year over year LC growth despite exceptional performance of 31% growth in the prior year period. Ingredients LC sales decreased 13% coming off very strong growth of 17% in the comparable 2010 period. LA LC sales growth of 1% was driven by double digit gains in Sweet and Dairy that was offset by a flat performance in Beverages. Within Fragrances, single digit LC sales growth in Fabric Care and Home Care were offset by volume softness in Ingredients, which experienced 14% growth in 2010. GA delivered solid LC sales growth of 6%, led by near double digit gains in Flavors, due to double digit gains in Beverage and Dairy, along with double digit gains in Fabric Care and single digit sales growth in Hair Care and Home Care. Cost of Goods Sold Cost of goods sold, as a percentage of sales, increased 210 basis points (bps) to 60.4% in 2011 compared to 58.3% in 2010. The increase versus last year was mainly driven by higher raw material costs combined with a slightly less favorable sales mix. Overall, raw material costs have increased approximately 10% on a year over year basis. These effects were partially offset by improved operating leverage, ongoing margin recovery efforts in both businesses, including pricing, and benefits associated with the European rationalization that was completed in late 2010. Research and Development (R&D) R&D expenses increased approximately $1.0 million versus the prior year as investments in technology and innovation were largely offset by lower provisions for incentive compensation. Overall R&D expenses decreased 40 bps as a percentage of sales from 8.3% in 2010 to 7.9% in 2011. Selling and Administrative (S&A) S&A, as a percentage of sales, decreased 120 bps to 15.9% versus 17.1%. The 2011 amount includes $33.5 million related to the Mane patent litigation settlement. Excluding this amount, S&A would have declined 240 29 Table of Contents bps to 14.7% of sales. The decrease in S&A expenses was driven by lower provisions for incentive compensation and ongoing cost discipline that more than offset planned spend in sales activities (mainly in emerging markets) to support our growth initiatives. Restructuring and Other Charges Restructuring and other charges primarily consist of separation costs for employees, including severance, outplacement and other benefit costs.

This alignment partly addresses issues identified in our 2010 strategic review process towards improving the underperforming areas of our portfolio. It will result in the redeployment of creative resources in emerging markets and the reorganization from a regional to a global category structure. We implemented a plan to streamline business operations globally which resulted in the elimination of 72 positions, across Fragrances, Flavors and Corporate functions. As a result, we recorded a provision for severance costs of $9.8 million to Restructuring and other charges, net in our 2011 Consolidated Statement of Income. We expect to realize pre tax savings of approximately $9.0 million in 2012. European Rationalization Plan During the second quarter 2011, we executed a partial settlement of its pension obligations with the former employees of the Drogheda facility. As a result we recorded a charge of $3.9 million related to the European rationalization plan to cover settlements and special termination benefits. This settlement was funded primarily through pension plan investment trust assets. We also reversed $1.2 million of employee related liabilities in 2011 due to certain employees accepting other roles within the Company, offset by $0.6 million of additional costs incurred. Based upon the period end estimates regarding the separation agreements, we increased our provision for severance costs in by $4.4 million in 2010. The remaining $5.7 million of the restructuring charges in 2010 was mainly due to accelerated depreciation and other restructuring related costs pertaining to the rationalization of our Fragrances and Ingredients operations in Europe. In the aggregate as of December 31, 2011, we have recorded expenses of $34.1 million relating to the European rationalization plan and $9.8 million for the Strategic initiative, of which $37.6 million was recorded to Restructuring and other charges, net and $6.3 million recorded to Cost of goods sold, R&D and Selling and administrative expenses. We do not anticipate any further expenses related to the European rationalization plan. Operating Results by Business Unit We evaluate the performance of business units based on Adjusted operating profit before Restructuring and certain non recurring adjustments before Interest expense, Other expense, net and Taxes on income. See Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the reconciliation to Income before taxes. 30 Table of Contents For the Year Ended December 31, 2011 (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) Flavors Fragrances Global Consolidated Operating profit $ 249,276 $ 215,336 $ (36,883 ) $ 427,729 Restructuring and other charges, net 1,475 11,224 473 13,172 Mane patent litigation settlement 33,495 33,495 Adjusted operating profit $ 284,246 $ 226,560 $ (36,410 ) $ 474,396 Operating margin 18.5 % 14.9 % 15.3 % Restructuring and other charges, net 0.1 % 0.8 % 0.5 % Mane patent litigation settlement 2.5 % 1.2 % Adjusted operating margin 21.1 % 15.7 % 17.0 % For the Year Ended December 31, 2010 (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) Flavors Fragrances Global Consolidated Operating profit $ 242,528 $ 234,889 $ (61,056 ) $ 416,361 Restructuring and other charges, net 10,077 10,077 Adjusted operating profit $ 242,528 $ 244,966 $ (61,056 ) $ 426,438 Operating margin 20.2 % 16.5 % 15.9 % Restructuring and other charges, net 0.7 % 0.4 % Adjusted operating margin 20.2 % 17.3 % 16.3 % Flavors Business Unit Flavors operating profit totaled $249.3 million in 2011 (18.5% of sales) compared to $242.5 million (20.2% of sales) in the comparable 2010 period. Flavors adjusted operating profit increased $41.7 million to $284.2 million (21.1% of sales). The improvement in profitability was mainly driven by strong sales growth and increased operating leverage, the realization of price increases and margin improvement initiatives that more than offset the effects of higher raw material costs and less favorable sales mix. Fragrances Business Unit Fragrances operating profit totaled $215.3 million in 2011 or 14.9% as a percentage of sales, compared to $234.9 million or 16.5% as a percentage of sales reported in 2010. Fragrances adjusted operating profit decreased $18.4 million to $226.6 million (15.7% of sales) versus $245.0 million (17.3% of sales) during 2010. The decline in profit was driven by sharply higher input costs and weaker sales mix that could only be partially offset by the realization of price increases, the benefits of the European restructuring, other margin improvement initiatives, and lower incentive compensation. Global Expenses Global expenses represent corporate and headquarters related expenses which include legal, finance, human resources and R&D and other administrative expenses that are not allocated to an individual business unit. In 2011, Global expenses were $36.9 million compared to $61.1 million during 2010. The decline principally reflects lower incentive compensation. Interest Expense In 2011, interest expense decreased $4.1 million to $44.6 million. The decrease in interest expense reflects lower levels of outstanding debt mainly due to $123.7 million of long term debt repayments in 2011. Average cost of debt was 4.7% for the 2011 period compared to 5.0% in 2010. Other Expense, Net Other expense, net increased approximately $1.4 million to $9.5 million in 2011 versus $8.1 million in 2010. The change was driven by higher foreign exchange losses on outstanding working capital balances, principally associated with a general weakening of the U.S. dollar. 31 Table of Contents Income Taxes The effective tax rate was 28.6% in 2011 as compared to a rate of 26.7% in the prior year. The current period included a $5.8 million adjustment of deferred tax assets as a result of U.S. state law changes enacted during the second quarter 2011 and a low effective tax rate on the Mane patent litigation settlement. 2010 IN COMPARISON TO 2009 Sales Sales for 2010 totaled $2.6 billion, an increase of 13% from $2.3 billion in 2009. The significant acceleration of growth (+13% in LC terms) reflects strong commercial performance in both businesses, higher volumes, including the effects of re stocking in developed markets, most notably in the first half of the year and stronger sales mix for both businesses. Sales from new wins accounted for half of the LC sales gains. In addition, higher volumes were driven by a broad based recovery in demand and lower base period comparisons in 2009 (primarily in Fine Fragrances, Ingredients and Home Care). Foreign currency movements had only a minor impact on year over year sales growth, although there was volatility from quarter to quarter. Flavors Business Unit On a reported basis Flavor sales increased 11%; excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, LC sales for the Flavors business increased 10% from the prior year period. Almost 60% of year over year gain was driven by higher volume (including some elements of re stocking) with the remaining due to sales from new business. Solid growth was experienced across all product categories, led by double digit LC growth in our Beverage and Sweet categories and near double digit growth in the others. Our regional growth was driven by EAME and GA which benefited from result of higher volumes and net new business particularly in the Beverage, Sweet, and Savory categories. Growth in both regions benefited from continued investments to strengthen our commercial and development capabilities. Sales in NOAM were up 6% due to higher volume and new business in Beverages and Sweet. LA had solid growth, up 6% in LC as new business wins and volume recovery in Sweet and Savory more than offset the effects of non strategic business lost last year. Overall growth was led by solid double digit growth in emerging markets of 14%, which represent 47% of Flavors overall sales. Fragrances Business Unit Fragrance sales increased significantly, up 14% on a reported basis and 16% in LC terms. Approximately 60% of the improvement was driven by sales from new wins with our customers with the balance attributable to increased volume (including the benefit of weaker prior year base sales in Fine Fragrance and Ingredients). The volume gains reflect a bounce back in demand supported by increased customer promotional activities, mainly in Fine Fragrance, lower base period comparisons and re stocking in the developed markets. Overall, Fine & Beauty Care LC sales increased 26% versus last year, driven by significant gains in new business, a recovery in demand (including effects of re stocking), and low prior year activity levels. LC Functional Fragrance sales increased 7%, driven by double digit gains in Home Care resulting from new business and solid growth in our Fabric Care category. Ingredient LC sales increased 18% driven by a recovery in demand, weaker year ago activity and customer success within certain specialty grades. All regions delivered double digit LC sales gains, led by LA (Fine & Beauty and Ingredients) and EAME (Fine Fragrance and Functional). GA growth was led by strong Functional and Hair Care category sales, whereas NOAM was mainly driven by higher Fine Fragrance sales. Overall growth was well balanced, with both emerging and developed markets delivering double digit LC gains, although emerging market growth was strongest at 18%. 32 Table of Contents Sales Performance by Region and Category % Change in Sales 2010 vs 2009 Fine &Beauty Care Functional Ingredients Total Frag.

The strong performance in Ingredients reflects broad based volume gains, re stocking and weak market conditions last year. Functional Fragrance sales increased as strong new business wins across all categories more than offset volume erosion in Fabric Care, with the strongest gain within the Home Care category. Double digit growth in Beverages (volume) and Sweet (net new wins) categories led the growth in the Flavors business, with Savory also contributing solid growth. EAME delivered strong sales gains across all categories (except Personal Wash), led by new business and demand recovery in Fine Fragrance, Ingredients and Fabric Care plus net new wins and higher volume for Flavors, notably within the Beverage category, which grew 27%. The Flavors business also benefited from double digit growth in Sweet and Dairy. Re stocking also supported growth in the developed countries within the region across most categories. LA sales performance was led by general recovery in demand and new business in Fine Fragrance, which grew 50%. Double digit growth in Beauty Care, Sweet, Dairy and Savory categories more than offset the effect of non strategic Flavors business lost last year. The Functional Fragrance category improvement benefited from both new business and volume recovery in Home Care and Fabric Care. GA delivered double digit LC sales growth in all categories. Fine & Beauty Care gains were driven by demand recovery and new business wins in Hair Care and Toiletries. Fine Fragrances growth of 40% also benefited from demand recovery and a weaker prior year base. Within Functional Fragrances, Fabric, Home Care and Personal Wash all achieved double digit gains reflecting both strong commercial performance and solid demand growth. Flavor sales growth was driven by new product introductions and volume growth mainly in Savory, Beverage and Sweet, with all major categories producing double digit gains. Cost of Goods Sold Cost of goods sold, as a percentage of sales, decreased to 58.3% in 2010 compared to 59.8% during 2009. The improvement in 2010 versus the prior year period reflects favorable input costs, combined with better absorption resulting from higher volumes, continued margin recovery efforts, and a stronger sales mix. This improvement was partially offset by inventory write offs and transition costs associated with the rationalization of our Fragrance and Ingredients operations in Europe. 33 Table of Contents Research and Development (R&D) R&D expenses increased approximately $34.0 million from the prior year. The increase was due to growth driven incentive compensation accruals of $15.0 million and lower R&D tax credits of $5.0 million. The remaining increase was due to higher basic research, targeted investments to support strategic growth initiatives, and lower prior period base comparison resulting from some curtailment in 2009 spend due to the then prevailing economic crisis. Selling and Administrative (S&A) S&A as a percentage of sales, increased slightly to 17.1% of sales compared to 16.8% for 2009. Overall spending increased $56.5 million versus the prior year, mainly driven by higher provisions for incentive compensation of $36.0 million. The remaining variance was due to planned investments and volume related activity to support growth, contingency related costs and fees, and lower prior period base spending in 2009 due to the prevailing economic crisis. The 2009 results include approximately $6.0 million of severance and related costs, primarily associated with a change in our Chief Executive Officer. Restructuring and Other Charges Restructuring Charges (In Thousands) Position Affected 2010 2009 2010 2009 Flavors $ $ 637 7 Fragrances 10,077 18,046 (10 ) 200 Global (382 ) 5 Total $ 10,077 $ 18,301 (10 ) 212 European Rationalization Plan In 2009, as part of the rationalization of our European Fragrance manufacturing footprint, the Company decided to close its Fragrances compounding facility in Drogheda, Ireland as well as the partial closure of its Fragrance Ingredients plant in Haverhill, United Kingdom. The Company recorded $12.2 million of severance costs and $1.0 million of accelerated depreciation on certain related assets and other restructuring related costs. In addition, as part of the continued focus to optimize our European operations, the Flavors segment recorded a provision for severance costs of $1.0 million. The Company has completed its negotiations with the Drogheda, Ireland employee representatives regarding separation benefits related to the closure of the Companys compounding facility at that location during the third quarter 2010. Based upon the period end estimates regarding the separation agreements, the Company increased its provision for severance costs by $4.4 million in 2010. The remaining $5.7 million of the restructuring charges in 2010 was mainly due to accelerated depreciation and other restructuring related costs pertaining to the rationalization of our Fragrances and Ingredients operations in Europe. The Company ceased its operations at the Drogheda plant as of September 30, 2010. Performance Improvement Plan In 2009 we provided another $6.6 million for severance and related costs associated with the elimination of approximately 70 additional positions globally. Subsequently, there was a $2.5 million reduction in previously recorded provisions due to lower estimated benefit costs on severance paid as well as fewer position eliminations requiring severance. 34 Table of Contents Operating Results by Business Unit We evaluate the performance of business units based on operating profit before interest expense, other expense, net and income taxes. See Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the reconciliation to Income before taxes. For the Year Ended December 31, 2010 (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) Flavors Fragrances Global Consolidated Operating profit $ 242,528 $ 234,889 $ (61,056 ) $ 416,361 Restructuring and other charges, net 10,077 10,077 Adjusted operating profit $ 242,528 $ 244,966 $ (61,056 ) $ 426,438 Operating margin 20.2 % 16.5 % 15.9 % Restructuring and other charges, net 0.7 % 0.4 % Adjusted operating margin 20.2 % 17.3 % 16.3 % For the Year Ended December 31, 2009 (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) Flavors Fragrances Global Consolidated Operating profit $ 208,329 $ 170,515 $ (38,556 ) $ 340,288 Restructuring and other charges, net 637 18,046 (382 ) 18,301 Employee separation costs 6,320 6,320 Adjusted operating profit $ 208,966 $ 188,561 $ (32,618 ) $ 364,909 Operating margin 19.3 % 13.7 % 14.6 % Restructuring and other non recurring charges 0.1 % 1.4 % 1.1 % Adjusted operating margin 19.3 % 15.1 % 15.7 % Flavors Business Unit In 2010, Flavors operating profit totaled $242.5 million, or 20.2% as a percentage of sales, compared to $208.3 million or 19.3% in 2009. The improvement in profitability was mainly driven by a 100 basis point (bps) improvement in gross margin resulting from strong sales growth and better absorption, improving input costs, and the benefits of our margin improvement initiatives, partially offset by higher tolling costs associated with some outsourcing of work. Research, selling and administrative costs (RSA) were down 10 bps as a percentage of sales. Higher overall RSA expenses were due to targeted investments in business development, growth driven incentive compensation costs, and product liability and other contingency claims. Fragrances Business Unit Fragrances operating profit for 2010 was $234.9 million, or 16.5% as a percentage of sales, compared to $170.5 million or 13.7% reported in 2009. Fragrances adjusted operating profit increased more than $56.4 million to $245.0 million (17.3% of sales) versus $188.6 million (15.1% of sales) during 2009. The improvement in profit was driven by a 200 bps increase in gross margin resulting from higher volumes and net win performance, favorable input costs, and the benefits of ongoing profit improvement initiatives. RSA as a percentage of sales improved 150 bps due to positive cost leverage on our higher volume. Overall RSA expenses increased due to incentive compensation expense, lower R&D credits and investments in business development. Global Expenses Global expenses represent corporate and headquarters related expenses which include legal, finance, human resources and other administrative expenses that are not allocated to an individual business unit. In 2010, Global expenses were $61.1 million compared to $38.6 million during 2009. The increase in Global expenses is mainly due to higher incentive compensation of $22.0 million with the balance mainly related to litigation related provisions and costs. In 2009, Global expenses included $6.3 million of employee separation costs associated with the change in our Chief Executive Officer. 35 Table of Contents Interest Expense During 2010, interest expense totaled $48.7 million compared to $61.8 million in 2009. The 2009 amount includes $4.0 million of interest paid on the close out of a cross currency interest rate swap classified as a net investment hedge. The additional reduction versus 2009 reflects certain debt repayments of $201.1 million made during the second half of 2009. Average cost of debt was 5.0% for the 2010 period compared to 5.5% in 2009. Other Expense, Net Other expense was $8.1 million in 2010 versus $1.9 million in 2009, approximately 50% of which relates to losses on foreign exchange transactions. The remaining change is principally attributable to higher provisions for non controlling interest in consolidated subsidiaries and miscellaneous non operating expenses. Income Taxes The effective tax rate for the year 2010 was 26.7% compared to 29.3% during 2009. The year over year decrease reflects the mix of earnings across the countries in which the Company operates, an adjustment to provisions for tax reserves, and lower repatriation costs. The 2009 results include $6 million of tax expense due to the recognition of out of period tax adjustments arising from periods 2006 and prior, and was also impacted by the higher level of restructuring costs which carried lower tax benefits. Liquidity and Capital Resources CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS We had cash and cash equivalents of $88.3 million at December 31, 2011 compared to $131.3 million at December 31, 2010, of which $76.3 million of the balance at December 31, 2011 was held outside the United States. Cash balances held in foreign jurisdictions are, in most circumstances, available to be repatriated to the United States; however, they would be subject to United States federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. We have not provided U.S. income tax expense on earnings in excess of current year earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because we intend and plan to reinvest the undistributed earnings indefinitely. Effective utilization of the cash generated by our international operations is a critical component of our tax strategy. Strategic dividend repatriation from foreign subsidiaries creates U.S. taxable income, which enables us to realize deferred tax assets. The Company regularly repatriates, in the form of dividends from its non U.S. subsidiaries, a portion of its current year earnings to fund financial obligations in the U.S. These repatriations of current year earnings totaled $119.5 million, $360.5 million and $150.5 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES Operating cash flows in 2011 were $189.2 million compared to $315.1 million and $291.6 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The cash flow impact associated with core working capital (trade receivables plus inventories, less accounts payable) was flat compared to 2010. The decrease in operating cash flows from 2010 reflects higher incentive compensation payments made in 2011 (as a result of strong 2010 performance), the Mane patent litigation settlement of $40 million and higher tax payments. Working capital (current assets less current liabilities) totaled $752.7 million at year end 2011 compared to $664.2 million at December 31, 2010. The 2011 increase in working capital reflects higher commercial activity, significant increases in input costs and lower provisions for incentive compensation. As of December 31, 2011, net trade receivables increased by $20.5 million as compared to December 31, 2010 principally related to higher sales levels during the fourth quarter 2011 versus the fourth quarter 2010. 36 Table of Contents CASH FLOWS USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES Additions to property, plant and equipment were $127.5 million, $106.3 million and $66.8 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and are expected to approximate 5% of sales in 2012. The increase in additions versus last year reflects planned investments in capacity and new technologies, mainly in the emerging markets. Net investing activities in 2011 utilized $131.2 million compared to $106.8 million and $80.9 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in investing activities in 2011 resulted from higher additions to property, plant and equipment to grow in emerging markets. CASH FLOWS USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES Net financing activities in 2011 used $100.7 million compared to $156.7 million and $312.2 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The decrease from 2010 reflects long term debt repayments in 2011 of $123.7 million compared to none in 2010, slightly offset by net credit facility borrowings in 2011 of $92.7 million compared to net credit facility payments of $103.2 million in 2010. At December 31, 2011, we had $894.9 million of debt outstanding compared to $921.6 million outstanding at December 31, 2010. In February 2009 we terminated a $300.0 million USD LIBOR to EURIBOR interest rate swap which required us to make a payment of $16.0 million. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these transactions. We paid dividends totaling $90.3 million, $81.2 million and $78.8 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The cash dividend declared per share in 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $1.16, $1.04 and $1.00, respectively. CAPITAL RESOURCES Operating cash flow provides the primary source of funds for capital investment needs, dividends paid to shareholders and debt repayments. We anticipate that cash flows from operations and availability under our existing credit facilities are sufficient to meet our investing and financing needs for at least the next eighteen months. We regularly assess our capital structure, including both current and long term debt instruments, as compared to our cash generation and investment needs in order to provide ample flexibility. We supplement short term liquidity with access to capital markets, mainly through bank credit facilities and issuance of commercial paper. We did not issue commercial paper during 2011 and 2010. On November 9, 2011, IFF, including certain subsidiaries, entered into a new credit agreement with Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent and the other lenders, agents, arrangers and bookrunners to replace the previous credit agreement set to expire November 23, 2012. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving loan facility in an aggregate amount up to an equivalent of $942.0 million (the New Facility). There are three tranches under the New Facility. The Tranche A facility is available to all of the Borrowers other than IFF Spain in U.S. dollars, euros, Swiss francs, Japanese yen and British sterling in an aggregate amount up to an equivalent of $458 million and contains sublimits of $25.0 million for letters of credit and $50.0 million for swing line borrowings. The Tranche B facility is available to all of the Borrowers in euros, Swiss francs, Japanese yen and British sterling in an aggregate amount up to an equivalent of $354.0 million and contains sublimits of 25.0 million for letters of credit and 50.0 million for swing line borrowings. The Tranche C facility is available to all of the Borrowers in euros only in an aggregate amount up to 100,505,400. The New Facility will be available for general corporate purposes of each Borrower and its subsidiaries. The obligations under the New Facility are unsecured and the Company has guaranteed the obligations of each other Borrower under the New Facility. The New Facility will mature on November 9, 2016, but may be extended for up to two additional one year periods at the Companys request, subject to the agreement of the lenders having commitments 37 Table of Contents representing more than 50% of the aggregate commitments of all lenders under the New Facility. Borrowings under the New Facility bear interest at an annual rate of LIBOR plus a margin, currently 125 bps, linked to our credit rating. The interest rate under the New Facility at December 31, 2011 was 1.77%. The New Facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants, including the requirement for us to maintain, at the end of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of net debt for borrowed money to adjusted EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) in respect of the previous 12 month period of not more than 3.25 to 1. We have complied with this covenant at all times. The New Facility provides us with access to approximately $80 million of additional borrowings compared to the old Facility. The margin added to the annual rate of LIBOR is currently 100 bps higher than the old Facility. Such increase has not caused a material change to our cost of borrowing. As of December 31, 2011 we had total borrowings under the New Facility of $157.5 million. The amount which we are able to draw down on under the Agreement is limited by financial covenants as described in more detail below. At December 31, 2011 we had a remaining overall borrowing capacity of $1,028.0 million. However, our drawdown capacity on the New Facility was limited to $784.5 million based on existing balances outstanding under the Facility at December 31, 2011. The Company did not have any letters of credit outstanding under the New Facility as of December 31, 2011. The Facility contains the most restrictive covenant of all of our debt requiring us to maintain, at the end of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of net debt for borrowed money to adjusted EBITDA in respect of the previous 12 month period of not more than 3.25 to 1. At December 31, 2011 and 2010 we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants. At December 31, 2011 our Net Debt/adjusted EBITDA(1) was 1.42 to 1 as defined by the debt agreements, well below the financial covenants of existing outstanding debt. Failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under these agreements would constitute default and would allow the lenders to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the related agreement. If such acceleration were to occur, we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness. We would likely have to seek amendments under the agreements for relief from the financial covenants or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity, and or asset sales, if necessary. We may be unable to amend the agreements or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturities are accelerated. (1) Adjusted EBITDA and Net Debt, which are non GAAP measures used for these covenants, are calculated in accordance with the definition in the debt agreements. In this context, these measures are used solely to provide information on the extent to which we are in compliance with debt covenants and may not be comparable to adjusted EBITDA and Net Debt used by other companies. Reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA to net income and net debt to total debt are as follows: 12 Months EndedDecember 31, (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) 2011 2010 Net income $ 266.9 $ 263.6 Interest expense 44.6 48.7 Income taxes 106.7 96.0 Depreciation and amortization 75.3 79.2 Specified items(1) 46.7 10.1 Non cash items(2) 20.9 Adjusted EBITDA $ 561.1 $ 497.6 (1) Specified items for the 12 months ended December 31, 2011 of $46.7 million consists of $33.5 million of the Mane patent litigation settlement and $13.2 million of restructuring charges related to the 2011 Strategic 38 Table of Contents Initiative and pension settlement costs related to our European rationalization. Specified items for the 12 months ended December 31, 2010 of $10.1 million consist of restructuring charges related to our European rationalization. (2) Non cash items, defined as part of Adjusted EBITDA in the terms of the Companys New Facility agreement, represent all other adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operations as presented on the Statement of Cash Flows, including gain on disposal of assets, stock based compensation and pension settlement/curtailment. December 31, (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) 2011 2010 Total debt $ 894.9 $ 921.6 Adjustments: Deferred gain on interest rate swaps (11.0 ) (12.9 ) Cash and cash equivalents (88.3 ) (131.3 ) Net debt $ 795.6 $ 777.4 Compliance with existing governmental requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment has not materially affected our operations, earnings or competitive position. In 2011 and 2010, we spent $2 million and $6 million, respectively, on capital projects and $17 million and $18 million, respectively, in operating expenses and governmental charges for the purpose of complying with such regulations. Expenditures for these purposes will continue for the foreseeable future. In addition, we are party to a number of proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act or similar state statutes. It is expected that the impact of any judgments in or voluntary settlements of such proceedings will not be material to our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS At December 31, 2011, we had contractual payment obligations due within the time periods as specified in the following table: Payments Due Contractual Obligations (Dollars In Millions) Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 andthereafter Borrowings(1) $ 884 $ 117 $ 100 $ 167 $ 500 Interest on borrowings(1) 328 46 83 79 120 Operating leases(2) 255 26 45 35 149 Pension funding obligations(3) 63 21 42 Postretirement obligations(4) 129 6 13 15 95 Purchase commitments(5) 160 111 49 Total $ 1,819 $ 327 $ 332 $ 296 $ 864 (1) See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our various borrowing facilities. (2) Operating leases include facility and other lease commitments executed in the normal course of the business, including sale leaseback obligations included in Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Further details concerning worldwide aggregate operating leases are contained in Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (3) See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our retirement plans. Anticipated funding obligations are based on current actuarial assumptions. The projected contributions beyond fiscal year 2014 are not currently determinable. (4) Amounts represent expected future benefit payments for our postretirement benefit plans. 39 Table of Contents (5) Purchase commitments include agreements for raw material procurement and contractual capital expenditures. Amounts for purchase commitments represent only those items which are based on agreements that are enforceable and legally binding. The table above does not include $68 million of the total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and approximately $13 million of associated accrued interest. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows, the Company is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid. Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As disclosed in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and accompanying disclosures. These estimates are based on managements best judgment of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future. Actual results may ultimately differ from estimates. Those areas requiring the greatest degree of management judgment or deemed most critical to our financial reporting involve: The periodic assessment of potential impairment of intangible assets acquired in business combinations. We currently have net intangible assets, including goodwill, of $708 million. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we early adopted ASU No. 2011 8 Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment. We conduct a goodwill qualitative assessment as of November 30th on an annual basis or more frequently when significant change in circumstances that would be considered a triggering event indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The goodwill impairment qualitative assessment requires us to perform an assessment for each reporting unit to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. We identified two reporting units, the Flavors reporting unit and the Fragrances reporting unit. These reporting units were determined based on the level at which the performance is measured and reviewed. The qualitative assessment considers various factors for each reporting unit, including the macroeconomic environment, industry and market specific conditions, financial performance, cost impacts, and issues or events specific to the reporting unit. If it is determined that it is more likely than not the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit, we perform a step one goodwill impairment test. We completed our annual qualitative assessment of as of November 30, 2011, which indicated no impairment of goodwill, as it was determined it is more likely than not that the fair values exceed the carrying values of each of our reporting units. The analysis and evaluation of income taxes. We account for taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The assessment of the need for a valuation allowance requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future earnings, reversal of existing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies. If actual experience differs from these estimates and assumptions, the recorded deferred tax asset may not be fully realized resulting in an increase to income tax expense in our results of operations. The Company has not established deferred tax liabilities for undistributed foreign earnings as it has plans to and intends to indefinitely reinvest those earnings to finance foreign activities. However, if these earnings become subject to U.S. federal tax, any required provision could have a material impact on our financial results. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. We first 40 Table of Contents determine whether a tax authority would more likely than not sustain our tax position if it were to audit the position with full knowledge of all the relevant facts and other information. For those tax positions that meet this threshold, we measure the amount of tax benefit based on the largest amount of tax benefit that we have a greater than 50% chance of realizing in a final settlement with the relevant authority. Those tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first interim period in which they meet the more likely than not standard, or are resolved through negotiation or litigation with the taxing authority, or upon expiration of the statute of limitations. This evaluation is made at the time that we adopt a tax position and whenever there is new information and is based upon managements evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. We maintain a cumulative risk portfolio relating to all of our uncertainties in income taxes in order to perform this analysis, but the evaluation of our tax positions requires significant judgment and estimation in part because, in certain cases, tax law is subject to varied interpretation, and whether a tax position will ultimately be sustained may be uncertain. The actual outcome of our tax positions, if significantly different from our estimates, could materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The evaluation of potential litigation and environmental liabilities, where changing circumstances, rules and regulations require regular reassessment of related practices and anticipated costs. We are subject to certain legal claims regarding products and other matters, as well as environmental related matters. Significant management judgment is involved in determining when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the extent to which it can be reasonably estimated. We regularly assess potential liabilities with respect to all legal claims based on the most recent available information, in consultation with outside counsel we have engaged on our behalf to handle the defense of such matters. To the extent a liability is considered to be probable and reasonably estimable, we recognize a corresponding liability; if the reasonably estimated liability is a range, we recognize that amount considered most likely, or in the absence of such a determination, the minimum reasonably estimated liability. To the extent such claims are covered by various insurance policies, we separately evaluate the right to recovery and estimate the related insurance claim receivable. Management judgments involve determination as to whether a liability has been incurred, the reasonably estimated amount of that liability, and any potential insurance recovery. We regularly evaluate potential environmental exposure in terms of total estimated cost and the viability of other potentially responsible parties (PRPs) associated with our exposure. Recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress and additional information becomes available. Critical management assumptions relate to expected total costs to remediate and the financial viability of PRPs to share such costs. Determination of the various assumptions employed in the valuation of pension and retiree health care expense and associated obligations. Amounts recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations. Inherent in such valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets, discount rates at which the liabilities could be settled, rates of increase in future compensation levels, mortality rates and health care cost trend rates. These assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In accordance with GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods. We consider a number of factors in determining and selecting assumptions for the overall expected long term rate of return on plan assets. We consider the historical long term return experience of our assets, the current and expected allocation of our plan assets, and expected long term rates of return. We derive these expected long term rates of return with the assistance of our investment advisors. We base our expected allocation of plan assets on a diversified portfolio consisting of domestic and international equity securities, fixed income, real estate, and alternative asset classes. We consider a variety of factors in determining and selecting our assumptions for the discount rate at December 31. For the U.S. plans, the discount rate was based on the internal rate of return for a portfolio of 41 Table of Contents Moodys Aaa, Aa and Merrill Lynch AAA AA high quality bonds with maturities that are consistent with the projected future benefit payment obligations of the plan. The rate of compensation increase for all plans and the medical cost trend rate for the applicable U.S. plans are based on plan experience. With respect to the U.S. plans, the expected rate of return on plan assets was determined based on an asset allocation model using the current target allocation, real rates of return by asset class and an anticipated inflation rate. The target asset allocation consists of approximately: 50% in equity securities and 50% in fixed income securities. The plan has achieved a compounded annual rate of return of 7.5% over the previous 20 years. At December 31, 2011, the actual asset allocation was: 50% in equity securities; 48% in fixed income securities; and 2% in cash equivalents. The expected rate of return for the non U.S. plans employs a similar set of criteria adapted for local investments, inflation rates and in certain cases specific government requirements. The target asset allocation, for the non U.S. plans, consists of approximately: 55% 60% in fixed income securities; 20% 25% in equity securities; 5% 10% in real estate; and 5% 10% in alternative investments. At December 31, 2011, the actual asset allocation was: 59% in fixed income investments; 22% in equity investments; 10% in real estate investments; 8% in alternative investments and 1% in cash and cash equivalents. Changes in pension and other post employment benefits, and associated expenses, may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions. The impact that a .25% decrease in the discount rate or a 1% change in the medical cost trend rate would have on our pension and other post employment benefit expense, as applicable, is as follows: Sensitivity of Disclosures to Changes in Selected Assumptions 25 BP Decrease inDiscount Rate 25 BP Decrease inDiscount Rate 25 BP Decrease inLong Term Rateof Return (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) Change inPBO Change inABO Change inpension expense Change inpension expense U.S. Pension Plans $ 12,563 $ 12,301 $ 679 $ 828 Non U.S. Pension Plans $ 28,023 $ 25,930 $ 2,140 $ 1,743 Postretirement Benefit Plan N/A $ 3,774 $ 183 N/A The effect of a 1% increase in the medical cost trend rate would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and the annual postretirement expense by approximately $8.1 million and $0.4 million, respectively; a 1% decrease in the rate would decrease the obligation and expense by approximately $7.4 million and $0.4 million, respectively. The ongoing assessment of the valuation of inventory, given the large number of natural ingredients employed, the quality of which may be diminished over time. We maintain approximately 45% 50% of our inventory as raw materials, providing the greatest degree of flexibility in manufacture and use. Materials are evaluated based on shelf life, known uses and anticipated demand based on forecasted customer order activity and changes in product/sales mix. Management policy provides for an ongoing assessment of inventory with adjustments recorded when an item is deemed to be slow moving or obsolete. We believe that we have considered relevant circumstances that we may be currently subject to, and the financial statements accurately reflect our best estimate of the impact of these items in our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows for the years presented. We have discussed the decision process and selection of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. New Accounting Standards In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued revised guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income. This revised guidance eliminates the option to present the components of Other comprehensive income (OCI) as part of the Consolidated Statement of Shareholders Equity and provides two alternatives for presenting the components of net income and OCI, either: (i) in a single continuous 42 Table of Contents statement of comprehensive income or (ii) in two separate but consecutive financial statements, consisting of an income statement followed by a separate statement of comprehensive income. Additionally, items that are reclassified from OCI to net income must be presented on the face of the financial statements. Retrospective application will be required and is effective for the Company as of the beginning of 2012. In December 2011, the FASB deferred the reclassification requirement of this guidance indefinitely. The application of this revised guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements, but will result in a change in the presentation of the Companys consolidated statements of income and equity. In September 2011, the FASB issued authoritative guidance allowing entities the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether or not it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, an entity does not have to perform step one of the goodwill impairment testing. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2011 with early adoption permitted. The Company has adopted this guidance when it performed its annual goodwill impairment testing during the fourth quarter 2011. Adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. Non GAAP Financial Measures The Company uses non GAAP financial operating measures which exclude restructuring charges (including costs associated with the Companys restructuring efforts in Europe in 2009, 2010 and 2011 and costs associated with the 2011 strategic initiative), employee separation costs in 2009 and the Mane patent litigation settlement in 2011. The company also measures sales performance on a non GAAP basis which eliminates the effects that result from translating its international sales in U.S. dollars (local currency). Such information is supplemental to information presented in accordance with GAAP and is not intended to represent a presentation in accordance with GAAP. In discussing our historical and expected future results and financial condition, we believe it is meaningful for investors to be made aware of and to be assisted in a better understanding of, on a period to period comparative basis, of financial amounts both including and excluding these identified items, as well as the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on operating results and financial condition. We believe such additional non GAAP information provides investors with an overall perspective of the period to period performance of our core business. In addition, management internally reviews each of these non GAAP measures to evaluate performance on a comparative period to period basis in terms of absolute performance, trends and expected future performance with respect to our core continuing business. A material limitation of these non GAAP measures is that such measures do not reflect actual GAAP amounts, restructuring charges, employee separation costs and the patent litigation settlement include actual cash outlays; and we compensate for such limitations by presenting the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. These non GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Cautionary Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 Statements in this Annual Report, which are not historical facts or information, are forward looking statements within the meaning of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Any public statements or disclosures by IFF following this report that modify or impact any of the forward looking statements contained in or accompanying this report will be deemed to modify or supersede such outlook or other forward looking statements in or accompanying this report. 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. We operate on a global basis and are exposed to currency fluctuation related to the manufacture and sale of our products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The major foreign currencies involve the markets in the European Union, Great Britain, Mexico, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Australia and Japan, although all regions are subject to foreign currency fluctuations versus the U.S. dollar. We actively monitor our foreign currency exposures in all major markets in which we operate, and employ a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, including foreign currency hedging activities. We have established a centralized reporting system to evaluate the effects of changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and other relevant market risks. Our risk management procedures include the monitoring of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures and hedge positions utilizing statistical analyses of cash flows, market value and sensitivity analysis. However, the use of these techniques to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of their accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions. For the year ended December 31, 2011, the Companys exposure to market risk was estimated using sensitivity analyses, which illustrate the change in the fair value of a derivative financial instrument assuming hypothetical changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts with the objective of reducing exposure to cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency receivables and payables, and with anticipated purchases of certain raw materials used in operations. These contracts, the counterparties to which are major international financial institutions, generally involve the exchange of one currency for a second currency at a future date, and have maturities not exceeding twelve months. The gain or loss on the hedging instrument and services is recorded in earnings at the same time as the transaction being hedged is recorded in earnings. At December 31, 2011, the Companys foreign currency exposures pertaining to derivative contracts exist with the Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Indonesia Rupiah, Singapore dollar, Australian dollar, South African Rand, Swedish Krona and Swiss Franc. Based on a hypothetical decrease or increase of 10% in the applicable balance sheet exchange rates (primarily against the U.S. dollar), the estimated fair value of the Companys foreign currency forward contracts would increase or decrease by approximately $20 million. However, any change in the value of the contracts, real or hypothetical, would be significantly offset by a corresponding change in the value of the underlying hedged items. We have a Japanese Yen/U.S. dollar currency swap related to monthly sale and purchase of products between the U.S. and Japan. A hypothetical decrease or increase of 10% in the value of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese Yen, the estimated fair value of the Companys foreign currency forward contracts would not have a material effect. We have also used non U.S. dollar borrowings and foreign currency forward contracts, to hedge the foreign currency exposures of our net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries, primarily in the European Union. Based on a hypothetical decrease or increase of 10% in the value of the U.S. dollar against the Euro, the estimated fair value of the Companys foreign currency forward contracts would change by approximately $5 million. However, any change in the value of the contracts, real or hypothetical, would be significantly offset by a corresponding change in the value of the underlying hedged items. We use derivative instruments as part of our interest rate risk management strategy. The derivative instruments used are comprised principally of fixed to variable rate interest rate swaps based on the LIBOR plus an interest mark up. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the swaps match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates. Based on a hypothetical decrease or increase of one percentage point in LIBOR, the estimated fair value of the Companys interest rate swaps would change by less than $2 million. At December 31, 2011, the fair value of our fixed rate debt was $867 million. Based on a hypothetical decrease of 10% in interest rates, the estimated fair value of the Companys fixed debt would increase by $5 million. 46 Table of Contents We purchase certain commodities, such as natural gas, electricity, petroleum based products and certain crop related items. We generally purchase these commodities based upon market prices that are established with the vendor as part of the purchase process. In general, we do not use commodity financial instruments to hedge commodity prices.
