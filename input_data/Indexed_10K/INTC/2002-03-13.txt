ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The information appearing under the heading "Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" on pages 13 through 19 of our 2001 Annual Report to Stockholders is incorporated by reference. Status of Outlook and related risk factor statements We expect that our corporate representatives will meet privately from time to time with investors, the media, investment analysts and others. At these meetings, we may reiterate the current published Outlook, including portions that are repeated or incorporated by reference in this Form 10 K. At the same time, we will keep our Outlook publicly available on our Web site (www.intc.com). Prior to the start of the Quiet Period (described below), the public can continue to rely on the Outlook on the Web site as still being our current expectations on matters covered, unless we publish a notice stating otherwise. From the close of business on March 15, 2002, we will observe a "Quiet Period" when we no longer publish or update Outlook, as our current expectations and Intel representatives will not comment concerning Outlook or Intels financial results and expectations. The Quiet Period will extend until the day when our next quarterly Earnings Release is published, presently scheduled for April 16, 2002. We also observed a "Quiet Period" from close of business on March 1 until we published our mid quarter update on March 7. 21  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The information appearing under the subheading "Financial market risks" under the heading "Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" on pages 16 and 17 of our 2001 Annual Report to Stockholders is incorporated by reference.
