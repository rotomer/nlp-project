The various sections of this MDA contain a number of forward looking statements. Words such as expects, goals, plans, believes, continues, may, will, and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements. In addition, any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses, and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward looking statements. Such statements are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing and particularly in the Business Outlook section (see also Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10 K). Our actual results may differ materially, and these forward looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, or other business combinations that had not been completed as of February 22, 2010. Overview Our goal is to be the preeminent provider of semiconductor chips and platforms for the worldwide digital economy. Our primary component level products include microprocessors, chipsets, and flash memory. To better align our major product groups around the core competencies of Intel architecture and our manufacturing operations, we completed the reorganization of our business in the fourth quarter of 2009. Net revenue, gross margin, operating income, and net income for the fourth and third quarters of 2009, and fiscal year 2009 and 2008 were as follows: Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended Dec. 26, Sept. 26, Dec. 26, Dec. 27, (In Millions) 2009 2009 2009 2008 Net revenue $ 10,569 $ 9,389 $ 35,127 $ 37,586 Gross margin $ 6,840 $ 5,404 $ 19,561 $ 20,844 Operating income $ 2,497 $ 2,579 $ 5,711 $ 8,954 Net income $ 2,282 $ 1,856 $ 4,369 $ 5,292 We started the year in one of the deepest recessions in our history and emerged from it with better products and technology in a strengthening market. Compared to the first quarter of 2008, revenue was down 26% in the first quarter of 2009, with the second and third quarters down 15% and 8%, respectively, compared to the second and third quarters of 2008. However, our fourth quarter results reflected a strengthening demand across all regions and all product categories, driven primarily by the notebook market segment. Fourth quarter revenue of $10.6 billion was up 13% compared to the third quarter, nearly twice the seasonal average, and up 28% compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. 25 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The launch of our microprocessor products using 32nm process technology was strong in the fourth quarter and was one of the contributors to the increase in our overall microprocessor average selling prices compared to the third quarter. Our server products also had a strong quarter, and we saw a demand shift toward higher end products, which also contributed to the increase in our average selling prices. Despite these fourth quarter increases, our microprocessor average selling prices in 2009 were lower than in 2008, driven primarily by decreases in average selling prices in the notebook and desktop market segments. With the launch of our 32nm products and fourth quarter record shipments of microprocessor units, we are entering 2010 in a strong competitive position as we continue delivering improvements in our product offerings through the tick tock manufacturing process technology and product development cadence. Additionally, our Intel Atom processors and related chipsets continue their strong ramp, with revenue having increased nearly $900 million in 2009 compared to 2008. We believe our total inventory levels of $2.9 billion, though up compared to the third quarter of 2009, are appropriate based on our forecasts. We believe that OEM component inventories are roughly flat compared to the third quarter and below levels at the end of 2008. Additionally, our distributors inventories are down compared to the third quarter. Our fourth quarter gross margin percentage of 64.7% set a new quarterly record. The fourth quarter gross margin percentage compared to the third quarter was positively impacted by lower inventory write offs, higher microprocessor average selling prices and unit sales, the lack of excess capacity charges, and improving unit costs. In the first quarter of 2010, we expect our gross margin percentage to decrease due to higher unit costs as we continue to ramp our 32nm products, as well as seasonally lower microprocessor unit sales and lower microprocessor average selling prices. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we made a $1.25 billion payment to AMD as part of a settlement to end all outstanding litigation between the companies, including antitrust litigation and cross license patent disputes. Also in the fourth quarter of 2009, the New York Attorney General and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed antitrust suits against Intel. For further information on our litigation matters, see Note 28: Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. From a financial condition perspective, we ended 2009 with an investment portfolio of $13.9 billion, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, debt instruments included in trading assets, and short term investments. During 2009, we generated $11.2 billion in cash from operations despite paying the 1.06 billion ($1.447 billion) European Commission fine recorded in the second quarter of 2009, and the AMD settlement recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009. During 2009, we issued $2.0 billion of convertible debt and utilized the proceeds from the convertible debt to repurchase $1.7 billion of common stock through our common stock repurchase program. In addition, during 2009 we returned $3.1 billion to stockholders through dividends. In January 2010, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.1575 per common share for the first quarter of 2010, an increase of 12.5% compared to our fourth quarter dividend. In February 2010, we signed a definitive agreement with Micron and Numonyx under which Micron agreed to acquire Numonyx in an all stock transaction. For further information, see Note 11: Non Marketable Equity Investments in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. 26 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Strategy Our goal is to be the preeminent provider of semiconductor chips and platforms for the worldwide digital economy. As part of our overall strategy to compete in each relevant market segment, we use our core competencies in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits, as well as our financial resources, global presence, brand recognition, and software development. We believe that we have the scale, capacity, and global reach to establish new technologies and respond to customers needs quickly. Some of our key focus areas are listed below: Customer Orientation. Our strategy focuses on developing our next generation of products based on the needs and expectations of our customers. In turn, our products help enable the design and development of new form factors and usage models for businesses and consumers. We offer platforms that incorporate various components designed and configured to work together to provide an optimized computing solution compared to components that are used separately. Architecture and Platforms. We are focusing on improved energy efficient performance for computing and communications systems and devices. Improved energy efficient performance involves balancing improved performance with lower power consumption. We continue to develop multi core microprocessors with an increasing number of cores, which enable improved multitasking and energy efficiency. In addition, to meet the demands of new and evolving netbook, consumer electronics, and various embedded market segments, we offer and are continuing to develop SoC products that are designed to provide improved performance due to higher integration, lower power consumption, and smaller form factors. Silicon and Manufacturing Technology Leadership. Our strategy for developing microprocessors with improved performance is to synchronize the introduction of a new microarchitecture with improvements in silicon process technology. We plan to introduce a new microarchitecture approximately every two years and ramp the next generation of silicon process technology in the intervening years. This coordinated schedule allows us to develop and introduce new products based on a common microarchitecture quickly, without waiting for the next generation of silicon process technology. We refer to this as our tick tock technology development cadence. In keeping with this cadence, we expect to introduce a new microarchitecture using our 32nm process technology in 2010. Strategic Investments. We make investments in companies around the world that we believe will generate financial returns, further our strategic objectives, and support our key business initiatives. Our investments, including those made through our Intel Capital program, generally focus on investing in companies and initiatives to stimulate growth in the digital economy, create new business opportunities for Intel, and expand global markets for our products. Our current investments primarily focus on the following areas: advancing flash memory products, enabling mobile wireless devices, advancing the digital home, enhancing the digital enterprise, advancing high performance communications infrastructures, and developing the next generation of silicon process technologies. Business Environment and Software. We believe that we are well positioned in the technology industry to help drive innovation, foster collaboration, and promote industry standards that will yield innovation and improved technologies for users. We plan to continue to cultivate new businesses and work to encourage the industry to offer products that take advantage of the latest market trends and usage models. We frequently participate in industry initiatives designed to discuss and agree upon technical specifications and other aspects of technologies that could be adopted as standards by standards setting organizations. Through our Software and Services Group, we help enable and advance the computing ecosystem by providing development tools and support to help software developers create software applications and operating systems that take advantage of our platforms. Lastly, we believe that the software expertise of our Wind River Software Group in the embedded and handheld market segments will expedite our growth strategy in these market segments. We believe that the proliferation of the Internet, including user demand for premium content and rich media, drives the need for greater performance in PCs and servers. Older PCs are increasingly incapable of handling the tasks that businesses and individual consumers demand, such as streaming video, web conferencing, online gaming, and other memory intensive applications. As these tasks become even more demanding and require more computing power, we believe that businesses and individual consumers will need and want to buy new PCs. We also believe that increased Internet traffic and the increasing use of cloud computing, in which a group of linked servers provide a variety of applications and data to users over the Internet, create a need for greater server infrastructure, including server products optimized for energy efficient performance and virtualization. 27 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) We believe that the trend of mobile microprocessor unit growth outpacing the growth in desktop microprocessor units will continue and that the demand for mobile microprocessors will result in the increased development of products with form factors and uses that require low power microprocessors. We also believe that these products will result in demand that is incremental to that of microprocessors designed for notebook and desktop computers, as a growing number of households have multiple devices for different computing functions. Our silicon and manufacturing technology leadership allows us to develop low power microprocessors for these and other new uses and form factors. We believe that Intel Atom processors give us the ability to extend Intel architecture and drive growth in new market segments, including a growing number of products that require processors specifically designed for embedded applications, handhelds, consumer electronics devices, and netbooks. We expect that our Intel Atom Developer Program will spur new applications that run on products using Intel Atom processors, which will expedite our growth strategy in these new market segments. The common elements for products in these new market segments are low power consumption and the ability to access the Internet. We are also focusing on the development of a new highly scalable, many core architecture aimed at parallel processing, the simultaneous use of multiple cores to execute a computing task. This architecture will initially be used as a software development platform for graphics and throughput computing (the need for large amounts of computing performance consistently over a long period of time). Over time, this architecture may be utilized in the development of products for scientific and professional workstations as well as high performance computing applications. In addition, we offer, and are continuing to develop, advanced NAND flash memory products, focusing on system level solutions for Intel architecture platforms such as solid state drives. In support of our strategy to provide advanced flash memory products, we continue to focus on the development of innovative products designed to address the needs of customers for reliable, non volatile, low cost, high density memory. Strategy by Major Market Segment The strategy for our PC Client Group operating segment is to offer products that are incorporated into notebook, netbook, and desktop computers for consumers and businesses. Our strategy for the notebook computing market segment is to offer notebook PC products designed to improve performance, battery life, and wireless connectivity, as well as to allow for the design of smaller, lighter, and thinner form factors. We are also increasing our focus on notebook products designed to offer technologies that provide increased manageability and security, and we continue to invest in the build out of WiMAX. Our strategy for the netbook computing market segment is to offer products that enable affordable, Internet focused devices with small form factors. Our strategy for the desktop computing market segment is to offer products that provide increased manageability, security, and energy efficient performance while lowering total cost of ownership for businesses. For consumers in the desktop computing market segment, we also focus on the design of components for high end enthusiast PCs and mainstream PCs with rich audio and video capabilities. The strategy for our Data Center Group operating segment is to offer products that provide leading performance, energy efficiency, and virtualization technology for server, workstation, and storage platforms. We are also increasing our focus on products designed for high performance and mission critical computing, cloud computing services, and emerging markets. In addition, we offer wired connectivity devices that are incorporated into products that make up the infrastructure for the Internet. The strategies for our other Intel architecture operating segments include: driving Intel architecture as a solution for embedded applications by delivering long life cycle support, software and architectural scalability, and platform integration; continuing to develop and offer products that enable handhelds to deliver digital content and the Internet to users in new ways; and offering products and solutions for use in consumer electronics devices designed to access and share Internet, broadcast, optical media, and personal content through a variety of linked digital devices within the home. 28 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Critical Accounting Estimates The methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements. Some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. Our most critical accounting estimates include: the valuation of non marketable equity investments and the determination of other than temporary impairments, which impact gains (losses) on equity method investments, net, or gains (losses) on other equity investments, net when we record impairments; the assessment of recoverability of long lived assets, which primarily impacts gross margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation; the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes (including the measurement of uncertain tax positions), which impact our provision for taxes; and the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross margin. Below, we discuss these policies further, as well as the estimates and judgments involved. Non Marketable Equity Investments We regularly invest in non marketable equity instruments of private companies, which range from early stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. The carrying value of our non marketable equity investment portfolio, excluding equity derivatives, totaled $3.4 billion as of December 26, 2009 ($4.1 billion as of December 27, 2008). The majority of this balance as of December 26, 2009 was concentrated in companies in the flash memory market segment. Our flash memory market segment investments include our investment in IMFT and IM Flash Singapore, LLP (IMFS) of $1.6 billion ($2.1 billion as of December 27, 2008). For further information, see Note 11: Non Marketable Equity Investments in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Our non marketable equity investments are recorded using adjusted cost basis or the equity method of accounting, depending on the facts and circumstances of each investment (see Note 2: Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K). Our non marketable equity investments are classified in other long term assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Non marketable equity investments are inherently risky, and a number of the companies in which we invest could fail. Their success is dependent on product development, market acceptance, operational efficiency, and other key business factors. Depending on their future prospects, the companies may not be able to raise additional funds when the funds are needed or they may receive lower valuations, with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings, and our investments would likely become impaired. Additionally, financial markets and credit markets are volatile, which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in, their ability to raise additional capital, and the likelihood of our being able to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. For further information about our investment portfolio risks, see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10 K. We determine the fair value of our non marketable equity investments quarterly for disclosure purposes; however, the investments are recorded at fair value only when an impairment charge is recognized. We determine the fair value of our non marketable equity investments using the market and income approaches. The market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies, such as projected revenues, earnings, and comparable performance multiples. The selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors, including comparable companies sizes, growth rates, industries, development stages, and other relevant factors. The income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model, which may include one or multiple discounted cash flow scenarios and requires the following significant estimates for the investee: revenue, based on assumed market segment size and assumed market segment share; expenses, capital spending, and other costs; and discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies. Estimates of market segment size, market segment share, expenses, capital spending, and other costs are developed by the investee and or Intel using historical data and available market data. The valuation of our non marketable investments also takes into account variables such as conditions reflected in the capital markets, recent financing activities by the investees, the investees capital structure, and differences in seniority and rights associated with the investees capital. 29 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) For non marketable equity investments, the measurement of fair value requires significant judgment and includes quantitative and qualitative analysis of identified events or circumstances that impact the fair value of the investment, such as: the investees revenue and earnings trends relative to pre defined milestones and overall business prospects; the technological feasibility of the investees products and technologies; the general market conditions in the investees industry or geographic area, including adverse regulatory or economic changes; factors related to the investees ability to remain in business, such as the investees liquidity, debt ratios, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash; and the investees receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation. If the fair value of an investment is below our carrying value, we determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired based on our quantitative and qualitative analysis, which includes assessing the severity and duration of the impairment and the likelihood of recovery before disposal. If the investment is considered to be other than temporarily impaired, we write down the investment to its fair value. Impairments of non marketable equity investments were $221 million in 2009. Over the past 12 quarters, including the fourth quarter of 2009, impairments of non marketable equity investments ranged from $11 million to $896 million per quarter. This range included impairments of $896 million during the fourth quarter of 2008, primarily related to a $762 million impairment charge on our investment in Clearwire Communications, LLC (Clearwire LLC). IMFT/IMFS IMFT and IMFS are variable interest entities that are designed to manufacture and sell NAND products to Intel and Micron at manufacturing cost. We determine the fair value of our investment in IMFT/IMFS using the income approach based on a weighted average of multiple discounted cash flow scenarios of our NAND Solutions Group business, which requires the use of unobservable inputs. Unobservable inputs that require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments are the estimates for projected revenue and discount rate. Changes in management estimates for these unobservable inputs have the most significant effect on the fair value determination. We did not have an other than temporary impairment on our investment in IMFT/IMFS in 2009, 2008, or 2007. It is reasonably possible that the estimates used in the fair value determination could change in the near term, which could result in an impairment of our investment. Long Lived Assets We assess the impairment of long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable. Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. We measure the recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations by comparing the carrying value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows. If an asset groupings carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. The impairment is measured by comparing the difference between the asset groupings carrying value and its fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Long lived assets such as goodwill; intangible assets; and property, plant and equipment are considered non financial assets, and are recorded at fair value only when an impairment charge is recognized. Impairments of long lived assets are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows. Due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity, we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings. In addition, as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions, we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets, primarily process specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements. When we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the assets new, shorter useful lives. Over the past 12 quarters, including the fourth quarter of 2009, impairments and accelerated depreciation of long lived assets ranged from $40 million to $300 million per quarter. For further discussion on these asset impairment charges, see Note 19: Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. 30 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Income Taxes We must make estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Significant changes in these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We believe that we will ultimately recover a majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely. Recovery of a portion of our deferred tax assets is impacted by managements plans with respect to holding or disposing of certain investments; therefore, changes in managements plans with respect to holding or disposing of investments could affect our future provision for taxes. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. If we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit, the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We re evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors such as changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, new audit activity, and effectively settled issues. Determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. Inventory The valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality. The determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products. The estimate of future demand is compared to work in process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount, if any, of obsolete or excess inventory. As of December 26, 2009, we had total work in process inventory of $1,469 million and total finished goods inventory of $1,029 million. The demand forecast is included in the development of our short term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuation and build decisions. Product specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of the customer base, the stage of the product life cycle of our products, consumer confidence, and customer acceptance of our products, as well as an assessment of the selling price in relation to the product cost. If our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we could be required to write off inventory, which would negatively impact our gross margin. In order to determine what costs can be included in the valuation of inventory, we must determine normal capacity at our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities, based on historical loadings of wafers compared to total available capacity. If the factory loadings are below the established normal capacity level, a portion of our manufacturing overhead costs would not be included in the cost of inventory, and therefore would be recognized as cost of sales in that period, which would negatively impact our gross margin. We refer to these costs as excess capacity charges. Over the past 12 quarters, excess capacity charges ranged from zero to $680 million per quarter. Accounting Changes and Recent Accounting Standards For a description of accounting changes and recent accounting standards, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 3: Accounting Changes and Note 4: Recent Accounting Standards in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. 31 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Results of Operations The following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated: 2009 2008 2007 % of % of % of (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Dollars Revenue Dollars Revenue Dollars Revenue Net revenue $ 35,127 100.0 % $ 37,586 100.0 % $ 38,334 100.0 % Cost of sales 15,566 44.3 % 16,742 44.5 % 18,430 48.1 % Gross margin 19,561 55.7 % 20,844 55.5 % 19,904 51.9 % Research and development 5,653 16.1 % 5,722 15.2 % 5,755 15.0 % Marketing, general and administrative 7,931 22.6 % 5,452 14.6 % 5,401 14.1 % Restructuring and asset impairment charges 231 0.6 % 710 1.9 % 516 1.3 % Amortization of acquisition related intangibles 35 0.1 % 6 % 16 0.1 % Operating income 5,711 16.3 % 8,954 23.8 % 8,216 21.4 % Gains (losses) on equity method investments, net (147 ) (0.4 )% (1,380 ) (3.7 )% 3 % Gains (losses) on other equity investments, net (23 ) (0.1 )% (376 ) (1.0 )% 154 0.4 % Interest and other, net 163 0.4 % 488 1.3 % 793 2.1 % Income before taxes 5,704 16.2 % 7,686 20.4 % 9,166 23.9 % Provision for taxes 1,335 3.8 % 2,394 6.3 % 2,190 5.7 % Net income $ 4,369 12.4 % $ 5,292 14.1 % $ 6,976 18.2 % Diluted earnings per common share $ 0.77 $ 0.92 $ 1.18 The following graphs set forth revenue information of geographic regions for the periods indicated: Geographic Breakdown of Revenue Our net revenue for 2009 decreased 7% compared to 2008. Average selling prices for microprocessors and chipsets decreased and microprocessor and chipset unit sales increased, compared to 2008, primarily due to the ramp of Intel Atom processors and chipsets, which generally have lower average selling prices than our other microprocessor and chipset products. Revenue from the sale of NOR flash memory products and communications products declined $740 million, primarily as a result of business divestitures. Additionally, an increase in revenue from the sale of NAND flash memory products was mostly offset by a decrease in revenue from the sale of wireless connectivity products. 32 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Revenue in the Asia Pacific region increased 2% compared to 2008, while revenue in the Europe, Japan, and Americas regions decreased by 26%, 15%, and 4%, respectively, compared to 2008. Our overall gross margin dollars for 2009 decreased $1.3 billion, or 6%, compared to 2008. Our overall gross margin percentage increased slightly to 55.7% in 2009 from 55.5% in 2008. The slight increase in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the gross margin percentage increases in the NAND Solutions Group and Data Center Group operating segments offset by the gross margin percentage decrease in the PC Client Group operating segment. We derived a substantial majority of our overall gross margin dollars in 2009, and most of our overall gross margin dollars in 2008, from the sales of microprocessors in the PC Client Group and Data Center Group operating segments. See Business Outlook for a discussion of gross margin expectations. Our net revenue for 2008 decreased 2% compared to 2007. Higher revenue from the sale of microprocessors and chipsets was more than offset by the impacts of divestitures and lower revenue from the sale of motherboards. Revenue from the sale of NOR flash memory and cellular baseband products declined $1.7 billion, primarily as a result of divestiture of these businesses. Revenue in the Americas region decreased 4% in 2008 compared to 2007. Revenue in the Asia Pacific, Europe, and Japan regions remained approximately flat in 2008 compared to 2007. Our overall gross margin dollars for 2008 were $20.8 billion, an increase of $940 million, or 5%, compared to 2007. Our overall gross margin percentage increased to 55.5% in 2008 from 51.9% in 2007. The increase in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the gross margin percentage increase in the PC Client Group operating segment and, to a lesser extent, the gross margin percentage increase in the Data Center Group operating segment. In addition, our gross margin percentage increased due to the divestiture of our NOR flash memory business. We derived most of our overall gross margin dollars in 2008 and 2007 from the sale of microprocessors in the PC Client Group and Data Center Group operating segments. PC Client Group The revenue and operating income for the PC Client Group (PCCG) for the three years ended December 26, 2009 were as follows: (In Millions) 2009 2008 2007 Microprocessor revenue $ 19,914 $ 21,516 $ 21,053 Chipset, motherboard, and other revenue 6,261 6,450 6,077 Net revenue $ 26,175 $ 27,966 $ 27,130 Operating income $ 7,585 $ 9,419 $ 8,535 Net revenue for the PCCG operating segment decreased by $1.8 billion, or 6%, in 2009 compared to 2008. Microprocessors and chipsets within PCCG include those designed for the notebook, netbook, and desktop computing market segments. The decrease in microprocessor revenue was primarily due to lower notebook microprocessor average selling prices, and lower desktop microprocessor unit sales and average selling prices. These decreases were partially offset by a significant increase in netbook microprocessor unit sales due to the ramp of Intel Atom processors. The decrease in chipset, motherboard, and other revenue was primarily due to lower chipset average selling prices and lower unit sales of wireless connectivity products, partially offset by higher chipset unit sales. Operating income decreased by $1.8 billion, or 19%, in 2009 compared to 2008. The decrease was primarily due to lower revenue and approximately $810 million of higher factory underutilization charges, partially offset by lower chipset and microprocessor unit costs. For 2008, net revenue for the PCCG operating segment increased slightly by $836 million, or 3%, compared to 2007. The increase in microprocessor revenue was primarily due to significantly higher notebook microprocessor unit sales, partially offset by significantly lower notebook microprocessor average selling prices. In addition, lower desktop microprocessor unit sales were partially offset by the ramp of Intel Atom processors. The increase in chipset, motherboard, and other revenue was primarily due to higher chipset unit sales, partially offset by lower desktop motherboard unit sales. Operating income increased by $884 million, or 10%, in 2008 compared to 2007. The increase in operating income was primarily due to lower microprocessor and chipset unit costs, partially offset by lower desktop microprocessor and chipset revenue and higher operating expenses. In addition, approximately $230 million of lower start up costs were offset by sales in 2007 of desktop microprocessors that had previously been written off, and higher write offs of desktop microprocessor inventory in 2008. 33 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Data Center Group The revenue and operating income for the Data Center Group (DCG) for the three years ended December 26, 2009 were as follows: (In Millions) 2009 2008 2007 Microprocessor revenue $ 5,301 $ 5,126 $ 4,796 Chipset, motherboard, and other revenue 1,149 1,464 1,659 Net revenue $ 6,450 $ 6,590 $ 6,455 Operating income $ 2,299 $ 2,135 $ 2,105 Net revenue for the DCG operating segment decreased slightly by $140 million, or 2%, in 2009 compared to 2008. The increase in microprocessor revenue was due to higher microprocessor average selling prices, partially offset by lower microprocessor unit sales. The decrease in chipset, motherboard, and other revenue was primarily due to lower chipset average selling prices. Operating income increased by $164 million, or 8%, in 2009 compared to 2008. The increase in operating income was primarily due to higher microprocessor revenue and lower operating expenses, partially offset by approximately $150 million of higher start up costs as well as lower chipset revenue. For 2008, net revenue for the DCG operating segment increased slightly by $135 million, or 2%, compared to 2007. The increase in microprocessor revenue was due to higher microprocessor average selling prices. The decrease in chipset, motherboard, and other revenue was primarily due to lower motherboard unit sales. Operating income was flat in 2008 compared to 2007. Higher revenue was mostly offset by higher operating expenses. Other Intel Architecture Operating Segments The revenue and operating income for the other Intel architecture operating segments (Other IA) for the three years ended December 26, 2009 were as follows: (In Millions) 2009 2008 2007 Net revenue $ 1,402 $ 1,763 $ 1,908 Operating income (loss) $ (179 ) $ (63 ) $ 47 Net revenue for the Other IA operating segments decreased by $361 million, or 20%, in 2009 compared to 2008, and operating loss for the Other IA operating segments increased by $116 million in 2009 compared to 2008. The changes were primarily due to lower revenue from the sale of communications products within the Embedded and Communications Group (ECG), primarily as a result of business divestitures. For 2008, net revenue for the Other IA operating segments decreased by $145 million, or 8%, compared to 2007. The decrease was primarily due to lower revenue from the sale of communications products within ECG, primarily as a result of business divestitures, partially offset by higher ECG microprocessor unit sales. Operating income (loss) decreased by $110 million in 2008 compared to 2007. The decrease was primarily due to higher operating expenses within the Ultra Mobility Group and, to a lesser extent, within the Digital Home Group. 34 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the three years ended December 26, 2009 were as follows: (In Millions) 2009 2008 2007 Research and development $ 5,653 $ 5,722 $ 5,755 Marketing, general and administrative $ 7,931 $ 5,452 $ 5,401 Restructuring and asset impairment charges $ 231 $ 710 $ 516 Amortization of acquisition related intangibles $ 35 $ 6 $ 16 Research and Development. RD spending was flat in 2009 compared to 2008, and was flat in 2008 compared to 2007. In 2009 compared to 2008, we had lower process development costs as we transitioned from RD to manufacturing using our 32nm process technology. This decrease was offset by higher profit dependent compensation expenses. In 2008 compared to 2007, we had lower product development expenses resulting from our divested businesses and slightly lower profit dependent compensation. These decreases were offset by higher process development costs as we transitioned from manufacturing start up costs related to our 45nm process technology to RD of our 32nm process technology. Marketing, General and Administrative. Marketing, general and administrative expenses increased $2.5 billion, or 45%, in 2009 compared to 2008, and were flat in 2008 compared to 2007. The increase in 2009 compared to 2008 was due to the charge of $1.447 billion incurred as a result of the fine imposed by the European Commission (EC) and the $1.25 billion payment to AMD as part of a settlement agreement (see Note 28: Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K). To a lesser extent, we had higher profit dependent compensation expenses that were partially offset by lower advertising expenses, including cooperative advertising expenses. In 2008 compared to 2007, we had higher legal expenses that were offset by lower profit dependent compensation and lower advertising expenses. RD, combined with marketing, general and administrative expenses, were 39% of net revenue in 2009, 30% of net revenue in 2008, and 29% of net revenue in 2007. Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges. The following table summarizes restructuring and asset impairment charges by plan for the three years ended December 26, 2009: (In Millions) 2009 2008 2007 2009 restructuring program $ 215 $ $ 2008 NAND plan 215 2006 efficiency program 16 495 516 Total restructuring and asset impairment charges $ 231 $ 710 $ 516 2009 Restructuring Program In the first quarter of 2009, management approved plans to restructure some of our manufacturing and assembly and test operations. These plans included closing two assembly and test facilities in Malaysia, one facility in the Philippines, and one facility in China; stopping production at a 200mm wafer fabrication facility in Oregon; and ending production at our 200mm wafer fabrication facility in California. We do not expect significant future charges related to the 2009 plan. The following table summarizes charges for the 2009 restructuring plan during 2009: (In Millions) 2009 Employee severance and benefit arrangements $ 208 Asset impairments 7 Total restructuring and asset impairment charges $ 215 35 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table summarizes the restructuring and asset impairment activity for the 2009 restructuring plan during 2009: Employee Severance Asset (In Millions) and Benefits Impairments Total Accrued restructuring balance as of December 27, 2008 $ $ $ Additional accruals 223 7 230 Adjustments (15 ) (15 ) Cash payments (182 ) (182 ) Non cash settlements (7 ) (7 ) Accrued restructuring balance as of December 26, 2009 $ 26 $ $ 26 The net charges above include $208 million that relate to employee severance and benefit arrangements for 6,500 employees, of which 5,400 employees had left the company as of December 26, 2009. Most of these employee actions occurred within manufacturing. We estimate that these employee severance and benefit charges will result in gross annual savings of approximately $290 million. The substantial majority of the savings will be realized within cost of sales. 2008 NAND Plan In the fourth quarter of 2008, management approved a plan with Micron to discontinue the supply of NAND flash memory from the 200mm facility within the IMFT manufacturing network. The agreement resulted in a $215 million restructuring charge, primarily related to the IMFT 200mm supply agreement. The restructuring charge resulted in a reduction of our investment in IMFT/IMFS of $184 million, a cash payment to Micron of $24 million, and other cash payments of $7 million. The 2008 NAND plan was completed at the end of 2008. 2006 Efficiency Program In the third quarter of 2006, management approved several actions as part of a restructuring plan designed to improve operational efficiency and financial results. The following table summarizes charges for the 2006 efficiency program for the three years ended December 26, 2009: (In Millions) 2009 2008 2007 Employee severance and benefit arrangements $ 8 $ 151 $ 289 Asset impairments 8 344 227 Total restructuring and asset impairment charges $ 16 $ 495 $ 516 During 2006, as part of our assessment of our worldwide manufacturing capacity operations, we placed for sale our fabrication facility in Colorado Springs, Colorado. As a result of placing the facility for sale, in 2006 we recorded a $214 million impairment charge to write down to fair value the land, building, and equipment. We incurred $54 million in additional asset impairment charges as a result of market conditions related to the Colorado Springs facility during 2007 and additional charges in 2008. We sold the Colorado Springs facility in 2009. In addition, during 2007 we recorded land and building write downs related to certain facilities in Santa Clara, California. We also incurred $85 million in asset impairment charges related to assets that we sold in conjunction with the divestiture of our NOR flash memory business in 2007 and an additional $275 million in 2008. We determined the impairment charges based on the fair value, less selling costs, that we expected to receive upon completion of the divestiture in 2007, and determined the impairment charges using the revised fair value of the equity and note receivable that we received upon completion of the divestiture, less selling costs, in 2008. For further information on this divestiture, see Note 16: Divestitures in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. 36 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table summarizes the restructuring and asset impairment activity for the 2006 efficiency program during 2008 and 2009: Employee Severance Asset (In Millions) and Benefits Impairments Total Accrued restructuring balance as of December 29, 2007 $ 127 $ $ 127 Additional accruals 167 344 511 Adjustments (16 ) (16 ) Cash payments (221 ) (221 ) Non cash settlements (344 ) (344 ) Accrued restructuring balance as of December 27, 2008 $ 57 $ $ 57 Additional accruals 18 8 26 Adjustments (10 ) (10 ) Cash payments (65 ) (65 ) Non cash settlements (8 ) (8 ) Accrued restructuring balance as of December 26, 2009 $ $ $ We recorded the additional accruals, net of adjustments, as restructuring and asset impairment charges. The 2006 efficiency plan is complete. From the third quarter of 2006 through 2009, we incurred a total of $1.6 billion in restructuring and asset impairment charges related to this program. These charges included a total of $686 million related to employee severance and benefit arrangements for 11,300 employees. A substantial majority of these employee actions affected employees within manufacturing, information technology, and marketing. The restructuring and asset impairment charges also included $896 million in asset impairment charges. We estimate that the total employee severance and benefit charges incurred as part of the 2006 efficiency program result in gross annual savings of approximately $1.1 billion. We are realizing these savings within marketing, general and administrative; cost of sales; and RD. Amortization of acquisition related intangibles. The increase of $29 million was due to amortization of intangibles primarily related to the acquisition of Wind River Systems completed in the third quarter of 2009. See Note 15: Acquisitions in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Share Based Compensation Share based compensation totaled $889 million in 2009, $851 million in 2008, and $952 million in 2007. Share based compensation was included in cost of sales and operating expenses. As of December 26, 2009, unrecognized share based compensation costs and the weighted average periods over which the costs are expected to be recognized were as follows: Unrecognized Share Based Weighted Compensation Average (Dollars in Millions) Costs Period Stock options $ 282 1.3 years Restricted stock units $ 1,196 1.4 years Stock purchase plan $ 9 1 month 37 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Gains (Losses) on Equity Method Investments, Net Gains (losses) on equity method investments, net were as follows: (In Millions) 2009 2008 2007 Equity method losses, net $ (131 ) $ (316 ) $ (103 ) Impairment charges (42 ) (1,077 ) (28 ) Other, net 26 13 134 Total gains (losses) on equity method investments, net $ (147 ) $ (1,380 ) $ 3 Impairment charges in 2008 included a $762 million impairment charge recognized on our investment in Clearwire LLC and a $250 million impairment charge recognized on our investment in Numonyx. We recognized the impairment charge on our investment in Clearwire LLC to write down our investment to its fair value, primarily due to the fair value being significantly lower than the cost basis of our investment in the fourth quarter of 2008. The impairment charge on our investment in Numonyx was due to a general decline in 2008 in the NOR flash memory market segment. Our equity method losses were primarily related to Numonyx ($31 million in 2009 and $87 million in 2008), Clearwire LLC ($27 million in 2009), and Clearwire Corporation ($184 million in 2008 and $104 million in 2007). See Note 11: Non Marketable Equity Investments in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. During 2007, we recognized $110 million of income due to the reorganization of one of our investments, included within Other, net in the table above. Gains (Losses) on Other Equity Investments, Net Gains (losses) on other equity investments, net were as follows: (In Millions) 2009 2008 2007 Impairment charges $ (179 ) $ (455 ) $ (92 ) Gains on sales, net 55 60 204 Other, net 101 19 42 Total gains (losses) on other equity investments, net $ (23 ) $ (376 ) $ 154 Impairment charges in 2008 included a $176 million impairment charge recognized on our investment in Clearwire Corporation and $97 million of impairment charges on our investment in Micron. The impairment charge on our investment in Clearwire Corporation was due to the fair value being significantly lower than the cost basis of our investment at the end of the fourth quarter of 2008. The impairment charges on our investment in Micron reflected the difference between our cost basis and the fair value of our investment in Micron at the end of the second and third quarters of 2008. In addition, we recognized higher gains on equity derivatives in 2009 compared to 2008. Interest and Other, Net The components of interest and other, net were as follows: (In Millions) 2009 2008 2007 Interest income $ 168 $ 592 $ 804 Interest expense (1 ) (8 ) (15 ) Other, net (4 ) (96 ) 4 Total interest and other, net $ 163 $ 488 $ 793 We recognized lower interest income in 2009 compared to 2008 as a result of lower interest rates. The average interest rate earned during 2009 decreased by 2.4 percentage points compared to 2008. In addition, lower gains on divestitures (zero in 2009 and $59 million in 2008) were more than offset by $70 million of fair value gains in 2009 on our trading assets, compared to $130 million of fair value losses in 2008. 38 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Interest and other, net decreased in 2008 compared to 2007 due to lower interest income and fair value losses that we experienced in 2008 on our trading assets. Interest income was lower in 2008 compared to 2007 as a result of lower interest rates, partially offset by higher average investment balances. The average interest rate earned during 2008 decreased by 1.9 percentage points compared to 2007. Provision for Taxes Our provision for taxes and effective tax rate were as follows: (Dollars in Millions) 2009 2008 2007 Income before taxes $ 5,704 $ 7,686 $ 9,166 Provision for taxes $ 1,335 $ 2,394 $ 2,190 Effective tax rate 23.4 % 31.1 % 23.9 % We generated a higher percentage of our profits from lower tax jurisdictions in 2009 compared to 2008. In addition, the 2009 tax rate was positively impacted by the reversal of previously accrued taxes of $366 million on settlements, effective settlements, and related remeasurements of various uncertain tax positions compared to a reversal of $103 million for such matters in 2008. These impacts were partially offset by the recognition of the EC fine of $1.447 billion with no associated tax benefit. In addition, our 2008 effective tax rate was negatively impacted by the recognition of a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of realizing tax benefits related to impairments of our equity investments. Our effective income tax rate increased in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to the recognition of a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of realizing tax benefits related to impairments of our equity investments. In addition, the rate increased in 2008 compared to 2007, due to the reversal of previously accrued taxes of $481 million (including $50 million of accrued interest) related to settlements with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the first and second quarters of 2007. Business Outlook Our future results of operations and the topics of other forward looking statements contained in this Form 10 K, including this MDA, involve a number of risks and uncertainties in particular: changes in business and economic conditions; revenue and pricing; gross margin and costs; pending legal proceedings; our effective tax rate (including changes in unrecognized tax positions); marketing, general and administrative expenses; our goals and strategies; new product introductions; plans to cultivate new businesses; RD expenses; divestitures or investments; net gains (losses) from equity investments; interest and other, net; capital spending; depreciation; and impairment of investments. In addition to the various important factors discussed above, a number of other important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. See the risks described in Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10 K. Our expectations for 2010 are as follows: Gross Margin Percentage. 61%, plus or minus three points. The 61% midpoint is higher than our 2009 gross margin of 55.7%, primarily due to lower manufacturing period costs, mostly factory underutilization charges. In addition, we expect lower unit costs and higher unit sales, partially offset by lower average selling prices. Total Spending. We expect spending on RD, plus marketing, general and administrative expenses, in 2010 to be approximately $11.8 billion, plus or minus $100 million, compared to $13.6 billion in 2009. Total spending in 2009 included charges of $1.447 billion incurred as a result of the fine imposed by the EC and $1.25 billion as a result of our legal settlement with AMD. Research and Development Spending. Approximately $6.2 billion compared to $5.7 billion in 2009. Capital Spending. Approximately $4.8 billion, plus or minus $100 million, compared to $4.5 billion in 2009. Depreciation. Approximately $4.4 billion, plus or minus $100 million, compared to $4.7 billion in 2009. Tax Rate. Approximately 30%, compared to 23% in 2009. The estimated effective tax rate is based on tax law in effect as of December 26, 2009 and expected income. 39 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Status of Business Outlook We expect that our corporate representatives will, from time to time, meet privately with investors, investment analysts, the media, and others, and may reiterate the forward looking statements contained in the Business Outlook section and elsewhere in this Form 10 K, including any such statements that are incorporated by reference in this Form 10 K. At the same time, we will keep this Form 10 K and our most current business outlook publicly available on our Investor Relations web site at www.intc.com. The public can continue to rely on the business outlook published on the web site as representing our current expectations on matters covered, unless we publish a notice stating otherwise. The statements in the Business Outlook section and other forward looking statements in this Form 10 K are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and SEC filings and at other times. From the close of business on February 26, 2010 until our quarterly earnings release is published, presently scheduled for April 13, 2010, we will observe a quiet period. During the quiet period, the Business Outlook section and other forward looking statements first published in our Form 8 K filed on January 14, 2010, as reiterated or updated as applicable in this Form 10 K, should be considered historical, speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update. During the quiet period, our representatives will not comment on our business outlook or our financial results or expectations. The exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period, and any others that we utilize from time to time, may vary at our discretion. 40 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources (Dollars in Millions) Dec. 26, 2009 Dec. 27, 2008 Cash and cash equivalents, debt instruments included in trading assets, and short term investments $ 13,920 $ 11,544 Loans receivable and other long term investments $ 4,528 $ 2,924 Short term and long term debt $ 2,221 $ 1,287 Debt as % of stockholders equity 5.3 % 3.3 % Sources and Uses of Cash (In Millions) In summary, our cash flows were as follows: (In Millions) 2009 2008 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 11,170 $ 10,926 $ 12,625 Net cash used for investing activities (7,965 ) (5,865 ) (9,926 ) Net cash used for financing activities (2,568 ) (9,018 ) (1,990 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 637 $ (3,957 ) $ 709 41 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non cash items and changes in certain assets and liabilities. For 2009 compared to 2008, the $244 million increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to changes in assets and liabilities, partially offset by lower net income. Income taxes paid, net of refunds in 2009 compared to 2008 were $3.1 billion lower on lower income before taxes and timing of payments. Changes in assets and liabilities for 2009 compared to 2008 included the following: Inventories decreased due to lower chipset and raw materials inventory. Accounts payable decreased due to timing of payments, despite higher production spending. Accounts receivable increased due to higher revenue and a higher proportion of sales at the end of the fourth quarter of 2009. Accrued compensation and benefits increased due to higher accrued profit dependent compensation. For 2009 and 2008, our two largest customers accounted for 38% of our net revenue, with one of these customers accounting for 21% of our net revenue in 2009 (20% in 2008), and another customer accounting for 17% of our net revenue in 2009 (18% in 2008). These two largest customers accounted for 41% of our accounts receivable as of December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008. For 2008 compared to 2007, the $1.7 billion decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the $1.7 billion decrease in net income, while total adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities, including net changes in assets and liabilities, were approximately flat. Effective 2008, cash flows related to marketable debt instruments classified as trading assets are included in investing activities. Investing Activities Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures, net investment purchases, maturities, disposals, and cash used for acquisitions. The increase in cash used for investing activities in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to an increase in net purchases of available for sale investments and trading assets, and higher cash paid for acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in investments in non marketable equity investments. Our investments in non marketable equity investments in 2008 included $1.0 billion for an ownership interest in Clearwire LLC. Our capital expenditures were $4.5 billion in 2009 ($5.2 billion in 2008 and $5.0 billion in 2007). Capital expenditures for 2010 are currently expected to be higher than our 2009 expenditures and are expected to be funded by cash flows from operating activities. The decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to a decrease in purchases of available for sale debt investments. In addition, the related cash flows for marketable debt instruments classified as trading assets were included in investing activities for 2008, and previously they had been included in operating activities. Financing Activities Financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases and retirement of common stock, payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance of long term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans. 42 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to a decrease in repurchases and retirement of common stock and the issuance of long term debt, partially offset by lower proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans. We used the majority of the proceeds from the 2009 issuance of long term debt to repurchase and retire common stock. During 2009, we repurchased $1.8 billion of common stock compared to $7.2 billion in 2008. As of December 26, 2009, $5.7 billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization of $25 billion. We base our level of common stock repurchases on internal cash management decisions, and this level may fluctuate. Proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans totaled $400 million in 2009 compared to $1.1 billion in 2008 as a result of a lower volume of employee exercises of stock options. Our total dividend payments in 2009 remained flat from 2008 at $3.1 billion. We have paid a cash dividend in each of the past 69 quarters. In January 2010, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.1575 per common share for the first quarter of 2010. The dividend is payable on March 1, 2010 to stockholders of record on February 7, 2010. The higher cash used in financing activities in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to an increase in repurchases and retirement of common stock, and lower proceeds from the sale of shares pursuant to employee equity incentive plans. Liquidity Cash generated by operations is used as our primary source of liquidity. As of December 26, 2009, cash and cash equivalents, debt instruments included in trading assets, and short term investments totaled $13.9 billion. In addition to the $13.9 billion, we have $4.5 billion in loans receivable and other long term investments that we include when assessing our investment portfolio. The credit quality of our investment portfolio remains high, with credit related other than temporary impairment losses on our available for sale debt instruments limited to less than $55 million cumulatively since the beginning of 2008. In addition, we continue to be able to invest in high credit quality investments. Substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are with A/A2 or better rated issuers, and a substantial majority of the issuers are rated AA /Aa3 or better. As of December 26, 2009, cumulative unrealized gains, net of corresponding hedging activities, related to debt instruments classified as trading assets, and cumulative unrealized gains related to debt instruments classified as available for sale, were insignificant. As of December 27, 2008, our cumulative unrealized losses, net of corresponding hedging activities, related to debt instruments classified as trading assets were $145 million. As of December 27, 2008, our cumulative unrealized losses related to debt instruments classified as available for sale were $215 million. Our commercial paper program provides another potential source of liquidity. We have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $3.0 billion, including through the issuance of commercial paper. Maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during 2009 were $610 million, although no commercial paper remained outstanding as of December 26, 2009. Our commercial paper was rated A 1+ by Standard Poors and P 1 by Moodys as of December 26, 2009. We also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. We believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet business requirements for the next 12 months, including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test, working capital requirements, and potential dividends, common stock repurchases, and acquisitions or strategic investments. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and we consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. See Note 5: Fair Value in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Credit risk is factored into the valuation of financial instruments that we measure and record at fair value on a recurring basis. When fair value is determined using observable market prices, the credit risk is incorporated into the market price of the financial instrument. When fair value is determined using pricing models, such as a discounted cash flow model, the issuers credit risk and or Intels credit risk is factored into the calculation of the fair value, as appropriate. 43 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Marketable Debt Instruments As of December 26, 2009, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $17.5 billion of marketable debt instruments. Of these instruments, $657 million was classified as Level 1, $15.8 billion as Level 2, and $1.1 billion as Level 3. When available, we use observable market prices for identical securities to value our marketable debt instruments. If observable market prices are not available, we use non binding market consensus prices that we seek to corroborate with observable market data, if available, or unobservable market data. When prices from multiple sources are available for a given instrument, we use observable market quotes to price our instruments, in lieu of prices from other sources. Our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 1 was classified as such due to the usage of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets. Marketable debt instruments in this category generally include certain of our corporate bonds, government bonds, and money market fund deposits. Management judgment was required to determine the levels at which sufficient volume and frequency of transactions are met for a market to be considered active. Our assessment of an active market for our marketable debt instruments generally takes into consideration activity during each week of the one month period prior to the valuation date of each individual instrument, including the number of days each individual instrument trades and the average weekly trading volume in relation to the total outstanding amount of the issued instrument. Approximately 10% of our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 2 was classified as such due to the usage of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in less active markets. When observable market prices for identical securities are not available, we price our marketable debt instruments using non binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data; quoted market prices for similar instruments; or pricing models, such as a discounted cash flow model, with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data. Non binding market consensus prices are based on the proprietary valuation models of pricing providers or brokers. These valuation models incorporate a number of inputs, including non binding and binding broker quotes; observable market prices for identical and or similar securities; and the internal assumptions of pricing providers or brokers that use observable market inputs and, to a lesser degree, unobservable market inputs. We corroborate the non binding market consensus prices with observable market data using statistical models when observable market data exists. The discounted cash flow model uses observable market inputs, such as LIBOR based yield curves, currency spot and forward rates, and credit ratings. Approximately 40% of our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 2 was classified as such due to the usage of non binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data, and approximately 50% due to the usage of a discounted cash flow model. Marketable debt instruments classified as Level 2 generally include commercial paper, bank time deposits, municipal bonds, certain of our money market fund deposits, and a majority of corporate bonds and government bonds. Our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 3 were classified as such due to the lack of observable market data to corroborate either the non binding market consensus prices or the non binding broker quotes. When observable market data is not available, we corroborate the non binding market consensus prices and non binding broker quotes using unobservable data, if available. Marketable debt instruments in this category generally include asset backed securities and certain of our corporate bonds. All of our investments in asset backed securities were classified as Level 3, and substantially all of them were valued using non binding market consensus prices that we were not able to corroborate with observable market data due to the lack of transparency in the market for asset backed securities. Equity Securities As of December 26, 2009, our portfolio of assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $773 million of marketable equity securities. Of these securities, $676 million was classified as Level 1 because the valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets. Our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity securities generally takes into consideration activity during each week of the one month period prior to the valuation date for each individual security, including the number of days each individual equity security trades and the average weekly trading volume in relation to the total outstanding shares of that security. The remaining marketable equity securities of $97 million were classified as Level 2 because their valuations were either based on quoted prices for identical securities in less active markets or adjusted for security specific restrictions. 44 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 26, 2009: Payments Due by Period Less Than More Than (In Millions) Total 1 Year 13 Years 35 Years 5 Years Operating lease obligations $ 349 $ 102 $ 149 $ 60 $ 38 Capital purchase obligations1 1,836 1,760 76 Other purchase obligations and commitments2 866 290 403 48 125 Long term debt obligations3 7,253 284 238 238 6,493 Other long term liabilities4, 5 593 230 153 97 113 Total6 $ 10,897 $ 2,666 $ 1,019 $ 443 $ 6,769 1 Capital purchase obligations represent commitments for the construction or purchase of property, plant and equipment. They were not recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 26, 2009, as we had not yet received the related goods or taken title to the property. Capital purchase obligations decreased from $2.9 billion as of December 27, 2008 to $1.8 billion as of December 26, 2009, primarily due to the timing of the ramp of our latest silicon process technology. 2 Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses and agreements to purchase raw materials or other goods, as well as payments due under non contingent funding obligations. Funding obligations include, for example, agreements to fund various projects with other companies. 3 Amounts represent principal and interest cash payments over the life of the debt obligations, including anticipated interest payments that are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. Any future settlement of convertible debt would impact our cash payments. 4 We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions; therefore, $193 million of long term income taxes payable has been excluded from the table above. However, long term income taxes payable, included on our consolidated balance sheets, included these uncertain tax positions, reduced by the associated federal deduction for state taxes and U.S. tax credits arising from non U.S. income. 5 Amounts represent future cash payments to satisfy other long term liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheets, including the short term portion of these long term liabilities. Expected contributions to our U.S. and non U.S. pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans of $60 million to be made during 2010 are also included; however, funding projections beyond 2010 are not practical to estimate. 6 Total generally excludes contractual obligations already recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as current liabilities. Contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services generally include agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on Intel and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The table above also includes agreements to purchase raw materials that have cancellation provisions requiring little or no payment. The amounts under such contracts are included in the table above because management believes that cancellation of these contracts is unlikely and expects to make future cash payments according to the contract terms or in similar amounts for similar materials. For other obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the table above were limited to the non cancelable portion of the agreement terms and or the minimum cancellation fee. We have entered into certain agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods that specify minimum prices and quantities based on a percentage of the total available market or based on a percentage of our future purchasing requirements. Due to the uncertainty of the future market and our future purchasing requirements, obligations under these agreements are not included in the table above. We estimate our obligation under these agreements as of December 26, 2009 to be approximately as follows: less than one year $364 million; one to three years $3 million; more than three years zero. Our purchase orders for other products are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. In addition, some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. 45 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones are not included in the table above. These obligations include contingent funding/payment obligations and milestone based equity investment funding. These arrangements are not considered contractual obligations until the milestone is met by the third party. Assuming that all future milestones are met, additional required payments related to these obligations were not significant as of December 26, 2009. For the majority of restricted stock units granted, the number of shares issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees. The obligation to pay the relative taxing authority is not included in the table above, as the amount is contingent upon continued employment. In addition, the amount of the obligation is unknown, as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest. We have a contractual obligation to purchase the output of IMFT in proportion to our investments, 49% as of December 26, 2009. We also have several agreements with Micron related to intellectual property rights, and RD funding related to NAND flash manufacturing and IMFT. The obligation to purchase our proportion of IMFTs inventory was $100 million as of December 26, 2009. See Note 11: Non Marketable Equity Investments in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The expected timing of payments of the obligations above are estimates based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 26, 2009, with the exception of a guarantee for the repayment of $275 million in principal of the payment obligations of Numonyx under its senior credit facility, as well as accrued unpaid interest, expenses of the lenders, and penalties, we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S K. In February 2010, we signed a definitive agreement with Micron and Numonyx under which Micron agreed to acquire Numonyx in an all stock transaction. The senior credit facility that is supported by Intels guarantee is expected to be repaid in full following the closing of this transaction. See Note 11: Non Marketable Equity Investments in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage currency exchange rate and interest rate risk, and to a lesser extent, equity market and commodity price risk. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions as of December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008. Actual results may differ materially. Currency Exchange Rates We generally hedge currency risks of non U.S. dollar denominated investments in debt instruments and loans receivable with offsetting currency forward contracts, currency options, or currency interest rate swaps. Gains and losses on these non U.S. currency investments would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments, resulting in a negligible net exposure to loss. Substantially all of our revenue and a majority of our expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, certain operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies, primarily the Japanese yen, the euro, and the Israeli shekel. We have established balance sheet and forecasted transaction currency risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in fair value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates. We generally utilize currency forward contracts and, to a lesser extent, currency options in these hedging programs. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements (see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10 K). We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that a weighted average adverse change of 20% in currency exchange rates could be experienced in the near term. Such an adverse change, after taking into account hedges and offsetting positions, would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than $40 million as of December 26, 2009 (less than $55 million as of December 27, 2008). Interest Rates We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio and debt issuances. The primary objective of our investments in debt instruments is to preserve principal while maximizing yields. To achieve this objective, the returns on our investments in debt instruments are generally based on the U.S. dollar three month LIBOR. A hypothetical decrease in interest rates of 1.0% would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our debt issuances of approximately $205 million as of December 26, 2009 (an increase of approximately $150 million as of December 27, 2008). A hypothetical decrease in interest rates of up to 1.0% would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our investment portfolio of approximately $10 million as of December 26, 2009 (an increase of approximately $15 million as of December 27, 2008). These hypothetical decreases in interest rates, after taking into account hedges and offsetting positions, would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our net investment position of approximately $195 million as of December 26, 2009 and $135 million as of December 27, 2008. The fluctuations in fair value of our debt issuances and investment portfolio reflect only the direct impact of the change in interest rates. Other economic variables, such as equity market fluctuations and changes in relative credit risk, could result in a significantly higher decline in our net investment portfolio. For further information on how credit risk is factored into the valuation of our investment portfolio and debt issuances, see Fair Value of Financial Instruments in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10 K. Equity Prices Our marketable equity investments include marketable equity securities and equity derivative instruments such as warrants and options. To the extent that our marketable equity securities have strategic value, we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our equity market exposure through hedging activities; however, for our investments in strategic equity derivative instruments, including warrants, we may enter into transactions to reduce or eliminate the equity market risks. For securities that we no longer consider strategic, we evaluate legal, market, and economic factors in our decision on the timing of disposal and whether it is possible and appropriate to hedge the equity market risk. We hold derivative instruments that seek to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements. The gains and losses from changes in fair value of these derivatives are designed to offset the gains and losses on the related liabilities, resulting in an insignificant net exposure to loss. 47 Table of Contents As of December 26, 2009, the fair value of our marketable equity securities and our equity derivative instruments, including hedging positions, was $805 million ($362 million as of December 27, 2008). Our marketable equity securities include our investments in Clearwire Corporation and Micron, carried at a fair market value of $250 million and $148 million, respectively, as of December 26, 2009. To determine reasonably possible decreases in the market value of our marketable equity investments, we analyzed the expected market price sensitivity of our marketable equity investment portfolio. Assuming a loss of 50% in market prices, and after reflecting the impact of hedges and offsetting positions, the aggregate value of our marketable equity investments could decrease by approximately $405 million, based on the value as of December 26, 2009 (a decrease in value of approximately $220 million, based on the value as of December 27, 2008 using an assumed loss of 60%). The decrease in the assumed loss percentage from December 27, 2008 to December 26, 2009 is due to lower expected overall equity market volatility. Many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our non marketable equity investments, although we cannot always quantify the impact directly. Financial markets and credit markets are volatile, which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in, their ability to raise additional capital, and the likelihood of our being able to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. These types of investments involve a great deal of risk, and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful; consequently, we could lose all or part of our investment. Our non marketable equity investments, excluding investments accounted for under the equity method, had a carrying amount of $939 million as of December 26, 2009 ($1.0 billion as of December 27, 2008). As of December 26, 2009, the carrying amount of our non marketable equity method investments was $2.5 billion ($3.0 billion as of December 27, 2008). A substantial majority of this balance as of December 26, 2009 was concentrated in companies in the flash memory market segment. Our flash memory market segment investments include our investment of $1.6 billion in IMFT/IMFS ($2.1 billion as of December 27, 2008) and $453 million in Numonyx ($484 million as of December 27, 2008). In February 2010, we signed a definitive agreement with Micron and Numonyx under which Micron agreed to acquire Numonyx in an all stock transaction. The value of the Micron common stock that we would receive upon the closing of the transaction is subject to equity market risk.
