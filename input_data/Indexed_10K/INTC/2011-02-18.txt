Overview of contractual obligations, contingent liabilities, commitments, and off balance sheet arrangements outstanding as of December 25, 2010, including expected payment schedule. The various sections of this MDA contain a number of forward looking statements. Words such as expects, goals, plans, believes, continues, may, will, and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements. In addition, any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses, and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward looking statements. Such statements are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing and particularly in the Business Outlook section and in Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10 K. Our actual results may differ materially, and other than our expected completion of the McAfee acquisition in the first quarter of 2011 (see Note 15: Acquisitions in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K), these forward looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, or other business combinations that had not been completed as of February 18, 2011. Overview Our results of operations were as follows: Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended Dec. 25, Sept. 25, Dec. 25, Dec. 26, (Dollars in Millions) 2010 2010 2010 2009 Net revenue $ 11,457 $ 11,102 $ 43,623 $ 35,127 Gross margin $ 7,406 $ 7,321 $ 28,491 $ 19,561 Gross margin percentage 64.6 % 65.9 % 65.3 % 55.7 % Operating income $ 4,023 $ 4,136 $ 15,588 $ 5,711 Net income $ 3,180 $ 2,955 $ 11,464 $ 4,369 2010 was a record year for us. Strong market growth in the business and consumer PC market segments as well as the continued build out of the data center, the leadership of our product portfolio, and improvements to our cost structure all contributed to the most profitable year in our history. Revenue increased 24% in 2010 compared to 2009. Our 2010 gross margin percentage of 65.3% increased by 9.6 percentage points from 2009, primarily driven by lower factory underutilization charges, higher microprocessor average selling prices, lower platform (microprocessor and chipset) unit cost, and higher platform unit sales. We expect continued strength in emerging markets coupled with the build out of the cloud computing infrastructure to contribute toward a 2011 revenue growth percentage in the mid to high teens. This expectation is also inclusive of the recently completed acquisition of the WLS business of Infineon and the expected acquisition of McAfee in the first quarter of 2011. In the fourth quarter, we achieved record quarterly revenue for the third quarter in a row despite continuation of the softness we saw in the consumer segments of mature markets starting in the middle of the year. The sequential decrease in our fourth quarter gross margin percentage was primarily driven by charges to repair and replace materials and systems impacted by a design issue related to our Intel 6 Series Express Chipset family (see Note 20: Chipset Design Issue in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K), increased costs associated with taking older technology offline, and higher start up costs. These impacts were partially offset by the qualification for sale of our 2nd generation Intel Coretm processor products (formerly code named Sandy Bridge), resulting in lower microprocessor inventory write offs and sales of previously written off products, and higher platform average selling prices. 24 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) As we enter 2011, the strength of our product portfolio is highlighted with the launch of 32nm process technology products based on our 2nd generation Intel Core processor microarchitecture. We continue to deliver improvements in our product offerings through our tick tock technology development cadence. We plan to invest $9.0 billion in capital assets in 2011 as we build and equip our 22nm process technology manufacturing capacity, which will increase our leading edge facilities to four. This increase in capital spending will enable us to take advantage of the significant market growth opportunities that we believe exist for our products across the computing spectrum, as well as move more transistors to our leading edge process technologies. The cash generating power of our business was evident in 2010 with $16.7 billion of cash from operations. From a financial condition perspective, we ended 2010 with an investment portfolio of $21.5 billion, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, and marketable debt instruments included in trading assets. During 2010, we purchased $5.2 billion in capital assets, returned $3.5 billion to stockholders through dividends, and repurchased $1.5 billion of common stock through our common stock repurchase program. In January 2011, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.1812 per common share for the first quarter of 2011, an increase of approximately 15% compared to our fourth quarter dividend, and increased the repurchase authorization limit of our common stock repurchase program by $10 billion. During 2010, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire McAfee for approximately $7.68 billion, and we expect to complete the acquisition in the first quarter of 2011. For further information, see Note 15: Acquisitions in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions. In the first quarter of 2011, we completed the acquisition of the WLS business of Infineon. Total net cash consideration for the acquisition is estimated at $1.4 billion. For further information, see Note 15: Acquisitions in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. In January 2011, we entered into a long term patent cross license agreement with NVIDIA. Under the agreement, we receive a license to all of NVIDIAs patents, while NVIDIA products are licensed to our patents subject to exclusions for x86 products, certain chipsets, and certain flash memory technology products. The agreement also includes settlement of the existing litigation between the companies as well as broad mutual general releases. We agreed to make payments to NVIDIA totaling $1.5 billion over six years. For further information, see Note 29: Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Strategy Our goal is to be the preeminent computing solutions company that powers the worldwide digital economy. We believe that the proliferation of the Internet and cloud computing have driven fundamental changes in the computing industry. We are transforming from a company with a primary focus on the design and manufacture of semiconductor chips for PCs and servers to a computing company that delivers complete solutions in the form of hardware and software platforms and supporting services. The number and variety of devices connected to the Internet is growing, and computing is becoming an increasingly personal experience. End users value consistency across devices that connect seamlessly and effortlessly to the Internet and to each other. We will help to enable this experience by innovating around three pillars of computing: energy efficient performance, connectivity, and security. Energy Efficient Performance. We are focusing on improved energy efficient performance for computing and communications systems and devices. Improved energy efficient performance involves balancing higher performance with lower power consumption. Connectivity. We are positioning our business to take advantage of the growth in devices that compute and connect to the Internet. In the first quarter of 2011, we acquired the WLS business of Infineon. This acquisition enables us to offer a portfolio of products that covers a broad range of wireless connectivity options by combining the Intel WiFi and Intel WiMAX technologies with WLS 2G and 3G technologies, and creates a combined path to accelerate industry adoption of 4G LTE. Security. Our goal is to enhance security features through a combination of hardware and software solutions. This may include identity protection and fraud deterrence; detection and prevention of malware; securing data and assets; as well as system recovery and enhanced security patching. We expect to complete the acquisition of McAfee in the first quarter of 2011. We believe that this acquisition will accelerate and enhance our hardware and software security solutions, improving the overall security of our platforms. 25 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) To succeed in the changing computing environment, we have the following key objectives: Strive to ensure that Intel technology remains the best choice for the PC as well as cloud computing and the data center. Expand platforms into adjacent market segments to bring compelling new solutions to the smartphone, the tablet, the TV, the car, and the rest of the embedded world. Enable devices that connect to the Internet and to each other to create a continuum of personal computing. This continuum would give consumers a set of secure, consistent, and personalized computing experiences. Positively impact the world through our actions and the application of our energy efficient technology. We will use our core assets to meet these objectives. Our core assets include our silicon and process technology, our architecture and platforms, our global presence, our strong relationships across the industry, and our brand recognition. We believe that applying these core assets to our key focus areas provides us with the scale, capacity, and global reach to establish new technologies and respond to customers needs quickly. Some of our core assets and key focus areas are: Silicon and Manufacturing Technology Leadership. We have long been a leader in silicon process technology and manufacturing, and we aim to continue our lead through investment and innovation in this critical area. We drive a regular two year upgrade cycle introducing a new microarchitecture approximately every two years and ramping the next generation of silicon process technology in the intervening years. We refer to this as our tick tock technology development cadence. As we continue to drive Moores Law over the next several years, we believe that the value of this advantage will increase. We aim to have the best process technology, and unlike most semiconductor companies, we primarily manufacture our products in our own facilities. This allows us to optimize performance, reduce our time to market, and scale new products more rapidly. Architecture and Platforms. We are now developing a wide range of solutions for devices that span the computing continuum, from PCs and smartphones to smart TVs and in vehicle infotainment systems and beyond. Users want computing experiences that are consistent and devices that are interoperable. Users and developers value consistency of architecture, which provides a common framework that allows for reduced time to market, with the ability to leverage technologies across multiple form factors. We believe that we can meet the needs of both users and developers by offering Intel architecture based computing solutions across the computing continuum. We continue to invest in improving Intel architecture so that we can deliver increased value to our customers in existing market segments and also expand the capabilities of the architecture to meet end user and customer needs in adjacent market segments. Increasingly, we are delivering our architecture in the form of platforms. Platforms include not only the microprocessor, but other critical hardware and software ingredients that are necessary to create computing solutions. We are expanding our platform capabilities with connectivity solutions, new types of user interfaces, new features and capabilities, and complementary software. Software. We enable and advance the computing ecosystem by providing development tools and support to help software developers create software applications and operating systems that take advantage of our platforms. We seek to expedite growth in various market segments, such as the embedded and handheld market segments, through our software offerings. Additionally, we have collaborated with other companies to develop software platforms optimized for our Intel Atomtm processors and that support multiple hardware architectures as well as multiple operating systems. Customer Orientation. Our strategy focuses on developing our next generation of products based on the needs and expectations of our customers. In turn, our products help enable the design and development of new form factors and usage models for businesses and consumers. We offer platforms that incorporate various components designed and configured to work together to provide an optimized solution compared to components that are used separately. Additionally, we promote industry standards that we believe will yield innovation and improved technologies for users. Strategic Investments. We make investments in companies around the world that we believe will generate financial returns, further our strategic objectives, and support our key business initiatives. Our investments, including those made through our Intel Capital program, generally focus on investing in companies and initiatives to stimulate growth in the digital economy, create new business opportunities for Intel, and expand global markets for our products. Stewardship. We are committed to developing energy efficient technology solutions that can be used to address major global problems while reducing our environmental impact. We are also committed to helping transform education globally through our technology, program, and policy leadership, as well as funding through the Intel Foundation. In addition, we strive to cultivate a work environment where engaged, energized employees can thrive in their jobs and in their communities. Our continued investment in developing our assets and execution on key focus areas will strengthen our competitive position as we enter and expand into new market segments. We believe that these new market segments will result in demand that is incremental to that of microprocessors designed for notebook and desktop computers. We also believe that increased Internet traffic and use of cloud computing create a need for greater server infrastructure, including server products optimized for energy efficient performance and virtualization. 26 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Strategy by Major Market Segment The strategy for our PC Client Group operating segment is to offer products that are incorporated into notebook, netbook, tablet, and desktop computers for consumers and businesses. Our strategy for the notebook computing market segment is to offer notebook PC products designed to improve performance, battery life, and wireless connectivity, as well as to allow for the design of smaller, lighter, and thinner form factors. We are also increasing our focus on notebook products designed to offer technologies that provide increased manageability and security. In addition, we are focusing on providing seamless connectivity within our platforms through the use and development of multi communication technologies such as WiMAX, WiFi, and 4G LTE. Our strategy for the netbook computing market segment is to offer products that enable customization and affordable Internet focused devices with small form factors. We also are focusing on offering performance capabilities and features that allow for enhanced end user experiences such as seamless connectivity, improved synchronization of content between devices, and enhanced media usage. Our strategy for the tablet computing market segment is to offer Intel Atom processor based solutions for multiple operating systems that are designed to provide enhanced performance and seamless connectivity to the Internet and other devices. Tablets provide a unique form factor for multiple operating systems and a unique user interface, including multi touch features. Our strategy for the desktop computing market segment is to offer products that provide increased manageability, security, and energy efficient performance while lowering total cost of ownership for businesses. For consumers in the desktop computing market segment, we also focus on the design of components for high end enthusiast PCs and mainstream PCs with rich audio and video capabilities. The strategy for our Data Center Group operating segment is to offer products that provide leading performance, energy efficiency, and virtualization technology for server, workstation, and storage platforms. We are also increasing our focus on products designed for high performance and mission critical computing, cloud computing services, and emerging markets. In addition, we offer wired connectivity devices that are incorporated into products that make up the infrastructure for the Internet. The strategies for our other Intel architecture operating segments include: driving Intel architecture as a solution for embedded applications by delivering long life cycle support, software and architectural scalability, and platform integration; continuing to develop and offer products that enable handheld devices to deliver digital content and the Internet to users in new ways; and offering products and solutions for use in consumer electronics devices designed to access and share Internet, broadcast, optical media, and personal content through a variety of linked digital devices within the home, including the TV. Critical Accounting Estimates The methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements. Some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. Our most critical accounting estimates include: the valuation of non marketable equity investments and the determination of other than temporary impairments, which impact gains (losses) on equity method investments, net, or gains (losses) on other equity investments, net when we record impairments; the assessment of recoverability of long lived assets, which impacts gross margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation; the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes (including the measurement of uncertain tax positions), which impact our provision for taxes; the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross margin; and the recognition and measurement of loss contingencies, which impact gross margin or operating expenses when we recognize a loss contingency, revise the estimate for a loss contingency, or record an asset impairment. Below, we discuss these policies further, as well as the estimates and judgments involved. 27 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Non Marketable Equity Investments We regularly invest in non marketable equity instruments of private companies, which range from early stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. The carrying value of our non marketable equity investment portfolio, excluding equity derivatives, totaled $2.6 billion as of December 25, 2010 ($3.4 billion as of December 26, 2009). The majority of this balance as of December 25, 2010 was concentrated in companies in the flash memory market segment. Our flash memory market segment investments include our investment in IM Flash Technologies, LLC (IMFT) and IM Flash Singapore, LLP (IMFS) of $1.5 billion ($1.6 billion as of December 26, 2009). For additional information, see Note 11: Equity Method and Cost Method Investments in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Our non marketable equity investments are recorded using the cost method or the equity method of accounting, depending on the facts and circumstances of each investment. Our non marketable equity investments are classified within other long term assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Non marketable equity investments are inherently risky, and their success is dependent on product development, market acceptance, operational efficiency, other key business factors, and the ability of the investee companies to raise additional funds in financial markets that can be volatile. The companies could fail or not be able to raise additional funds when needed, or they may receive lower valuations with less favorable investment terms than previous financings. These events could cause our investments to become impaired. In addition, financial market volatility could negatively affect our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. For further information about our investment portfolio risks, see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10 K. We determine the fair value of our non marketable equity investments quarterly for disclosure purposes; however, the investments are recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized. We determine the fair value of our non marketable equity investments using the market and income approaches. The market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies, such as projected revenues, earnings, and comparable performance multiples. The selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors, including comparable companies sizes, growth rates, industries, development stages, and other relevant factors. The income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model, which may include one or multiple discounted cash flow scenarios and requires the following significant estimates for the investee: revenue, based on assumed market segment size and assumed market segment share; expenses, capital spending, and other costs; and discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies. Estimates of market segment size, market segment share, expenses, capital spending, and other costs are developed by the investee and or Intel using historical data and available market data. The valuation of our non marketable equity investments also takes into account variables such as conditions reflected in the capital markets, recent financing activities by the investees, the investees capital structure, and the terms of the investees issued interests. For non marketable equity investments, the measurement of fair value requires significant judgment and includes quantitative and qualitative analysis of identified events or circumstances that impact the fair value of the investment, such as: the investees revenue and earnings trends relative to pre defined milestones and overall business prospects; the technological feasibility of the investees products and technologies; the general market conditions in the investees industry or geographic area, including adverse regulatory or economic changes; factors related to the investees ability to remain in business, such as the investees liquidity, debt ratios, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash; and the investees receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation. If the fair value of an investment is below our carrying value, we determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired based on our quantitative and qualitative analysis, which includes assessing the severity and duration of the impairment and the likelihood of recovery before disposal. If the investment is considered to be other than temporarily impaired, we write down the investment to its fair value. Impairments of non marketable equity investments were $125 million in 2010. Over the past 12 quarters, including the fourth quarter of 2010, impairments of non marketable equity investments ranged from $11 million to $896 million per quarter. This range included impairments of $896 million during the fourth quarter of 2008, primarily related to a $762 million impairment charge on our investment in Clearwire Communications, LLC (Clearwire LLC). 28 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) IMFT/IMFS IMFT and IMFS are variable interest entities that are designed to manufacture and sell NAND products to Intel and Micron at manufacturing cost. We determine the fair value of our investment in IMFT/IMFS using the income approach based on a weighted average of multiple discounted cash flow scenarios of our NAND Solutions Group business, which requires the use of unobservable inputs. Unobservable inputs that require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments are the estimates for projected revenue and discount rate. Changes in management estimates for these unobservable inputs have the most significant effect on the fair value determination. We have not had an other than temporary impairment of our investment in IMFT/IMFS. Long Lived Assets We assess the impairment of long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable. Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. We measure the recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations by comparing the carrying value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows. If an asset groupings carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. The impairment is measured by comparing the difference between the asset groupings carrying value and its fair value. Long lived assets such as goodwill; intangible assets; and property, plant and equipment are considered non financial assets, and are recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized. Impairments of long lived assets are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows. Due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity, we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings. In addition, as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions, we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets, primarily process specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements. When we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the assets new, shorter useful lives. Over the past 12 quarters, including the fourth quarter of 2010, impairments and accelerated depreciation of long lived assets ranged from $10 million to $300 million per quarter. Income Taxes We must make estimates and judgments in determining the provision for taxes for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Significant changes in these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We believe that we will ultimately recover the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely. Recovery of a portion of our deferred tax assets is impacted by managements plans with respect to holding or disposing of certain investments; therefore, changes in managements plans with respect to holding or disposing of investments could affect our future provision for taxes. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. If we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit, the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We re evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors such as changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, new audit activity, and effectively settled issues. Determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. 29 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Inventory The valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality. The determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products. The estimate of future demand is compared to work in process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount, if any, of obsolete or excess inventory. As of December 25, 2010, we had total work in process inventory of $1.9 billion and total finished goods inventory of $1.4 billion. The demand forecast is included in the development of our short term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuation and build decisions. Product specific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of the customer base, the stage of the product life cycle of our products, consumer confidence, and customer acceptance of our products, as well as an assessment of the selling price in relation to the product cost. If our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we could be required to write off inventory, which would negatively impact our gross margin. In order to determine what costs can be included in the valuation of inventory, we must determine normal capacity at our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities, based on historical loadings compared to total available capacity. If the factory loadings are below the established normal capacity level, a portion of our manufacturing overhead costs would not be included in the cost of inventory, and therefore would be recognized as cost of sales in that period, which would negatively impact our gross margin. We refer to these costs as excess capacity charges. Over the past 12 quarters, excess capacity charges ranged from zero to $680 million per quarter. Loss Contingencies We are subject to various legal and administrative proceedings and asserted and potential claims, accruals related to repair or replacement of parts in connection with product errata, as well as product warranties and potential asset impairments (loss contingencies) that arise in the ordinary course of business. An estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a loss contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. The outcomes of legal and administrative proceedings and claims, and the estimation of product warranties and asset impairments, are subject to significant uncertainty. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is reasonably estimable. With respect to estimating the losses associated with repairing and replacing parts in connection with product errata, we make judgments with respect to customer return rates, costs to repair or replace parts, and where the product is in our customers manufacturing process. At least quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter, and we may revise our estimates. These revisions could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Accounting Changes and Recent Accounting Standards For a description of accounting changes and recent accounting standards, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 3: Accounting Changes and Note 4: Recent Accounting Standards in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. 30 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Results of Operations The following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated: 2010 2009 2008 % of Net % of Net % of Net (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Dollars Revenue Dollars Revenue Dollars Revenue Net revenue $ 43,623 100.0 % $ 35,127 100.0 % $ 37,586 100.0 % Cost of sales 15,132 34.7 % 15,566 44.3 % 16,742 44.5 % Gross margin 28,491 65.3 % 19,561 55.7 % 20,844 55.5 % Research and development 6,576 15.1 % 5,653 16.1 % 5,722 15.2 % Marketing, general and administrative 6,309 14.5 % 7,931 22.6 % 5,452 14.6 % Restructuring and asset impairment charges % 231 0.6 % 710 1.9 % Amortization of acquisition related intangibles 18 % 35 0.1 % 6 % Operating income 15,588 35.7 % 5,711 16.3 % 8,954 23.8 % Gains (losses) on equity method investments, net 117 0.3 % (147 ) (0.4 )% (1,380 ) (3.7 )% Gains (losses) on other equity investments, net 231 0.5 % (23 ) (0.1 )% (376 ) (1.0 )% Interest and other, net 109 0.3 % 163 0.4 % 488 1.3 % Income before taxes 16,045 36.8 % 5,704 16.2 % 7,686 20.4 % Provision for taxes 4,581 10.5 % 1,335 3.8 % 2,394 6.3 % Net income $ 11,464 26.3 % $ 4,369 12.4 % $ 5,292 14.1 % Diluted earnings per common share $ 2.01 $ 0.77 $ 0.92 Geographic Breakdown of Revenue Our net revenue for 2010 increased $8.5 billion, or 24%, compared to 2009. The increase was due to higher microprocessor and chipset unit sales, as well as higher microprocessor average selling prices. Revenue in the Japan, Asia Pacific, Americas, and Europe regions increased by 31%, 29%, 21%, and 6%, respectively, compared to 2009. 31 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our overall gross margin dollars for 2010 increased $8.9 billion, or 46%, compared to 2009. The increase was primarily due to significantly higher revenue. To a lesser extent, excess capacity charges recorded in 2009 of $1.1 billion and lower platform (microprocessor and chipset) unit cost contributed to the increase in gross margin dollars for 2010 compared to 2009. These increases were partially offset by charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010 to repair and replace materials and systems impacted by a design issue related to our Intel 6 Series Express Chipset family. For further information, see Note 20: Chipset Design Issue in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Our overall gross margin percentage increased to 65.3% in 2010 from 55.7% in 2009. The increase in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the gross margin percentage increase in the PC Client Group operating segment and, to a lesser extent, gross margin percentage increases in the Data Center Group and NAND Solutions Group operating segments. We derived a substantial majority of our overall gross margin dollars in 2010 and 2009 from the sale of microprocessors in the PC Client Group and Data Center Group operating segments. See Business Outlook for a discussion of gross margin expectations. Our net revenue for 2009 decreased 7% compared to 2008. Average selling prices for microprocessors and chipsets decreased and microprocessor and chipset unit sales increased, compared to 2008, primarily due to the ramp of Intel Atom processors and chipsets, which generally have lower average selling prices than our other microprocessor and chipset products. Revenue from the sale of NOR flash memory products and communications products declined $740 million, primarily as a result of business divestitures. Additionally, an increase in revenue from the sale of NAND flash memory products was mostly offset by a decrease in revenue from the sale of wireless connectivity products. Revenue in the Asia Pacific region increased 2% compared to 2008, while revenue in the Europe, Japan, and Americas regions decreased by 26%, 15%, and 4%, respectively, compared to 2008. Our overall gross margin dollars for 2009 decreased $1.3 billion, or 6%, compared to 2008. The decrease was due to lower revenue, approximately $830 million of higher factory underutilization charges, and approximately $330 million of higher start up costs. These decreases were partially offset by lower platform unit cost and lower NAND flash memory unit cost. Our overall gross margin percentage increased slightly to 55.7% in 2009 from 55.5% in 2008. The slight increase in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the gross margin percentage increases in the NAND Solutions Group and Data Center Group operating segments, offset by the gross margin percentage decrease in the PC Client Group operating segment. We derived a substantial majority of our overall gross margin dollars in 2009, and most of our overall gross margin dollars in 2008, from the sales of microprocessors in the PC Client Group and Data Center Group operating segments. PC Client Group The revenue and operating income for the PC Client Group (PCCG) for the three years ended December 25, 2010 were as follows: (In Millions) 2010 2009 2008 Microprocessor revenue $ 24,721 $ 19,914 $ 21,516 Chipset, motherboard, and other revenue 6,877 6,261 6,450 Net revenue $ 31,598 $ 26,175 $ 27,966 Operating income $ 13,304 $ 7,585 $ 9,419 Net revenue for the PCCG operating segment increased by $5.4 billion, or 21%, in 2010 compared to 2009. Microprocessors and chipsets within PCCG include those designed for the notebook, netbook, and desktop computing market segments. Significantly higher notebook unit sales were the primary driver for the increase in microprocessor revenue. To a lesser extent, higher notebook average selling prices and higher desktop unit sales also contributed to the increase. The increase in chipset, motherboard, and other revenue was due to significantly higher chipset unit sales, partially offset by significantly lower revenue from the sale of wireless connectivity products. Operating income increased by $5.7 billion in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase in operating income was primarily due to significantly higher revenue. During 2009, PCCG recognized approximately $1.0 billion of excess capacity charges, primarily related to microprocessors and chipsets. Additionally, lower platform unit cost in 2010 contributed to the increase in operating income. These impacts were partially offset by charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010 to repair and replace materials and systems impacted by a design issue related to our Intel 6 Series Express Chipset family. Additionally, operating expenses in 2010 were higher compared to 2009. 32 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) For 2009, net revenue for the PCCG operating segment decreased by $1.8 billion, or 6%, compared to 2008. The decrease in microprocessor revenue was primarily due to lower notebook microprocessor average selling prices, and lower desktop microprocessor unit sales and average selling prices. These decreases were partially offset by a significant increase in netbook microprocessor unit sales due to the ramp of Intel Atom processors. The decrease in chipset, motherboard, and other revenue was primarily due to lower chipset average selling prices and lower unit sales of wireless connectivity products, partially offset by higher chipset unit sales. Operating income decreased by $1.8 billion, or 19%, in 2009 compared to 2008. The decrease was primarily due to lower revenue and approximately $810 million of higher factory underutilization charges, partially offset by lower platform unit cost. Data Center Group The revenue and operating income for the Data Center Group (DCG) for the three years ended December 25, 2010 were as follows: (In Millions) 2010 2009 2008 Microprocessor revenue $ 7,361 $ 5,301 $ 5,126 Chipset, motherboard, and other revenue 1,332 1,149 1,464 Net revenue $ 8,693 $ 6,450 $ 6,590 Operating income $ 4,395 $ 2,299 $ 2,135 Net revenue for the DCG operating segment increased by $2.2 billion, or 35%, in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase in microprocessor revenue was primarily due to significantly higher microprocessor unit sales and, to a lesser extent, higher microprocessor average selling prices. The increase in chipset, motherboard, and other revenue was due to significantly higher chipset unit sales and significantly higher revenue from the sale of wired connectivity products. Operating income increased by $2.1 billion in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase in operating income was due to significantly higher revenue and, to a lesser extent, lower chipset unit cost. For 2009, net revenue for the DCG operating segment decreased slightly by $140 million, or 2%, compared to 2008. The increase in microprocessor revenue was due to higher microprocessor average selling prices, partially offset by lower microprocessor unit sales. The decrease in chipset, motherboard, and other revenue was primarily due to lower chipset average selling prices. Operating income increased by $164 million, or 8%, compared to 2008. The increase in operating income was primarily due to higher microprocessor revenue and lower operating expenses, partially offset by approximately $150 million of higher start up costs as well as lower chipset revenue. Other Intel Architecture Operating Segments The revenue and operating income for the other Intel architecture (Other IA) operating segments, including the Embedded and Communications Group (ECG), the Digital Home Group, and the Ultra Mobility Group, for the three years ended December 25, 2010 were as follows: (In Millions) 2010 2009 2008 Net revenue $ 1,784 $ 1,402 $ 1,763 Operating income (loss) $ (60 ) $ (179 ) $ (63 ) Net revenue for the Other IA operating segments increased by $382 million, or 27%, in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase was primarily due to significantly higher revenue within ECG from significantly higher microprocessor and chipset unit sales. Operating loss decreased by $119 million in 2010 compared to 2009. The operating loss decrease was primarily due to significantly higher ECG revenue and lower ECG unit cost, partially offset by higher operating expenses in ECG and the Ultra Mobility Group. For 2009, net revenue for the Other IA operating segments decreased by $361 million, or 20%, compared to 2008, and operating loss for the Other IA operating segments increased by $116 million in 2009 compared to 2008. The changes were primarily due to lower revenue from the sale of communications products within ECG, primarily as a result of business divestitures. 33 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the three years ended December 25, 2010 were as follows: (In Millions) 2010 2009 2008 Research and development $ 6,576 $ 5,653 $ 5,722 Marketing, general and administrative $ 6,309 $ 7,931 $ 5,452 Restructuring and asset impairment charges $ $ 231 $ 710 Amortization of acquisition related intangibles $ 18 $ 35 $ 6 Research and Development. RD spending increased by $923 million, or 16%, in 2010 compared to 2009, and was flat in 2009 compared to 2008. The increase in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to higher profit dependent compensation, an increase in employees, and higher process development costs as we transitioned from manufacturing start up costs related to our 32nm process technology to RD of our next generation 22nm process technology. In 2009 compared to 2008, we had lower process development costs as we transitioned from RD to manufacturing using our 32nm process technology. This decrease was offset by higher profit dependent compensation. Marketing, General and Administrative. Marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased $1.6 billion, or 20%, in 2010 compared to 2009, and increased $2.5 billion, or 45%, in 2009 compared to 2008. The decrease in 2010 was due to the 2009 charge of $1.447 billion incurred as a result of the fine imposed by the European Commission (EC) and the $1.25 billion payment to AMD in 2009 as part of a settlement agreement. These decreases were partially offset by higher advertising expenses (including cooperative advertising expenses), higher profit dependent compensation, and, to a lesser extent, expenses related to our Wind River Software Group operating segment and an expense of $100 million recognized during the fourth quarter of 2010 due to a patent cross license agreement that we entered into with NVIDIA in January 2011 (see Note 29: Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K). The increase in 2009 compared to 2008 was due to the 2009 charge incurred as a result of the fine imposed by the EC and the payment to AMD in 2009 as part of a settlement agreement. To a lesser extent, we had higher profit dependent compensation expenses that were partially offset by lower advertising expenses (including cooperative advertising expenses). RD, combined with marketing, general and administrative expenses, were 30% of net revenue in 2010, 39% of net revenue in 2009, and 30% of net revenue in 2008. Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges. The following table summarizes restructuring and asset impairment charges by plan for the three years ended December 25, 2010: (In Millions) 2010 2009 2008 2009 restructuring program $ $ 215 $ 2008 NAND plan 215 2006 efficiency program 16 495 Total restructuring and asset impairment charges $ $ 231 $ 710 2009 Restructuring Program In the first quarter of 2009, management approved plans to restructure some of our manufacturing and assembly and test operations. These plans included closing two assembly and test facilities in Malaysia, one facility in the Philippines, and one facility in China; stopping production at a 200mm wafer fabrication facility in Oregon; and ending production at our 200mm wafer fabrication facility in California. The 2009 restructuring program is complete. The following table summarizes charges for the 2009 restructuring program for the two years ended December 25, 2010: (In Millions) 2010 2009 Employee severance and benefit arrangements $ $ 208 Asset impairments 7 Total restructuring and asset impairment charges $ $ 215 34 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table summarizes the restructuring and asset impairment activity for the 2009 restructuring program during 2009 and 2010: Employee Severance and Asset (In Millions) Benefits Impairments Total Accrued restructuring balance as of December 27, 2008 $ $ $ Additional accruals 223 7 230 Adjustments (15 ) (15 ) Cash payments (182 ) (182 ) Non cash settlements (7 ) (7 ) Accrued restructuring balance as of December 26, 2009 $ 26 $ $ 26 Additional accruals Adjustments Cash payments (26 ) (26 ) Non cash settlements Accrued restructuring balance as of December 25, 2010 $ $ $ Under the 2009 restructuring program, we incurred $208 million of charges related to employee severance and benefit arrangements for approximately 6,500 employees. Most of these employee actions occurred within manufacturing. We estimate that these employee severance and benefit charges result in gross annual savings of approximately $290 million. We are realizing a substantial majority of these savings within cost of sales. 2008 NAND Plan In the fourth quarter of 2008, management approved a plan with Micron to discontinue the supply of NAND flash memory from the 200mm facility within the IMFT manufacturing network. The agreement resulted in a $215 million restructuring charge, primarily related to the IMFT 200mm supply agreement. The restructuring charge resulted in a reduction of our investment in IMFT/IMFS of $184 million, a cash payment to Micron of $24 million, and other cash payments of $7 million. The 2008 NAND plan was completed at the end of 2008. 2006 Efficiency Program In the third quarter of 2006, management approved several actions as part of a restructuring plan designed to improve operational efficiency and financial results. The following table summarizes charges for the 2006 efficiency program for the three years ended December 25, 2010: (In Millions) 2010 2009 2008 Employee severance and benefit arrangements $ $ 8 $ 151 Asset impairments 8 344 Total restructuring and asset impairment charges $ $ 16 $ 495 During 2006, as part of our assessment of our worldwide manufacturing capacity operations, we placed for sale our fabrication facility in Colorado Springs, Colorado. As a result of placing the facility for sale, in 2006 we recorded a $214 million impairment charge to write down to fair value the land, building, and equipment. We incurred $54 million in additional asset impairment charges as a result of market conditions related to the Colorado Springs facility during 2007 and additional charges in 2008. We sold the Colorado Springs facility in 2009. We incurred $85 million in asset impairment charges related to assets that we sold in conjunction with the divestiture of our NOR flash memory business in 2007 and an additional $275 million in 2008. We determined the impairment charges based on the fair value, less selling costs, that we expected to receive upon completion of the divestiture in 2007, and determined the impairment charges based on the revised fair value of the equity and note receivable that we received upon completion of the divestiture, less selling costs, in 2008. For further information on this divestiture, see Note 16: Divestitures in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. 35 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table summarizes the restructuring and asset impairment activity for the 2006 efficiency program during 2009: Employee Severance and Asset (In Millions) Benefits Impairments Total Accrued restructuring balance as of December 27, 2008 $ 57 $ $ 57 Additional accruals 18 8 26 Adjustments (10 ) (10 ) Cash payments (65 ) (65 ) Non cash settlements (8 ) (8 ) Accrued restructuring balance as of December 26, 2009 $ $ $ The 2006 efficiency program is complete. From the third quarter of 2006 through 2009, we incurred a total of $1.6 billion in restructuring and asset impairment charges related to this program. These charges included a total of $686 million related to employee severance and benefit arrangements for 11,300 employees. A substantial majority of these employee actions affected employees within manufacturing, information technology, and marketing. The restructuring and asset impairment charges also included $896 million in asset impairment charges. Share Based Compensation Share based compensation totaled $917 million in 2010 ($889 million in 2009 and $851 million in 2008). Share based compensation was included in cost of sales and operating expenses. As of December 25, 2010, unrecognized share based compensation costs and the weighted average periods over which the costs are expected to be recognized were as follows: Unrecognized Share Based Weighted Compensation Average (Dollars in Millions) Costs Period Stock options $ 220 1.2 years Restricted stock units $ 1,210 1.3 years Stock purchase plan $ 13 1 month Gains (Losses) on Equity Method Investments, Net Gains (losses) on equity method investments, net were as follows: (In Millions) 2010 2009 2008 Equity method losses, net $ (113 ) $ (131 ) $ (316 ) Impairment charges (16 ) (42 ) (1,077 ) Other, net 246 26 13 Total gains (losses) on equity method investments, net $ 117 $ (147 ) $ (1,380 ) We recognized higher gains on sales, lower impairment charges, and lower equity method losses in 2010 compared to 2009. During 2010, we recognized a gain of $33 million on the initial public offering of SMART Technologies, Inc., included within Equity method losses, net, and a gain of $148 million on the subsequent sale of our shares in the secondary offering, included in Other, net, resulting in a total gain of $181 million. We also recognized a gain of $91 million on the sale of our ownership interest in Numonyx B.V., included in Other, net. Equity method losses, net also includes Clearwire LLC ($116 million loss in 2010 and $27 million loss in 2009), Numonyx ($42 million gain in 2010, $31 million loss in 2009, and $87 million loss in 2008), and Clearwire Corporation ($184 million loss in 2008). For further information, see Note 11: Equity Method and Cost Method Investments in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. 36 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Impairment charges in 2008 included a $762 million impairment charge recognized on our investment in Clearwire LLC and a $250 million impairment charge recognized on our investment in Numonyx. We recognized the impairment charge on our investment in Clearwire LLC to write down our investment to its fair value, primarily due to the fair value being significantly lower than the cost basis of our investment in the fourth quarter of 2008. The impairment charge on our investment in Numonyx was due to a general decline in 2008 in the NOR flash memory market segment. See Note 11: Equity Method and Cost Method Investments in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Gains (Losses) on Other Equity Investments, Net Gains (losses) on other equity investments, net were as follows: (In Millions) 2010 2009 2008 Impairment charges $ (109 ) $ (179 ) $ (455 ) Gains on sales, net 185 55 60 Other, net 155 101 19 Total gains (losses) on other equity investments, net $ 231 $ (23 ) $ (376 ) We recognized higher gains on third party merger transactions, primarily related to our cost method investments; higher gains on sales; and lower impairment charges in 2010 compared to 2009. Gains on other equity investments in 2010 included a gain of $67 million on the sale of shares in Micron, which occurred in the first quarter of 2010. Impairment charges in 2008 included a $176 million impairment charge recognized on our investment in Clearwire Corporation and $97 million of impairment charges on our investment in Micron. The impairment charge on our investment in Clearwire Corporation was due to the fair value being significantly lower than the cost basis of our investment at the end of the fourth quarter of 2008. The impairment charges on our investment in Micron reflected the difference between our cost basis and the fair value of our investment in Micron at the end of the second and third quarters of 2008. In addition, we recognized higher gains on equity derivatives in 2009 compared to 2008. Interest and Other, Net The components of interest and other, net were as follows: (In Millions) 2010 2009 2008 Interest income $ 119 $ 168 $ 592 Interest expense (1 ) (8 ) Other, net (10 ) (4 ) (96 ) Total interest and other, net $ 109 $ 163 $ 488 Interest income was lower in 2010 compared to 2009 as a result of lower average interest rates, partially offset by higher average investment balances. The average interest rate earned during 2010 decreased by approximately 0.5 percentage points compared to 2009. In addition, lower fair value gains on our trading assets (zero in 2010 and $70 million in 2009) were partially offset by lower exchange rate losses (zero in 2010 and $40 million in 2009). Exchange rate losses in 2009 were due to euro exposure related to our euro denominated liability for the EC fine. We recognized lower interest income in 2009 compared to 2008 as a result of lower interest rates. The average interest rate earned during 2009 decreased by 2.4 percentage points compared to 2008. In addition, lower gains on divestitures (zero in 2009 and $59 million in 2008) were more than offset by $70 million of fair value gains in 2009 on our trading assets, compared to $130 million of fair value losses in 2008. 37 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Provision for Taxes Our provision for taxes and effective tax rate were as follows: (Dollars in Millions) 2010 2009 2008 Income before taxes $ 16,045 $ 5,704 $ 7,686 Provision for taxes $ 4,581 $ 1,335 $ 2,394 Effective tax rate 28.6 % 23.4 % 31.1 % We generated a higher percentage of our profits from higher tax jurisdictions in 2010 compared to 2009, negatively impacting our effective tax rate for 2010. The effective tax rate for 2009 was positively impacted by the reversal of previously accrued taxes of $366 million on settlements, effective settlements, and related remeasurements of various uncertain tax positions. These impacts were partially offset by the recognition of the EC fine of $1.447 billion in 2009, which was not tax deductible and therefore significantly increased our effective tax rate for 2009. For further information on the EC fine, see Note 29: Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. We generated a higher percentage of our profits from lower tax jurisdictions in 2009 compared to 2008, positively impacting our effective tax rate for 2009. In addition, the 2009 tax rate was positively impacted by the reversal of previously accrued taxes of $366 million on settlements, effective settlements, and related remeasurements of various uncertain tax positions compared to a reversal of $103 million for such matters in 2008. These impacts were partially offset by the recognition of the EC fine. In addition, our 2008 effective tax rate was negatively impacted by the recognition of a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of realizing tax benefits related to impairments of our equity investments. Business Outlook Our future results of operations and the topics of other forward looking statements contained in this Form 10 K, including this MDA, involve a number of risks and uncertainties in particular: changes in business and economic conditions; revenue and pricing; gross margin and costs; pending legal proceedings; our effective tax rate; marketing, general and administrative expenses; our goals and strategies; new product introductions, and product defects and errata; plans to cultivate new businesses; RD expenses; divestitures, acquisitions, or similar transactions; net gains (losses) from equity investments; interest and other, net; capital spending; depreciation; and impairment of investments. Our business outlook incorporates financial projections and assumptions concerning the performance of McAfee, which we expect to acquire in the first quarter of 2011, and the recently acquired WLS business of Infineon (see Note 15: Acquisitions in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K). Because we are required to make a number of assumptions about the future performance of these businesses, it may be more difficult to accurately project our financial results. Some of these assumptions include the prospects for the acquired businesses products and markets, the ability to retain customer relationships and key employees, successful integration of key technologies or operations, and the potential for unexpected liabilities. In addition, as we integrate these businesses into our operations, our understanding of the financial and operational performance of the acquired businesses may change, which could require an update to our business outlook. Our business outlook contains forward looking statements and projections based upon estimates of the impact of the chipset design issue related to our Intel 6 Series Express Chipset family (see Note 20: Chipset Design Issue in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K) on our future financial and operating results, including on revenue, gross margin, and inventory valuation, based on our preliminary analysis. Among the factors related to the chipset design issue that could cause actual results to differ are the number of units that may be affected, the impact on systems in the market, the costs that we may incur in repairing or replacing impacted components, the extent to which customers purchase parts from our competitors as a result of our parts shortages or otherwise, the extent of shipments of impacted chipsets for use in PC system configurations that would not be impacted by the design issue, and the extent to which we are able to increase production of substitute or redesigned parts for customers. In addition to the various important factors discussed above, a number of other important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10 K. 38 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our expectations for 2011 are as follows: Revenue. We expect a 2011 revenue growth percentage in the mid to high teens. Gross Margin Percentage. 63%, plus or minus a few percentage points. The 63% midpoint is lower compared to our 2010 gross margin of 65.3%, primarily due to higher manufacturing period costs, mostly start up costs, as well as the impacts of the recently completed acquisition of the WLS business of Infineon and the expected acquisition of McAfee in the first quarter of 2011. We expect these decreases to be partially offset by lower platform unit cost and higher platform revenue. Total Spending. We expect spending on RD, plus marketing, general and administrative expenses, in 2011 to be approximately $15.7 billion, plus or minus $200 million, compared to $12.9 billion in 2010. Research and Development Spending. Approximately $8.2 billion compared to $6.6 billion in 2010 as we continue to ramp our new 22nm process technology. Capital Spending. $9.0 billion, plus or minus $300 million, compared to $5.2 billion in 2010. We expect capital spending for 2011 to primarily consist of investments in 22nm process technology. Depreciation. Approximately $5.0 billion, plus or minus $100 million, compared to $4.4 billion in 2010. Tax Rate. Approximately 29%, flat compared to 29% in 2010. The estimated effective tax rate is based on tax law in effect as of December 25, 2010 and expected income. Status of Business Outlook We expect that our corporate representatives will, from time to time, meet privately with investors, investment analysts, the media, and others, and may reiterate the forward looking statements contained in the Business Outlook section and elsewhere in this Form 10 K, including any such statements that are incorporated by reference in this Form 10 K. At the same time, we will keep this Form 10 K and our most current business outlook publicly available on our Investor Relations web site at www.intc.com. The public can continue to rely on the business outlook published on our web site as representing our current expectations on matters covered, unless we publish a notice stating otherwise. The statements in the Business Outlook section and other forward looking statements in this Form 10 K are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and SEC filings and at other times. From the close of business on March 4, 2011 until our quarterly earnings release is published, presently scheduled for April 19, 2011, we will observe a quiet period. During the quiet period, the Business Outlook section and other forward looking statements first published in our Form 8 K filed on January 13, 2011, as updated in our Form 8 K filed on January 31, 2011, and as reiterated or updated as applicable in this Form 10 K, should be considered historical, speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update. During the quiet period, our representatives will not comment on our business outlook or our financial results or expectations. The exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period, and any others that we utilize from time to time, may vary at our discretion. 39 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Liquidity and Capital Resources Dec. 25, Dec. 26, (Dollars in Millions) 2010 2009 Cash and cash equivalents, marketable debt instruments included in trading assets, and short term investments $ 21,497 $ 13,920 Loans receivable and other long term investments $ 3,876 $ 4,528 Short term and long term debt $ 2,115 $ 2,221 Debt as % of stockholders equity 4.3 % 5.3 % Sources and Uses of Cash (In Millions) In summary, our cash flows were as follows: (In Millions) 2010 2009 2008 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 16,692 $ 11,170 $ 10,926 Net cash used for investing activities (10,539 ) (7,965 ) (5,865 ) Net cash used for financing activities (4,642 ) (2,568 ) (9,018 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 1,511 $ 637 $ (3,957 ) 40 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non cash items and changes in certain assets and liabilities. For 2010 compared to 2009, the $5.5 billion increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to higher net income, partially offset by adjustments for non cash items. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, in 2010 compared to 2009 were $3.7 billion higher, primarily due to higher income before taxes in 2010. Changes in assets and liabilities as of December 25, 2010 compared to December 26, 2009 included the following: Inventories increased due to higher microprocessor inventory, primarily due to ramping new products. Accounts receivable increased due to a higher proportion of sales at the end of the fourth quarter of 2010. Accounts payable increased due to timing of payments. For 2010 and 2009, our two largest customers accounted for 38% of our net revenue, with one of these customers accounting for 21% of our net revenue in 2010 and 2009, and another customer accounting for 17% of our net revenue in 2010 and 2009. These two largest customers accounted for 44% of our accounts receivable as of December 25, 2010 (41% as of December 26, 2009). For 2009 compared to 2008, the $244 million increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to changes in assets and liabilities, partially offset by lower net income. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, in 2009 compared to 2008 were $3.1 billion lower, primarily due to lower income before taxes and timing of payments. Investing Activities Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures, net investment purchases, maturities, disposals, and cash used for acquisitions. The increase in cash used for investing activities in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to an increase in net purchases of available for sale investments and, to a lesser extent, higher capital expenditures ($5.2 billion in 2010 and $4.5 billion in 2009). These increases were partially offset by a decrease in net purchases of trading assets and lower cash paid for acquisitions. The increase in cash used for investing activities in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to an increase in net purchases of available for sale investments and trading assets, and higher cash paid for acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in investments in non marketable equity investments. Our investments in non marketable equity investments in 2008 included $1.0 billion for an ownership interest in Clearwire LLC. Financing Activities Financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of long term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans. The increase in cash used in financing activities in 2010 compared to 2009 was due to the issuance of long term debt in 2009. During 2010, we repurchased $1.7 billion of common stock compared to $1.8 billion in 2009. As of December 25, 2010, $4.2 billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization of $25 billion. In January 2011, our Board of Directors increased the repurchase authorization limit by $10 billion. We base our level of common stock repurchases on internal cash management decisions, and this level may fluctuate. Proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans totaled $587 million in 2010 compared to $400 million in 2009. Our total dividend payments were $3.5 billion in 2010 compared to $3.1 billion in 2009 as a result of an increase in quarterly cash dividends per common share. We have paid a cash dividend in each of the past 73 quarters. In January 2011, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.1812 per common share for the first quarter of 2011. The dividend is payable on March 1, 2011 to stockholders of record on February 7, 2011. The decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to a decrease in repurchases of common stock and the issuance of long term debt, partially offset by lower proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans. We used the majority of the proceeds from the 2009 issuance of long term debt to repurchase common stock. 41 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Liquidity Cash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity. As of December 25, 2010, cash and cash equivalents, marketable debt instruments included in trading assets, and short term investments totaled $21.5 billion. In addition to the $21.5 billion, we have $3.9 billion in loans receivable and other long term investments that we include when assessing our investment portfolio. In the first quarter of 2011, we completed the acquisition of the WLS business of Infineon. Total net cash consideration for the acquisition is estimated at $1.4 billion. For further information, see Note 15: Acquisitions in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are with A/A2 or better rated issuers, and a substantial majority of the issuers are rated AA /Aa3 or better. Our commercial paper program provides another potential source of liquidity. We have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $3.0 billion, including through the issuance of commercial paper. Maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during 2010 were $150 million, although no commercial paper remained outstanding as of December 25, 2010. Our commercial paper was rated A 1+ by Standard Poors and P 1 by Moodys as of December 25, 2010. We also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. We believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet our business requirements for the next 12 months, including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test; working capital requirements; and potential dividends, common stock repurchases, and acquisitions or strategic investments. Fair Value of Financial Instruments When determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and we consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. For further information, see Fair Value in Note 2: Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Credit risk is factored into the valuation of financial instruments that we measure and record at fair value on a recurring basis. When fair value is determined using pricing models, such as a discounted cash flow model, the issuers credit risk and or Intels credit risk is factored into the calculation of the fair value, as appropriate. Marketable Debt Instruments As of December 25, 2010, our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $24 billion of marketable debt instruments. Of these instruments, $7 billion was classified as Level 1, $16.7 billion as Level 2, and $308 million as Level 3. Our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 1 was classified as such due to the use of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets. Management judgment was required to determine the levels for the frequency of transactions that should be met for a market to be considered active. Our assessment of an active market for our marketable debt instruments generally takes into consideration the number of days each individual instrument trades over a specified period. Of the $16.7 billion balance of marketable debt instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 2, approximately 45% of the balance was classified as Level 2 due to the use of a discounted cash flow model and approximately 55% due to the use of non binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data. Our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as Level 3 were classified as such due to the lack of observable market data to corroborate either the non binding market consensus prices or the non binding broker quotes. When observable market data is not available, we corroborate the non binding market consensus prices and non binding broker quotes using unobservable data, if available. 42 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Equity Securities As of December 25, 2010, our portfolio of assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included $1.4 billion of marketable equity securities. Of these securities, $1.2 billion was classified as Level 1 because the valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets. Our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity securities generally takes into consideration the number of days that each individual equity security trades over a specified period. The remaining marketable equity securities of $223 million were classified as Level 2 because their valuations were either adjusted for security specific restrictions or based on quoted prices for identical securities in less active markets. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 25, 2010: Payments Due by Period Less Than More Than (In Millions) Total 1 Year 13 Years 35 Years 5 Years Operating lease obligations $ 327 $ 102 $ 142 $ 52 $ 31 Capital purchase obligations1 4,576 4,260 316 Other purchase obligations and commitments2 567 393 106 65 3 Long term debt obligations3 6,969 119 238 238 6,374 Other long term liabilities4, 5 701 252 184 133 132 Total6 $ 13,140 $ 5,126 $ 986 $ 488 $ 6,540 1 Capital purchase obligations represent commitments for the construction or purchase of property, plant and equipment. They were not recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 25, 2010, as we had not yet received the related goods or taken title to the property. 2 Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses and agreements to purchase raw materials or other goods, as well as payments due under non contingent funding obligations. Funding obligations include, for example, agreements to fund various projects with other companies. 3 Amounts represent principal and interest cash payments over the life of the debt obligations, including anticipated interest payments that are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. Any future settlement of convertible debt would impact our cash payments. 4 We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions; therefore, $190 million of long term income taxes payable has been excluded from the preceding table. However, long term income taxes payable, included on our consolidated balance sheet, included these uncertain tax positions, reduced by the associated federal deduction for state taxes and U.S. tax credits arising from non U.S. income. 5 Amounts represent future cash payments to satisfy other long term liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, including the short term portion of these long term liabilities. Expected contributions to our U.S. and non U.S. pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans of $56 million to be made during 2011 are also included; however, funding projections beyond 2011 are not practical to estimate. 6 Total generally excludes contractual obligations already recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as current liabilities. Contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services include agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on Intel and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the non cancelable portion of the agreement terms and or the minimum cancellation fee. We have entered into certain agreements for the purchase of raw materials that specify minimum prices and quantities based on a percentage of the total available market or based on a percentage of our future purchasing requirements. Due to the uncertainty of the future market and our future purchasing requirements, as well as the non binding nature of these agreements, obligations under these agreements are not included in the preceding table. Our purchase orders for other products are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. In addition, some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. 43 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones are not included in the preceding table. These obligations include contingent funding/payment obligations and milestone based equity investment funding. These arrangements are not considered contractual obligations until the milestone is met by the third party. Assuming that all future milestones are met, additional required payments related to these obligations were not significant as of December 25, 2010. For the majority of restricted stock units granted, the number of shares issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees. The obligation to pay the relative taxing authority is not included in the preceding table, as the amount is contingent upon continued employment. In addition, the amount of the obligation is unknown, as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest. We have a contractual obligation to purchase the output of IMFT in proportion to our investment, which was 49% as of December 25, 2010. We also have several agreements with Micron related to intellectual property rights, and RD funding related to NAND flash manufacturing. The obligation to purchase our proportion of IMFTs inventory was approximately $100 million as of December 25, 2010. See Note 11: Equity Method and Cost Method Investments in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. In January 2011, we entered into a patent cross license agreement with NVIDIA. We agreed to make payments totaling $1.5 billion to NVIDIA over six years ($300 million in each of January 2011, 2012, and 2013; and $200 million in each of January 2014, 2015, and 2016). For further information, see Note 29: Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. During 2010, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all outstanding common shares of McAfee for $48.00 per share in cash to be paid to the stockholders of McAfee. As of the date that we entered into the agreement, the transaction had an approximate value of $7.68 billion. We expect to complete the acquisition in the first quarter of 2011. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions. For further information, see Note 15: Acquisitions in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. During 2010, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the WLS business of Infineon. In the first quarter of 2011, we completed the acquisition. Total net cash consideration for the acquisition is estimated at $1.4 billion. For further information, see Note 15: Acquisitions in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The expected timing of payments of the obligations above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 25, 2010, we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S K. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage currency exchange rate and interest rate risk, and, to a lesser extent, equity market and commodity price risk. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions as of December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009. Actual results may differ materially. Currency Exchange Rates In general, we economically hedge currency risks of non U.S. dollar denominated investments in debt instruments and loans receivable with offsetting currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps. Gains and losses on these non U.S. currency investments would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments, resulting in a negligible net exposure to loss. Substantially all of our revenue is transacted in U.S. dollars. However, a significant amount of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies, primarily the Japanese yen, the euro, and the Israeli shekel. We have established balance sheet and forecasted transaction currency risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in fair value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates. We generally utilize currency forward contracts and, to a lesser extent, currency options in these hedging programs. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements (see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10 K). We considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that a weighted average adverse change of 20% in currency exchange rates could be experienced in the near term. Such an adverse change, after taking into account hedges and offsetting positions, would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than $35 million as of December 25, 2010 (less than $40 million as of December 26, 2009). Interest Rates We generally hedge interest rate risks of fixed rate debt instruments with offsetting interest rate swaps. Gains and losses on these investments would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments, resulting in a negligible net exposure to interest rate loss. We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio and debt issuances. We refer to our combined investment portfolio, investment hedges, and debt issuances as our net investment position. The primary objective of our investments in debt instruments is to preserve principal while maximizing yields. To achieve this objective, the returns on our investments in debt instruments are generally based on the U.S. dollar three month LIBOR. A hypothetical decrease in interest rates of 1.0% would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our debt issuances of approximately $235 million as of December 25, 2010 (an increase of approximately $205 million as of December 26, 2009). A hypothetical decrease in interest rates of up to 1.0%, after taking into account investment hedges, would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our investment portfolio of up to approximately $15 million as of December 25, 2010 (an increase of approximately $10 million as of December 26, 2009). These hypothetical decreases in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our net investment position of approximately $220 million as of December 25, 2010 (a decrease of $195 million as of December 26, 2009). The fluctuations in fair value of our net investment position reflect only the direct impact of the change in interest rates. Other economic variables, such as equity market fluctuations and changes in relative credit risk, could result in a significantly higher decline in our net investment position. For further information on how credit risk is factored into the valuation of our investment portfolio and debt issuances, see Fair Value of Financial Instruments in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10 K. Equity Prices Our marketable equity investments include marketable equity securities and equity derivative instruments such as warrants and options. To the extent that our marketable equity securities have strategic value, we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our equity market exposure through hedging activities; however, for our investments in strategic equity derivative instruments, we may enter into transactions to reduce or eliminate the equity market risks. For securities that we no longer consider strategic, we evaluate legal, market, and economic factors in our decision on the timing of disposal, and whether it is possible and appropriate to hedge the equity market risk. We hold derivative instruments that seek to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements. The gains and losses from changes in fair value of these derivatives are designed to offset the gains and losses on the related liabilities, resulting in an insignificant net exposure to loss. 45 Table of Contents As of December 25, 2010, the fair value of our marketable equity investments and our equity derivative instruments, including hedging positions, was $1.5 billion ($805 million as of December 26, 2009). Our marketable equity investments include our investments in Micron, Imagination Technologies Group PLC, VMware, Inc., and Clearwire Corporation, and were carried at a total fair market value of $968 million, or 65% of our marketable equity portfolio, as of December 25, 2010. Our marketable equity method investment in SMART is excluded from our analysis, as the carrying value does not fluctuate based on market price changes unless an other than temporary impairment is deemed necessary. To determine reasonably possible decreases in the market value of our marketable equity investments, we analyzed the expected market price sensitivity of our marketable equity investment portfolio. Assuming a loss of 40% in market prices, and after reflecting the impact of hedges and offsetting positions, the aggregate value of our marketable equity investments could decrease by approximately $365 million, based on the value as of December 25, 2010 (a decrease in value of approximately $405 million, based on the value as of December 26, 2009 using an assumed loss of 50%). Many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our non marketable equity investments, although we cannot always quantify the impact directly. Financial markets are volatile, which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in, their ability to raise additional capital, and the likelihood of our being able to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, mergers, and private sales. These types of investments involve a great deal of risk, and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful; consequently, we could lose all or part of our investment. Our non marketable equity investments, excluding investments accounted for under the equity method, had a carrying amount of $872 million as of December 25, 2010 ($939 million as of December 26, 2009). As of December 25, 2010, the carrying amount of our non marketable equity method investments was $1.8 billion ($2.5 billion as of December 26, 2009). A substantial majority of this balance as of December 25, 2010 was concentrated in our IMFT/IMFS investment of $1.5 billion ($1.6 billion as of December 26, 2009). Our investments as of December 26, 2009 also included an investment of $453 million in Numonyx, which was sold in 2010. For further information, see Note 11: Equity Method and Cost Method Investments in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10 K. 46 Table of Contents
