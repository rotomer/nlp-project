ITEM 7 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NOTE: For a more complete understanding of our financial condition and results of operations, and some of the risks that could affect future results, see Risks That Could Affect Future Results in this Item 7. This section should also be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes in Item 8. As discussed below, we sold our Quicken Loans mortgage business in July 2002 and our Japanese subsidiary, Intuit KK, in February 2003 and accounted for the sales of these businesses as discontinued operations. Accordingly, we have reclassified our financial statements for all periods prior to the sales to reflect these businesses as discontinued operations. Unless otherwise noted, the following discussion pertains only to our continuing operations. Results of Operations The following table shows trends in our total net revenue and net income (loss) for the past three fiscal years.

Overview Intuits Mission. Our mission is to transform the way people run their businesses and manage their financial lives. Our products and services fall into the following principal categories: QuickBooks small business accounting and business management solutions; small business products and services that include payroll, financial supplies, technical support and information technology management solutions; TurboTax consumer tax products and services; ProSeries and Lacerte professional tax products and services; Intuit branded business management solutions designed to meet the specialized requirements of businesses in selected industries (which we call Verticals); and our other businesses, which consist primarily of Quicken personal finance products and services and our Canadian business. See Net Revenue below and Note 11 of the financial statements for more information about our business segments. Expanding Product and Service Offerings. During the last year, we have expanded the number and complexity of the products and services that we offer. Under our Right for My Business strategy, we are introducing solutions to meet the specialized requirements of certain small businesses by developing industry specific versions of QuickBooks, which we call flavors. We have introduced new versions of QuickBooks for companies that, due to their larger size or complexity, have more demanding accounting needs. We have also introduced business solutions that go beyond accounting software to address a wider range of business management challenges that small businesses face. In addition, we are acquiring companies that offer robust business management solutions to businesses in selected vertical industries. We expect to continue to expand in these directions over the next several years. Evolving Distribution Channels. We have been expanding our distribution channels to accommodate the expansion of the markets we serve and the range of products and services we offer our target customers. In the retail channel, we are selling an increasing proportion of our software products directly to a variety of retailers rather than through a few major distributors. As we offer software products that are more complex and higher priced than our traditional retail software products, we expect that direct sales will become an increasingly important source of revenue and new customers. Finally, as we add products and services that are complementary to our core products, we are focusing on strengthening our cross selling capabilities. We expect that these increased capabilities will allow us to generate additional revenue from our existing customers, particularly our small business customers. 25 Table of Contents Seasonality. Our tax businesses, and to a lesser extent our small business products and services, are highly seasonal. Sales of tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from November through April. These seasonal patterns mean that our total net revenue is usually highest during our second and third quarters ending January 31 and April 30. Since fiscal 2000, we have recognized an increasing portion of our Consumer Tax annual revenue during the third quarter compared to the second quarter, and that trend continued during fiscal 2003. We typically report losses in our first and fourth quarters ending October 31 and July 31 when revenue from our tax businesses is minimal, while operating expenses to develop new products and services continue at relatively consistent levels. Impact of Acquisitions. Our acquisitions of businesses and assets have affected the comparability of our results. During the past three fiscal years, we have completed several acquisitions, which have affected the comparability of revenue and operating results for those years. The amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets we have acquired in connection with acquisitions has also had a significant impact on our operating results, and on the comparability of results for those years. During fiscal 2001 and 2002, we recorded amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets and other acquisition related charges of $247.8 million and $181.4 million, which included impairment charges of $78.7 million and $22.0 million. Starting with the first quarter of fiscal 2003, we no longer amortize goodwill in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. As a result, our acquisition related charges decreased significantly during fiscal 2003, to $33.9 million. There were no impairment charges in fiscal 2003. It is possible that in the future we may incur impairment charges related to existing goodwill, as well as to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions. At July 31, 2003, we had $591.1 million in goodwill and $125.4 million in intangible assets on our balance sheet. See Notes 1 and 4 of the financial statements for more information regarding our goodwill and intangible assets and the impact of impairment charges on our reported net income or loss. Critical Accounting Policies In preparing our financial statements, we make estimates, assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue, operating income or loss and net income or loss, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Senior management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and their disclosure in this Report with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Net Revenue Revenue Recognition. Intuit derives revenues from the sale of packaged software products, product support, professional services, outsourced payroll services and multiple element arrangements that may include any combination of these items. We follow the appropriate revenue recognition rules for each type of revenue. See Note 1 of the financial statements, Net Revenue. We generally recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable. However, determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report. For example, for multiple element arrangements we must make assumptions and judgments in order to allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver, to determine whether undelivered services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services, to determine whether vendor specific evidence of fair value exists for each undelivered element and to determine whether and when each element has been delivered. If we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments, it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period. Amounts invoiced relating to arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized as the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied. Net Revenue Return and Rebate Reserves. As part of our revenue recognition policy, we estimate future product returns and rebate payments and establish reserves against revenue at the time of sale based on these estimates. Our return policy allows distributors and retailers, subject to certain contractual limitations, to return purchased products. For product returns reserves, we consider such factors as the volume and price mix of products in the retail channel, historical return rates for prior releases of the 26 Table of Contents product, trends in retailer inventory and economic trends that might impact customer demand for our products (including the competitive environment and the timing of new releases of our products). We fully reserve for obsolete products in the distribution channels. Our rebate reserves include distributor and retailer sales incentive rebates and end user rebates. Our estimated reserves for distributor and retailer incentive rebates are based on distributors and retailers actual performance against the terms and conditions of rebate programs, which we typically establish annually. Our reserves for end user rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the specific promotional rebate program, actual sales during the promotion, the amount of redemptions received and historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program. In the past, actual returns and rebates have approximated and not generally exceeded the reserves that we have established. However, actual returns and rebates in any future period are inherently uncertain. If we were to change our assumptions and estimates, our revenue reserves would change, which would impact the net revenue we report. If actual returns and rebates are significantly greater than the reserves we have established, the actual results would decrease our future reported revenue. Conversely, if actual returns and rebates are significantly less than our reserves, this would increase our future reported revenue. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. We make ongoing assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable. The accounts receivable amount on our balance sheet includes a reserve for accounts that might not be paid. In determining the amount of the reserve, we consider our historical level of credit losses. We also make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations and we assess current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future. Our reserves have generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses. However, since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, we cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be adequate. If actual credit losses are significantly greater than the reserve we have established, that would increase our general and administrative expenses and reduce our reported net income. Conversely, if actual credit losses are significantly less than our reserve, this would eventually decrease our general and administrative expenses and increase our reported net income. Goodwill, Purchased Intangible Assets and Other Long Lived Assets Impairment Assessments. We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than temporary impairment in the remaining value of the assets recorded on our balance sheet may exist. We test the impairment of goodwill annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise. In order to estimate the fair value of long lived assets, we typically make various assumptions about the future prospects for the business that the asset relates to, consider market factors specific to that business and estimate future cash flows to be generated by that business. Based on these assumptions and estimates, we determine whether we need to take an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset stated on our balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results. More conservative assumptions of the anticipated future benefits from these businesses could result in impairment charges, which would decrease net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet. Conversely, less conservative assumptions could result in smaller or no impairment charges, higher net income and higher asset values. At July 31, 2003, we had $591.1 million in goodwill and $125.4 million in intangible assets on our balance sheet. Accounting for Stock Based Incentive Programs. We currently measure compensation expense for our stock based incentive programs using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Under this method, we do not record compensation expense when stock options are granted to eligible participants as long as the exercise price is not less than the fair market value of the stock when the option is granted. We also do not record compensation expense in connection with our Employee Stock Purchase Plan as long as the purchase price of the stock is not less than 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the stock at the 27 Table of Contents beginning of each offering period or at the end of each purchase period. In accordance with SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and SFAS 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, we disclose our pro forma net income or loss and net income or loss per share as if the fair value based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense for our stock based incentive programs. We have elected to follow APB 25 because, as discussed in Note 1 of the financial statements, the fair value accounting provided for under SFAS 123 requires the use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) decided on April 22, 2003 to require all companies to expense the value of incentive stock options. Companies will be required to measure the cost of incentive stock options according to their fair value. The FASB has indicated that it plans to issue in the near future an exposure draft of a new accounting standard addressing this matter. This new accounting standard could become effective as early as 2004. Prior to issuance of this exposure draft, the FASB has indicated that it will be addressing several significant technical issues. A method to determine the fair value of incentive stock options must be established. Current accounting standards require the use of an option pricing model, such as the Black Scholes model, to determine fair value and provide guidance on adjusting some of the input factors used in the model. This valuation approach has received significant criticism and may be subject to changes that could have a significant impact on the calculated fair value of incentive stock options under the new standard. Among other things, the FASB must also determine the extent to which the new accounting standard will permit adjustments to recognized expense for actual option forfeitures and actual performance outcomes. This determination will affect the timing and amount of compensation expense recognized. We monitor progress at the FASB and other developments with respect to the general issue of stock based incentive compensation. In the future, should we expense the value of stock based incentive compensation, either out of choice or due to new requirements issued by the FASB, and or decide to alter our current employee compensation programs to provide other benefits in place of incentive stock options, we may have to recognize substantially more compensation expense in future periods that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Income Taxes Estimates of Effective Tax Rates, Deferred Taxes and Valuation Allowance. When we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. This requires us to estimate our current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which we show on our consolidated balance sheet. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized. To the extent we believe that realization is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. When we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period, we record a corresponding tax expense on our statement of operations. Management must make significant judgments to determine our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax asset. Our net deferred tax asset as of July 31, 2003 was $217.9 million, net of the valuation allowance of $7.5 million. We recorded the valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets (consisting primarily of certain net operating losses carried forward by our international subsidiaries and certain state capital loss carryforwards) before they expire. The valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable. While we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, we could be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize. An increase in the valuation allowance would have an adverse impact, which could be material, on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we make the increase. 28 Table of Contents Total Net Revenue The table below shows total net revenue and percentage of total net revenue for each of our business segments for fiscal years 2001, 2002 and 2003. We have reclassified prior year financial information to conform to the current year presentation for comparability. See Note 11 of the financial statements for additional information about our business segments. % Total % Total % Total Fiscal Net Fiscal Net Fiscal Net 2001 2002 2002 2003 (Dollars in millions) 2001 Revenue 2002 Revenue 2003 Revenue % Change % Change QuickBooks Product $ 164.2 $ 194.8 $ 239.3 Service 0.3 3.5 Other Subtotal 164.2 15 % 195.1 15 % 242.8 15 % 19 % 24 % Small Business Products and Services Product 180.3 205.7 258.9 Service 90.7 125.7 175.7 Other 19.1 6.3 20.3 Subtotal 290.1 26 % 337.7 26 % 454.9 27 % 16 % 35 % Consumer Tax Product 168.2 219.4 243.7 Service 100.5 128.4 176.6 Other 3.4 3.3 2.6 Subtotal 272.1 25 % 351.1 27 % 422.9 26 % 29 % 20 % Professional Accounting Solutions Product 169.8 219.2 239.3 Service 11.1 6.5 4.1 Other Subtotal 180.9 17 % 225.7 17 % 243.4 15 % 25 % 8 % Vertical Business Management Solutions Product 8.9 35.5 Service 5.3 59.1 Other 0.2 Subtotal 14.2 1 % 94.8 6 % 568 % Other Businesses Product 123.2 129.5 141.2 Service 14.2 7.4 4.5 Other 51.4 51.5 46.2 Subtotal 188.8 17 % 188.4 14 % 191.9 11 % 0 % 2 % Total net revenue $ 1,096.1 100 % $ 1,312.2 100 % $ 1,650.7 100 % 20 % 26 % 29 Table of Contents Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002. Fiscal 2003 total net revenue of $1,650.7 million represented a 26% increase over fiscal 2002 total net revenue. The increase in net revenue was primarily due to growth of 35% in our Small Business Products and Services segment, 24% in our QuickBooks segment and 20% in our Consumer Tax segment. Our Vertical Business Management Solutions segment, which is comprised primarily of companies we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, contributed $94.8 million to net revenue compared to $14.2 million in fiscal 2002. Net revenue for our Professional Accounting Solutions segment also grew 8%. Net revenue for our Other Businesses segment increased only 2%, due primarily to lack of growth in the personal finance desktop software category and continuing industry wide slowness in spending by purchasers of Internet advertising. Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001. Fiscal 2002 total net revenue of $1,312.2 million represented an increase of 20% over fiscal 2001 total net revenue. The increase in net revenue was primarily due to growth of 29% in our Consumer Tax segment, 25% in our Professional Accounting Solutions segment, 19% in our QuickBooks segment and 16% in our Small Business Products and Services segment. Other Businesses net revenue was flat in fiscal 2002, reflecting a decrease in Internet advertising revenue and lower sales of Quicken due to the continuing overall decline in the personal finance desktop software category, offset by growth in Canada. Total Net Revenue by Business Segment The following net revenue discussion is categorized by our reportable business segments, which reflect how we manage our operations and how our chief operating decision maker views results. In fiscal 2003, we revised our reportable segments to reflect the way we currently manage and view our businesses. We determined that the QuickBooks product component of our fiscal 2002 Small Business segment was a separate reportable segment and we combined our fiscal 2002 Employer Services segment with the balance of Small Business to arrive at the fiscal 2003 segment called Small Business Products and Services. We began reporting Vertical Business Management Solutions (formerly Small Business Verticals) as a separate segment in fiscal 2003. Finally, we combined our fiscal 2002 Personal Finance and Global Business segments to arrive at the fiscal 2003 segment called Other Businesses. We have reclassified previously reported fiscal 2002 and 2001 segment results to conform to the fiscal 2003 presentation. See Note 11 of the financial statements for additional information about our reportable segments. QuickBooks QuickBooks product revenue is derived primarily from QuickBooks desktop software products. QuickBooks service revenue is derived from QuickBooks Online Edition. Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002. QuickBooks total net revenue increased 24% in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002. The revenue increase reflected higher unit sales as well as higher average selling prices driven by the introduction of certain higher priced QuickBooks products and a shift in revenue mix toward those products. The products include QuickBooks Premier: Accountant Edition for accounting professionals; QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions for businesses with up to 250 employees; QuickBooks Point of Sale for retail businesses; and three industry specific versions of QuickBooks. We launched these products at the end of fiscal 2002 and during fiscal 2003 as part of our Right for My Business strategy, and they have significantly higher average selling prices than our original QuickBooks Basic and QuickBooks Pro products. We expect to introduce additional versions of QuickBooks in fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001. QuickBooks total net revenue increased 19% in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001. The increase in QuickBooks product revenue reflected higher average selling prices driven primarily by the November 2001 launch of our higher priced QuickBooks Premier products, as well as higher unit sales. The volume increase was driven by strong upgrade sales, which we believe were due in part to our decision to discontinue technical support and tax table services during calendar 2002 for customers using certain older versions of QuickBooks. We believe that the availability of a range of third party offerings from the Intuit Developer Network to QuickBooks 2002 customers may also have contributed to the stronger upgrade sales. 30 Table of Contents Small Business Products and Services Small Business Products and Services product revenue is comprised of QuickBooks Do It Yourself Payroll, which offers payroll tax tables, forms and electronic tax payment and filing services on a subscription basis to small businesses that prepare their own payrolls; financial supplies such as paper checks, envelopes and invoices; and information technology management software. Service revenue for this segment is derived primarily from outsourced payroll services and from QuickBooks support plans. Other revenue for this segment consists primarily of royalties from small business online services and interest earned on customer payroll deposits. Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002. Small Business Products and Services total net revenue grew 35% in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002. Payroll product revenue increased due to growth in the customer base and higher average selling prices driven by price increases. Financial supplies product revenue increased slightly during the year. Outsourced payroll service revenue increased due in large part to our acquisition of CBS Employer Services, Inc. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. QuickBooks support revenue grew due to an increase in the number of support plans sold and continued strength in the higher priced support plans for higher end QuickBooks products introduced in late fiscal 2002 and in fiscal 2003. Finally, our acquisition of Intuit Information Technology Solutions, formerly Blue Ocean Software, Inc., in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 also contributed to revenue growth for this segment. Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001. Small Business Products and Services total net revenue increased 16% in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001. Payroll product revenue increased, reflecting higher average selling prices and growth in the customer base. Financial supplies product revenue increased slightly during the year. Outsourced payroll service revenue increased, reflecting growth in QuickBooks Assisted Payroll Service due to higher average selling prices and growth in the customer base; higher Premier payroll service revenue; and revenue from our fourth quarter fiscal 2002 acquisition of CBS Employer Services, Inc. Fiscal 2002 service revenue growth in this segment also reflected strong results from QuickBooks support plans. In August 2001, we began offering several higher end support plans, which resulted in significantly higher average selling prices that more than offset declines in volume compared to fiscal 2001. Revenue growth in this segment was partially offset by a decline in QuickBooks Internet Gateway other revenue. Consumer Tax Consumer Tax product revenue is derived primarily from TurboTax federal and state consumer desktop tax return preparation software. Consumer Tax service revenue is derived primarily from TurboTax for the Web online tax return preparation services and consumer electronic filing services. Paid Web units exclude tax filing units that we donate under the Intuit Tax Freedom Project. Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002. Consumer Tax total net revenue increased 20% in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002. Total paid federal units increased 12% over fiscal 2002. Desktop revenue increased due to growth in paid federal units and higher average selling prices for federal tax offerings with enhanced functionality. TurboTax for the Web revenue increased due to paid federal unit growth and higher average selling prices. Electronic filing revenue was up due to higher federal desktop unit sales and higher average state electronic filing prices. Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001. Consumer Tax total net revenue increased 29% in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001. Revenue from TurboTax desktop products was up due primarily to higher average selling prices resulting from the introduction of a higher priced premium product. Revenue from TurboTax for the Web was strong in fiscal 2002, reflecting a significant increase in the mix of higher end service offerings as well as 84% unit growth. Electronic filing units and revenue also contributed to the year over year growth. Professional Accounting Solutions Professional Accounting Solutions product revenue is derived primarily from ProSeries and Lacerte professional tax preparation software products. Professional Accounting Solutions service revenue is derived primarily from electronic filing and training services. 31 Table of Contents Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002. Total net revenue from our professional tax preparation products and services increased 8% in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002. Product revenue grew 9% in fiscal 2003 due to price increases related to product enhancements, new customer acquisition initiatives and successful cross sell efforts to the existing tax client base. Renewal rates for our existing customer base remained strong during fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001. Total net revenue from our professional tax preparation products and services increased 25% in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001. Approximately $21.0 million or 47% of the growth compared to fiscal 2001 resulted from our acquisition of Tax and Accounting Software Corporation in April 2001. Higher revenue from electronic filing services was also a significant factor in the increase. In addition, new customer acquisition and higher average selling prices for our ProSeries and Lacerte unlimited use products contributed to the revenue growth. Renewal rates for our existing customer base remained strong during fiscal 2002. Vertical Business Management Solutions Vertical Business Management Solutions (VBMS) revenue is derived from four businesses that we acquired in fiscal 2002 that provide business management solutions for companies in selected industries. Those businesses are Intuit Distribution Management Solutions, whose Intuit Eclipse line of products and services offers business management software for the wholesale durable goods industry; MRI Real Estate Solutions, whose Intuit MRI line of products and services provides business management software solutions for commercial and residential property managers; Intuit Construction Business Solutions, whose Intuit MasterBuilder line of products and services provides business management solutions for the construction industry; and Intuit Public Sector Solutions, whose Intuit Fundware line of products and services offers accounting and business management software solutions for nonprofit organizations, universities and government agencies. VBMS product revenue is derived from business management software for these vertical industries. VBMS service revenue consists primarily of technical support, consulting and training services. Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002. Our vertical businesses contributed $94.8 million in revenue for fiscal 2003 compared to $14.2 million in fiscal 2002. Three of the four acquisitions were completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. As a result, revenue from this segment was not significant in fiscal 2002 and consisted primarily of revenue generated by Intuit Construction Business Solutions, which we acquired in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. Other Businesses Other Businesses consist primarily of Personal Finance and Canada. Personal Finance product revenue is derived primarily from Quicken desktop software products. Personal Finance service revenue is nominal while other revenue consists of fees from consumer online transactions and Quicken.com advertising revenue. In Canada, product revenue is derived primarily from localized versions of QuickBooks and Quicken as well as QuickTax and TaxWiz consumer desktop tax return preparation software and ProFile professional tax preparation products. Service revenue in Canada consists primarily of revenue from software maintenance contracts sold with QuickBooks. Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002. Other Businesses total net revenue increased 2% in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002. Personal Finance product revenue decreased due to lack of growth in the market for personal finance desktop software and slow consumer spending. Lower unit sales for all Quicken products more than offset higher average selling prices for Quicken Premier and Quicken Home and Business. Personal Finance other revenue also decreased due to continuing slowness in Internet advertising and our exit from certain online businesses in fiscal 2002. Total net revenue from Canada grew in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002, due partially to slightly higher revenue from QuickTax. Higher average selling prices and higher unit sales for this product were fueled by the second quarter fiscal 2003 introduction of Right for Me consumer tax products targeted at taxpayers who maintain home offices or who are preparing for retirement. Our new TaxWiz consumer tax preparation software also contributed to fiscal 2003 revenue growth. Canadian QuickBooks revenue for fiscal 2003 declined due to lack of growth in the software category and decreases in the level of inventory purchasing by retailers. The impact of these trends was partially offset by the introduction of several Right for My Business versions of QuickBooks in Canada in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2003. 32 Table of Contents Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001. Other Businesses total net revenue was flat in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001. Personal Finance total net revenue decreased due primarily to a decline in revenue from Quicken desktop products and lower Quicken.com revenue. Solid growth in our online transactions business partially offset these declines. The decrease in Quicken revenue reflected the continuing overall decline in the personal finance desktop software category. Lower Quicken.com advertising revenue reflected the industry wide decline in spending by purchasers of Internet advertising. Revenue from Canada increased in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001. This reflected strong tax season results for QuickTax, due in part to the preliminary success of our efforts to reduce unauthorized sharing of desktop software. Canadian consumer tax revenue growth was partially offset by modest revenue declines for QuickBooks and Quicken.

Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002. Cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue decreased to 15% in fiscal 2003 from 16% in fiscal 2002. This was primarily due to strong sales of our new higher priced QuickBooks products, which have higher margins per unit. We also continued to improve the packaging design process for certain products and streamline some of our manufacturing processes during fiscal 2003. This enabled us to reduce the per unit materials, manufacturing and shipping costs for our shrink wrap software products. We expect to implement further efficiencies in our manufacturing processes during fiscal 2004. We also expect that the mix shift toward our higher priced, higher margin QuickBooks products will continue and that growth rates for our higher priced QuickBooks products will exceed those for our lower priced products. Cost of service revenue as a percentage of service revenue decreased to 35% in fiscal 2003 from 39% in fiscal 2002. This decrease was primarily attributable to the growth in our outsourced payroll business during fiscal 2003. As this business grows, we are leveraging our historical investments in data center and other infrastructure to reduce the unit cost and improve the profitability of outsourced payroll services. In addition, starting in the third quarter of fiscal 2003 we no longer paid royalties to Wells Fargo Bank for our Premier payroll service. Although we now amortize the $29.2 million purchase price of the right to market to this customer base to cost of service revenue, the amortization expense is less than the royalties that would have been incurred under the old agreement. We expect continued growth in our outsourced payroll business and a full year of the lower amortization expense for our Premier payroll service during fiscal 2004. 33 Table of Contents Cost of other revenue as a percentage of other revenue decreased to 30% in fiscal 2003 from 40% in fiscal 2002. In the first quarter of fiscal 2002, we moved a large number of servers that supported our Quicken.com Web site from an external hosting company to our own data center and streamlined the infrastructure. Over time, this led to decreased cost of other revenue for this business. We recorded a $5.2 million impairment charge for intangible assets related to Quicken.com advertising revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2002. Adjusting for this impairment charge, amortization of purchased software increased $6.6 million in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002. The increase was a result of additional amortization for intangible assets we purchased in connection with the acquisitions we completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 and the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Amortization of purchased software expense may increase in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 as a result of future acquisitions and impairment charges, which are not possible to predict. Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001. Cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue decreased to 16% in fiscal 2002 from 17% in fiscal 2001. We lowered our per unit materials, manufacturing and shipping costs for our shrink wrap software products, resulting in significant cost savings. These savings were nearly offset by increased costs associated with improving our product distribution function. During the first quarter of fiscal 2002, we established a new third party retail distribution relationship for our shrink wrap software products. This distribution relationship enabled us to ship a larger percentage of our products directly to individual retail stores and allowed us to provide inventory to our retail customers on a more timely basis. By providing better service to our retailers, we reduced product returns and related costs. Cost of service revenue as a percentage of service revenue decreased to 39% in fiscal 2002 from 50% in fiscal 2001. This decrease was attributable primarily to our payroll and Web based tax businesses, which experienced significant revenue growth with relatively fixed cost bases in fiscal 2002. Cost of other revenue as a percentage of other revenue increased to 40% in fiscal 2002 compared to 35% in fiscal 2001. This increase was primarily due to increased data center costs related to our Personal Finance segments online transaction business. Amortization of purchased software decreased $2.5 million in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001. This reflected lower amortization expense in the second half of fiscal 2002 that resulted from a lower base of assets to be amortized. This decline was partially offset by impairment charges for certain purchased software assets that were recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2002, which caused the decrease in the base of assets. 34 Table of Contents Operating Expenses % Total % Total % Total Fiscal Net Fiscal Net Fiscal Net 2001 2002 2002 2003 (Dollars in millions) 2001 Revenue 2002 Revenue 2003 Revenue % Change % Change Customer service and technical support $ 137.2 13 % $ 164.9 13 % $ 178.9 11 % 20 % 8 % Selling and marketing 217.8 20 % 263.7 20 % 324.4 20 % 21 % 23 % Research and development 196.1 18 % 198.5 15 % 255.8 15 % 1 % 29 % General and administrative 93.5 9 % 109.1 8 % 148.9 9 % 17 % 36 % 644.6 59 % 736.2 56 % 908.0 55 % 14 % 23 % Charge for purchased research and development 0.2 0 % 2.2 0 % 8.9 1 % NM NM Charge for vacant facilities 13.2 1 % (1.1 ) 0 % NM NM Acquisition related charges 247.8 23 % 181.4 14 % 33.9 2 % 27 % 81 % Loss on impairment of long lived asset 27.0 2 % Total operating expenses $ 892.6 81 % $ 960.0 73 % $ 949.7 58 % 8 % 1 % NM is a non meaningful comparison. Customer Service and Technical Support Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002. Customer service and technical support expenses were 11% of total net revenue in fiscal 2003 compared to 13% in fiscal 2002. We continued to increase our efficiency in fiscal 2003 by improving our utilization of internal customer service representatives and by outsourcing some of our seasonal call center capabilities. We also increased the proportion of customer service and technical support we provide through less expensive methods such as Web sites, online chat, email and other electronic means. In fiscal 2003 we benefited from the fiscal 2002 implementation of a number of successful process excellence initiatives that reduced costs while maintaining or increasing service levels. These benefits were partially offset by increased demand for customer service and technical support due to the increasing complexity of our products and to customer questions relating to product activation technology in TurboTax desktop products. We discontinued product activation in certain TurboTax products after the 2002 tax season. Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001. Customer service and technical support expenses were 13% of total net revenue in fiscal 2002 and 2001. We improved our efficiency in fiscal 2002 by increasing the proportion of customer service and technical support we provide through less expensive methods such as Web sites, online chat, email and other electronic means. We also implemented a number of successful process excellence initiatives that reduced costs while maintaining or increasing service levels. However, these benefits were offset by higher direct sales and support costs associated with converting the customers of Tax Accounting and Software Company, a company that we acquired in April 2001, to our ProSeries and Lacerte professional tax products, and by increased demand for customer service and technical support due to our growing customer base. 35 Table of Contents Selling and Marketing Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002. Selling and marketing expenses were 20% of total net revenue in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002. In fiscal 2003, we continued to expand our small business marketing programs to support the Right for My Business strategy announced in fiscal 2002. Marketing expenses for certain new QuickBooks products with advanced functionality totaled approximately $12.0 million in fiscal 2003, compared to about $2.0 million in marketing expenses for those products in fiscal 2002. Marketing expenses for fiscal 2003 also increased compared to fiscal 2002 as we expanded marketing programs to support our Consumer Tax Right for Me strategy, which we introduced during the 2002 tax season. In addition, we added selling and marketing expenses for the companies we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 and the first quarter of fiscal 2003. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of total net revenue for our payroll business due to significant revenue growth in that segment. Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001. Selling and marketing expenses were 20% of total net revenue in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001. In fiscal 2002, selling and marketing expenses increased as we expanded our small business marketing programs to support the Right for My Business strategy announced in September 2001. We also incurred additional marketing expenses for our Intuit Construction Business Solutions products, which we acquired in November 2001. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of total net revenue for our payroll business due to significant revenue growth in that segment. Research and Development Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002. Research and development expenses were 15% of total net revenue in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002. During fiscal 2003, we continued to invest in new products and enhanced functionality for existing products, particularly those that support our small business Right for My Business and Consumer Tax Right for Me strategies. We also added research and development expenses for the companies we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 and the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Offsetting these increases, we continued to benefit from improvements in our development process that resulted in shorter development times and higher quality in many of our products. Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001. During fiscal 2002, we increased research and development spending in some of our highest growth businesses QuickBooks, Consumer Tax and Professional Accounting Solutions by approximately 10%. In particular, we continued to invest in our Right for My Business strategy, including new QuickBooks Premier, Enterprise and Point of Sale products launched in the second quarter of fiscal 2002, the Intuit Developer Network and other new products that we expected to introduce in fiscal 2003. At the same time, we significantly decreased or stopped spending in less strategic areas and discontinued product lines. We also benefited from improvements in our development process that resulted in shorter development times and higher quality for our new QuickBooks products. The net result was that research and development expenses in fiscal 2002 declined as a percentage of total net revenue to 15% of total net revenue compared to 18% in fiscal 2001. General and Administrative Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002. General and administrative expenses were 9% of total net revenue in fiscal 2003 compared to 8% in fiscal 2002. General and administrative expenses increased in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 primarily due to acquisition integration costs; the addition of general and administrative expenses for the companies we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 and the first quarter of fiscal 2003; and higher insurance costs. General and administrative expenses did not include labor costs capitalized in connection with internal use software projects of $18.0 million in fiscal 2003 and $12.9 million in fiscal 2002. Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001. General and administrative expenses were 8% of total net revenue in fiscal 2002 compared to 9% in fiscal 2001. We experienced increased directors and officers liability insurance costs and costs associated with integrating our acquisitions of Intuit Construction Business Solutions (formerly OMware, Inc.) in November 2001 and EmployeeMatters, Inc. in December 2000. These increases were partially offset by decreases in bad debt charges in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001. 36 Table of Contents Charge for Purchased Research and Development In connection with certain acquisitions and with the assistance of third party appraisers, we determine the value of in process projects under development for which technological feasibility has not been established. The value of each project is determined by estimating the costs to develop the in process technology into a commercially feasible product, estimating the net cash flows we believe would result from the product and discounting these net cash flows back to their present value. The resulting amount is recorded as a charge for purchased research and development when we acquire certain new businesses. In fiscal 2003, we recorded charges totaling $8.9 million for purchased research and development, primarily in connection with our acquisition of Blue Ocean Software, Inc. (now Intuit Information Technology Solutions). In fiscal 2002, we recorded a charge of $2.2 million for purchased research and development as a result of our acquisition of Management Reports, Inc. (now MRI Real Estate Solutions). In fiscal 2001, we recorded a charge of $0.2 million for purchased research and development when we acquired Tax Accounting and Software Corporation. Charge for Vacant Facilities During the third quarter of fiscal 2002, we concluded that we would not occupy two vacant leased buildings in Mountain View, California and that we would be unable to recover a substantial portion of our lease obligations by subleasing the vacant space. As a result, we recorded a charge for vacant facilities of $13.2 million in that quarter. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, we decided that based on corporate growth requirements and the current real estate market in the San Francisco Bay Area, we would reoccupy one of these two vacant buildings. As a result, we reversed the remaining $1.9 million reserve for the related lease obligations to our statement of operations. At the same time, we added $1.4 million to the reserve for the remaining vacant Mountain View building to reflect our revised estimate of future sublease income for that facility. Based on revised estimates, we also reversed approximately $0.6 million in reserves related to various smaller facilities for a total credit for vacant facilities of $1.1 million to our statement of operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. See Note 13 of the financial statements. Acquisition Related Charges Acquisition related charges include the amortization of goodwill prior to August 1, 2002, the amortization of purchased intangible assets and deferred compensation expenses arising from acquisitions, and impairment charges relating to goodwill and purchased intangible assets. Beginning on August 1, 2002, we no longer amortize goodwill due to our adoption of SFAS 142. However, it is possible that in the future we may incur impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions. See Note 1 and Note 4 of the financial statements. Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002. In fiscal 2003, acquisition related charges were $33.9 million compared to $181.4 million in fiscal 2002. In fiscal 2002, acquisition related charges included the amortization of goodwill, the amortization of purchased intangible assets and deferred compensation expenses arising from acquisitions. Acquisition related charges for fiscal 2002 also included impairment charges of $22.0 million that were related to our Internet based advertising business and our Site Solutions business. Beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2003, acquisition related charges no longer included amortization of goodwill due to our adoption of SFAS 142 and there were no impairment charges in fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001. In fiscal 2002, acquisition related charges were $181.4 million compared to $247.8 million in fiscal 2001. Acquisition related charges in fiscal 2002 included impairment charges totaling $22.0 million that were related to our Internet based advertising business and our Site Solutions business. Acquisition related charges for fiscal 2001 included impairment charges that totaled $78.7 million for goodwill and intangible assets recorded in connection with our acquisitions of Venture Finance Software Corp., SecureTax.com and Hutchison Avenue Software Corporation. 37 Table of Contents Loss on Impairment of Long lived Asset In connection with the sale of our Quicken Bill Manager business in May 2001, we acquired a $27.0 million long term asset related to future consideration from Princeton eCom. See Note 8 of the financial statements. During fiscal 2002, events and circumstances indicated impairment of this asset. These indicators included the deterioration of Princeton eComs financial position and the decreased likelihood that it would receive future funding. Based on our analysis we determined that the fair value of this asset was impaired and recorded a charge of $27.0 million in fiscal 2002 to reduce its carrying value to zero. Non Operating Income and Expenses Interest and Other Income Interest and other income was $38.7 million in fiscal 2003 compared to $27.3 million in fiscal 2002 and $57.6 million in fiscal 2001. Fiscal 2003 interest and other income included $10.1 million in royalties from trademark license and distribution agreements that we entered into when we sold our mortgage business in July 2002. See Note 9 of the financial statements. Due to the effect of the weakening U.S. dollar on intercompany balances with our Canadian subsidiary, interest and other income also included foreign exchange gains of $5.4 million in fiscal 2003, compared to a nominal foreign exchange impact in fiscal 2002. In fiscal 2003, the interest income that we earned on our cash and short term investment balances decreased due in part to a continuing decline in market interest rates compared to the same periods of the prior year. Our interest income also decreased as a result of lower average cash and short term investment balances during part of fiscal 2003 compared to the same periods of fiscal 2002 due to our use of cash to fund our acquisitions and our stock repurchase programs. See Note 7 and Note 15 of the financial statements. The decrease in interest and other income during fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was due to a sharp decline in the interest we earned on our cash and short term investment balances in fiscal 2002, reflecting significant decreases in market interest rates during the period. Interest earned on customer payroll deposits is reported as revenue for our payroll business, and is not included in interest and other income. Gains (Losses) on Marketable Securities and Other Investments, Net We recorded a pre tax net gain relating to marketable securities and other investments of $10.9 million in fiscal 2003. We recorded pre tax net losses relating to marketable securities and other investments of $15.5 million in fiscal 2002 and $98.1 million in fiscal 2001. The fiscal 2003 net gain included charges totaling $2.8 million to write down certain long term investments for which the decline in fair value below carrying value was other than temporary. The fiscal 2002 net loss included charges totaling $9.5 million to write down certain long term investments for which the decline in fair value below carrying value was other than temporary. The fiscal 2001 net loss included charges of $40.2 million to write down certain available for sale securities for which the decline in fair value below carrying value was other than temporary and $28.6 million to write down certain long term investments for which the decline in fair value below carrying value was other than temporary. Net Gains (Losses) on Divestitures In March 2002, we paid $12.0 million to terminate our remaining $20.3 million obligation under an interactive services agreement related to our Quicken Bill Manager business, which we sold in May 2001. We recorded a pre tax gain of $8.3 million in connection with the termination of this agreement. See Note 8 of the financial statements. During fiscal 2001, we recorded a pre tax net loss of $15.3 million resulting from our divestitures of businesses. We recorded a pre tax loss of $16.9 million for the sale of the technology assets of our Quicken Bill Manager business. This loss was partially offset by a pre tax gain of $1.6 million for the sale of certain assets of our wholly owned subsidiary, Intuit Insurance Services, Inc., which operated our Quicken Insurance business. See Note 8 of the financial statements. 38 Table of Contents Income Taxes For fiscal 2003, we recorded an income tax provision of $129.6 million on pre tax income from continuing operations of $392.8 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of approximately 33%. For fiscal 2002, we recorded an income tax provision of $16.9 million on pre tax income from continuing operations of $70.5 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of approximately 24%. For fiscal 2001, we recorded an income tax benefit of $12.5 million on a pre tax loss from continuing operations of $137.1 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of approximately 9%. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2003 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to tax exempt interest income and research and development credits. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2002 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to a tax benefit related to a divestiture that became available during the year and tax exempt interest income, offset by non deductible merger related charges. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2001 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the net effect of non deductible merger and divestiture related charges offset by the benefit received from tax exempt interest income. At July 31, 2003, we had net deferred tax assets of $217.9 million, which included a valuation allowance of $7.5 million for net operating loss carryforwards relating to our international subsidiaries and certain state capital loss carryforwards. The allowance reflects managements assessment that we may not receive the benefit of certain loss carryforwards of our international subsidiaries and capital loss carryforwards in certain state jurisdictions. While we believe our current valuation allowance is sufficient, it may be necessary to increase this amount if it becomes more likely that we will not realize a greater portion of the net deferred tax asset. We assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. See Note 14 of the financial statements. Discontinued Operations Intuit KK On February 7, 2003, we sold our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary, Intuit KK, and accounted for the sale as discontinued operations. In accordance with SFAS 144, we have segregated the operating results of Intuit KK from continuing operations on our statement of operations for all periods prior to the sale. We recorded a gain on disposal of these discontinued operations of $71.0 million, net of income taxes of $5.1 million, in the third quarter of fiscal 2003. See Note 9 of the financial statements. Quicken Loans On July 31, 2002, we sold 87.5% of our Quicken Loans mortgage business segment and accounted for the sale as discontinued operations. In accordance with APB Opinion No. 30, we have segregated the operating results of Quicken Loans from continuing operations on our statement of operations for all periods prior to the sale. We recorded a net gain on disposal of these discontinued operations of $23.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. In October 2002, we sold our residual 12.5% equity interest in the purchasing company and recognized a net gain of $5.6 million on the transaction. See Note 9 of the financial statements. Concurrent with the sale, we signed an agreement to license the Quicken Loans brand and a distribution agreement under which the purchasing company will provide mortgage services on Quicken.com. We will receive minimum royalties of $1.75 million a year for the next five years under the licensing agreement and minimum fees of $0.75 million a year for the next five years under the distribution agreement. Royalties and fees under these agreements are being recorded as earned and are included in interest and other income on our statement of operations. For fiscal 2003, we recorded royalties of $1.75 million under the trademark licensing agreement and fees of $8.3 million under the distribution agreement. Fees due under these agreements totaled $9.5 million at July 31, 2003 and are included in accounts receivable on our balance sheet. See Note 9 of the financial statements. Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change During the first quarter of fiscal 2001, we recorded a cumulative gain of $14.3 million, net of income taxes, as a result of a change in accounting principle when we adopted SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. We recognized the cumulative effect of the change in how we accounted for options to 39 Table of Contents purchase shares of S1 Corporation as of August 1, 2000. See Note 1 of the financial statements. Subsequent fluctuations in the fair value of these options were included in our net income or net loss until we sold them in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. Liquidity and Capital Resources At July 31, 2003 our cash, cash equivalents and short term investments totaled $1.2 billion, essentially unchanged from July 31, 2002. In fiscal 2003, we generated cash primarily from continuing operations, discontinued operations and the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans and we used cash primarily for our stock repurchase programs and for acquisitions. The following table summarizes selected items from our statements of cash flows for fiscal 2001, 2002 and 2003. For complete statements of cash flows for those periods, see the financial statements in Item 8. Fiscal 2001 2002 2003 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 230.7 $ 344.3 $ 569.4 Net income (loss) from continuing operations (124.7 ) 53.6 263.2 Acquisition related costs 263.0 196.0 56.6 Depreciation 54.3 58.8 73.8 Net cash used in investing activities (300.0 ) (30.9 ) (486.6 ) Acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired (198.1 ) (284.1 ) (214.8 ) Net liquidation (purchases) of short term investments (64.4 ) 302.7 (224.5 ) Purchases of property and equipment 48.4 42.1 50.4 Capitalization of internal use software 23.4 21.3 34.3 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 87.6 (196.1 ) (661.8 ) Purchase of treasury stock (8.4 ) (318.4 ) (814.3 ) Net proceeds from issuance of common stock 96.8 133.6 155.9 Net cash provided by (used in) discontinued operations (303.1 ) 225.2 341.4 Collection of amounts due from discontinued operations entities (297.7 ) 108.1 241.6 Net income from discontinued operations 27.5 63.2 3.3 Net gains from discontinued operations 23.3 76.6 We generated $569.4 million, $344.3 million and $230.7 million in cash from our operations during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001. Net income from continuing operations generated $263.2 million in fiscal 2003 and $53.6 million in fiscal 2002. Net loss from continuing operations used $124.7 million in fiscal 2001. Adjustments for non cash expenses included depreciation of $73.8 million, $58.8 million and $54.3 million in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001. Adjustments for non cash expenses also included acquisition related charges, charges for purchased research and development and amortization of purchased software totaling $56.6 million, $196.0 million and $263.0 million in those periods. Adjustments for non cash expenses included $27.0 million for an impairment loss on a long lived asset in fiscal 2002 and $98.1 million for net losses on marketable securities and other investments in fiscal 2001. We used $486.6 million, $30.9 million and $300.0 million in cash for investing activities during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001. Our primary use of cash for investing activities was for business acquisitions, which totaled $214.8 million in fiscal 2003, $284.1 million in fiscal 2002 and $198.1 million in fiscal 2001, net of cash on the balance sheets of the companies when we acquired them. Fiscal 2003 proceeds from the sale upon maturity of short term investments of $2.1 billion were more than offset by reinvestments of $2.3 billion, a net investment of $224.5 million. Proceeds of $3.2 billion from the sale upon maturity of short term investments were partially offset by reinvestments of $2.9 billion during fiscal 2002, a net draw of $302.7 million. Fiscal 2001 proceeds from the sale upon maturity of short term investments of $3.1 billion essentially offset reinvestments of $3.2 billion. Finally, as a 40 Table of Contents result of our continued investment in information systems and infrastructure, we also purchased property and equipment of $50.4 million, $42.1 million and $48.4 million and capitalized internal use software development projects of $34.3 million, $21.3 million and $23.4 million in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001. We used $661.8 million and $196.1 million in cash for our financing activities in fiscal 2003 and 2002. We generated $87.6 million in cash from financing activities in fiscal 2001. The primary component of cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2003 and 2002 was $814.3 million and $318.4 million for the repurchase of stock through our stock repurchase programs. See Note 15 of the financial statements. This was partially offset by proceeds of $155.9 million and $133.6 million we received from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans in fiscal 2003 and 2002. The primary component of cash generated from financing activities in fiscal 2001 was $96.8 million we received from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans. Cash generated by discontinued operations totaled $341.4 million in fiscal 2003 and $225.2 million in fiscal 2002 while discontinued operations used cash of $303.1 million in fiscal 2001. Cash generated by discontinued operations in fiscal 2003 included collection of $241.6 million in amounts due from Quicken Loans and Intuit KK and a net gain of $71.0 million from the sale of Intuit KK. Cash generated by discontinued operations during fiscal 2002 was primarily from collection of $108.1 million in amounts due from Quicken Loans and Intuit KK, net income from discontinued operations of $63.2 million and a gain of $23.3 million on the sale of Quicken Loans. Cash used in discontinued operations during fiscal 2001 was related primarily to an increase of $297.7 million in amounts due from Quicken Loans and Intuit KK. In May 2001, Intuits Board of Directors initiated Repurchase Plan I and authorized the Company to repurchase up to $500.0 million of common stock from time to time over a three year period. In July 2002, our Board of Directors increased the authorized purchase amount by $250.0 million to a total of $750.0 million. From inception of the program through its conclusion in December 2002, we repurchased a total of 16.6 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of approximately $750.0 million. Shares of stock repurchased under this program became treasury shares. In March 2003, Intuits Board of Directors initiated Repurchase Plan II and authorized the Company to repurchase up to $500.0 million of common stock from time to time over a three year period. During fiscal 2003, we repurchased a total of 8.9 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of approximately $390.4 million under this program. Authorized funds of $109.6 million remained available under the program at July 31, 2003. Shares of stock repurchased under this program become treasury shares. In August 2003, our Board of Directors initiated Repurchase Plan III and authorized the Company to repurchase up to $500.0 million of common stock from time to time over a three year period. Shares of stock repurchased under this program will become treasury shares. Shares repurchased under the plans described above from the inception of the plans had no significant impact on our basic and diluted net income or loss per share in fiscal 2001 or 2002 while they increased our basic and diluted net income per share by $0.13 and $0.12 in fiscal 2003. Outstanding loans to executive officers and other employees totaled $19.7 million at July 31, 2003 and $21.3 million at July 31, 2002. Loans to executive officers are primarily relocation loans. Loans are generally secured by real property and have maturity dates of up to 10 years. As of July 31, 2003, all interest payments were current in accordance with the terms of the loan agreements. Consistent with the requirements of the Sarbanes Oxley legislation enacted on July 30, 2002, no loans to executive officers have been made or modified since July 30, 2002 and we do not intend to make or modify loans to executive officers in the future. See Note 19 of the financial statements. In March 2003, we repurchased 17,532 shares of common stock from our chief executive officer at fair market value to provide him with the funds to pay the payroll tax withholding obligation relating to the vesting of his restricted stock. See Note 19 of the financial statements. In the normal course of business, we enter into leases for new or expanded facilities in both domestic and global locations. We also evaluate, on an ongoing basis, the merits of acquiring technology or businesses, or establishing 41 Table of Contents strategic relationships with and investing in other companies. We may decide to use cash and cash equivalents to fund such activities in the future. We believe that our cash, cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at July 31, 2003: Payments Due by Period Less than 1 1 3 3 5 After 5 (In millions) year years years years Total Restricted cash $ 12.2 $ $ $ $ 12.2 Short term portion of vacancy reserve 1.4 1.4 Long term obligations 3.5 20.5 2.6 2.7 29.3 Operating leases 24.6 49.9 39.3 69.0 182.8 Total contractual cash obligations $ 41.7 $ 70.4 $ 41.9 $ 71.7 $ 225.7 Restricted cash at July 31, 2003 included $4.0 million for product rebates due our customers and $5.7 million in obligations to our employees under deferred compensation plans. Restricted cash at July 31, 2003 also included $2.5 million that we held in escrow in connection with our fiscal 2002 acquisition of CBS Employer Services, Inc. The escrow period expires in June 2005. See Note 1 of the financial statements. Long term obligations at July 31, 2003 included the $8.3 million long term portion of our reserve for vacant Mountain View facilities. Long term obligations also included $17.5 million for amounts we owe to former stockholders of CBS Employer Services, Inc. in connection with our acquisition of that company in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. See Note 13 of the financial statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In November 2002, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. Issue 00 21 provides guidance on accounting for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services and or rights to use assets. The provisions of Issue 00 21 will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003. We do not believe that the adoption of Issue 00 21 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. FIN 46 requires us to consolidate a variable interest entity if we are subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns or both. A variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either does not have equity investors with voting rights or has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. A variable interest entity often holds financial assets, including loans or receivables, real estate or other property. A variable interest entity may be essentially passive or it may engage in research and development or other activities on behalf of another company. The consolidation requirements of FIN 46 apply immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003. The consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. Some of the disclosure requirements apply to all financial statements issued after January 31, 2003, regardless of when the variable interest entity was established. We anticipate that the adoption of FIN 46 will not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In April 2003, the FASB issued Statement No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Statement 149 is intended to result in more consistent reporting of contracts as either 42 Table of Contents freestanding derivative instruments subject to Statement 133 in its entirety, or as hybrid instruments with debt host contracts and embedded derivative features. In addition, Statement 149 clarifies the definition of a derivative by providing guidance on the meaning of initial net investments related to derivatives. Statement 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003. We do not believe the adoption of Statement 149 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity. Statement 150 establishes standards for classifying and measuring as liabilities certain financial instruments that embody obligations of the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity. Statement 150 represents a significant change in practice in the accounting for a number of financial instruments, including mandatorily redeemable equity instruments and certain equity derivatives that are frequently used in connection with share repurchase programs. We do not use such instruments in our share repurchase program. Statement 150 is effective for all financial instruments created or modified after May 31, 2003, and to other instruments as of September 1, 2003. We adopted Statement 150 on June 1, 2003 and do not believe the effect of adopting this statement will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 43 Table of Contents RISKS THAT COULD AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS Company Wide Factors That Could Affect Future Results We face intense competitive pressures in all of our businesses, which can have a negative impact on our revenue, profitability and market position. We have formidable current and potential competitors. Accordingly, we expect competition to remain intense during fiscal 2004 and beyond. In all our businesses, we face continual risks that competitors will introduce better products and services, reduce prices, gain better access to distribution channels, increase advertising (including advertising targeted at Intuit customers), and release new products and services before we do. Any of these competitive actions particularly any prolonged price competition could result in lower net revenue and or lower profitability for us. They could also affect our ability to keep existing customers and acquire new customers. For more information about the competitive environment in which we operate, see Item 1, Business Competition and the competition risk factors for each of our businesses below. If we do not continue to develop new products and services in a timely manner, our future financial results will suffer. It is necessary for us to continually develop new products and services and to improve existing products and services so that we can remain competitive in the markets we serve and in the markets we seek to enter. In executing our customer focused product strategies, we have introduced a number of products and services that are specially designed for specific businesses and consumer needs. Many of our offerings have posed new product development challenges for us because several of these offerings require that our products and services integrate with one another and with both our web sites and our internal information systems. In addition, our customers expect and our business model contemplates increased functionality and greater inter operability among our products and services. Moreover, our development and enhancement processes involve several risks, including challenges in hiring and retaining highly qualified employees, the risk of delays in product and service launches, the risk of defects that hinder performance and the risk that consumers will not buy new or modified offerings. Failure to timely and successfully develop new products and services would harm our competitive position and result in declines in our revenue and earnings. Expanding our product and service offerings creates risks due to the increasing complexity and decreasing predictability of our revenue streams. Our expanding range of products and services generates more varied revenue streams than our traditional desktop software businesses. The accounting policies that apply to these revenue streams are more complex than those that apply to our traditional products and services. We expect this trend to continue as we acquire additional companies. For example, as we begin to offer additional features and options as part of multiple element sales arrangements, we could be required to defer a higher percentage of our product revenue at the time of sale than we do for traditional products. This would decrease revenue at the time products are shipped, but result in increased revenue in fiscal periods after shipment. In addition, our Vertical Business Management Solutions businesses offer products and services with significantly higher prices than we have traditionally offered. Revenue from these offerings tends to be less predictable than revenue from our traditional desktop products, due to longer sales and implementation cycles. These businesses also tend to rely on a relatively small number of large orders for a substantial portion of their revenue in a particular quarter, which could cause our quarterly revenue from these businesses to fluctuate. We are continuing to implement new information systems to enable us to execute on our growth strategy, and problems with the design or implementation of these new systems could interfere with our business and operations. We are in the process of implementing new information systems to eventually replace our existing systems. As a part of this effort, we began implementing in fiscal 2003, and will continue to implement in fiscal 2004, new software applications to manage our business and finance operations. We may not successfully implement these new systems and transition data, and even if we do succeed, the implementation may be much more costly than we anticipated. Any disruptions relating to these systems enhancements could adversely impact our ability to do the following in a timely and accurate manner: take customer orders, ship products, provide services and support to our customers, bill and track our customers, fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise run our business. In addition, many of our newer businesses depend on a different operational infrastructure than our desktop software businesses, and we must continually develop, expand and modify our internal systems and procedures including call center, customer management, order management, billing and other systems to support these businesses. If we are unable to successfully implement new information systems, our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price could be adversely affected. 44 Table of Contents Any significant failure in our technology systems could harm our operations and our financial performance. We rely on a variety of technology systems to, among other functions, take and fulfill customer orders, handle customer service requests, host our Web based activities, support internal operations and store customer and company data. Our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted, or lose customer data, any of which could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and adversely impact our internal operations. To prevent interruptions, we must continually upgrade our systems and processes to ensure that we have adequate recoverability both of which are costly and time consuming. While we have backup systems for certain aspects of our operations, our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. In addition, we may have inadequate insurance coverage or insurance limits to compensate us for losses from a major interruption. If any of this were to occur, it could harm our financial performance, damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy. Business integration of acquired companies presents several challenges and we may not fully realize the intended benefits of our acquisitions if we do not successfully integrate them with our operations. During the past few years, we have completed numerous acquisitions (two in fiscal 2003 and five in fiscal 2002), and we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions as part of our Right for My Business strategy. These acquisitions expand our product and service offerings, personnel and geographic locations and require us to integrate different company cultures, management teams and business infrastructures. The integration process can strain our resources and be expensive and time consuming, particularly if we are integrating multiple companies at the same time. Promptly and efficiently integrating acquired businesses creates challenges for our operational, financial and management information systems, as well as for our product development processes. We may have difficulty developing, manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines to realize the value from expected synergies. Depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition, and the number of acquisitions we are concurrently integrating, our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors, including: Retaining key employees Managing facilities and employees in different geographic areas Retaining key customers, and Integrating or coordinating different research and development, product manufacturing, and sales and marketing programs. Despite our efforts to adequately staff and equip our customer service and technical support operations, we cannot always respond promptly to customer requests for assistance. We occasionally experience customer service and technical support problems, including longer than expected waiting times for customers when our staffing and systems are inadequate to handle a higher than anticipated volume of requests. When we experience these problems, they can adversely affect customer relationships and our financial results (due to lost revenue because of our inability to accept orders for our products or increased costs). We also risk losing service at any one of our customer contact centers and our redundancy systems could prove inadequate to provide backup support. In addition, our customer focused business strategy presents additional technical support challenges as we increase the number and complexity of the products we offer, particularly for our QuickBooks, Consumer Tax and Vertical Business Management Solutions segments. To improve our performance in this area, we must eliminate underlying causes of service and support requests through product improvements, better order fulfillment processes, more robust self help tools, and improved ability to accurately anticipate demand for support. Implementing any of these improvements can be expensive, time consuming and ultimately prove unsuccessful. Given the nature of the products and services that we offer, our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal. Several of our businesses are highly seasonal particularly our tax businesses, but also our small business software and service offerings to a lesser extent. This causes significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results. Revenue and operating results are usually strongest during the second and third fiscal quarters ending January 31 and April 30. We experience lower revenues, and often significant operating losses, in the first and fourth quarters ending October 31 and July 31. Recently we have recognized an increasing portion of our Consumer Tax revenue in the third fiscal quarter compared to the second fiscal quarter. Our financial results can also fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of factors, including changes in product sales mix that affect average selling prices, product release dates, the timing of sales of our higher priced Vertical Business Management Solutions 45 Table of Contents offerings, our methods for distributing our products, including the shift to a consignment model for our consumer tax products that we sell through retail distribution channels, and the timing of acquisitions, dispositions, and goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairment charges. We face risks relating to customer privacy and security and increasing regulation, which could hinder the growth of our businesses and affect our financial performance. Despite our efforts to address customer concerns about privacy and security, these issues still pose a risk to our business, and we have experienced lawsuits and negative publicity relating to privacy issues. A major breach of customer privacy or security by Intuit, or even by another company, could have serious consequences for our businesses, including reduced customer demand for our products and or additional regulation by federal or state agencies. In addition, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant expenses to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols. If additional similar federal and state laws and or regulations (like the recently created federal Do Not Call List) that govern our direct marketing activities (such as telesales and email campaigns) are passed, our ability to communicate with our customers may be further limited and our compliance costs may increase, both of which could have a negative impact on our operating results. Moreover, in response to concerns about their customers privacy, third parties (such as Internet service providers) have developed, and may continue to develop, technology that limits or impedes our ability to communicate with our customers, particularly via email. We face several risks relating to our retail distribution channel through which we sell our core desktop software products (QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken). We face challenges with our relationships with retailers, including our ability to negotiate favorable terms with them, the risk that retailers could consolidate and potentially eliminate the number of retail locations in which our products are offered, and the negative effect of the current economic environment on retail sales generally. In addition, any change in significant business terms, termination or significant disruption of our relationship with any of our major resellers could result in a decline in our revenue. If any of our retailers experience financial difficulties, it could have an adverse effect on our operating expenses if uncollectible amounts from them exceed the bad debt reserves we have established. We face additional risks in the retail channel as we execute on our Customer Focused Product Strategy through which we offer a collection of products and services that are tailored for a wide range of customers with differing needs. We now offer several more stock keeping units (SKUs) than we have in the past and some of these products can be more complex and priced higher than our traditional retail software products and therefore pose new challenges for us in the retail channel. For example, to market our QuickBooks offerings at retail we have historically relied on product packaging, in store displays and other retail merchandising to educate customers about our products. However, because our industry specific versions of QuickBooks (which we call flavors) are priced higher, this strategy may prove less effective or ineffective given the increased need to educate potential customers about the added benefits of these products and the related higher pricing. As a result, we may need to incur additional expenses to develop other marketing programs that supplement our traditional in store promotional efforts to sell these products to customers. In addition, retailers may be reluctant to carry the higher priced SKUs because they are new offerings, and we have not yet been able to demonstrate demand for these products at levels that are desirable to our retailers. Finally, our Customer Focused Product Strategy and, in particular, our Right for My Business strategy is resulting in a greater number of Intuit products that were asking our retailers to stock. Therefore, we may experience difficulty in negotiating with our retailers to ensure that they will carry all of our SKUs and to ensure that they will carry an adequate supply of all of the different versions of our products in their stores. If retail distribution proves an ineffective channel for certain of our new offerings (and our QuickBooks flavors in particular), it could adversely impact our growth, revenue and profitability. Acquisition related costs can cause significant fluctuation in our net income. Our recent acquisitions have resulted in significant expenses, including amortization of purchased software (which is reflected in cost of revenue), as well as charges for in process research and development, and amortization and impairment of goodwill, purchased intangible assets and deferred compensation (which are reflected in operating expenses). Total acquisition related costs in the categories identified above were $263.0 million in fiscal 2001, $196.0 million in fiscal 2002 and $56.6 million in fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2003 acquisition related costs have declined primarily because of a change in the accounting treatment of goodwill. However, we may incur less frequent, but larger, impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions. As of July 31, 2003, we had an unamortized goodwill balance of approximately $591.1 million, which could be subject to impairment charges in the 46 Table of Contents future. Additional acquisitions, and any impairment of the value of purchased assets, could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results. If we are required to account for options under our employee stock plans as a compensation expense, it would significantly reduce our net income and earnings per share. Although we are not currently required to record any compensation expense in connection with option grants to employees that have an exercise price at or above fair market value, it is possible that future laws or regulations will require us to treat all employee stock options as a compensation expense. The increased compensation expense would significantly reduce our net income and earnings per share under generally accepted accounting principles. If actual product returns exceed returns reserves our revenue would be lower. We ship more desktop software products to our distributors and retailers than we expect them to sell, in order to reduce the risk that distributors or retailers will run out of products. This is particularly true for our Consumer Tax products, which have a short selling season and for which returns occur primarily in our fourth fiscal quarter. Like most software companies, we have historically accepted significant product returns. We establish reserves against revenue for product returns in our financial statements, based on estimated future returns of products. We closely monitor levels of product sales and inventory in the retail channel in an effort to maintain reserves that are adequate to cover expected returns. In the past, returns have not generally exceeded these reserves. However, if we do experience actual returns that significantly exceed reserves, it would result in lower net revenue. We rely on third party vendors to handle all outsourced aspects of manufacturing and distribution for our primary retail and primary direct desktop software products. To manufacture and distribute our primary retail products at the time of product launches and to replenish products in the retail channel after the primary launch, we have a manufacturing relationship with Modus Media, and a distribution arrangement with Ingram Micro Logistics. To manufacture and distribute our primary direct products (QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken), we have a manufacturing and distribution relationship with Arvato Services Inc. While we believe that relying on only three outsourcers for product launches and replenishment improves the efficiency and reliability of these activities, relying on any vendor for a significant aspect of our business can have severe negative consequences if the vendor fails to perform at acceptable service levels for any reason, including but not limited to financial difficulties of the vendor. Legal protection for our intellectual property is not always effective to prevent unauthorized use or copying. Current U.S. laws that prohibit copying give us only limited practical protection from software piracy and the laws of many other countries provide very little protection. Policing unauthorized use and copying of our products is difficult, expensive, and time consuming. In addition, efforts to protect our intellectual property may not be positively perceived by our customers. Although we continue to evaluate technology solutions to piracy, as well as increase our civil and criminal enforcement efforts, we expect piracy to be a persistent problem. Changes to federal or state laws and or regulations could impact our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights. Also, the Internet may tend to increase, and provide new methods for, illegal copying of our desktop and Internet based products and services. In addition, we face risks relating to licensing our intellectual property to third parties. For example, we licensed the use of the Quicken Loans and Quicken Mortgage trademarks to the purchaser of our Quicken Loans mortgage business. If the purchaser violates the terms of the trademark license, it could result in serious harm to Intuits reputation and serious and irreparable harm to the value of our Quicken related brands. We do not own all of the software, other technologies and content used in our products and services. We have the licenses from third parties that we believe are necessary for using technology and content that we do not own in our current products and services. From time to time we may be required to renegotiate with these third parties or negotiate with new third parties to include their technology or content in our existing products, in new versions of our current products or in new products. We may not be able to negotiate or renegotiate licenses on reasonable terms, or at all. If were unable to obtain the rights necessary to use third party technology or content in our products and services, we may not be able to sell the affected products, which would in turn have a negative impact on our revenue and operating results. We may unintentionally infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, which could expose us to substantial damages or restrict our business operations. As the number of our products and services increases and their features and content continue to expand, and as we acquire technology through acquisitions or licenses, we may increasingly become subject to infringement claims by third parties. From time to time, we have received communications from 47 Table of Contents third parties in which the claimant alleges that a product or service we offer infringes the claimants intellectual property rights. Occasionally these communications result in lawsuits. In many of these cases, it is difficult to assess the extent to which the intellectual property right that the claimant asserts is valid or the extent to which we have any material exposure. Past claims have not resulted in any significant litigation, settlement or licensing expenses, but future claims could present an exposure of uncertain magnitude. Existing or future infringement claims or lawsuits against us, whether valid or not, may be time consuming and expensive to defend. Intellectual property litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the following: cease selling, incorporating or using products or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property; obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property, which may not be available on commercially favorable terms or at all; or redesign our software products or services, possibly in a manner that reduces their commercial appeal. Any of these actions may cause material harm to our business and financial results. Specific Factors Affecting Our QuickBooks, Small Business Products and Services and Vertical Business Management Solutions Segments In our QuickBooks and our Small Business Products and Services businesses, we face a wide range of competitive risks that could impact our financial results. Our QuickBooks business faces current competition from competitors desktop and Web based software offerings. Many competitors and potential competitors have begun providing, or have expressed significant interest in providing, accounting and business management products and services to small businesses. As we expand the depth and breadth of our small business offerings, we face additional competition from others who are already offering industry specific small business solutions and business management tools and services for larger small businesses. Microsoft has several small business offerings that compete with our small business offerings, including Microsoft Business Solutions Small Business Manager, Microsoft Busines Solutions CRM and Business Contact Manager for Microsoft Office Outlook 2003. We expect that Microsoft small business offerings will continue to compete with our small business offerings, perhaps even more directly in the future. In addition, we face direct competition in our Intuit Payroll Services Complete Payroll business from traditional payroll services offered by a number of companies, including ADP and Paychex. Our financial supplies business faces ongoing pricing pressures from many of our competitors. As we implement our Right for My Business strategy we face increased competitive threats from larger companies in bigger markets than we have historically faced. We face competitive pressures in our Vertical Business Management Solutions segment. All of our Vertical Business Management Solutions businesses operate in highly competitive and fragmented environments where no competitor has a significant share of the market segment. We may experience pricing pressure in these market segments because we compete with many small companies, who have fewer resources than larger companies and are therefore more likely to focus on near term sales. In each of these market segments, the possibility exists that through either consolidation within the market segment or the entry into the market segment of new companies a significant competitor will emerge. It is too soon to provide assurance that we will be able to generate substantial and sustained revenue growth from new products and services in the QuickBooks, Small Business Products and Services and Vertical Business Management Solutions segments. To meet our growth goals, we must generate revenue from a wider range of market and customer segments, as well as from new products and services. There are a number of risks associated with our growth strategy, including: We may have difficulty identifying potential targets for acquisition. Our strategy depends on our successfully completing acquisitions and integrating acquired companies, which presents a number of challenges as described above under Company Wide Risk Factors. Our Right for My Business strategy is resulting in a dramatic increase in the number and complexity of the products and services that we offer. This places greater demands on our research and development, and marketing and sales resources, as we must develop, market and sell both the new products and services and periodic enhancements to an expanding portfolio of products and services. This will also require us to continually develop, expand and modify our internal business operations systems and procedures to gain better integration so we can support our new businesses, including our customer service and technical support contact centers, and our customer management, order management, billing and other systems. 48 Table of Contents Many of the new products and services we offer, and will be offering, are much more complex than our traditional core desktop software products and are priced accordingly. They will therefore require a more consultative sales process and a higher level of post sales support, both of which could result in higher selling and marketing expenses. If we are not able to effectively adapt our marketing, sales, distribution and customer support functions to accommodate these changes, we will not succeed in generating significant or sustained revenue or net income from these new businesses. Our acquisition strategy entails a number of challenges that could limit our successful implementation of the strategy. A key component of our Right for My Business strategy is to continue to expand our product and service offerings, and we expect to derive a significant portion of this expansion from acquisitions. We could face the following risks relating to our strategy and future acquisitions, in addition to the integration challenges noted above: Competition for acquisition opportunities could inhibit our ability to complete suitable acquisitions, and could also increase the price we would have to pay to complete acquisitions. If we are unable to complete acquisitions successfully, we may not be able to develop and market products for new industries or applications with which we may not be familiar. Despite our due diligence reviews, acquired businesses may bring with them unanticipated liabilities, business or legal risks or operating costs that could harm our results of operations or business, reduce or eliminate any benefits of the acquisition or require unanticipated expenses. Future acquisitions may require us to issue shares of our stock and stock options to owners of the acquired businesses, which would result in dilution to the equity interests of our stockholders. If we fail to retain the services of key employees of acquired companies for significant time periods after we acquire their companies, we may experience difficulty in managing the acquired companys business and not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Revenue growth for our Vertical Business Management Solutions segment may be hindered by a variety of factors, which could have a negative impact on overall company revenue growth. Revenue growth for our Vertical Business Management Solutions business is subject to numerous risks. Among these are the negative impact of the current economic environment on customer purchases of the relatively high priced software solutions offered by these businesses, strong pricing pressure in these markets because we compete with many small companies, who have fewer resources than larger companies and are therefore more likely to focus on near term sales, our ability to successfully acquire other companies and the potential disruption to the businesses of the acquired companies during the acquisition integration process. In addition, revenue growth in any particular period may be difficult to predict because of the complex revenue streams generated by these businesses, and the corresponding complexity in the accounting policies that apply to them. Our financial supplies business relies on a single source vendor. We have an exclusive contract with John H. Harland Company to print and fulfill supplies orders for all of our checks and most other products for our financial supplies business. Harland fulfilled orders for about 75% to 85% of our supplies revenue in fiscal 2001 and 2002, and almost 95% of our supplies revenue in fiscal 2003. We believe that relying on one vendor improves customer service and maximizes operational efficiencies for our supplies business. However, if there are significant problems with Harlands performance, it could have a material negative impact on sales of supplies and on Intuits financial results as a whole. Our payroll businesses face a number of risks that could have a negative impact on revenue and profitability. For our payroll businesses, we must process customer data accurately, reliably and timely in order to attract and retain customers and avoid the costs associated with errors. We must also accurately and timely develop new and upgraded payroll products to enable our customers to meet the various regulatory deadlines associated with employer related payroll activities. If we failed to timely deliver any of our payroll products, it could cause our current and prospective customers to choose a competitors product for that years payroll and not to purchase Intuit products in the future. In order to generate sustained growth for our Intuit Payroll Services Complete Payroll, we will be required to successfully develop and manage a more extensive and proactive direct field sales operation, which is a different distribution method than those we have historically utilized. As our payroll businesses involve the processing of large amounts of payroll funds and the remittance of large amounts of income taxes, there is a potential for errors in processing the payments or misappropriation of payroll funds by either our customers 49 Table of Contents employees or our own employees. Any such error or misappropriation could subject Intuit to liabilities that could be substantial. In addition, we are authorized by our customers to transfer money from their bank accounts to fund amounts owed to their employees and taxing authorities. It is possible that we could be held liable for such amounts in the event the client has insufficient funds to cover them. Moreover, our payroll businesses, other than our Do It Yourself product, include as part of their revenue interest on customer deposits not yet remitted to taxing authorities or to customers employees. If interest rates decline, or there take effect regulatory changes either decreasing the amount of taxes withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to taxing authorities, it would result in less interest revenue for those businesses. If any of the above eventualities came to pass, it could have a negative impact on the revenue, profitability and future growth of our payroll businesses. Specific Factors Affecting Our Consumer Tax and Professional Accounting Solutions Segments We face intense competitive pressures from both the private and public sectors in our Consumer Tax and Professional Accounting Solutions businesses that could have a negative impact on revenue, profitability and market position. There are formidable current and potential competitors in the private sector for both our consumer and professional tax products, and we expect competition to remain intense in the future. Our major domestic competitor for both desktop and Web based consumer tax software continues to be HR Block, the makers of TaxCut software, and our largest professional tax competitors are CCH Incorporated, with its ProSystem fx product line; Kleinrock Publishing, with its ATX product line; and the Thomson Corporation, with its Creative Solutions and GoSystem offerings. These competitive pressures can have a negative impact on our revenue, profitability and market position. In addition, we face current and potential competition from a number of publicly funded government entities that are offering individual taxpayers electronic tax preparation and or filing services, at no cost to individual taxpayers. If governmental agencies are able to develop consumer tax preparation and filing services and to gain consumer acceptance of those services, it could have a negative impact on our financial results in future years. The federal government signed a three year Free File Alliance agreement in October 2002 under which a number of private sector companies, rather than the federal government, are providing Web based federal tax preparation and filing services at no cost through voluntary public services initiatives such as our Intuit Tax Freedom Project. However, future administrative, regulatory or legislative activity in this area could have a strong adverse impact the financial performance of our Consumer Tax and Professional Accounting Solutions businesses. The product activation technology that we introduced into certain TurboTax desktop products last year could have an adverse impact on this years results for our Consumer Tax business. During tax year 2002, federal versions of TurboTax desktop products for Windows included product activation technology that helped to prevent unlicensed users from using pass along and or counterfeit copies of TurboTax to print or electronically file a tax return. The introduction of product activation generated negative commentary in the media and in online forums and also resulted in a modest increase in the volume of customers contacting our customer service and technical support centers. While we have publicly announced that we will not include product activation in retail versions of TurboTax for Windows for the upcoming tax season, there is uncertainty about whether the negative publicity and customer reactions to, and experiences with, this technology last year will impact our Consumer Tax business this year. Any significant negative repercussions relating to product activation could adversely impact our fiscal 2004 results for our Consumer Tax business, in particular, and our financial performance as a whole. Significant problems or delays in developing our Consumer Tax and Professional Tax products would result in lost revenue and customers. Developing tax preparation software presents a unique challenge because of the demanding annual development cycle required to incorporate unpredictable tax law and tax form changes each year and because our customers expect high levels of accuracy and a timely launch of these products. Our tax preparation software business, which represents a substantial portion of our annual revenue, is highly seasonal since the customers in that market generally prepare and file their taxes by April 15. A significantly late product launch could result in lost revenue and lost customers. It could cause our current and prospective customers to choose a competitors product for that years tax season or to choose not to purchase tax preparation software at all. These risks could result in lost revenue in the current tax year and would make it more difficult for us to sell our products to customers in future tax seasons. Moreover, the rigid development timetable increases the risk of errors in our products and the risk of launch delays. Any major defects could lead to negative publicity, customer dissatisfaction and incremental 50 Table of Contents operating expenses, including expenses resulting from our commitment to reimburse penalties and interest paid by consumer customers due solely to calculation errors in our products. If we fail to maintain reliable and responsive service levels for our electronic tax offerings, we could lose revenue and customers. Our Web based tax preparation and electronic filing services must effectively handle extremely heavy customer demand during the peak tax season and the exact level of demand for these offerings is difficult to predict. We face significant risks and challenges in maintaining these services and maintaining adequate service levels, particularly during peak volume service times. For example, we experienced a relatively brief unscheduled interruption in our electronic filing service on April 15, 2003 during which certain users of our professional tax products were unable to receive confirmation from us that their electronic filing had been accepted. We also experienced relatively brief unscheduled interruptions in our electronic filing.and or tax preparation services during tax years 1999 and 2000, and we reached maximum capacity for a short period on April 15, 2002. We also face risks related to the performance of our redundancy and data recoverability systems in these businesses. If our redundancy and data recoverability systems are inadequate, then we could lose the ability to provide these services or provided these services at inadequate levels to our customers. If we experience any prolonged difficulties with our Web based tax preparation or electronic filing service at any time during the tax season, we could lose current and future customers, receive negative publicity and incur increased operating costs, any of which could have a significant negative impact on the financial and market success of these businesses and have a negative impact on our near term and long term financial results. Increased state filing mandates could significantly increase our costs. We are required to comply with a variety of state revenue agency standards in order to successfully operate our tax preparation and electronic filing services. Changes in state imposed requirements by one or more of the states, including the required use of specific technologies or technology standards, could significantly increase the costs of providing those services to our customers. If we are unable to significantly increase accountant facilitated sales, it could have a negative impact on revenue growth. We are currently focused on developing relationships with accounting professionals in order to expand our opportunities to sell small business products and services to their clients under our Right for My Firm, Right for My Clients strategy. We view this strategy as an important driver for our Professional Accounting Solutions segment, as well as our QuickBooks and Small Business Products and Services businesses. However, since this is a new model for us, we face several risks associated with it, including the risk that we will not be able to effectively execute this strategy and the risk that we will not derive the anticipated benefits (including financial benefits) from this strategy. We face intense competition in this effort, as there are an increasing number of alliances between accountants and other professional tax preparers and providers of small business software and services that aim to capitalize on accountant facilitated sales of small business products and services to their clients. Specific Factors Affecting Our Other Businesses Segment Our Other Businesses products face competition that could have a negative impact on revenue, profitability and market position. Our Quicken products compete domestically and internationally directly with Microsoft Money, which is aggressively promoted and priced. We expect competitive pressures for Quicken to continue, both from Microsoft Money and from Web based personal finance tracking and management tools that are becoming increasingly available at no cost to consumers. Competitive pressures can result in reduced revenue and lower profitability for our Quicken product line. In Canada, we face competition from a number of companies in the small business, consumer tax and professional tax businesses. The long term viability of our personal finance business will depend on our ability to provide new products and services that attract customers. The demand for personal finance desktop software products such as our Quicken offering has been weakening over recent years due to the increasing availability of free Web based personal finance tracking and management tools through financial institutions and others. In addition, the demand for Internet advertising on Web sites like Quicken.com has declined precipitously. We must identify and capitalize on additional sources of revenue for our personal finance business to continue to grow that business and we face the risk that any approach that we take to increase revenue for this business may not succeed. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Short Term Investment Portfolio We do not hold derivative financial instruments in our short term investment portfolio. Our short term investments consist of instruments that meet quality standards consistent with our investment policy. This policy specifies that, except for direct obligations of the United States government and money market or cash management funds, we diversify our holdings and limit our short term investments with any individual issuer to a maximum of $5.0 million in each of our three managed portfolios. The following table of our short term investments portfolio is classified by the original maturity date listed on the security and reflects instruments with both taxable and tax exempt interest rates. Principal Amounts by Stated Maturity (In thousands, except interest rates) Years Ending July 31, 2008 Fair Value and July 31, 2004 2005 2006 2007 Thereafter Total 2003 Cash Equivalents $ 147,536 $ 147,536 $ 147,536 Average Interest Rate 1.16 % 1.16 % Short term Investments $ 241,110 $ 270,900 $ 3,088 $ 9,400 $ 512,260 $ 1,036,758 $ 1,036,758 Average Interest Rate 1.75 % 1.33 % 1.30 % 0.88 % 0.92 % 1.22 % Total Portfolio $ 388,646 $ 270,900 $ 3,088 $ 9,400 $ 512,260 $ 1,184,294 $ 1,184,294 Average Interest Rate 1.52 % 1.33 % 1.30 % 0.88 % 0.92 % 1.21 % Interest Rate Risk Our cash equivalents and short term investment portfolio are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents and short term investments and the value of those investments. Over the past few years, we have experienced significant reductions in our interest income due to declines in interest rates. These declines have led to interest rates that are low by historical standards and we do not believe that further decreases in interest rates will have a material impact on the interest income earned on our cash equivalents and short term investments held at July 31, 2003. Impact of Foreign Currency Rate Changes We translate foreign currencies (primarily Canadian dollars and British pounds) into U.S dollars for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results, though the historical impact has generally been immaterial. We believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not significant primarily because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies. There was a nominal currency exchange impact from our intercompany transactions for fiscal 2001 and 2002. Due to the effect of the weakening U.S. dollar on intercompany balances with our Canadian subsidiary, we recorded foreign currency exchange gains of $5.4 million in fiscal 2003. Although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial in the past and we believe that for the reasons cited above currency fluctuations will not be significant in the future, there can be no guarantee that the impact of currency fluctuations will not be material in the future. As of July 31, 2003, we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities. 52 Table of Contents
