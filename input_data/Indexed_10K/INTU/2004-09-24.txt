ITEM 7 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS We begin our Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MDA) with a discussion of the Critical Accounting Policies that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments underlying our financial statements. This is followed by a discussion of our Results of Operations that begins with an Overview followed by a more detailed discussion of our revenue and expenses. We then provide an analysis of our Liquidity and Capital Resources with a discussion of key aspects of our statements of cash flows, changes in our balance sheets, and our financial commitments. Following these discussions is the section entitled Risks That Could Affect Future Results which details some important factors that may significantly impact our future financial performance. You should also note that this MDA discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Please see the section entitled Caution Regarding Forward Looking Statements at the end of this Item 7 for important information to consider when evaluating such statements. You should read this MDA in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes in Item 8. As discussed below, we sold our Quicken Loans mortgage business in fiscal 2002 and our Japanese subsidiary, Intuit KK, in fiscal 2003 and accounted for the sales of these businesses as discontinued operations. Accordingly, we have reclassified our financial statements for all periods prior to the sales to reflect these businesses as discontinued operations. Unless otherwise noted, the following discussion pertains only to our continuing operations. Critical Accounting Policies In preparing our financial statements, we make estimates, assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue, operating income or loss and net income or loss, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Senior management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and their disclosure in this Report with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Net Revenue Revenue Recognition. Intuit derives revenues from the sale of packaged software products, license fees, product support, professional services, outsourced payroll services, transaction fees and multiple element arrangements that may include any combination of these items. We follow the appropriate revenue recognition rules for each type of revenue. See Note 1 to the financial statements, Net Revenue. We generally recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable. However, determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report. For example, for multiple element arrangements we must make assumptions and judgments in order to allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver, to determine whether undelivered services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services, to determine whether vendor specific evidence of fair value exists for each undelivered element and to determine whether and when each element has been delivered. If we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments, it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period. Amounts for fees collected or invoiced and due relating to arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized when the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied. Net Revenue Return and Rebate Reserves. As part of our revenue recognition policy, we estimate future product returns and rebate payments and establish reserves against revenue at the time of sale based on these estimates. Our return policy allows distributors and retailers, subject to certain contractual limitations, to return purchased products. Product returns by distributors and retailers relate primarily to the return of obsolete products. In determining our product returns reserves, we consider the volume and price mix of products in the retail channel, historical return rates for prior releases of the product, trends in retailer inventory and economic trends that might impact customer demand for our products (including the competitive environment and the timing of new releases of our products). We fully reserve for obsolete products in the distribution channels. 22 Table of Contents Our rebate reserves include distributor and retailer sales incentive rebates and end user rebates. Our estimated reserves for distributor and retailer incentive rebates are based on distributors and retailers actual performance against the terms and conditions of rebate programs, which we typically establish annually. Our reserves for end user rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the specific promotional rebate program, actual sales during the promotion, the amount of redemptions received and historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program. In the past, actual returns and rebates have approximated and not generally exceeded the reserves that we have established. However, actual returns and rebates in any future period are inherently uncertain. If we were to change our assumptions and estimates, our revenue reserves would change, which would impact the net revenue we report. If actual returns and rebates are significantly greater than the reserves we have established, the actual results would decrease our future reported revenue. Conversely, if actual returns and rebates are significantly less than our reserves, this would increase our future reported revenue. For example, if we had increased our fiscal 2004 returns reserves by 1% of non consignment sales to retailers for QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken, our fiscal 2004 total net revenue would have been $4.0 million lower. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. We make ongoing assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable. The accounts receivable amount on our balance sheet includes a reserve for accounts that might not be paid. In determining the amount of the reserve, we consider our historical level of credit losses. We also make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations, and we assess current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future. Our reserves have generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses. However, since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, we cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be adequate. If actual credit losses are significantly greater than the reserve we have established, that would increase our general and administrative expenses and reduce our reported net income. Conversely, if actual credit losses are significantly less than our reserve, this would eventually decrease our general and administrative expenses and increase our reported net income. Goodwill, Purchased Intangible Assets and Other Long Lived Assets Impairment Assessments. We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than temporary impairment in the remaining value of the assets recorded on our balance sheet may exist. We test the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise. The timing of the formal annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods. In order to estimate the fair value of long lived assets, we typically make various assumptions about the future prospects for the business that the asset relates to, consider market factors specific to that business and estimate future cash flows to be generated by that business. We evaluate cash flows at the lowest operating level and the number of reporting units that we have identified may make impairment more probable than it would be at a company with fewer reporting units and integrated operations following acquisitions. Based on these assumptions and estimates, we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset stated on our balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results. More conservative assumptions of the anticipated future benefits from these businesses could result in impairment charges, which would decrease net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet. Conversely, less conservative assumptions could result in smaller or no impairment charges, higher net income and higher asset values. We recorded impairment charges for goodwill and purchased intangible assets of $27.3 million in fiscal 2002 and $18.7 million in fiscal 2004. At July 31, 2004, we had $670.0 million in goodwill and $107.3 million in net purchased intangible assets on our balance sheet. Accounting for Stock Based Incentive Programs. We currently measure compensation expense for our stock based incentive programs using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board, or APB, Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Under this method, we do not record compensation expense when stock options are granted to eligible participants as long as the 23 Table of Contents exercise price is not less than the fair market value of the stock when the option is granted. We also do not record compensation expense for shares purchased in connection with our Employee Stock Purchase Plan as long as the purchase price of the stock is not less than 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the stock at the beginning of each offering period or at the end of each purchase period. In accordance with SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and SFAS 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, we disclose our pro forma net income or loss and net income or loss per share as if the fair value based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense for our stock based incentive programs. We have elected to follow APB 25 because the fair value accounting provided for under SFAS 123 requires the use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares. On March 31, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued its exposure draft, Share Based Payment, which is a proposed amendment to SFAS 123. The exposure draft would require all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options and purchases under employee stock purchase plans, to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values. The FASB expects to issue a final standard late in 2004 that would be effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2004. We have not yet assessed the impact of adopting this new standard. We monitor progress at the FASB and other developments with respect to stock based incentive compensation. We may have to recognize substantially more compensation expense in future periods if we are required or elect to expense the value of stock based incentive compensation or if we decide to alter our current employee compensation programs to provide other benefits in place of incentive stock options. Income Taxes Estimates of Effective Tax Rates, Deferred Taxes and Valuation Allowance. When we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We record an additional amount in our provision for income taxes in the period in which we determine that our recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate tax assessment to be. If in a later period we determine that payment of this additional amount is unnecessary, we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit in that later period. As a result, our ongoing assessments of the probable outcomes of the audit issues and related tax positions require judgment and can materially increase or decrease our effective tax rate as well as impact our operating results. This also requires us to estimate our current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which we show on our consolidated balance sheet. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized. To the extent we believe that realization is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. When we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period, we record a corresponding tax expense on our statement of operations. Our net deferred tax asset at July 31, 2004 was $167.2 million, net of the valuation allowance of $7.5 million. We recorded the valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets (consisting primarily of certain net operating losses carried forward by our international subsidiaries and certain state capital loss carryforwards) before they expire. The valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable. While we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, we could be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize. An increase in the valuation allowance would have an adverse impact, which could be material, on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we make the increase. 24 Table of Contents Results of Operations Overview Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal 2002 2003 2003 2004 (Dollars in millions, except per 2002 2003 2004 % Change % Change share amounts) Total net revenue $ 1,312.2 $ 1,650.7 $ 1,867.7 26 % 13 % Income from continuing operations 50.5 343.2 420.3 580 % 22 % Net income from continuing operations 53.6 263.2 317.0 391 % 20 % Diluted net income per share from continuing operations $ 0.24 $ 1.25 $ 1.58 421 % 26 % Net cash provided by operating activities $ 351.6 $ 570.2 $ 574.6 62 % 1 % In fiscal 2004 we revised our reportable segments to reflect the way we currently manage our operations and view our results. Our five business segments are now QuickBooks Related, Intuit Branded Small Business, Consumer Tax, Professional Tax and Other Businesses. Total net revenue increased in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 primarily due to growth in our QuickBooks Related and Consumer Tax segments. Fiscal 2004 growth in our QuickBooks Related segment was driven by sales of higher priced versions of QuickBooks and by continuing growth in the QuickBooks Do It Yourself Payroll, or DIY, customer base and average selling prices, which resulted in higher DIY revenue. Total net revenue increased in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 primarily due to growth in our QuickBooks Related and Consumer Tax segments, with the QuickBooks Related revenue increase fueled by sales of higher priced versions of QuickBooks and by DIY revenue. Fiscal 2003 revenue also increased compared with fiscal 2002 because of acquisitions in our Intuit Branded Small Business segment. The markets for many of our products are maturing and as a result we believe that our revenue growth is slowing. We continue to develop new products and services to mitigate the impact of this slowing growth in the long term. Income from continuing operations grew faster than revenue in fiscal 2004 primarily due to an increase in revenue from higher margin products, such as industry specific versions of QuickBooks and DIY, and to the fact that we reduced costs while revenue grew in our Quicken business. Income from continuing operations grew faster than revenue in fiscal 2003 primarily due to an increase in revenue from higher margin products, efficiencies in customer service and technical support, significantly lower acquisition related charges in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 charges for vacant facilities, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, and impairment of long lived assets that did not recur in fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2003 acquisition related charges were significantly lower compared with fiscal 2002 because due to our adoption of SFAS 142 fiscal 2003 acquisition related charges do not include amortization of goodwill. Net income (after tax) from continuing operations grew faster than revenue in fiscal 2004 primarily due to the factors cited above and the reversal of $35.7 million in reserves related to potential income tax exposures that were resolved, partially offset by lower interest and other income and lower gains on marketable securities and other investments. Net income (after tax) from continuing operations grew faster than revenue in fiscal 2003 primarily due to the factors cited above and to higher interest and other income and gains on marketable securities and other investments in fiscal 2003, partially offset by a fiscal 2002 gain on divestiture of businesses that did not recur in fiscal 2003 and a higher effective tax rate in fiscal 2003 than in fiscal 2002. Diluted net income per share from continuing operations grew faster than net income (after tax) from continuing operations for fiscal 2004 and 2003 primarily due to the net reduction of average shares outstanding resulting from repurchases of stock under our stock repurchase programs. At July 31, 2004, our cash, cash equivalents and short term investments totaled $1.0 billion. In fiscal 2004 we generated cash primarily from continuing operations and the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans and we used cash primarily for our stock repurchase programs, acquisitions and capital expenditures. In fiscal 2004 we bought 13.5 million shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs at an average price of $45.01 for a total price of $609.4 million. We completed our third stock repurchase program in June 2004 and at July 31, 2004 authorized funds of $500.0 million remained available under our fourth program. 25 Table of Contents Total Net Revenue The table below and the discussion of total net revenue that follows it are categorized by our five reportable business segments. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 we revised our reportable segments to reflect the way we currently manage our operations and view our results. We combined our fiscal 2003 QuickBooks segment with the businesses from our fiscal 2003 Small Business Products and Services segment that relate to and support QuickBooks to form the fiscal 2004 segment called QuickBooks Related. We also combined our outsourced payroll and information technology businesses with our fiscal 2003 Vertical Business Management Solutions segment to form the fiscal 2004 segment called Intuit Branded Small Business. We made no changes to our Consumer Tax, Professional Tax and Other Businesses segments. We have reclassified previously reported fiscal 2003 and 2002 segment results to be consistent with the fiscal 2004 presentation. We reclassified a total of $28.1 million for certain fiscal 2003 electronic filing revenue in our Consumer Tax and Professional Tax segments from product revenue to service revenue to be consistent with our fiscal 2004 presentation. Total fiscal 2003 revenue for each of these segments did not change as a result of these reclassifications. See Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information about our business segments. % Total % Total % Total Fiscal Net Fiscal Net Fiscal Net 2002 2003 2003 2004 (Dollars in millions) 2002 Revenue 2003 Revenue 2004 Revenue % Change % Change QuickBooks Related Product $ 396.6 $ 465.1 $ 534.1 Service 50.1 70.5 97.1 Other 13.4 17.0 22.7 Subtotal 460.1 35 % 552.6 33 % 653.9 35 % 20 % 18 % Intuit Branded Small Business Product 9.1 63.0 72.3 Service 77.6 173.4 195.0 Other 0.3 3.5 5.1 Subtotal 87.0 7 % 239.9 15 % 272.4 15 % 176 % 14 % Consumer Tax Product 219.4 231.1 231.7 Service 128.4 189.2 257.9 Other 3.3 2.6 0.4 Subtotal 351.1 27 % 422.9 26 % 490.0 26 % 20 % 16 % Professional Tax Product 219.2 223.8 226.1 Service 6.5 19.6 25.8 Other Subtotal 225.7 17 % 243.4 15 % 251.9 13 % 8 % 3 % Other Businesses Product 129.5 141.2 148.2 Service 7.3 4.5 7.8 Other 51.5 46.2 43.5 Subtotal 188.3 14 % 191.9 11 % 199.5 11 % 2 % 4 % Total net revenue $ 1,312.2 100 % $ 1,650.7 100 % $ 1,867.7 100 % 26 % 13 % 26 Table of Contents Fiscal 2004 total net revenue increased compared with fiscal 2003 primarily due to growth in DIY revenue in our QuickBooks Related segment and to growth in TurboTax for the Web and electronic filing services in our Consumer Tax segment. Fiscal 2003 total net revenue increased over fiscal 2002 primarily due to higher revenue in our QuickBooks Related, Consumer Tax and Intuit Branded Small Business segments. In fiscal 2003 our Intuit Branded Small Business segment included revenue from the date of acquisition for three companies we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 and one company we acquired in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Total Net Revenue by Business Segment QuickBooks Related QuickBooks Related product revenue is derived primarily from QuickBooks desktop software products; QuickBooks Do It Yourself Payroll, or DIY, which offers payroll tax tables, forms and electronic tax payment and filing on a subscription basis to small businesses that prepare their own payrolls; and financial supplies such as paper checks, envelopes and invoices. QuickBooks Related service revenue is derived primarily from QuickBooks Online Edition, QuickBooks support plans and merchant services. Other revenue for this segment consists primarily of royalties from small business online services. Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003. QuickBooks Related total net revenue grew in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 due to increased sales of higher priced industry specific versions of QuickBooks and higher DIY revenue driven by growth in the average customer base, an increase in QuickBooks related services and the full impact in fiscal 2004 of a December 2002 price increase. Our October 2003 acquisition of Innovative Merchant Solutions also contributed to the higher fiscal 2004 total net revenue. Fiscal 2003 Compared with Fiscal 2002. QuickBooks Related total net revenue increased in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002, reflecting higher QuickBooks unit sales as well as higher average selling prices driven by the introduction of certain higher priced QuickBooks products and a shift in revenue mix toward those products. DIY revenue increased due to growth in the average customer base and higher average selling prices driven by price increases. QuickBooks support revenue grew due to an increase in the number of support plans sold and strength in the higher priced support plans for higher end QuickBooks products. Intuit Branded Small Business Intuit Branded Small Business product revenue is derived primarily from business management software for information technology and four selected industries: wholesale durable goods; residential, commercial and corporate property management; construction; and nonprofit organizations, universities and government agencies. In August 2004 management formally approved a plan to sell our Intuit Public Sector Solutions business. Intuit Branded Small Business service revenue is derived from technical support, consulting and training services for those software products and from outsourced payroll services. Service revenue for this segment also includes interest earned on funds held for payroll customers. Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003. Intuit Branded Small Business total net revenue increased in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 primarily due to new client acquisition in our wholesale durable goods and property management solutions businesses as well as higher average selling prices from increased customer use of support and other services in these businesses and in our information technology business. Fiscal 2003 Compared with Fiscal 2002. Intuit Branded Small Business total net revenue was higher in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 due to our acquisition of several businesses. Higher outsourced payroll revenue in fiscal 2003 was primarily a result of our acquisition of CBS Employer Services, Inc. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. We also acquired our wholesale durable goods, property management and nonprofit businesses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. They contributed $80.6 million in revenue for fiscal 2003 compared with $3.4 million in fiscal 2002. Finally, we acquired Intuit Information Technology Solutions in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. 27 Table of Contents Consumer Tax Consumer Tax product revenue is derived primarily from TurboTax federal and state consumer desktop tax return preparation software. Consumer Tax service revenue is derived primarily from TurboTax for the Web online tax return preparation services and consumer electronic filing services. Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003. Consumer Tax total net revenue increased in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 as a result of TurboTax for the Web and retail desktop unit growth, higher attach rates for electronic filing services and higher average selling prices. Fiscal 2003 Compared with Fiscal 2002. Consumer Tax total net revenue grew in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 due to an increase in desktop revenue that was driven by unit growth and higher average selling prices for federal tax offerings with enhanced functionality; higher TurboTax for the Web revenue due to unit growth and higher average selling prices; and an increase in electronic filing revenue due to higher federal desktop unit sales and higher average state electronic filing prices. Professional Tax Professional Tax product revenue is derived primarily from ProSeries and Lacerte professional tax preparation software products. Professional Tax service revenue consists of electronic filing and training services. Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003. Professional Tax total net revenue grew slightly in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 due to additional sales to existing customers, higher average selling prices related to product enhancements and increased sales of our unlimited electronic filing product as a result of new government rules requiring the electronic filing of certain professionally prepared 2003 income tax returns. However, revenue growth in fiscal 2004 was negatively impacted by competition from lower priced professional tax preparation software products. Although we have revised our product strategy to address this competition for the 2004 tax year, it is possible that this competition may continue to negatively affect revenue growth rates for our Professional Tax segment in the future. Fiscal 2003 Compared with Fiscal 2002. Professional Tax total net revenue grew in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 due to price increases related to product enhancements, new customer acquisition initiatives and successful cross sell efforts to the existing tax client base. Renewal rates for our existing customer base remained strong during fiscal 2003. Other Businesses Other Businesses consist primarily of Quicken and Canada. Quicken product revenue is derived primarily from Quicken desktop software products. Quicken other revenue consists primarily of fees from consumer online transactions and from Quicken branded credit card and bill payment offerings that we provide through our partners. We exited the online advertising business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. In Canada, product revenue is derived primarily from localized versions of QuickBooks and Quicken as well as QuickTax and TaxWiz consumer desktop tax return preparation software and ProFile professional tax preparation products. Service revenue in Canada consists primarily of revenue from software maintenance contracts sold with QuickBooks. Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003. Other Businesses total net revenue grew slightly in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 primarily due to higher Quicken revenue. In fiscal 2004 Quicken direct unit sales increased in response to direct mail campaigns for upgrades due to the discontinuation of support for older versions of the product and for TurboTax cross selling offers. Retail unit sales also increased. Aggregate average selling prices for Quicken were higher in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 due to a shift in demand to our higher priced Quicken Premier and Quicken Home and Business products. Partially offsetting these increases, Quicken other revenue declined in fiscal 2004 due to the expiration or termination of contracts with several significant online advertising customers. We exited the online advertising business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. 28 Table of Contents Canadian revenue in U.S. dollars was slightly higher in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 due to the favorable effect of the strengthening Canadian dollar in fiscal 2004. Total net revenue in Canadian dollars decreased in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003, primarily due to lower demand for QuickBooks in Canada. QuickTax revenue was also down in fiscal 2004 due to a decline in unit sales that was partially offset by higher average selling prices related to a shift in demand toward the higher priced specialty versions of that product. Fiscal 2003 Compared with Fiscal 2002. Other Businesses total net revenue increased slightly in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002. Quicken revenue decreased while Canadian revenue grew. Quicken product revenue decreased due to lack of growth in the market for personal finance desktop software and slow consumer spending. Lower unit sales for all Quicken products more than offset higher average selling prices for Quicken Premier and Quicken Home and Business. Quicken other revenue also decreased due to continuing slowness in Internet advertising and our exit from certain online businesses in fiscal 2002. Total net revenue from Canada grew in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002, due partially to slightly higher revenue from QuickTax. Higher average selling prices and higher unit sales for this product were fueled by the introduction of Right for Me consumer tax products targeted at taxpayers who maintain home offices or who are preparing for retirement. Our new TaxWiz consumer tax preparation software also contributed to fiscal 2003 revenue growth. Canadian QuickBooks revenue for fiscal 2003 declined due to lack of growth in the software category and decreases in the level of inventory purchasing by retailers.

Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003. Cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue decreased slightly in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003. This was primarily due to a continuing shift toward sales of our higher priced QuickBooks products and to lower royalties incurred for our Consumer Tax and Quicken products. Cost of service revenue as a percentage of service revenue decreased in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003. This decrease was due to growth in our Consumer Tax service revenue, which had minimal incremental costs. Cost of service revenue as a percentage of service revenue also decreased in fiscal 2004 due to growth in revenue from the higher margin businesses we acquired during fiscal 2003 and 2004, notably Intuit Information Technology Solutions and Innovative Merchant Solutions. Cost of other revenue as a percentage of other revenue increased in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003. This was primarily due to declining Quicken other revenue resulting from the fiscal 2004 expiration or termination of contracts with several significant online advertising customers, which had minimal associated costs. We exited the online advertising business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. 29 Table of Contents Fiscal 2003 Compared with Fiscal 2002. Cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue decreased slightly in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002. This was primarily due to a shift toward sales of our new higher priced QuickBooks products, which have higher margins per unit, and to cost reductions due to improvements in packaging design and manufacturing processes during fiscal 2003. Cost of service revenue as a percentage of service revenue decreased in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 primarily as a result of growth in our outsourced payroll business during fiscal 2003. In addition, starting in the third quarter of fiscal 2003 we no longer paid royalties to Wells Fargo Bank for our Premier Payroll Service. Although we amortized the $29.2 million purchase price of the right to market to this customer base to cost of service revenue in fiscal 2003, the amortization expense was less than the royalties that would have been incurred under the old agreement. Cost of other revenue as a percentage of other revenue decreased in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002. In the first quarter of fiscal 2002, we moved a large number of servers that supported our Quicken.com Web site from an external hosting company to our own data center and streamlined the infrastructure. Over time, this led to decreased cost of other revenue for this business.

Total core operating expenses increased in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 and in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002. Individually and in the aggregate, core operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenue were generally consistent in these 30 Table of Contents periods. Operating expenses that changed by more than 1% of total net revenue from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2004 are discussed below. Customer Service and Technical Support Customer service and technical support expenses declined as a percentage of total net revenue in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 and in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002. We continued to increase our efficiency in these periods by improving our utilization of internal customer service representatives and by outsourcing some of our seasonal call center capabilities. We also increased the proportion of customer service and technical support we provide through less expensive methods such as Web sites, online chat, email and other electronic means. These benefits were partially offset by higher demand for customer service and technical support due to the increased number of our offerings. General and Administrative General administrative expenses increased as a percentage of total net revenue in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 and in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 due to increased spending for infrastructure and new information systems. Acquisition Related Charges Fiscal 2004 and 2003 acquisition related charges declined significantly compared with fiscal 2002. Fiscal 2002 acquisition related charges included the amortization of goodwill. Due to our adoption of SFAS 142, fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 acquisition related charges did not include the amortization of goodwill. Loss on Impairment of Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, events and circumstances indicated impairment of goodwill that we recorded in connection with our acquisition of Intuit Public Sector Solutions. IPSS became part of our Intuit Branded Small Business segment. The primary indicator of impairment was the fact that actual sales levels did not meet initial projections. Based on our analysis, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 we recorded a charge of $18.7 million to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill to $10.9 million. In August 2004 management formally approved a plan to sell IPSS. See Note 4 to the financial statements. The fiscal 2002 loss on impairment of goodwill and purchased intangible assets related to certain Internet based businesses in our Intuit Branded Small Business and Other Businesses segments. Indicators of impairment included a steep decline in demand for online advertising reflecting the industry wide decline in Internet advertising spending and our decision to eliminate the use of certain technology purchased from one of the businesses. Based on our analyses, in the second quarter of fiscal 2002 we recorded charges totaling $27.3 million to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill and purchased intangible assets associated with these businesses to zero. See Note 4 to the financial statements. Loss on Impairment of Long Lived Asset In connection with the sale of our Quicken Bill Manager business in May 2001, we acquired a $27.0 million long term asset related to future consideration from the buyer. During fiscal 2002, events and circumstances indicated impairment of this asset and we recorded a charge of $27.0 million to reduce its carrying value to zero. See Note 10 to the financial statements. Segment Operating Income (Loss) Segment operating income or loss is segment net revenue less segment cost of revenue and operating expenses. Segment expenses do not include certain costs, such as corporate general and administrative expenses that are not allocated to specific segments. In addition, segment expenses do not include acquisition related costs, which include acquisition related charges, goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairment charges, amortization of purchased software and charges for purchased research and development. Segment expenses also do not include realized net 31 Table of Contents gains or losses on marketable securities and other investments, and interest and other income. See Note 11 to the financial statements for reconciliations of total segment operating income to income from operations for each fiscal year presented. % of % of % of Fiscal Related Fiscal Related Fiscal Related 2002 2003 2003 2004 (Dollars in millions) 2002 Revenue 2003 Revenue 2004 Revenue % Change % Change QuickBooks Related $ 207.8 45 % $ 247.6 45 % $ 289.0 44 % 19 % 17 % Intuit Branded Small Business (29.6 ) (34 %) (0.2 ) 11.7 4 % 99 % NM Consumer Tax 218.0 62 % 271.6 64 % 320.3 65 % 25 % 18 % Professional Tax 121.9 54 % 141.4 58 % 138.5 55 % 16 % 2 % Other Businesses 38.5 20 % 57.8 30 % 66.0 33 % 50 % 14 % Total segment operating income $ 556.6 42 % $ 718.2 44 % $ 825.5 44 % 29 % 15 % QuickBooks Related Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003. The increase in QuickBooks Related segment operating income in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 was primarily due to 18% higher revenue that included strong growth in our high margin DIY payroll business. In addition, fiscal 2004 operating income for this segment included operating income for Innovative Merchant Solutions, which we acquired in the first quarter of fiscal 2004. These factors were partially offset by increases in spending for QuickBooks product development, technical support, marketing programs and direct sales personnel and infrastructure. Fiscal 2003 Compared with Fiscal 2002. The increase in QuickBooks Related segment operating income in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 was primarily due to 20% higher revenue that included strong growth in our high margin DIY payroll business. These factors were partially offset by increases in spending for product development, marketing, sales and technical support for industry specific versions of QuickBooks that launched late in fiscal 2002 and throughout fiscal 2003. Intuit Branded Small Business Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003. Our Intuit Branded Small Business segment had operating income in fiscal 2004 after it broke even in fiscal 2003 because revenue for this segment grew 14% while we held costs steady in our information technology and industry solutions businesses. Partially offsetting these improvements, outsourced payroll operating income was lower in fiscal 2004 because we incurred expenses for additional sales and service personnel during the first half of the year that were not completely offset by increased revenue. Fiscal 2003 Compared with Fiscal 2002. Intuit Branded Small Business broke even in fiscal 2003 after experiencing an operating loss in fiscal 2002. The primary reasons for the improvement in operating margin were growth in our outsourced payroll business and our acquisition of Intuit Information Technology Solutions in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Consumer Tax Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003. Consumer Tax segment operating income growth in fiscal 2004 was slightly above revenue growth for that period because gross margin improvements due to higher average selling prices and growing high margin service revenues were only partially offset by additional costs incurred for national television and radio advertising in fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2003 Compared with Fiscal 2002. Consumer Tax segment operating income growth in fiscal 2003 was above revenue growth for that period as improvements in average selling prices were partially offset by additional costs incurred for higher partner royalties and infrastructure. 32 Table of Contents Professional Tax Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003. Professional Tax segment operating income declined slightly on a 3% revenue increase in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003. Segment operating income did not grow in fiscal 2004 because of increased spending on product development and customer service. Fiscal 2003 Compared with Fiscal 2002. Professional Tax segment operating income grew in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 due to streamlining of training and materials costs that produced higher gross margins on 8% revenue growth. Operating expenses for this segment remained relatively flat in fiscal 2003 due to staffing efficiencies achieved in customer service. Other Businesses Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003. Other Businesses segment operating income grew faster than revenue due primarily to Quicken revenue increases on relatively flat costs and our exit from the online brokerage business in the first quarter of fiscal 2004. Partially offsetting the Quicken improvements, Canadian operating income was down in fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2003 Compared with Fiscal 2002. Other Businesses segment operating income grew during fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 as a result of reduced spending in our Quicken online advertising business and reduction of other Quicken operating expenses as operational efficiencies were introduced. Canadian operating income was also slightly higher in fiscal 2003. Non Operating Income and Expenses Interest and Other Income Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal 2002 2003 2004 Interest income $ 31.7 $ 22.1 $ 14.0 Quicken Loans royalties and fees 10.1 10.2 Net foreign exchange gain 0.1 5.4 3.1 Interest expense (1.5 ) (0.9 ) (0.3 ) Other (3.0 ) 2.0 3.8 $ 27.3 $ 38.7 $ 30.8 Total interest and other income declined in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 but increased in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002. The interest income that we earn on our cash and short term investment balances decreased $8.1 million in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 and $9.6 million in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 due to our reinvestment of maturing instruments in new instruments that generally yielded lower current market interest rates. In addition, due to the Companys continued investment in its stock repurchase programs and in acquisitions, average invested balances were lower in fiscal 2004 than in fiscal 2003 and were lower in fiscal 2003 than in fiscal 2002. Fiscal 2004 and 2003 interest and other income included royalties from trademark license and distribution agreements that we entered into when we sold our mortgage business in July 2002. See Note 9 to the financial statements. This is the primary reason for the increase in total interest and other income in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002. Interest and other income also includes net gains resulting from foreign exchange transactions that were due primarily to the effect of the weakening U.S. dollar on intercompany balances with our Canadian subsidiary. 33 Table of Contents Gains (Losses) on Marketable Securities and Other Investments, Net We recorded pre tax net gains relating to marketable securities and other investments in fiscal 2004 and 2003 while we recorded a pre tax net loss relating to marketable securities and other investments in fiscal 2002. The fiscal 2003 net gain and fiscal 2002 net loss included charges totaling $2.8 million and $9.5 million to write down certain long term investments for which the decline in fair value below carrying value was other than temporary. Gain on Divestiture of Business In March 2002 we paid $12.0 million to terminate our remaining $20.3 million obligation under an interactive services agreement related to our Quicken Bill Manager business, which we sold in May 2001. We recorded a pre tax gain of $8.3 million in connection with the termination of this agreement. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate was 30% for fiscal 2004, 33% for fiscal 2003 and 24% for fiscal 2002. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2004 differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the net effect of reversals of $35.7 million in reserves related to potential income tax exposures that have been resolved and to the benefit received from tax exempt interest income and various tax credits offset by state taxes, acquisition related charges and deferred tax adjustments. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2003 differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the net effect of the benefit received from tax exempt interest income and various tax credits offset by state taxes and acquisition related charges. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2002 differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to a tax benefit related to a divestiture that became available during the year and to tax exempt interest income offset by non deductible merger related charges. See Note 14 to the financial statements. At July 31, 2004, we had net deferred tax assets of $167.2 million, which included a valuation allowance of $7.5 million for net operating loss carryforwards relating to our international subsidiaries and certain state capital loss carryforwards. The allowance reflects managements assessment that we may not receive the benefit of certain loss carryforwards of our international subsidiaries and capital loss carryforwards in certain state jurisdictions. While we believe our current valuation allowance is sufficient, it may be necessary to increase this amount if it becomes more likely that we will not realize a greater portion of the net deferred tax assets. We assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. See Note 14 to the financial statements. Discontinued Operations Intuit KK In February 2003 we sold our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary, Intuit KK, and accounted for the sale as discontinued operations. In accordance with SFAS 144, we have segregated the operating results of Intuit KK from continuing operations on our statement of operations for all periods prior to the sale. We recorded a gain on disposal of these discontinued operations of $71.0 million, net of income taxes of $5.1 million, in the third quarter of fiscal 2003. See Note 9 to the financial statements. Quicken Loans In July 2002 we sold 87.5% of our Quicken Loans mortgage business segment and accounted for the sale as discontinued operations. In accordance with APB 30, we have segregated the operating results of Quicken Loans from continuing operations on our statement of operations for all periods prior to the sale. We recorded a net gain on disposal of these discontinued operations of $23.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. In October 2002, we sold our residual equity interest in the purchasing company and recognized a net gain of $5.6 million on the transaction. We receive royalties and fees under certain licensing and distribution agreements that relate to our former Quicken Loans business. We record these amounts as other income on our statement of operations. See Note 9 to the financial statements. 34 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Statements of Cash Flows At July 31, 2004 our cash, cash equivalents and short term investments totaled $1.0 billion, a decrease of $187.6 million from July 31, 2003. In fiscal 2004, we generated cash primarily from continuing operations and the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans and we used cash primarily for our stock repurchase programs, acquisitions and capital expenditures. The following table summarizes selected items from our statements of cash flows for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002. See the financial statements for complete statements of cash flows for those periods. Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal (In millions) 2002 2003 2004 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 351.6 $ 570.2 $ 574.6 Net income from continuing operations 53.6 263.2 317.0 Acquisition related costs 196.0 56.6 56.6 Depreciation 58.8 73.8 77.6 Net cash used in investing activities (38.4 ) (492.7 ) (211.0 ) Acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired (284.1 ) (214.8 ) (123.6 ) Net liquidation (purchases) of available for sale debt securities 295.1 (230.6 ) (64.3 ) Purchases of property and equipment (42.1 ) (50.4 ) (61.1 ) Capitalization of internal use software (21.3 ) (34.3 ) (57.1 ) Net cash used in financing activities (196.1 ) (661.8 ) (506.5 ) Purchase of treasury stock (318.4 ) (814.3 ) (610.2 ) Net proceeds from issuance of common stock 133.6 155.9 119.1 Net cash provided by discontinued operations 225.2 341.4 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 342.0 (238.9 ) (142.8 ) We generated cash from our operations during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, including net income from continuing operations in each of those years. Acquisition related costs were significantly higher in fiscal 2002 than in fiscal 2003 and 2004 primarily because we amortized goodwill in fiscal 2002. Due to our adoption of SFAS 142, we stopped amortizing goodwill in fiscal 2003. Acquisition related costs also included impairments of goodwill and purchased intangible assets of $27.3 million in fiscal 2002 and $18.7 million in fiscal 2004. We used cash for investing activities during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002. Our primary use of cash for investing activities was for business acquisitions. On a net basis, we invested cash in available for sale debt securities in fiscal 2004 and 2003 while we drew cash from them in fiscal 2002. We used cash for our financing activities in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, primarily for the repurchase of stock under our stock repurchase programs. See Stock Repurchase Programs below and Note 15 to the financial statements. This was partially offset by proceeds that we received from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans in each of these fiscal years. Cash generated by discontinued operations in fiscal 2003 included collection of $241.6 million in amounts due from Quicken Loans and Intuit KK and a net gain of $71.0 million from the sale of Intuit KK. Cash generated by discontinued operations during fiscal 2002 was primarily from collection of $108.1 million in amounts due from Quicken Loans and Intuit KK, net income from discontinued operations of $63.2 million and a gain of $23.3 million on the sale of Quicken Loans. 35 Table of Contents Stock Repurchase Programs Intuits Board of Directors has initiated a series of common stock repurchase programs. Shares of common stock repurchased under these programs become treasury shares. The following table summarizes our stock repurchase programs at July 31, 2004. Date Initiated / Amount Amount Shares Plan Name Increased Date Concluded Authorized Repurchased Repurchased (Dollars in millions) Repurchase Plan I May 2001 / July 2002 December 2002 $ 750.0 $ 750.0 16,602,583 Repurchase Plan II March 2003 November 2003 500.0 500.0 11,280,609 Repurchase Plan III August 2003 June 2004 500.0 500.0 11,197,779 Repurchase Plan IV May 2004 Still active 500.0 Loans to Executive Officers and Other Employees Outstanding loans to executive officers and other employees totaled $17.1 million at July 31, 2004 and $19.7 million at July 31, 2003. Loans to executive officers are primarily relocation loans that are generally secured by real property and have original maturity dates of up to 10 years. At July 31, 2004, no loans were overdue and all interest payments were current in accordance with the terms of the loan agreements. Consistent with the requirements of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, no loans to executive officers have been made or modified since July 30, 2002 and we do not intend to make or modify loans to executive officers in the future. See Note 19 to the financial statements. Other We evaluate, on an ongoing basis, the merits of acquiring technology or businesses, or establishing strategic relationships with and investing in other companies. We may decide to use cash and cash equivalents to fund such activities in the future. We believe that our cash, cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations to make future payments at July 31, 2004: Payments Due by Period Less than 1 1 3 3 5 After 5 year years years years Total (In millions) Amounts due under executive deferred compensation plan $ $ 13.2 $ $ $ 13.2 Short term portion of capital lease obligations 2.5 2.5 Short term portion of vacancy reserve 1.4 1.4 Long term obligations (1) 8.1 3.8 4.5 16.4 Purchase obligations (2) 4.7 4.8 3.3 7.6 20.4 Operating leases 27.8 50.4 36.4 61.1 175.7 Total contractual cash obligations $ 36.4 $ 76.5 $ 43.5 $ 73.2 $ 229.6 (1) Long term obligations at July 31, 2004 included the $7.6 million long term portion of our reserve for vacant Mountain View facilities. See Note 13 to the financial statements. (2) Represents agreements to purchase products and services that are enforceable, legally binding and specify terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the payments. 36 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements On March 31, 2004, the FASB issued its exposure draft, Share Based Payment, which is a proposed amendment to SFAS 123. The exposure draft would require all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options and purchases under employee stock purchase plans, to be recognized as expenses in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods. The FASB expects to issue a final standard late in 2004 that would be effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2004. We have not yet assessed the impact of adopting this new standard. See Note 1 to the financial statements. 37 Table of Contents RISKS THAT COULD AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS We face intense competitive pressures in all of our businesses that may negatively impact our revenue, profitability and market position. We have formidable competitors and we expect competition to remain intense during fiscal 2005 and beyond. The number, resources and sophistication of the companies with whom we compete has increased as we continue to expand our product and service offerings. Microsoft Corporation, in particular, presents a significant threat to a number of our businesses due to its market position, strategic focus and superior financial resources. Our competitors may introduce new and improved products and services, bundle new offerings with market leading products, reduce prices, gain better access to distribution channels, advertise aggressively or beat us to market with new products and services. Any of these competitive actions particularly any prolonged price competition could diminish our revenue and profitability and could affect our ability to keep existing customers and acquire new customers. Some additional competitive factors that may impact our businesses are as follows: QuickBooks Related. Losing existing or potential QuickBooks customers to competitors causes us to lose potential software revenue and limits our opportunities to sell related products and services such as our financial supplies, DIY payroll and merchant service offerings. Many competitors and potential competitors provide, or have expressed significant interest in providing, accounting and business management products and services to small businesses. For example, Microsoft currently offers a number of competitive small business offerings and has indicated part of its growth strategy is to focus on small business offerings. Accordingly, we expect that competition from Microsoft in the small business area will intensify over time with the introduction of small business offerings that directly compete with our QuickBooks and other offerings. Given its market position and resources, if Microsoft launches additional products and services that directly compete with our offerings it may have a significant negative impact on our revenue and profitability. Consumer Tax. Our consumer tax business faces significant competition from both the public and private sector. In the public sector we face the risk of federal and state taxing authorities developing or contracting to provide software or other systems to facilitate tax return preparation and electronic filing at no charge to taxpayers. Federal Government. Agencies of the U.S. government have made several attempts during the two most recent presidential administrations to offer taxpayers a form of free tax preparation software and filing service. However, in October 2002 the U.S. Internal Revenue Service agreed not to develop or deploy its own competing tax software product or service so long as participants in an association of private tax preparation software companies, including Intuit, agreed to provide Web based federal tax preparation and filing services at no cost to qualified taxpayers for a period of three years, subject to recurring two year extensions. The relationship, called the Free File Alliance, is intended to serve lower income, disadvantaged and underserved taxpayers with the objective of making free online tax preparation software and filing services available to at least 60% of taxpayers. Although the Free File Alliance has kept the federal government from being a direct competitor to our tax offerings, it has caused us to lose revenue opportunities for a large percentage of the tax base. In addition, some of our competitors are using the Free File Alliance as a free marketing tool by giving away services at the federal level and attempting to make money from ancillary service offerings. Further, were the federal government to terminate the Free File Alliance and elect to provide its own software and electronic filing services available to taxpayers at no charge it would negatively impact our revenue and profits. State Governments. State taxing authorities have also actively pursued strategies to provide free online tax return preparation and electronic filing services for state taxpayers. During 2004 at least 15 states participated in Free File Alliance collaborations with private sector software companies to offer free online tax preparation and electronic filing services to qualified taxpayers. However, 22 states, including California, directly offered their own online services to taxpayers. It is possible that other governmental entities that currently do not offer such services will elect to pursue similar competitive offerings in the future. These publicly sponsored programs have caused us to lose potential customers to free offerings and have enabled competitors to gain market share at our expense by using participation in the free alliances as an effective tool to attract customers to ancillary paid offerings. Given the efficiencies that electronic tax filing provides to taxing authorities, we anticipate that governmental competition will present a continued competitive threat to our business for the foreseeable future. 38 Table of Contents Private Sector. In the private sector we face intense competition primarily from HR Block, the makers of TaxCut software, and from web based competitive offerings. We also compete for customers with low cost assisted tax preparation businesses, such as HR Block. Other Segments (Intuit Branded Small Business, Professional Tax and Other Businesses). Our professional tax offerings face pricing pressure from competitors seeking to obtain our customers through deep product discounts and loss of customers to competitors offering no frills offerings at low prices. This business also faces competition from competitively priced integrated accounting solutions that are more complete than our current offerings. The substantial size of our principal competitors in the outsourced payroll services business and our merchant card processing service business benefit from greater economies of scale that may result in pricing pressure for our offerings. The growth of electronic banking and other electronic payment systems is decreasing the demand for checks and consequently causing pricing pressure for our supplies products as competitors aggressively compete for share of this shrinking market. Our Quicken products compete both with Microsoft Money, which is aggressively promoted and priced, and with Web based electronic banking and personal finance tracking and management tools that are becoming increasingly available at no cost to consumers. These competitive pressures may result in reduced revenue and lower profitability for our Quicken product line and related bill payment service offering. The growth of some of our businesses is slowing and if we do not continue to introduce new and enhanced products and services our revenues and margins will decline. We are seeing a slowdown in the revenue growth rate for some of our businesses as they mature. This trend causes our product development efforts to be even more critical to our success. Product and service enhancements are necessary for us to differentiate our offerings from those of our competitors and to motivate our existing customers to purchase upgrades, or annual licenses in the case of our tax offerings. A number of our businesses derive a significant amount of their revenue through one time upfront license fees and rely on customer upgrades and service offerings that include upgrades to generate a significant portion of their revenues. As our existing products mature, encouraging customers to purchase product upgrades becomes more challenging unless new product releases provide features and functionality that have meaningful incremental value. If we are not able to develop and clearly demonstrate the value of upgraded products to our customers, our upgrade and service revenues will be negatively impacted. Similarly, our business will be harmed if we are not successful in our efforts to develop and introduce new products and services that expand our customer base and revenues per customer. We are implementing new information systems and problems with the design or implementation of these systems could interfere with our business and operations. We are in the process of implementing new information systems to replace existing systems that manage our business and finance operations. Due to the size and complexity of our portfolio of businesses, the conversion process is very challenging. We began switching over in large part to the new information systems in September 2004 with the upgrade of significant financial systems, order taking systems, middleware systems (systems to allow for interoperability of different databases) and network security systems. Although the upgraded systems appear to be functioning in a stable manner and performing tasks at acceptable performance levels for our current business demands, we may still encounter difficulties as our business demands increase and as greater functionality from the systems is required. For example, we have not yet successfully closed a financial reporting period with data generated by the upgraded systems. Similarly, the upgraded systems have not yet been subject to, and may not be able to handle, the demand peaks caused by the seasonal nature of our business. In addition, although the switch over of our more critical systems is underway, we will be continuing to replace existing systems throughout fiscal year 2005. Any disruptions relating to our systems enhancements, particularly any disruptions impacting our operations during our second and third fiscal quarters, could adversely impact our ability to do the following in a timely and accurate manner: take customer orders, ship products, provide services and support to our customers, bill and track our customers, fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise run our business. Even if we do succeed, the implementation may be much more costly than we anticipated. If we are unable to successfully implement new information systems as planned, in addition to adversely impacting our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in the short and long term, it could also affect our ability to collect the information necessary to timely file our first quarter fiscal 2005 financial reports with the SEC. 39 Table of Contents Our new product and service offerings may not achieve market success or may cannibalize sales of our existing products, causing our revenues and earnings to decrease. Our future success depends in large part upon our ability to identify emerging opportunities in our target markets and our capacity to quickly develop, and sell products and services that satisfy these demands in a cost effective manner. Successfully predicting demand trends is difficult and we may expend a significant amount of resources and management attention on products or services that do not succeed in their markets. We have encountered difficulty in launching new products and services in the past. For example, in 2003 we ended our Quicken Brokerage service offering due to lack of customer acceptance. If we misjudge customer needs, our new products and services will not succeed and our revenues and earnings will be negatively impacted. In addition, as we expand our offerings to new customer categories we run the risk of customers shifting from higher priced and higher margin products to newly introduced lower priced offerings. If we experience significant product quality problems or delays it will harm our revenues, operating income and reputation. All of our tax products, and many of our non tax products, have rigid development timetables that increase the risk of errors in our products and the risk of launch delays. Many of our products are highly complex and require interoperability with other software products and services. Our tax preparation software product development cycle is particularly challenging due to the need to incorporate unpredictable tax law and tax form changes each year and because our customers expect high levels of accuracy and a timely launch of these products to prepare and file their taxes by April 15th. Due to this complexity and the condensed development cycles under which we operate our products sometimes contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the software. For example, our software may face interoperability difficulties with software operating systems or programs being used by our customers. When we encounter problems we may be required to modify our code, distribute patches to customers that had already purchased the product and recall or repackage existing product inventory in our distribution channels. If we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our products late in our development cycle it may cause us to delay our product launch date. Any major defects or launch delays could lead to the following: loss of customers to competitors, which could also deprive us of future revenue attributable to repeat purchases, product upgrades and purchases of related services; negative publicity and damage to our brands; customer dissatisfaction; reduced retailer shelf space and product promotions; and increased operating expenses, such as inventory replacement costs and in our consumer tax business, expenses resulting from our commitment to reimburse penalties and interest paid by customers due solely to calculation errors in our consumer tax preparation products. If we fail to maintain reliable and responsive service levels for our electronic tax offerings, or if the IRS or other governmental agencies experience difficulties in receiving customer submissions, we could lose revenue and customers. Our Web based tax preparation and electronic filing services must effectively handle extremely heavy customer demand during the peak tax season. We face significant risks and challenges in maintaining these services and maintaining adequate service levels, particularly during peak volume service times. Similarly, governmental entities receiving electronic tax filings must also handle large volumes of data and may experience difficulties with their systems preventing the receipt of electronic filings. If customers are unable to file their returns electronically they may elect to make paper filings. This would result in reduced electronic tax return preparation and filing revenues and profits and would negatively impact our reputation and ability to keep and attract customers who demand a reliable electronic filing experience. We have experienced relatively brief unscheduled interruptions in our electronic filing and or tax preparation services during past tax years. For example, on April 15, 2003 we experienced a relatively brief unscheduled interruption in our electronic filing service during which certain users of our professional tax products were unable to receive confirmation from us that their electronic filing had been accepted and on April 15, 2002 we reached maximum capacity for processing e filings for short period of time. If we experience any prolonged difficulties with our Web based tax preparation or electronic filing service at any time during the tax season, we could lose current and future customers, receive negative publicity and incur increased 40 Table of Contents operating costs, any of which could have a significant negative impact on the financial and market success of these businesses and have a negative impact on our near term and long term financial results. Our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and our quarterly results fluctuate significantly. Several of our businesses are highly seasonal causing significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results. Revenue and operating results are usually strongest during the second and third fiscal quarters ending January 31 and April 30 due to our tax businesses contributing most of their revenue during those quarters and the timing of the release of our small business software upgrades. We experience lower revenues, and significant operating losses, in the first and fourth quarters ending October 31 and July 31. Our financial results can also fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of factors, including changes in product sales mix that affect average selling prices, product release dates, the timing of our discontinuance of support for older product offerings, the timing of sales of our higher priced Intuit Branded Small Business offerings, our methods for distributing our products, including the shift to a consignment model for some of our desktop products sold through retail distribution channels, and the timing of acquisitions, divestitures, and goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairment charges. As our product and service offerings become more complex our revenue streams become less predictable. Our expanding range of products and services generates more varied revenue streams than our traditional desktop software businesses. The accounting policies that apply to these revenue streams are more complex than those that apply to our traditional products and services. We expect this trend to continue as we acquire additional companies and expand our offerings. For example, as we begin to offer additional features and options as part of multiple element sales arrangements, we could be required to defer a higher percentage of our product revenue at the time of sale than we do for traditional products. This would decrease recognized revenue at the time products are shipped, but result in increased recognized revenue in fiscal periods after shipment. For example, some of our TurboTax offerings provide for both use of our software and filing of returns electronically, causing some of our revenue to be deferred until the time of the actual filing of tax returns by our customers. In addition, our Intuit Branded Small Business segment businesses offer products and services with significantly higher prices than we have traditionally offered. Revenue from these offerings tends to be less predictable than revenue from our traditional desktop products, due to longer sales and implementation cycles. These businesses also tend to rely on a relatively small number of large orders for a substantial portion of their revenue in a particular quarter, which could cause our quarterly revenue from these businesses to fluctuate. Acquisition related costs and impairment charges can cause significant fluctuation in our net income. Our recent acquisitions have resulted in significant expenses, including amortization of purchased software (which is reflected in cost of revenue), as well as charges for in process research and development, and amortization and impairment of goodwill, purchased intangible assets and deferred compensation (which are reflected in operating expenses). Total acquisition related costs in the categories identified above were $196.0 million in fiscal 2002, $56.6 million in fiscal 2003 and $56.6 million in fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2003 and 2004 acquisition related costs have declined primarily because of a change in the accounting treatment of goodwill. However, we may incur less frequent, but larger, impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions. We test the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise. The timing of the formal annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods. For example, at the end of fiscal 2004 we incurred an impairment charge of $18.7 million related to our acquisition of Intuit Public Sector Solutions. As of July 31, 2004, we had an unamortized goodwill balance of approximately $670.0 million, which could be subject to impairment charges in the future. New acquisitions, and any impairment of the value of purchased assets, could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results. If we do not respond promptly and effectively to customer service and technical support inquiries we will lose customers and our revenues will decline. The effectiveness of our customer service and technical support operations are critical to customer satisfaction and our financial success. If we do not respond effectively to service and technical support requests we will lose customers and miss out on potential revenue opportunities, such as paid service and new product sales. In our 41 Table of Contents service offerings, such as our merchant card processing and outsourced payroll businesses, customer service delivery is fundamental to retaining and maintaining existing customer and acquiring new customers. We occasionally experience customer service and technical support problems, including longer than expected waiting times for customers when our staffing and systems are inadequate to handle a higher than anticipated volume of requests. We also risk losing service at any one of our customer contact centers and our redundancy systems could prove inadequate to provide backup support. Training and retaining qualified customer service and technical support personnel is particularly challenging due to the expansion of our product offerings and the seasonality of our tax business. For example, in fiscal 2004 the number of our consumer tax service representatives ranged from 10 during off season months to about 750 at the peak of the season. If we do not adequately train our support representatives our customers will not receive the level of support that they demand and we strive to deliver. To improve our performance in this area, we must eliminate underlying causes of service and support requests through product improvements, better order fulfillment processes, more robust self help tools, and improved ability to accurately anticipate demand for support. Implementing any of these improvements can be expensive, time consuming and ultimately prove unsuccessful. If we do not deliver the high level of support that our customers expect for any of the reasons stated above we will lose customers and our financial results will suffer. If we encounter problems with our third party customer service and technical support providers our business will be harmed and margins will decline. We outsource a substantial portion of our customer support activities to third party service providers, most significantly to service providers in India. During fiscal 2004 we greatly increased the number of third party customer service representatives working on our behalf and we expect to continue to rely heavily on third parties in the future. This strategy provides us with lower operating costs and greater flexibility, but also presents risks to our business, including the following: International outsourcing has received considerable negative attention in the media and there are indications that the U.S. Congress may pass legislation that would impact how we operate and impact customer perceptions of our service. For example, in Congress legislators have discussed restricting the flow of personal information to overseas providers and requiring representatives in foreign jurisdictions to affirmatively identify themselves by name and location; Customers may react negatively to providing information to and receiving support from overseas organizations; We may not be able to impact the quality of support that we provide as directly as we are able to in our company run call centers; In recent years India has experienced political instability and changing policies that may impact our operations. In addition, for a number of years India and Pakistan have been in conflict and an active state of war between the two countries could disrupt our services; and We rely on a global communications infrastructure that may be interrupted in a number of ways. For example, in fiscal 2004 we had to reroute calls to India due to an underwater cable being cut in the Mediterranean Sea. We face significant risks in our retail distribution channel that could result in loss of revenues and reduced margins. We sell most of our desktop software products through our retail distribution channel and a relatively small number of retailers generate much of our sales volume. Our principal retailers have significant bargaining leverage due to their size and available resources. Any change in principal business terms, termination or major disruption of our relationship with these resellers could result in a potentially significant decline in our revenues and earnings. For example, the sourcing decisions, product display locations and promotional activities that retailers undertake can greatly impact the sales of our products. Due to its seasonal nature, sales of TurboTax are particularly impacted by such decisions and if our principal distribution sources were to elect to carry or promote competitive products our revenues would decline. The fact that we also sell our products directly could cause retailers to reduce their efforts to promote our products or stop selling our products altogether. If any of our retailers run into financial difficulties we may be unable to collect amounts that we are owed. 42 Table of Contents Selling new products may be more challenging and costlier than selling our historical products, causing our margins to decline. Because our strategy for some of our products involves the routine introduction of new products at retail, if retailers do not offer our new products we will not be able to grow as planned. An outcome of our Right for Me marketing approach is the introduction of additional versions of our products. Retailers may be reluctant to stock unproven products, or products that sell at higher prices, but more slowly. Retailers may also choose to place less emphasis on software as a category within their stores. In addition, it may be costlier for us to market and sell some of our higher priced products due to our need to convey the more customer specific value of the products to customers rather than communicating more generalized benefits. This may require us to develop other marketing programs that supplement our traditional in store promotional efforts to sell these products to customers causing our margins to shrink. If retail distribution proves an ineffective channel for certain of our new offerings it could adversely impact our growth, revenue and profitability. If our manufacturing and distribution suppliers execute poorly our business will be harmed. We have chosen to outsource the manufacturing and distribution of many of our desktop software products to a small number of third party providers and we use a single vendor to produce and distribute our check and business forms supplies products. Although our reliance on a small number of suppliers, or a single supplier, provides us with efficiencies and enhanced bargaining power, poor performance by or lack of effective communication with these parties can significantly harm our business. This risk is amplified by the fact that we carry very little inventory and rely on just in time manufacturing processes. We have experienced problems with our suppliers in the past. For example, during fiscal 2004 one of our suppliers was unable to fulfill orders for some of our software products for a number of days due to operational difficulties and communication errors. Although together we were able to mitigate the impact of that delay with minimal disruption to our business, if we experience longer delays, delays during a peak demand period or significant quality issues our business will be significantly harmed. Failure of our information technology systems or those of our service providers could adversely affect our future operating results. We rely on a variety of internal technology systems and technology systems maintained by our outside manufacturing and distribution suppliers to take and fulfill customer orders, handle customer service requests, host our Web based activities, support internal operations, and store customer and company data. These systems could be damaged or interrupted, preventing us or our service providers from accepting and fulfilling customer orders or otherwise interrupting our business. In addition, these systems could suffer security breaches, causing company and customer data to be unintentionally disclosed. Any of these occurrences could adversely impact our operations. We have experienced system challenges in the past. For example, during fiscal 2004 some of our non critical systems were interrupted due to computer viruses that caused loss of productivity and added expense. We also experience computer server failures from time to time. To prevent interruptions we must continually upgrade our systems and processes to ensure that we have adequate recoverability both of which are costly and time consuming. While we and our outside service partners have backup systems for certain aspects of our operations, not all systems upon which we rely are fully redundant and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Possession and use of personal customer information by our businesses presents risks and expenses that could harm our business. A number of our businesses possess personal customer information. Possession and use of this information in conducting our business subjects us to regulatory burdens and potential lawsuits. We have incurred and will continue to incur significant expenses to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols and there is a trend toward greater regulation of privacy. For example, regulations like the recently created federal Do Not Call List, and actions by Internet service providers to limit communications with their subscribers may impede our ability to communicate with our customers and increase our compliance costs. Because our businesses rely heavily on direct marketing, any limitations on our ability to communicate with our customers could harm our financial results. In the past we have experienced lawsuits and negative publicity relating to privacy issues and we could face similar suits in the future. A major breach of customer privacy or security by Intuit, or even another company, could have serious negative consequences for our businesses, including direct damages that we may be 43 Table of Contents required to pay as a result of a breach by us, reduced customer demand for our services and additional regulation by federal or state agencies. Although we have sophisticated network security, internal control measures, and physical security procedures to safeguard customer information, there can be no assurance that a data security breach or theft will not occur resulting in harm to our business and results of operations. If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, competitors may exploit our innovations, which could weaken our competitive position and reduce our revenues. Our success depends upon our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of copyright, trade secret, trademark, patent, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. As part of our confidentiality procedures, we generally enter into non disclosure agreements with our employees, contractors, distributors and corporate partners and into license agreements with respect to our software, documentation and other proprietary information. Effectively creating and protecting our proprietary rights is expensive and may require us to engage in expensive and distracting litigation. Despite these precautions, third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization. Because we outsource significant aspects of our product development, manufacturing and distribution we are at risk that confidential portions of our intellectual property could become public by lapses in security by our contractors. We have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to others. These licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. It is also possible that other companies could successfully challenge the validity or scope of our patents and that our patent portfolio, which is relatively small, may not provide us with a meaningful competitive advantage. Ultimately, our attempts to secure legal protection for our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our competitors could independently develop similar technologies, duplicate our products, or design around patents and other intellectual property rights. If our intellectual property protection proves inadequate we could lose our competitive advantage and our financial results will suffer. We expect copying and misuse of our intellectual property to be a persistent problem causing lost revenue and increased expenses. Our intellectual property rights are among our most valuable assets. Policing unauthorized use and copying of our products is difficult, expensive, and time consuming. Current U.S. laws that prohibit copying give us only limited practical protection from software piracy and the laws of many other countries provide very little protection. We may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our technology. For example, we frequently encounter unauthorized copies of our software being sold through online auction sites and other online marketplaces. In addition, efforts to protect our intellectual property may be misunderstood and perceived negatively by our customers. For example, during 2003 we employed technology to prohibit unauthorized sharing of our TurboTax products. These efforts were not effectively communicated causing a negative reaction by some of our customers who misunderstood our actions. Although we continue to evaluate technology solutions to piracy, and we continue to increase our civil and criminal enforcement efforts, we expect piracy to be a persistent problem that results in lost revenues and increased expenses. We do not own all of the software, other technologies and content used in our products and services. Many of our products are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties. We believe we have all of the necessary licenses from third parties to use and distribute third party technology and content that we do not own that is used in our current products and services. From time to time we may be required to renegotiate with these third parties or negotiate with new third parties to include their technology or content in our existing products, in new versions of our existing products or in wholly new products. We may not be able to negotiate or renegotiate licenses on reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain the rights necessary to use or continue to use third party technology or content in our products and services, we may not be able to sell the affected products, which would in turn have a negative impact on our revenue and operating results. We may unintentionally infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which could expose us to substantial damages or restrict our business operations. As the number of our products and services increases and their features and content continue to expand, and as we acquire technology through acquisitions or licenses, we may increasingly become subject to infringement claims by third parties. We expect that software products in general will increasingly be subject to these claims as the number 44 Table of Contents of products and competitors increase, the functionality of products overlap and as the patenting of software functionality continues to grow. From time to time, we have received communications from third parties in which the claimant alleges that a product or service we offer infringes the claimants intellectual property rights. Occasionally these communications result in lawsuits. In many of these cases, it is difficult to assess the extent to which the intellectual property right that the claimant asserts is valid or the extent to which we have any material exposure. The receipt of a notice alleging infringement may require us to obtain a costly opinion of counsel to prevent an allegation of intentional infringement. Future claims could present an exposure of uncertain magnitude. Existing or future infringement claims or lawsuits against us, whether valid or not, may be time consuming and expensive to defend and be distracting to our developers and management. Intellectual property litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the following: cease selling, incorporating or using products or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property; obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property, which may not be available on commercially favorable terms or at all; or redesign our software products or services, possibly in a manner that reduces their commercial appeal. Any of these actions may cause material harm to our business and financial results. Our acquisition activity could disrupt our ongoing business and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions. We have acquired and may continue to acquire companies, products and technologies that complement our strategic direction. For example, over the last three fiscal years we have acquired the stock or assets of eight companies. These acquisitions may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including: inability to successfully integrate the acquired technology and operations into our business and maintain uniform standards, controls, policies, and procedures; distraction of managements attention away from normal business operations; challenges retaining the key employees of the acquired operation; insufficient revenue generation to offset liabilities assumed; expenses associated with the acquisition; and unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence process, including product quality issues and legal contingencies. Acquisitions are inherently risky, we can not be certain that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect the conduct, operating results or financial condition of our business. We have generally paid cash for our recent acquisitions. If we issue common stock or other equity related purchase rights as consideration in an acquisition, current shareholders percentage ownership and earnings per share may become diluted. If we fail to operate our outsourced payroll business effectively our revenue and profitability will be harmed. Our payroll business handles a significant amount of dollar and transaction volume. Due to the size and volume of transactions that we handle effective processing systems and controls are essential to ensure that transactions are handled appropriately. Despite our efforts, it is possible that we may make errors or that funds may be misappropriated. In addition to any direct damages and fines that any such problems would create, which could be substantial, the loss of customer confidence in our accuracy and controls would seriously harm our business. Our payroll business has grown largely through acquisitions and our systems are comprised of multiple technology platforms that are difficult to scale. We must constantly continue to upgrade our systems and processes to ensure that we process customer data in an accurate, reliable and timely manner. These upgrades must also meet the various regulatory deadlines associated with employer related payroll activities. Any failure of our systems or processes in critical switch over times, such as in January when many businesses elect to change payroll service providers, would be detrimental to our business. If we failed to timely deliver any of our payroll products, it could cause our current and prospective customers to choose a competitors product for that years payroll and not to purchase Intuit products in the future. To generate sustained growth in our payroll business we must successfully develop and manage a more proactive inside and field sales operation. If these efforts are not successful our revenue growth and profitability will decline. 45 Table of Contents Interest income attributable to payroll customer deposits may fluctuate or be eliminated causing our revenue and profitability to decline. We currently earn revenue from interest earned on customer deposits that we hold pending payment of funds to taxing authorities or to customers employees. If interest rates decline, or there are regulatory changes that diminish the amount of time that we are required or permitted to hold such funds our interest revenue will decline. We face a number of risks in our merchant card processing business that could result in a reduction in our revenues and profits. Our merchant card processing service business is subject to the following risks: if merchants for whom we process credit card transactions are unable to pay refunds due to their customers in connection with disputed or fraudulent merchant transactions we may be required to pay those amounts and our payments may exceed the amount of the customer reserves we have established to make such payments; we will not be able to conduct our business if the bank sponsors and card payment processors and other service providers that we rely on to process bankcard transactions terminate their relationships with us and we are not able to secure or successfully migrate our business elsewhere; we could be required to stop providing payment processing services for Visa and MasterCard if we or our bank sponsors fail to adhere to the standards of the Visa and MasterCard credit card associations; we depend on independent sales organizations that do not serve us exclusively to acquire and retain merchant accounts; our profit margins will be reduced if for competitive reasons we cannot increase our fees at times when Visa and MasterCard increase the fees that we pay to process merchant transactions through their systems; unauthorized disclosure of merchant and cardholder data, whether through breach of our computer systems or otherwise, could expose us to protracted and costly litigation; and we may encounter difficulties scaling our business systems to support our growth as we continue to migrate users of our QuickBooks Merchant Account Services from third party service providers to our own systems. Should any of these risks be realized our business could be harmed and our financial results will suffer. Increased state filing mandates could significantly increase our costs. We are required to comply with a variety of state revenue agency standards in order to successfully operate our tax preparation and electronic filing services. Changes in state imposed requirements by one or more of the states, including the required use of specific technologies or technology standards, could significantly increase the costs of providing those services to our customers and could prevent us from delivering a quality product to our customers in a timely manner. We may be unable to attract and retain key personnel. Much of our future success depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel, including members of our executive team, and those in technical, marketing and staff positions. Experienced personnel in the software and services industries are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in the Silicon Valley and San Diego, California, where the majority of our employees are located. Although we strive to be an employer of choice, we may not be able to continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel which would cause our business to suffer. If actual product returns exceed returns reserves, or if customer rebates exceed historical amounts, our revenue would be lower. We ship more desktop software products to our distributors and retailers than we expect them to sell, in order to reduce the risk that distributors or retailers will run out of products. This is particularly true for our Consumer Tax products, which have a short selling season and for which returns occur primarily in our fourth fiscal quarter. Like 46 Table of Contents most software companies, we have historically accepted significant product returns. We establish reserves against revenue for product returns in our financial statements, based on estimated future returns of products. We closely monitor levels of product sales and inventory in the retail channel in an effort to maintain reserves that are adequate to cover expected returns. In the past, returns have not generally exceeded these reserves. However, if we do experience actual returns that significantly exceed reserves, it would result in lower net revenue. In addition, our policy of recognizing revenue from distributors and retailers upon delivery of product for non consignment sales is predicated upon our ability to reasonably estimate returns. If we do not continue to demonstrate our ability to estimate returns then our revenue recognition policy for these types of sales may no longer be appropriate. We also offer customer rebates as part of our selling efforts and establish reserves for payment of rebates. Historically a percentage of customers do not submit requests for their rebates. If a greater number of eligible customers seek rebates than for which we have provided reserves, our margins will be adversely affected. For example, if rebate redemptions for our QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken products were to increase by 1%, it would result in a decrease of approximately $1 million in our revenue. Our insurance policies are costly, may be inadequate and potentially expose us to unrecoverable risks. Insurance availability, coverage terms and pricing continue to vary with market conditions. We endeavor to obtain appropriate insurance coverage for insurable risks that we identify, however, we may fail to correctly anticipate or quantify insurable risks, we may not be able to obtain appropriate insurance coverage, and insurers may not respond as we intend to cover insurable events that may occur. We have observed rapidly changing conditions in the insurance markets relating to nearly all areas of traditional corporate insurance. Such conditions have resulted in higher premium costs, higher policy deductibles, and lower coverage limits. For some risks, because of cost or availability, the Company does not have insurance coverage. For these reasons, the Company is retaining a greater portion of its insurable risks than it has in the past at relatively greater cost. If we are required to account for options under our employee stock plans as a compensation expense, it would significantly reduce our net income and earnings per share. Although we are not currently required to record any compensation expense in connection with option grants to employees that have an exercise price at or above fair market value, it is possible that future accounting pronouncements will require us to treat all employee stock options as a compensation expense. The increased compensation expense would significantly reduce our net income and earnings per share under generally accepted accounting principles. We are frequently a party to litigation that is costly to defend and is a distraction to our business. Due to our financial position and the large number of customers that we serve we are often forced to defend litigation. For example we are currently being sued in three actions for claims related to our election to stop supporting certain of our older product offerings. Although we believe that these cases have no merit and we are defending the matters vigorously, defending such matters is distracting to management and expensive for Intuit. Although we often seek insurance coverage for litigation defense costs, there is no assurance that our defense costs, which can be substantial, will be covered in all cases. In addition, by its nature, litigation is unpredictable and we may not prevail even in cases where we strongly believe a plaintiffs case has no valid claims. If we do not prevail in litigation we may be required to pay substantial monetary damages or alter our business operations. Regardless of the outcome, litigation is expensive and distracting and may reduce our income. Unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results. Our future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on its operating results and financial condition. 47 Table of Contents Our stock price may be volatile. Our stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between our actual and anticipated financial results and as a result of our announcements and those of our competitors. In addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. These factors, as well as general economic and political conditions, may materially adversely affect the market price of our stock in the future. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to detect fraud or report our financial results accurately, which could harm our business and the trading price of our common stock. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to detect and prevent fraud. We periodically assess our system of internal controls, and the internal controls of service providers upon which we rely, to review their effectiveness and identify potential areas of improvement. These assessments may conclude that enhancements, modifications or changes to our system of internal controls are necessary. In addition, from time to time we acquire businesses, many of which have limited infrastructure and systems of internal controls. Performing assessments of internal controls, implementing necessary changes, and maintaining an effective internal controls process is expensive and requires considerable management attention, particularly in the case of newly acquired entities. Internal control systems are designed in part upon assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and all such systems, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. If we fail to implement and maintain an effective system of internal controls or prevent fraud, we could suffer losses, could be subject to costly litigation, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information and our brand and operating results could be harmed, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. We must comply with recently enacted legislation known as SOX 404. Specifically, we and our independent registered public accounting firm must certify the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting at July 31, 2005. Identification of material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting by us or our independent registered public accounting firm could adversely affect our competitive position in our business, especially our outsourced payroll business, and the market price for our common stock. Business interruptions could adversely affect our future operating results. Several of our major business operations are subject to interruption by earthquake, fire, power shortages, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, and other events beyond our control. The majority of our research and development activities, our corporate headquarters, our principal information technology systems, and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults. We do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake related losses. Our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or manmade disaster. Caution Regarding Forward Looking Statements This Report contains forward looking statements. These forward looking statements include our statements regarding the following: our belief that we can deliver solid revenue and profit growth; our expectations regarding our product development efforts noted in the last paragraph of the section entitled Product Development, our belief that our distributor relationships will increase growth opportunities in our higher end offerings; our belief that our current real estate leases are sufficient to meet our current and near term needs; our expectations regarding our use of cash generated in our business; the assumptions underlying our Critical Accounting Policies, including our estimates regarding product rebate and return reserves; our belief that revenue growth for our products is slowing due to market maturation; our plans to mitigate slowing revenue by developing and introducing new products and services; our plan to sell our Intuit Public Sector Solutions business; our belief that our income tax valuation allowance is sufficient; our expectation that we may use cash for future acquisitions of technology and businesses; 48 Table of Contents and our expectation that our cash, cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the next 12 months. We caution investors that forward looking statements are only predictions based on our current expectations about future events and are not guarantees of future performance.

We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward looking statement for any reason, except as required by law. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Short Term Investment Portfolio We do not hold derivative financial instruments in our portfolio of short term investments and funds held for payroll customers. Our short term investments and funds held for payroll customers consist of instruments that meet quality standards consistent with our investment policy. This policy specifies that, except for direct obligations of the United States government, securities issued by agencies of the United States government, and money market or cash management funds, we diversify our holdings by limiting our short term investments and funds held for payroll customers with any individual issuer. The following table presents our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments at July 31, 2004 by stated maturity. The table is classified by the original maturity date listed on the security and includes cash equivalents and short term investments that are part of funds held for payroll customers on our balance sheet. As of July 31, 2004 the interest rate earned on our money market accounts is 0.90% and the interest rate earned on our short term investments is 1.22%. Years Ending July 31, 2009 and 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Cash equivalents $ 198,189 $ $ $ $ $ 198,189 Short term investments 280,417 255,788 15,186 15,757 516,127 1,083,275 $ 478,606 $ 255,788 $ 15,186 $ 15,757 $ 516,127 $ 1,281,464 Interest Rate Risk Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of short term investments and funds held for payroll customers are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents, short term investments and funds held for payroll customers and the value of those investments. Should interest rates increase by 10% from the levels of July 31, 2004, the value of our short term investments and funds held for payroll customers would decline by approximately $0.9 million. Should interest rates increase by 100 basis points from the levels of July 31, 2004, the value of our short term investments and funds held for payroll customers would decline by approximately $5.9 million. Impact of Foreign Currency Rate Changes Since we translate foreign currencies (primarily Canadian dollars and British pounds) into U.S dollars for financial reporting purposes, currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results. The historical impact of currency fluctuations has generally been immaterial. We believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not significant primarily because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies. There was a nominal currency exchange impact from our intercompany transactions for fiscal 2002. Due primarily to the effect of the weakening U.S. dollar on intercompany balances with our Canadian subsidiary, we recorded foreign currency exchange gains of $5.4 million in fiscal 2003 and $3.1 million in fiscal 2004. Although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial in the past and we believe that for the reasons cited above currency fluctuations will not be significant in the future, there can be no guarantee that the impact of currency fluctuations will not be material in the future. As of July 31, 2004, we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities. 50 Table of Contents
