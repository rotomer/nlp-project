Liquidity and Capital Resources, which discusses key aspects of our statements of cash flows, changes in our balance sheets and our financial commitments. A section entitled Risks That Could Affect Future Results, which details important factors that may significantly impact our future financial performance. You should note that this MD&A discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Please see the section entitled Caution Regarding Forward Looking Statements at the end of this Item 7 for important information to consider when evaluating such statements. You should read this MD&A in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes in Item 8. As discussed below, we sold our Japanese subsidiary, Intuit KK, in fiscal 2003 and our Intuit Public Sector Solutions business in fiscal 2005. In May 2005 our Board of Directors formally approved a plan to sell our Intuit Information Technology Solutions business. We accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations and have accordingly reclassified our financial statements for all periods presented to reflect them as discontinued operations. Unless otherwise noted, the following discussion pertains only to our continuing operations. Executive Overview The following overview discusses at a high level our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business. We believe that an understanding of these trends is important in order to understand our financial results for fiscal 2005 as well as our future prospects. This summary is not intended to be exhaustive, nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this Form 10 K. About Intuit Intuit is a leading provider of business and financial management solutions for small business, consumer and professional tax, and accountants. We organize our business into the following five segments: QuickBooks Related. This segment includes our QuickBooks accounting and business management software for small businesses as well as products and services that can be added on to QuickBooks. These include financial supplies, QuickBooks payroll, merchant services and technical support. Intuit Branded Small Business. This segment includes products and services that are designed primarily for small and medium sized businesses and include outsourced payroll and solutions designed to meet the needs of businesses in selected industries. Consumer Tax. This segment includes our TurboTax consumer tax return preparation products and services. Professional Tax. This segment includes our Lacerte and ProSeries professional tax products and services. Other Businesses. This segment consists primarily of our Quicken personal finance products and services and our businesses in Canada and the United Kingdom. 21 Table of Contents Key Accomplishments in Fiscal 2005 In fiscal 2005, we successfully executed growth strategies focused on our core markets of small business, consumer and professional tax, and accountants. This enabled us to acquire more new customers in these markets and sell more products and services to our large base of customers over their lifetime. We introduced several new products, including: QuickBooks Simple Start, which provides accounting functionality suitable for very small businesses; SnapTax, designed for taxpayers with very simple personal income tax returns; ProSeries Basic Edition, designed for the needs of smaller and seasonal tax practices; ProSeries Express Edition, designed for tax practices that focus on helping taxpayers obtain their tax refunds quickly; Quicken Medical Expense Manager; and Quicken Rental Property Manager. Overview of Financial Results Total net revenue for fiscal 2005 was $2.0 billion, up 13% compared with fiscal 2004. The fiscal 2005 revenue increase was primarily due to growth in our QuickBooks Related and Consumer Tax segments. Fiscal 2005 net income was $381.6 million, up 20% compared with fiscal 2004. Net income increased in fiscal 2005 primarily due to revenue growth that was partially offset by higher spending for infrastructure, implementation of new information systems, new product development and promotion and Sarbanes Oxley compliance. Diluted net income per share was $2.03 in fiscal 2005, an increase of 28% compared with fiscal 2004. Diluted net income per share grew faster than net income in fiscal 2005 primarily due to the net reduction of average shares outstanding. Average shares outstanding declined as a result of repurchases of common stock under our stock repurchase programs, partially offset by the issuance of shares under option and employee stock purchase plans. In fiscal 2005 we generated $590.0 million in cash from continuing operations, compared with $552.5 million in fiscal 2004. The fiscal 2005 increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to higher net income from continuing operations. We used $709.2 million in cash for repurchases of common stock under our stock repurchase programs in fiscal 2005. Seasonality Our QuickBooks, Consumer Tax and Professional Tax businesses are highly seasonal. Some of our other offerings are also seasonal, but to a lesser extent. Revenue from upgrades for many of our small business software products, including QuickBooks, tends to be concentrated around calendar year end. Sales of income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from November through April. These seasonal patterns mean that our total net revenue is usually highest during our second quarter ending January 31 and third quarter ending April 30. We typically report losses in our first quarter ending October 31 and fourth quarter ending July 31, when revenue from our tax businesses is minimal while operating expenses continue at relatively consistent levels. Strategy and Trends Strategy. Intuits strategy is to apply our customer driven invention mindset and processes to solve complex customer problems. The key to our success is our 20 year history of staying focused on customer needs. Our in depth customer knowledge allows us to make more informed decisions that lead to better products and services for customers. Opportunities in Our Core Markets. While we have strong positions in our core markets for QuickBooks and TurboTax software, we believe that there are many more opportunities in the markets for small businesses and individual consumers. Many small businesses and individuals are using other methods, such as manual tools and processes or general purpose software. In fiscal 2005 we began to explore ways to meet the needs of customers that we have never reached before. For example, we introduced QuickBooks Simple Start with accounting functionality for very small businesses and SnapTax for taxpayers with very simple personal income tax returns. We expect to continue this focus in fiscal 2006 and beyond. 22 Table of Contents Importance of Developing and Introducing New Products and Services. To remain competitive and grow in the future, we must continue to invest in initiatives aimed at uncovering and meeting new customer needs while enhancing our existing offerings to make them even better. Importance of Technology Infrastructure. Our Internet based products and services include QuickBooks Online Edition, QuickBooks Assisted Payroll Service, Complete web based Payroll, TurboTax for the Web and consumer and professional electronic tax filing services. As our businesses continue to move toward delivering more web based products and services, our technology infrastructure will become even more critical in the future. Competition. We have formidable competitors, and we expect competition to remain intense during fiscal 2006 and beyond. For example, Microsoft Corporation currently offers a number of competitive small business offerings and has indicated that part of its growth strategy is to focus on the small business market. Microsoft has also announced its intention to target small business customers with accounting software and associated services. In our Consumer Tax business, we face the risk of federal and state taxing authorities developing or contracting to provide software or other systems to facilitate tax return preparation and electronic filing at no charge to taxpayers. Critical Accounting Policies In preparing our financial statements, we make estimates, assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue, operating income or loss and net income or loss, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Senior management has reviewed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and their disclosure in this Annual Report on Form 10 K with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Net Revenue Revenue Recognition We derive revenue from the sale of packaged software products, license fees, product support, professional services, outsourced payroll services, merchant services, transaction fees and multiple element arrangements that may include any combination of these items. We follow the appropriate revenue recognition rules for each type of revenue. For additional information, see Net Revenue in Note 1 to the financial statements. We generally recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable. However, determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report. For example, for multiple element arrangements we must make assumptions and judgments in order to allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver, to determine whether undelivered services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services, to determine whether vendor specific evidence of fair value exists for each undelivered element and to determine whether and when each element has been delivered. If we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments, it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period. Amounts for fees collected or invoiced and due relating to arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized when the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied. Net Revenue Return and Rebate Reserves As part of our revenue recognition policy, we estimate future product returns and rebate payments and establish reserves against revenue at the time of sale based on these estimates. Our return policy allows distributors and retailers, subject to contractual limitations, to return purchased products. Product returns by distributors and retailers relate primarily to the return of obsolete products. In determining our product returns reserves, we consider the volume and price mix of products in the retail channel, historical return 23 Table of Contents rates for prior releases of the product, trends in retailer inventory and economic trends that might impact customer demand for our products (including the competitive environment and the timing of new releases of our products). We fully reserve for obsolete products in the distribution channels. Our rebate reserves include distributor and retailer sales incentive rebates and end user rebates. Our estimated reserves for distributor and retailer incentive rebates are based on distributors and retailers actual performance against the terms and conditions of rebate programs, which we typically establish annually. Our reserves for end user rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the specific promotional rebate program, actual sales during the promotion, the amount of redemptions received and historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program. In the past, actual returns and rebates have approximated and not generally exceeded the reserves that we have established. However, actual returns and rebates in any future period are inherently uncertain. If we were to change our assumptions and estimates, our revenue reserves would change, which would impact the net revenue we report. If actual returns and rebates are significantly greater than the reserves we have established, the actual results would decrease our future reported revenue. Conversely, if actual returns and rebates are significantly less than our reserves, this would increase our future reported revenue. For example, if we had increased our fiscal 2005 returns reserves by 1% of non consignment sales to retailers for QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken, our fiscal 2005 total net revenue would have been $3.6 million lower. If rebate redemptions for our QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken products were to increase by 1%, our annual total net revenue would decrease by approximately $1.2 million. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We make ongoing assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable. The accounts receivable amount on our balance sheet includes a reserve for accounts that might not be paid. In determining the amount of the reserve, we consider our historical level of credit losses. We also make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations, and we assess current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future. Our reserves have generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses. However, since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, we cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be adequate. If actual credit losses are significantly greater than the reserve we have established, that would increase our general and administrative expenses and reduce our reported net income. Conversely, if actual credit losses are significantly less than our reserve, this would eventually decrease our general and administrative expenses and increase our reported net income. Goodwill, Purchased Intangible Assets and Other Long Lived Assets Impairment Assessments We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than temporary impairment in the remaining value of the assets recorded on our balance sheet may exist. We test the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise. The timing of the formal annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods. In order to estimate the fair value of long lived assets, we typically make various assumptions about the future prospects for the business that the asset relates to, consider market factors specific to that business and estimate future cash flows to be generated by that business. We evaluate cash flows at the lowest operating level and the number of reporting units that we have identified may make impairment more probable than it would be at a company with fewer reporting units and integrated operations following acquisitions. Based on these assumptions and estimates, we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset stated on our balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions and estimates could 24 Table of Contents materially impact our reported financial results. More conservative assumptions of the anticipated future benefits from these businesses could result in impairment charges, which would decrease net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet. Conversely, less conservative assumptions could result in smaller or no impairment charges, higher net income and higher asset values. In fiscal 2004 we recorded an impairment charge of $18.7 million on goodwill associated with our Intuit Public Sector Solutions business, which was subsequently sold. At July 31, 2005 we had $509.5 million in goodwill and $69.7 million in net purchased intangible assets on our balance sheet. Accounting for Stock Based Incentive Programs Through the end of fiscal 2005, we measured compensation expense for our stock based incentive programs using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Under this method, we did not record compensation expense when stock options were granted to eligible participants as long as the exercise price was not less than the fair market value of the stock when the option was granted. We also did not record compensation expense for shares purchased in connection with our Employee Stock Purchase Plan as long as the purchase price of the stock was not less than 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the stock at the beginning of each offering period or at the end of each purchase period. In accordance with SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation,and SFAS 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, we disclosed our pro forma net income or loss and net income or loss per share as if the fair value based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense for our stock based incentive programs. To determine the pro forma impact of applying SFAS 123, we estimated the fair value of our options using the Black Scholes option valuation model. This model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. This model also requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected volatility of our common stock price. The assumptions we used for the valuation model are set forth in Note 1 to the financial statements. The appropriate volatility factor for stock options and for our Employee Stock Purchase Plan is the estimated future volatility of our stock over the expected life of the options. Prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 we estimated the volatility factors for stock options and for our Employee Stock Purchase Plan using the historical volatility of our stock over the most recent five year period. From the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 through the third quarter of fiscal 2005 we estimated the volatility factors for stock options using the historical volatility of our stock over the most recent three year period, which was approximately equal to the average expected life of our options. During that time we estimated the volatility factors for our Employee Stock Purchase Plan using the historical volatility of our stock over the most recent one year period, which was equal to the length of the offering periods under that plan. Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 we estimated the volatility factors for stock options and for our Employee Stock Purchase Plan using the implied volatility of our stock. We estimated the implied volatility of our stock using the prices of publicly traded options, which we believe provides a more accurate estimate of expected volatility factors over the life of the options. Our stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates. In the future, we may elect to use different assumptions under the Black Scholes valuation model or a different valuation model, which could result in a significantly different impact on our net income or loss. On December 16, 2004 the FASB issued SFAS 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, which is a revision of SFAS 123. SFAS 123(R) requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options and purchases under employee stock purchase plans, to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values. This standard is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We are required to adopt this new standard in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending July 31, 2006. The adoption of SFAS 123(R)s fair value method will have a significant 25 Table of Contents adverse impact on our net income and net income per share. See Recent Accounting Pronouncements later in this Item 7. Legal Contingencies We are subject to certain legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business. We review the status of each significant matter quarterly and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability and an expense for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our accruals are based on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Potential legal liabilities and the revision of estimates of potential legal liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Income Taxes Estimates of Effective Tax Rates, Deferred Taxes and Valuation Allowance When we prepare our financial statements, we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We record an additional amount in our provision for income taxes in the period in which we determine that our recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate tax assessment to be. If in a later period we determine that payment of this additional amount is unnecessary, we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit in that later period. As a result, our ongoing assessments of the probable outcomes of the audit issues and related tax positions require judgment and can materially increase or decrease our effective tax rate and materially affect our operating results. This also requires us to estimate our current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which we show on our balance sheet. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized. To the extent we believe that realization is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. When we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period, we record a corresponding tax expense on our statement of operations. Our net deferred tax asset at July 31, 2005 was $173.3 million, net of the valuation allowance of $6.0 million. We recorded the valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets (consisting primarily of certain state capital loss carryforwards) before they expire. The valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable. While we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, we could be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize. An increase in the valuation allowance would have an adverse impact, which could be material, on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we make the increase. 26 Table of Contents Results of Operations Financial Overview Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal 2005 2004 2004 2003 2005 2004 2003 % Change % Change (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Total net revenue $ 2,037.7 $ 1,802.2 $ 1,597.1 13% 13% Operating income from continuing operations 524.1 419.5 338.6 25% 24% Net income from continuing operations 375.0 323.3 260.1 16% 24% Diluted net income per share from continuing operations $ 1.99 $ 1.61 $ 1.24 24% 30% Net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations $ 590.0 $ 552.5 $ 552.0 7% 0% Total net revenue increased in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 primarily due to growth in QuickBooks, QuickBooks Payroll and Innovative Merchant Solutions merchant services revenue in our QuickBooks Related segment and to growth in TurboTax for the Web and electronic filing and refund transfer services in our Consumer Tax segment. Total net revenue increased in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 primarily due to higher QuickBooks Payroll revenue in our QuickBooks Related segment and to growth in revenue from TurboTax for the Web and electronic filing services in our Consumer Tax segment. Operating income from continuing operations grew faster than total net revenue in fiscal 2005 because the increase in total net revenue was only partially offset by higher spending for infrastructure, implementation of our new information systems, new product development and promotion and Sarbanes Oxley compliance. Operating income from continuing operations grew faster than total net revenue in fiscal 2004 primarily due to an increase in revenue from higher margin products, such as industry specific versions of QuickBooks and QuickBooks Payroll, and to the fact that we reduced costs while revenue grew in our Quicken business. Net income from continuing operations grew more slowly than operating income from continuing operations in fiscal 2005. In fiscal 2004 we reversed $35.7 million in reserves related to potential income tax exposures that were resolved while in fiscal 2005 we reversed only $25.7 million of such reserves. Net income from continuing operations grew at about the same rate as operating income from continuing operations in fiscal 2004 primarily because lower interest and other income and lower gains on marketable equity securities and other investments were offset by our reversal of $35.7 million in reserves related to potential income tax exposures that were resolved. Diluted net income per share from continuing operations grew faster than net income from continuing operations in fiscal 2005 and 2004 primarily due to the net reduction of average shares outstanding. Average shares outstanding declined as a result of repurchases of common stock under our stock repurchase programs, partially offset by the issuance of shares under option and employee stock purchase plans. At July 31, 2005 our cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $994.3 million, a decrease of $23.7 million from July 31, 2004. In fiscal 2005 we generated cash primarily from continuing operations and by issuing common stock under employee stock plans. We used cash in fiscal 2005 primarily for repurchases of common stock under our stock repurchase programs and capital expenditures. In fiscal 2005 we bought 16.2 million shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs at an average price of $43.72 for a total price of $709.2 million. We completed our fourth stock repurchase program in March 2005. In May 2005 our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $500.0 million of our common stock from time to time over a three year period under a fifth repurchase plan that expires on May 15, 2008. At July 31, 2005 authorized funds of $290.8 million remained available under this fifth stock repurchase program. We expect to continue to repurchase shares under this program during fiscal 2006. 27 Table of Contents Total Net Revenue The table below and the discussion of total net revenue that follows it are organized in accordance with our five reportable business segments.

QuickBooks Related total net revenue increased in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 primarily due to higher QuickBooks, Innovative Merchant Solutions merchant services and QuickBooks Payroll revenue. QuickBooks revenue grew on higher unit volume resulting 28 Table of Contents primarily from an increase in new customers and on a favorable product mix. The increase in merchant services revenue was primarily due to growth in the customer base, higher transaction volume per customer and our discontinuation of the outsourcing of certain merchant processing services beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. In fiscal 2005 we completed the transition to recognizing the full revenue from processing merchant transactions that were formerly processed through two major banks rather than the smaller profit sharing fees we would have received under our prior arrangement with those banks. QuickBooks Payroll revenue was higher in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 primarily because of growth in the customer base, price increases and the successful launch of our higher priced Enhanced Payroll Plus offering. Enhanced Payroll Plus provides QuickBooks software upgrades in addition to federal and state tax forms and workers compensation tracking. Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003. QuickBooks Related total net revenue grew in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 due to increased sales of higher priced industry specific versions of QuickBooks and higher QuickBooks Payroll revenue driven by growth in the average customer base, an increase in QuickBooks related services and the realization in fiscal 2004 of the full impact of a December 2002 price increase. The October 2003 acquisition of our Innovative Merchant Solutions merchant services business also contributed to the higher fiscal 2004 total net revenue in this segment. Intuit Branded Small Business Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004. Intuit Branded Small Business total net revenue increased in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 primarily due to growth in our outsourced payroll and Intuit Real Estate Solutions (IRES) businesses. Higher outsourced payroll revenue was driven by growth in the number of QuickBooks Assisted Payroll Service and Complete Payroll customers processing payrolls, price increases and higher interest income on funds held for payroll customers, partially offset by attrition in the Premier Payroll Service customer base. The increase in IRES revenue was a result of growth in sales to larger customers. Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003. Intuit Branded Small Business total net revenue increased in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 primarily due to new client acquisition in our wholesale durable goods and property management solutions businesses as well as higher average selling prices from increased customer use of support and other services in these businesses. Consumer Tax Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004. Consumer Tax total net revenue increased in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 primarily due to higher federal TurboTax for the Web units and to volume and price increases in electronic filing and refund transfer services. Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003. Consumer Tax total net revenue increased in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 as a result of TurboTax for the Web and retail desktop unit growth, higher attach rates for electronic filing services and higher average selling prices. Professional Tax Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004. Professional Tax total net revenue increased in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 primarily due to an increase in Lacerte product revenue driven by improved customer retention rates and to bank product transmission services volume from our new ProSeries Express product. Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003. Professional Tax total net revenue grew slightly in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 due to additional sales to existing customers, higher average selling prices related to product enhancements and increased sales of our unlimited electronic filing product as a result of new government rules requiring the electronic filing of certain professionally prepared 2003 income tax returns. However, revenue growth in fiscal 2004 was negatively impacted by competition from lower priced professional tax preparation software products. 29 Table of Contents Other Businesses Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004. Other Businesses total net revenue increased in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004. Quicken service revenue was higher in fiscal 2005 primarily due to the growing base of financial institutions paying for Quicken connectivity and growth in our bill payment customer base. Canadian revenue increased in fiscal 2005 primarily due to market share gains for QuickBooks software and higher subscription revenue for payroll services that was driven by improvements in service levels. Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003. Other Businesses total net revenue grew slightly in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 primarily due to higher Quicken revenue. In fiscal 2004 Quicken direct unit sales increased in response to direct mail campaigns for upgrades due to the discontinuation of support for older versions of the product and for TurboTax cross selling offers. Retail unit sales also increased. Aggregate average selling prices for Quicken were higher in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 due to a shift in demand to our higher priced Quicken Premier and Quicken Home and Business products. Partially offsetting these increases, Quicken other revenue declined in fiscal 2004 due to the expiration or termination of contracts with several significant online advertising customers. We exited the online advertising business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Canadian revenue in U.S. dollars was slightly higher in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 due to the favorable effect of the strengthening Canadian dollar in fiscal 2004. Total net revenue in Canadian dollars decreased in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003, primarily due to lower demand for QuickBooks in Canada. QuickTax revenue was also down in fiscal 2004 due to a decline in unit sales that was partially offset by higher average selling prices related to a shift in demand toward the higher priced specialty versions of that product.

Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004. Cost of service revenue as a percentage of service revenue decreased in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 primarily due to growth in our Consumer Tax electronic filing revenue and Innovative Merchant Solutions merchant services revenue, both of which had minimal cost increases associated with the related revenue increases, and to customer service efficiencies in our outsourced payroll business. Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003. Cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue decreased in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003. This was primarily due to a continuing shift toward 30 Table of Contents sales of our higher priced QuickBooks products and to lower royalties incurred for our Consumer Tax and Quicken products. Cost of service revenue as a percentage of service revenue decreased in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003. This decrease was due in part to growth in our Consumer Tax electronic filing revenue, which had minimal incremental costs. Cost of service revenue as a percentage of service revenue also decreased in fiscal 2004 due to growth in revenue from the higher margin Innovative Merchant Solutions merchant services business we acquired in the first quarter of fiscal 2004.

Selling and marketing expenses include the cost of providing customer service and technical support to customers who have not purchased support plans. Individually and in the aggregate, core operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenue were generally consistent in the periods presented. Total core operating expenses in dollars increased in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 primarily due to spending for infrastructure, implementation of our new information systems, new product development and promotion and Sarbanes Oxley compliance. We plan to continue to upgrade our new information systems to improve performance and support our future growth. We also plan to continue to spend for new product development and promotion. Total core operating expenses in dollars increased in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 primarily due to spending for infrastructure and implementation of our new information systems. 31 Table of Contents Segment Operating Income (Loss) Segment operating income or loss is segment net revenue less segment cost of revenue and operating expenses. Segment expenses do not include certain costs, such as corporate general and administrative expenses, that are not allocated to specific segments. These unallocated costs totaled $388.0 million in fiscal 2005, $348.5 million in fiscal 2004 and $318.3 million in fiscal 2003. In addition, segment expenses do not include amortization of purchased intangible assets, acquisition related charges, and impairment of goodwill and purchased intangible assets. Segment expenses also do not include interest and other income and realized net gains or losses on marketable equity securities. See Note 9 to the financial statements for reconciliations of total segment operating income to income from continuing operations for each fiscal year presented. % of % of % of Fiscal Related Fiscal Related Fiscal Related 2005 2004 2004 2003 2005 Revenue 2004 Revenue 2003 Revenue % Change % Change (Dollars in millions) QuickBooks Related $ 321.9 43% $ 289.0 44 % $ 247.6 45 % 11 % 17 % Intuit Branded Small Business 15.6 7% (12.1 ) (16.3 ) NM NM Consumer Tax 379.8 67% 320.3 65 % 271.6 64 % 19 % 18 % Professional Tax 132.7 50% 138.5 55 % 141.4 58 % 4 % 2 % Other Businesses 88.9 41% 66.0 33 % 57.8 30 % 35 % 14 % Total segment operating income $ 938.9 46% $ 801.7 44 % $ 702.1 44 % 17 % 14 % QuickBooks Related Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004. QuickBooks Related segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue was flat in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004. The 15% revenue increase compared with fiscal 2004 was offset by increased spending for QuickBooks product development, technical support and marketing in fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003. QuickBooks Related segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue was flat in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003. The 18% revenue increase compared with fiscal 2004 included strong growth in our high margin QuickBooks Payroll business and the first quarter fiscal 2004 acquisition of Innovative Merchant Solutions. The higher fiscal 2004 revenue was offset by increases in spending for QuickBooks product development, technical support, marketing programs and direct sales personnel and infrastructure. Intuit Branded Small Business Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004. Our Intuit Branded Small Business segment had operating income in fiscal 2005 after experiencing an operating loss in fiscal 2004. This was primarily due to outsourced payroll revenue growth combined with customer service efficiencies, the consolidation of regional sales facilities and a reorganization of the sales force that resulted in lower spending in that business in fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003. Our Intuit Branded Small Business segment had a smaller operating loss in fiscal 2004 than it did in fiscal 2003. Revenue for this segment grew 11% while we held costs steady in our industry solutions businesses. Partially offsetting these improvements, outsourced payroll operating income was lower in fiscal 2004 because we incurred expenses for additional sales and service personnel during the first half of the year. 32 Table of Contents Consumer Tax Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004. Consumer Tax segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue was slightly higher in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004. Higher revenue from TurboTax federal units and volume and price increases in electronic filing and refund transfer services was offset by higher expenses for advertising, product development, customer support and retail merchandising. Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003. Consumer Tax segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue was flat in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003. Higher revenue and gross margin improvements due to higher average selling prices and growing high margin service revenues were partially offset by additional costs incurred for national television and radio advertising in fiscal 2004. Professional Tax Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004. Professional Tax segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue decreased in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004. Higher revenue was more than offset by higher spending for overall customer support and for product development and marketing related to our new ProSeries Basic and ProSeries Express products. Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003. Professional Tax segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue declined slightly on a 3% revenue increase in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003. Segment operating income did not grow in fiscal 2004 because of increased spending on product development and customer service. Other Businesses Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004. Other Businesses segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue increased in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004. Quicken revenue was higher while Quicken cost of revenue was relatively flat primarily due to savings resulting from the outsourcing of our Quicken.com website. Higher revenue combined with relatively stable spending also produced better fiscal 2005 operating margins in Canada. Fiscal 2004 Compared with Fiscal 2003. Other Businesses segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue increased slightly in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003. Quicken revenue increased on relatively flat spending and we exited the unprofitable online brokerage business in the first quarter of fiscal 2004. Partially offsetting the Quicken improvements, Canadian operating income as a percentage of related revenue was down in fiscal 2004 due to lower revenue on relatively stable spending. Non Operating Income and Expenses Interest and Other Income Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal 2005 2004 2003 Interest income $ 17.5 $ 13.6 $ 22.1 Quicken Loans royalties and fees 9.8 10.2 10.1 Net foreign exchange gain (0.1 ) 2.7 5.1 Insurance settlement 2.2 Other (0.5 ) 1.7 1.1 Total interest and other income $ 26.7 $ 30.4 $ 38.4 Higher interest rates and slightly higher average invested balances resulted in an increase in interest income in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004. Interest income decreased in fiscal 2004 compared with 2003 due to lower interest rates and lower average invested balances that were a result of common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase programs and acquisitions. Total interest and other income for all 33 Table of Contents periods presented included royalties from trademark license and distribution agreements that we entered into when we sold our Quicken Loans mortgage business in July 2002. See Note 8 to the financial statements. The decrease in net foreign exchange gains in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 and in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 resulted primarily from our conversion of a significant portion of our Canadian intercompany balances to long term investments in that subsidiary in the third quarter of fiscal 2004. This reduced our statement of operations exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate was 32.6% for fiscal 2005, 28.4% for fiscal 2004 and 32.9% for fiscal 2003. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2005 differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the net effect of the reversal of $25.7 million in reserves related to potential income tax exposures that were resolved, the federal research and experimental credit and to the benefit received from tax exempt interest income offset by state taxes. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2004 differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the net effect of the reversal of $35.7 million in reserves related to potential income tax exposures that were resolved, the federal research and experimental credit and to the benefit received from tax exempt interest income offset by state taxes and acquisition related charges. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2003 differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the net effect of the benefit received from tax exempt interest income and various tax credits offset by state taxes and acquisition related charges. See Note 12 to the financial statements. At July 31, 2005 we had net deferred tax assets of $173.3 million, which included a valuation allowance of $6.0 million for certain state capital loss carryforwards. We decreased the valuation allowance by $1.5 million in fiscal 2005 due to the realization of state capital loss carryforwards that were previously estimated to be unrealizable and adjustments made to foreign net operating loss carryforwards. The allowance reflects managements assessment that we may not receive the benefit of certain loss carryforwards in certain state jurisdictions. While we believe our current valuation allowance is sufficient, it may be necessary to increase this amount if it becomes more likely that we will not realize a greater portion of the net deferred tax assets. We assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. See Note 12 to the financial statements. Discontinued Operations Intuit Information Technology Solutions In May 2005 our Board of Directors formally approved a plan to sell our Intuit Information Technology Solutions (ITS) business. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 144, we determined that ITS became a long lived asset held for sale and a discontinued operation in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Consequently, we have segregated the operating results of ITS from continuing operations on our statement of operations for all periods presented. Since the carrying value of ITS at July 31, 2005 was less than the estimated fair value less cost to sell, no adjustment to the carrying value of this long lived asset was necessary during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. See Note 8 to the financial statements. Intuit Public Sector Solutions In December 2004 we sold our Intuit Public Sector Solutions (IPSS) business for approximately $11 million and accounted for the sale as a discontinued operation. In accordance with SFAS 144, we have segregated the operating results of IPSS from continuing operations on our statement of operations for all periods prior to the sale. In fiscal 2005 we recorded a loss on disposal of IPSS of $4.8 million that included an income tax provision of $4.3 million for the estimated tax payable in connection with the tax gain on the transaction. The fiscal 2004 net loss from Intuit Public Sector Solutions discontinued operations included a goodwill impairment charge of $18.7 million. See Note 8 to the financial statements. 34 Table of Contents Intuit KK In February 2003 we sold our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary, Intuit KK, and accounted for the sale as a discontinued operation. In accordance with SFAS 144, we have segregated the operating results of Intuit KK from continuing operations on our statement of operations for all periods prior to the sale. In fiscal 2003 we recorded a gain on disposal of this discontinued operation of $71.0 million, net of income taxes of $5.1 million. See Note 8 to the financial statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources Statements of Cash Flows At July 31, 2005 our cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $994.3 million, a decrease of $23.7 million from July 31, 2004. In fiscal 2005 we generated cash primarily from continuing operations and by issuing common stock under employee stock plans. We used cash in fiscal 2005 primarily for repurchases of common stock under our stock repurchase programs and capital expenditures. The following table summarizes selected items from our statements of cash flows for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003. See the financial statements in Item 8 for complete statements of cash flows for those periods. Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal 2005 2004 2003 (In millions) Net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations $ 590.0 $ 552.5 $ 552.0 Net income from continuing operations 375.0 323.3 260.2 Depreciation 100.0 77.3 73.4 Acquisition related costs 26.8 33.6 45.1 Net cash used in investing activities of continuing operations (1.6 ) (208.2 ) (320.5 ) Acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired (4.3 ) (121.4 ) (43.2 ) Net liquidation (purchases) of available for sale debt securities 69.9 (64.3 ) (230.6 ) Purchases of property and equipment (38.2 ) (51.8 ) (41.2 ) Capitalization of internal use software (31.4 ) (65.8 ) (42.9 ) Net cash used in financing activities (548.1 ) (510.0 ) (661.7 ) Purchase of treasury stock (709.9 ) (610.2 ) (814.3 ) Net proceeds from issuance of common stock 165.8 119.1 155.9 Net cash provided by discontinued operations 17.3 24.2 184.6 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 57.9 (141.3 ) (241.5 ) We generated cash from our operating activities during fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, primarily from net income from continuing operations in each of those years. We used cash for investing activities during fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003. Our primary use of cash for investing activities in fiscal 2004 was for business acquisitions. Our primary use of cash for investing activities in fiscal 2003 was for net purchases of available for sale debt securities. We used cash for financing activities in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, primarily for the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase programs. See Stock Repurchase Programs below and Note 13 to the financial statements. This was partially offset by proceeds that we received from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans in each of these fiscal years. Cash generated by discontinued operations in fiscal 2003 included collection of $245.6 million in amounts due from the purchaser of our Quicken Loans business and a net gain of $71.0 million from the sale of Intuit KK. See Note 8 to the financial statements. 35 Table of Contents Stock Repurchase Programs Intuits Board of Directors has initiated a series of common stock repurchase programs. Shares of common stock repurchased under these programs become treasury shares. The following table summarizes the historical activity under our stock repurchase programs as of July 31, 2005. Date Initiated/ Amount Amount Shares Plan Name Increased Date Concluded Authorized Repurchased Repurchased (Dollars in millions) Repurchase Plan I May 2001/July 2002 December 2002 $ 750.0 $ 750.0 16,602,583 Repurchase Plan II March 2003 November 2003 500.0 500.0 11,280,609 Repurchase Plan III August 2003 June 2004 500.0 500.0 11,197,779 Repurchase Plan IV May 2004 March 2005 500.0 500.0 11,493,290 Repurchase Plan V May 2005 Still active 500.0 209.2 4,730,840 In May 2005 our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500.0 million of our common stock from time to time over a three year period under Repurchase Plan V, which expires on May 15, 2008. At July 31, 2005 authorized funds of approximately $290.8 million remained under Repurchase Plan V. We expect to continue to repurchase shares under this plan in fiscal 2006. Loans to Executive Officers and Other Employees Outstanding loans to executive officers and other employees totaled $9.2 million at July 31, 2005 and $17.1 million at July 31, 2004. Loans to executive officers and other employees at July 31, 2005 excluded a $5.5 million secured loan to one executive officer who ceased to be an Intuit employee in the third quarter of fiscal 2005. We transferred this loan to other long term assets on our balance sheet in that quarter. Loans to executive officers are primarily relocation loans that are generally secured by real property and have original maturity dates of up to 10 years. At July 31, 2005 no loans were in default and all interest payments were current in accordance with the terms of the loan agreements. Consistent with the requirements of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, no loans to executive officers have been made or modified since July 30, 2002 and we do not intend to make or modify loans to executive officers in the future. See Note 17 to the financial statements. Repurchases of Vested Restricted Stock In the third quarters of fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, we entered into share repurchase agreements with Stephen M. Bennett, our chief executive officer, pursuant to which we repurchased shares of our common stock from Mr. Bennett at the closing price quoted on The Nasdaq Stock Market on the dates of repurchase. We repurchased 15,945 shares of our common stock at $41.81 per share from Mr. Bennett in fiscal 2005, 17,157 shares at $44.64 per share in fiscal 2004 and 17,532 shares at $39.02 in fiscal 2003. All of the proceeds from these repurchases were remitted to federal and state taxing authorities to satisfy Mr. Bennetts federal, state and Medicare tax withholding obligations resulting from the vesting of 37,500 shares of our common stock in each of those three quarters under his January 2000 new hire restricted stock awards. These repurchases were approved by our Board of Directors. Other We evaluate, on an ongoing basis, the merits of acquiring technology or businesses, or establishing strategic relationships with and investing in other companies. We may decide to use cash and cash equivalents to fund such activities in the future. We believe that our cash, cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. 36 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of July 31, 2005 we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulations S K.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements SFAS 123(R), Share Based Payment On December 16, 2004 the FASB issued SFAS 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, (SFAS 123(R)) which is a revision of SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. SFAS 123(R) supercedes APB 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and amends SFAS 95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in SFAS 123(R) is similar to the approach described in SFAS 123. However, SFAS 123(R) requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options and purchases under employee stock purchase plans, to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure of fair value recognition will no longer be an alternative. SFAS 123(R) is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005, with earlier adoption permitted. We are required to adopt this new standard in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending July 31, 2006. SFAS 123(R) permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods: 1. A modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date (a) based on the requirements of SFAS 123(R) for all share based payments granted after the effective date and (b) based on the requirements of SFAS 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date that remain unvested on the effective date. 2. A modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above but also permits restatement using amounts previously disclosed under the pro forma provisions of SFAS 123 either for (a) all prior periods presented or (b) prior interim periods of the year of adoption. We have not yet chosen a method of adoption for SFAS 123(R). As permitted by SFAS 123, through the end of fiscal 2005 we accounted for share based payments to employees using APB 25s intrinsic value method. As a consequence, we generally recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options and purchases under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. 37 Table of Contents Although the adoption of SFAS 123(R)s fair value method will have no adverse impact on our balance sheet or net cash flows, it will have a significant adverse impact on our net income and net income per share. The pro forma effects on net income and earnings per share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 to share based payments to employees in prior periods are disclosed in Note 1 under Stock Based Incentive Programs. Although the pro forma effects of applying SFAS 123 may be indicative of the effects of applying SFAS 123(R), the provisions of these two statements differ in some important respects. The actual effects of adopting SFAS 123(R) will depend on numerous factors including the valuation model we use to value future share based payments to employees, estimated forfeiture rates and the accounting policies we adopt concerning the method of recognizing the fair value of awards over the requisite service period. We currently estimate that the fiscal 2006 impact on Intuit of adopting SFAS 123(R) will be a decrease in net income of approximately $45 million. SFAS 123(R) also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as prescribed under current accounting rules. This requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption. Total cash flow will remain unchanged compared with cash flow as it would have been reported under prior accounting rules. SFAS 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections On June 1, 2005 the FASB issued SFAS 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, which replaces APB 20, Accounting Changes, and SFAS 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements. SFAS 154 applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle, and changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable. APB 20 previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle. SFAS 154 carries forward many other provisions of APB 20 without change, including the provisions related to the reporting of a change in accounting estimate, a change in the reporting entity and the correction of an error. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. Earlier application is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after June 1, 2005. We do not expect our adoption of this new standard to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 38 Table of Contents RISKS THAT COULD AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS In evaluating Intuit and our business, you should consider the following factors in addition to the other information in this annual report on Form 10 K. Forward looking statements in this report are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied in the forward looking statements. Any of the following risks could seriously harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We face intense competitive pressures in all of our businesses that may negatively impact our revenue, profitability and market position. We have formidable competitors, and we expect competition to remain intense during fiscal 2006 and beyond. The number, resources and sophistication of the companies with whom we compete has increased as we continue to expand our product and service offerings. Microsoft Corporation, in particular, presents a significant threat to a number of our businesses due to its market position, strategic focus and superior financial resources. Our competitors may introduce new and improved products and services, bundle new offerings with market leading products, reduce prices, gain better access to distribution channels, advertise aggressively or beat us to market with new products and services. Any of these competitive actions taken over any prolonged period could diminish our revenue and profitability and could affect our ability to keep existing customers and acquire new customers. Some additional competitive factors that may impact our businesses are discussed below. QuickBooks Related. Losing existing or potential QuickBooks customers to competitors causes us to lose potential software revenue and limits our opportunities to sell related products and services such as our financial supplies, QuickBooks Payroll and merchant service offerings. Many competitors and potential competitors provide, or have expressed significant interest in providing, accounting and business management products and services to small businesses. For example, Microsoft currently offers a number of competitive small business offerings and has indicated part of its growth strategy is to focus on small business offerings. In November 2004 Microsoft announced the impending launch of a number of product and service offerings aimed at small businesses, including a product named Microsoft Office Small Business Accounting, which is expected to be integrated with the Microsoft Office product suite and available in the fall of 2005. Microsoft also announced partnerships with ADP and other service providers to offer payroll related services that interact with its products. In July 2005 Microsoft announced that it will collaborate with leading merchant acquiring institutions, including Chase Merchant Services LLC, to offer credit card processing for Microsoft Office Small Business Accounting. Accordingly, we expect that competition from Microsoft in the small business area will intensify over time with the introduction of these and other offerings that directly compete with our QuickBooks and other offerings. Although we have successfully competed with Microsoft in the past, given its market position and resources, Microsofts small business product and service offerings may have a significant negative impact on our revenue and profitability. Consumer Tax. Our consumer tax business faces significant competition from both the public and private sector. In the public sector we face the risk of federal and state taxing authorities developing or contracting to provide software or other systems to facilitate tax return preparation and electronic filing at no charge to taxpayers. Federal Government. Agencies of the U.S. government have made several attempts during the two most recent presidential administrations to offer taxpayers a form of free tax preparation software and filing service. However, in October 2002 the U.S. Internal Revenue Service agreed not to provide its own competing tax software product or service so long as participants in an association of private tax preparation software companies, including Intuit, agreed to provide web based federal tax preparation and filing services at no cost to qualified taxpayers for a period of three years, subject to recurring two year extensions. The relationship, called the Free File Alliance, is principally designed to serve lower income, disadvantaged and underserved taxpayers with the objective of making free federal online tax preparation software and filing services available to at least 60% of taxpayers. The agreement is currently under negotiation by the federal government 39 Table of Contents and the Free File Alliance for possible changes. Although, for the time being, the Free File Alliance has kept the federal government from being a direct competitor to our tax offerings, it has fostered additional web based competition and has the potential to cause us to lose revenue opportunities for a large percentage of the tax base. Over time, a growing number of competitors have used the Free File Alliance as a free marketing tool by giving away services at the federal level and attempting to make money by selling state filing and other services. Accordingly, for the 2004 tax season we modified our Free File Alliance offering to permit all taxpayers to prepare and file federal returns at no charge. Our free web based offering was fully functional but it did not allow the download of prior year information into the current year tax return. Although we were successful in the 2004 tax season in selling Free File Alliance users enhanced offerings and state tax preparation services, we may not be successful in this endeavor in the future. In addition, persons who formerly have paid for our products may elect to use our unpaid federal offering instead. Any amendments to the current agreement could also have unexpected and negative effects on our business. Further, were the federal government to terminate the Free File Alliance and elect to provide its own software and electronic filing services available to taxpayers at no charge it would negatively impact our revenue and profits. State Governments. State taxing authorities have also actively pursued strategies to provide free online tax return preparation and electronic filing services for state taxpayers. For the 2004 tax season 22 states, including California, directly offered their own online services to taxpayers. In addition, for the 2004 tax season California tested its Ready Return concept by preparing about 60,000 state income tax returns from available electronic sources and presenting them at no additional cost to taxpayers for acceptance and filing. It is possible that other governmental entities that currently do not offer such services will elect to pursue similar competitive offerings in the future. These publicly sponsored programs have caused us to lose potential customers to free offerings and have enabled competitors to gain market share at our expense by using participation in the free alliances as an effective tool to attract customers to ancillary paid offerings. Given the efficiencies that electronic tax filing provides to taxing authorities, we anticipate that governmental competition will present a continued competitive threat to our business for the foreseeable future. Private Sector. In the private sector we face intense competition primarily from H&R Block, the makers of TaxCut software, and increasingly from web based competitive offerings where we are subject to significant and increasing price pressure. We also compete for customers with low cost assisted tax preparation businesses, such as H&R Block. Other Segments (Intuit Branded Small Business, Professional Tax and Other Businesses). Our professional tax offerings face pricing pressure from competitors seeking to obtain our customers through deep product discounts and loss of customers to competitors offering no frills offerings at low prices, such as Kleinrock Publishings ATX product line. This business also faces competition from competitively priced tax and accounting solutions that include integration with non tax functionality. The substantial size of our principal competitors in the outsourced payroll services business benefit from greater economies of scale that may result in pricing pressure for our offerings. In addition, in November 2004 Microsoft announced that it had entered into partnership agreements with ADP and other service providers to offer payroll related services that interact with its products. The growth of electronic banking and other electronic payment systems is decreasing the demand for checks and consequently causing pricing pressure for our supplies products as competitors aggressively compete for share of this shrinking market. Our Quicken products compete both with Microsoft Money, which is aggressively promoted and priced, and with web based electronic banking and personal finance tracking and management tools that are becoming increasingly available at no cost to consumers. These competitive pressures may result in reduced revenue and lower profitability for our Quicken product line and related bill payment service offering. Future revenue growth for our core products depends upon our introduction of new and enhanced products and services. Our customer driven invention and associated product development efforts are critical to our success. The introduction of new offerings and product and service enhancements are necessary for us to differentiate 40 Table of Contents our offerings from those of our competitors and to motivate our existing customers to purchase upgrades, or current year products in the case of our tax offerings. A number of our businesses derive a significant amount of their revenue through one time upfront license fees and rely on customer upgrades and service offerings that include upgrades to generate a significant portion of their revenues. As our existing products mature, encouraging customers to purchase product upgrades becomes more challenging unless new product releases provide features and functionality that have meaningful incremental value. If we are not able to develop and clearly demonstrate the value of upgraded products to our customers, our upgrade and service revenues will be negatively impacted. Similarly, our business will be harmed if we are not successful in our efforts to develop and introduce new products and services to retain our existing customers, expand our customer base and increase revenues per customer. Our new product and service offerings may not achieve market success or may cannibalize sales of our existing products, causing our revenues and earnings to decrease. Our future success depends in large part upon our ability to identify emerging opportunities in our target markets and our capacity to quickly develop, and sell products and services that satisfy these demands in a cost effective manner. Successfully predicting demand trends is difficult, and we may expend a significant amount of resources and management attention on products or services that do not ultimately succeed in their markets. We have encountered difficulty in launching new products and services in the past. For example, in 2004 we discontinued our QuickBooks Premier Healthcare offering due to lack of customer demand. If we misjudge customer needs, our new products and services will not succeed and our revenues and earnings will be negatively impacted. In addition, as we expand our offerings to new customer categories we run the risk of customers shifting from higher priced and higher margin products to newly introduced lower priced offerings. For instance, our new QuickBooks Simple Start offering, our new Snap Tax offering and our new ProSeries Basic and ProSeries Express offerings may attract users that would otherwise have purchased our higher priced, more full featured offerings. The nature of our products necessitates timely product launches and if we experience significant product quality problems or delays, it will harm our revenues, operating income and reputation. All of our tax products and many of our non tax products have rigid development timetables that increase the risk of errors in our products and the risk of launch delays. Many of our products are highly complex and require interoperability with other software products and services. Our tax preparation software product development cycle is particularly challenging due to the need to incorporate unpredictable tax law and tax form changes each year and because our customers expect high levels of accuracy and a timely launch of these products to prepare and file their taxes by April 15th. Due to this complexity and the condensed development cycles under which we operate, our products sometimes contain bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the software. For example, our software may face interoperability difficulties with software operating systems or programs being used by our customers. When we encounter problems we may be required to modify our code, distribute patches to customers who have already purchased the product and recall or repackage existing product inventory in our distribution channels. If we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our products late in our development cycle it may cause us to delay our product launch date. Any major defects or launch delays could lead to the following: loss of customers to competitors, which could also deprive us of future revenue attributable to repeat purchases, product upgrades and purchases of related services; negative publicity and damage to our brands; customer dissatisfaction; reduced retailer shelf space and product promotions; and increased operating expenses, such as inventory replacement costs and in our Consumer Tax business, expenses resulting from our commitment to reimburse penalties and interest paid by customers due solely to calculation errors in our consumer tax preparation products. 41 Table of Contents The growth of our business depends on our ability to adapt to rapid technological change. The software industry in which we operate is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions and enhancements. Our Right for Me marketing approach increases the importance for us of developing additional versions of our products to meet specific customer needs. Our ability to succeed in this rapidly changing environment requires that we continuously invest resources to enhance our software architecture and developer tools. We must make this investment in order to continue to enhance our current products and develop new products to meet changing customer needs and to attract and retain talented software developers. We are currently in the process of modernizing the software platforms for a number of our product lines, including our QuickBooks, TurboTax, Quicken and IDMS products. Completing these upgrades and adapting to other technological developments may require considerable time and expense. If we experience prolonged delays or unforeseen difficulties in upgrading our software architecture, our ability to develop new products and enhancements to our current products would suffer. If we fail to maintain reliable and responsive service levels for our electronic tax offerings, or if the IRS or other governmental agencies experience difficulties in receiving customer submissions, we could lose revenue and customers. Our web based tax preparation services, electronic filing services and pay as you go services are an important and growing part of our tax businesses and must effectively handle extremely heavy customer demand during the peak tax season from January to April. We face significant risks and challenges in maintaining these services and maintaining adequate service levels, particularly during peak volume service times. Similarly, governmental entities receiving electronic tax filings must also handle large volumes of data and may experience difficulties with their systems preventing the receipt of electronic filings. If customers are unable to file their returns electronically they may elect to make paper filings. This would result in reduced electronic tax return preparation and filing revenues and profits and would negatively impact our reputation and ability to keep and attract customers who demand a reliable electronic filing experience. We have experienced relatively brief unscheduled interruptions in our electronic filing and or tax preparation services during past tax years. For example, on April 15, 2003 we experienced a relatively brief unscheduled interruption in our electronic filing service during which certain users of our professional tax products were unable to receive confirmation from us that their electronic filing had been accepted and on April 15, 2002 we reached maximum capacity for processing e filings for a short period of time. If we experience any prolonged difficulties with our web based tax preparation or electronic filing service at any time during the tax season, we could lose current and future customers, receive negative publicity and incur increased operating costs, any of which could have a significant negative impact on the financial and market success of these businesses and have a negative impact on our near term and long term financial results. If actual product returns exceed returns reserves, or if actual customer rebate redemptions exceed rebate reserves, our revenue would be lower. We ship more desktop software products to our distributors and retailers than we expect them to sell, in order to reduce the risk that distributors or retailers will run out of products. This is particularly true for our Consumer Tax products, which have a short selling season and for which returns occur primarily in our fiscal third and fourth quarters. Like many software companies that sell their products through distributors and retailers, we have historically accepted significant product returns. We establish reserves against revenue for product returns in our financial statements, based on estimated future returns of products. We closely monitor levels of product sales and inventory in the retail channel in an effort to maintain reserves that are adequate to cover expected returns. In the past, returns have not generally exceeded these reserves. However, if we do experience actual returns that significantly exceed reserves, it would result in lower net revenue. For example, if we had increased our fiscal 2005 returns reserves by 1% of non consignment sales to retailers for QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken, our fiscal 2005 total net revenue would have been approximately $3.6 million lower. In addition, our policy of recognizing revenue from distributors and retailers upon delivery of product for non consignment sales is predicated upon our 42 Table of Contents ability to reasonably estimate returns. If we do not continue to demonstrate our ability to estimate returns then our revenue recognition policy for these types of sales may no longer be appropriate. We also offer customer rebates as part of our selling efforts and establish reserves through a charge to revenue for estimated future payments of rebates. Historically, a percentage of customers do not submit requests for their rebates. Rebate redemption rates are going up because we, along with certain retailers, are making it easier for customers to claim rebates. While we have taken this trend into account in determining our rebate reserves, if a greater number of eligible customers seek rebates than for which we have provided reserves our margins will be adversely affected. If rebate redemptions for our QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken products were to increase by 1%, our annual total net revenue would decrease by approximately $1.2 million. We are continuing to enhance our new information systems, which we use to manage our business and finance operations, and problems with the design or implementation of these enhancements could interfere with our business and operations. In September 2004 we implemented new information systems that manage our business and finance operations. During the course of the conversion we upgraded significant financial systems, order taking systems, middleware systems (systems that allow for interoperability of different databases) and network security systems. While we were able to complete the processing requirements of our peak business season in fiscal 2005, we experienced some system related slowdowns. Consequently, we believe that we need to further enhance and upgrade the systems over the next several months to improve performance and support our future growth. In the event that we are unable to expand the capabilities of our systems, our ability to grow our business will be limited. The expenditures associated with the expansion and upgrade of our systems could be significant. Problems with the design or implementation of these system enhancements could adversely impact our ability to do the following in a timely and accurate manner: take customer orders, ship products, provide services and support to our customers, bill and track our customers, fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise run our business. Our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and our quarterly results fluctuate significantly. Several of our businesses are highly seasonal causing significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results. Revenue and operating results are usually strongest during the second and third fiscal quarters ending January 31 and April 30 due to our tax businesses contributing most of their revenue during those quarters and the timing of the release of our small business software upgrades. We experience lower revenues, and significant operating losses, in the first and fourth quarters ending October 31 and July 31. For example, in the second and third quarters of our last two fiscal years we had total net revenue of between $620.6 million and $834.9 million while in our first and fourth fiscal quarters we had total net revenue of between $227.1 million and $301.8 million. Our financial results can also fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of factors, including changes in product sales mix that affect average selling prices, product release dates, the timing of our discontinuance of support for older product offerings, the timing of sales of our higher priced Intuit Branded Small Business offerings, our methods for distributing our products, including the shift to a consignment model for some of our desktop products sold through retail distribution channels, the inclusion of upgrades with certain offerings (which can impact the pattern of revenue recognition), and the timing of acquisitions, divestitures, and goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairment charges. As our product and service offerings become more complex our revenue streams may become less predictable. Our expanding range of products and services generates more varied revenue streams than our traditional desktop software businesses. The accounting policies that apply to these revenue streams are more complex than those that apply to our traditional products and services. We expect this trend to continue as we acquire additional companies and expand our offerings. For example, as we begin to offer additional features and options as part of multiple element revenue arrangements, we could be required to defer a higher percentage of our product revenue at the time of sale than we do for traditional products. This would decrease recognized revenue at the time products are shipped, but result in increased recognized 43 Table of Contents revenue in fiscal periods after shipment. In addition, our Intuit Branded Small Business segment businesses offer products and services with significantly higher prices than our traditional core business software products. Revenue from these offerings tends to be less predictable than revenue from our traditional desktop products due to longer sales and implementation cycles, which could cause our quarterly revenue from these businesses to fluctuate. Acquisition related costs and impairment charges can cause significant fluctuation in our net income. Our acquisitions have resulted in significant expenses, including amortization of purchased assets (which is reflected in cost of revenue), as well as charges for in process research and development, impairment of goodwill, amortization and impairment of purchased intangible assets and charges for deferred compensation (which are reflected in operating expenses). Total acquisition related costs in the categories identified above were $26.8 million in fiscal 2005, $33.6 million in fiscal 2004 and $45.1 million in fiscal 2003. Although under current accounting rules goodwill is no longer amortized, we may incur impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions. We test the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise. The timing of the formal annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods. For example, at the end of fiscal 2004 we incurred a goodwill impairment charge of $18.7 million related to our Intuit Public Sector Solutions business. As of July 31, 2005 we had goodwill of $509.5 million and unamortized purchased intangible assets of $69.7 million on our balance sheet, both of which could be subject to impairment charges in the future. New acquisitions, and any impairment of the value of purchased assets, could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results. If we do not respond promptly and effectively to customer service and technical support inquiries we will lose customers and our revenues will decline. The effectiveness of our customer service and technical support operations are critical to customer satisfaction and our financial success. If we do not respond effectively to service and technical support requests we will lose customers and miss revenue opportunities, such as paid service, product renewals and new product sales. In our service offerings, such as our merchant card processing and outsourced payroll businesses, customer service delivery is fundamental to retaining and maintaining existing customers and acquiring new customers. We occasionally experience customer service and technical support problems, including longer than expected waiting times for customers when our staffing and systems are inadequate to handle a higher than anticipated volume of requests. We also risk losing service at any one of our customer contact centers and our redundancy systems could prove inadequate to provide backup support. Training and retaining qualified customer service and technical support personnel is particularly challenging due to the expansion of our product offerings and the seasonality of our tax business. For example, in fiscal 2005 the number of our consumer tax service representatives ranged from 15 during off season months to about 715 at the peak of the season. If we do not adequately train our support representatives our customers will not receive the level of support that they demand and we strive to deliver. To improve our performance in this area, we must eliminate underlying causes of service and support requests through product improvements, better order fulfillment processes, more robust self help tools, and improved ability to accurately anticipate demand for support. Implementing any of these improvements can be expensive, time consuming and ultimately prove unsuccessful. If we do not deliver the high level of support that our customers expect for any of the reasons stated above we will lose customers and our financial results will suffer. If we encounter problems with our third party customer service and technical support providers our business will be harmed and our margins will decline. We outsource a substantial portion of our customer service and technical support activities to domestic and international third party service providers, including to service providers in India. During fiscal 2004 we greatly increased the number of third party customer service representatives working on our behalf and we 44 Table of Contents expect to continue to rely heavily on third parties in the future. This strategy provides us with lower operating costs and greater flexibility, but also presents risks to our business, including the following: International outsourcing has received considerable negative attention in the media and there are indications that the U.S. Congress may pass legislation that would impact how we operate and impact customer perceptions of our service. For example, in Congress legislators have discussed restricting the flow of personal information to overseas providers and requiring representatives in foreign jurisdictions to affirmatively identify themselves by name and location; Customers may react negatively to providing information to and receiving support from overseas organizations; We may not be able to impact the quality of support that we provide as directly as we are able to in our company run call centers; In recent years India has experienced political instability and changing policies that may impact our operations. In addition, for a number of years India and Pakistan have been in conflict and an active state of war between the two countries could disrupt our services; and We rely on a global communications infrastructure that may be interrupted in a number of ways. For example, in fiscal 2004 we had to reroute calls to India due to an underwater cable being cut in the Mediterranean Sea. We depend upon a small number of larger retailers to generate a significant portion of our sales volume for our desktop software products. We sell most of our desktop software products through our retail distribution channel and a relatively small number of larger retailers generate a significant portion of our sales volume. Our principal retailers have significant bargaining leverage due to their size and available resources. Any change in principal business terms, termination or major disruption of our relationship with these resellers could result in a potentially significant decline in our revenues and earnings. For example, the sourcing decisions, product display locations and promotional activities that retailers undertake can greatly impact the sales of our products. Due to its seasonal nature, sales of TurboTax are particularly impacted by such decisions and if our principal distribution sources were to elect to carry or promote competitive products our revenues would decline. The fact that we also sell our products directly could cause retailers to reduce their efforts to promote our products or stop selling our products altogether. If any of our retailers run into financial difficulties we may be unable to collect amounts that we are owed. Selling new products may be more challenging and costlier than selling our historical products, causing our margins to decline. Because our strategy for some of our products involves the routine introduction of new products at retail, if retailers do not offer our new products we will not be able to grow as planned. An outcome of our Right for Me marketing approach is the introduction of additional versions of our products. Retailers may be reluctant to stock unproven products, or products that sell at higher prices, but more slowly. Retailers may also choose to place less emphasis on software as a category within their stores. In addition, it may be costlier for us to market and sell some of our higher priced products due to our need to convey the more customer specific value of the products to customers rather than communicating more generalized benefits. This may require us to develop other marketing programs that supplement our traditional in store promotional efforts to sell these products to customers causing our margins to shrink. If retail distribution proves an ineffective channel for certain of our new offerings it could adversely impact our growth, revenue and profitability. If our manufacturing and distribution suppliers execute poorly our business will be harmed. We have chosen to outsource the manufacturing and distribution of many of our desktop software products to a small number of third party providers and we use a single vendor to produce and distribute our check and business forms supplies products. Although our reliance on a small number of suppliers, or a single supplier, provides us with efficiencies and enhanced bargaining power, poor performance by or lack of effective communication with these parties can significantly harm our business. This risk is amplified by 45 Table of Contents the fact that we carry very little inventory and rely on just in time manufacturing processes. We mitigate this risk by managing our second tier vendors and maintaining contingency plans. We have experienced problems with our suppliers in the past. For example, during fiscal 2004 one of our suppliers was unable to fulfill orders for some of our software products for a number of days due to operational difficulties and communication errors. Although together we were able to mitigate the impact of that delay with minimal disruption to our business, if we experience longer delays, delays during a peak demand period or significant quality issues our business could be significantly harmed. Failure to maintain the availability and security of the systems, networks, databases and software required to operate and deliver our Internet based products and services could adversely affect our operating results. Our Internet based product and service offerings, including QuickBooks Online Edition, QuickBooks Assisted Payroll Service, Complete web based Payroll, Turbo Tax for the Web, consumer and professional electronic tax filing services, Quicken.com and QuickBase, rely on a variety of systems, networks and databases, many of which are maintained by us at our data centers. In order to prevent interruptions to the availability of our Internet based products and services, we generally follow industry standard practices for creating a fault tolerant environment. However, we do not have complete redundancy for all of our systems. We maintain back up processing capabilities that are designed to protect us against site related disasters for many of our mission critical applications. Notwithstanding our efforts to protect against down time for our Internet based products and services, we do occasionally experience unplanned outages or technical difficulties. In order to provide our Internet based products and services, we must protect the security of our systems, networks, databases and software. Like all companies that deliver products and services via the Internet, we are subject to attack by computer hackers who develop and deploy software that is designed to penetrate the security of our systems and networks. A hacker who is able to penetrate our security systems could misappropriate or damage our proprietary information or cause disruptions in the delivery of our products and services. We believe that we have taken steps to protect against such attacks. However, there can be no assurance that our security measures will not be penetrated by experienced hackers. In the event that the systems, networks, databases and software required to deliver our Internet based products and services become unavailable or suffer technical difficulties or a breach in security, we may be required to expend significant resources to alleviate these problems, and our operating results could suffer. In addition, any such interruption or breach of security could damage our reputation and lead to the loss of customers. Failure of our information technology systems or those of our service providers could adversely affect our future operating results. We rely on a variety of internal technology systems and technology systems maintained by our outside manufacturing and distribution suppliers to take and fulfill customer orders, handle customer service requests, host our web based activities, support internal operations, and store customer and company data. These systems could be damaged or interrupted, preventing us or our service providers from accepting and fulfilling customer orders or otherwise interrupting our business. In addition, these systems could suffer security breaches, causing company and customer data to be unintentionally disclosed. Any of these occurrences could adversely impact our operations. We have experienced system challenges in the past. For example, during fiscal 2004 some of our non critical systems were interrupted due to computer viruses that caused loss of productivity and added expense. We also experience computer server failures from time to time. To prevent interruptions we must continually upgrade our systems and processes to ensure that we have adequate recoverability both of which are costly and time consuming. While we and our outside service partners have backup systems for certain aspects of our operations, not all systems upon which we rely are fully redundant and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Possession and use of personal customer information by our businesses presents risks and expenses that could harm our business. A number of our businesses possess personal customer information, including credit card numbers. We use commercially available encryption technology to transmit customer information when orders are placed over the Internet. However, there can be no assurance that a third party will not be able to circumvent 46 Table of Contents these security measures. Possession and use of personal customer information in conducting our business subjects us to regulatory burdens and potential lawsuits. We have incurred and will continue to incur significant expenses to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols and there is a trend toward greater regulation of privacy. For example, regulations like the recently created federal Do Not Call List, and actions by Internet service providers to limit communications with their subscribers may impede our ability to communicate with our customers and increase our compliance costs. Because our businesses rely heavily on direct marketing, any limitations on our ability to communicate with our customers could harm our financial results. In the past we have experienced lawsuits and negative publicity relating to privacy issues and we could face similar suits in the future. A major breach of customer privacy or security by Intuit, or even another company, could have serious negative consequences for our businesses, including direct damages that we may be required to pay as a result of a breach by us, reduced customer demand for our services, damage to our reputation and additional regulation by federal or state agencies. Although we have sophisticated network security, internal control measures, and physical security procedures to safeguard customer information, there can be no assurance that a data security breach or theft will not occur resulting in harm to our business and results of operations. We are exposed to risks associated with credit card fraud and credit card processing and payment. Many of our customers use credit cards to pay for our services. We have suffered losses, and may continue to suffer losses, as a result of orders placed with fraudulent credit card data. Under current credit card practices, we may be liable for fraudulent credit card transactions if we do not obtain a cardholders signature, a frequent practice in Internet sales. We employ technology solutions to help us detect fraudulent credit card transactions. However, the failure to detect or control credit card fraud could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, competitors may exploit our innovations, which could weaken our competitive position and reduce our revenues. Our success depends upon our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of copyright, trade secret, trademark, patent, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. As part of our confidentiality procedures, we generally enter into non disclosure agreements with our employees, contractors, distributors and corporate partners and into license agreements with respect to our software, documentation and other proprietary information. Effectively creating and protecting our proprietary rights is expensive and may require us to engage in costly and distracting litigation. Despite these precautions, third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization. Because we outsource significant aspects of our product development, manufacturing and distribution we are at risk that confidential portions of our intellectual property could become public by lapses in security by our contractors. We have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to others. These licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. It is also possible that other companies could successfully challenge the validity or scope of our patents and that our patent portfolio, which is relatively small, may not provide us with a meaningful competitive advantage. Ultimately, our attempts to secure legal protection for our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our competitors could independently develop similar technologies, duplicate our products, or design around patents and other intellectual property rights. If our intellectual property protection proves inadequate we could lose our competitive advantage and our financial results will suffer. We expect copying and misuse of our intellectual property to be a persistent problem causing lost revenue and increased expenses. Our intellectual property rights are among our most valuable assets. Policing unauthorized use and copying of our products is difficult, expensive, and time consuming. Current U.S. laws that prohibit copying give us only limited practical protection from software piracy and the laws of many other countries provide very little protection. We may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our technology. For example, we frequently encounter unauthorized copies of our software being sold through online auction sites and other 47 Table of Contents online marketplaces. In addition, efforts to protect our intellectual property may be misunderstood and perceived negatively by our customers. For example, during 2003 we employed technology to prohibit unauthorized sharing of our TurboTax products. These efforts were not effectively communicated causing a negative reaction by some of our customers who misunderstood our actions. Although we continue to evaluate technology solutions to piracy, and we continue to increase our civil and criminal enforcement efforts, we expect piracy to be a persistent problem that results in lost revenues and increased expenses. Although we are unable to quantify the extent of piracy of our software products, software piracy may depress our net revenues. We engage in efforts to educate consumers on the benefits of licensing genuine products and to educate lawmakers on the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected, and we cooperate with the Software & Information Industry Association in their efforts to combat piracy. However, these efforts may not affect the piracy of our products. We do not own all of the software, other technologies and content used in our products and services. Many of our products are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties. We believe we have all of the necessary licenses from third parties to use and distribute third party technology and content that we do not own that is used in our current products and services. From time to time we may be required to renegotiate with these third parties or negotiate with new third parties to include their technology or content in our existing products, in new versions of our existing products or in wholly new products. We may not be able to negotiate or renegotiate licenses on reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain the rights necessary to use or continue to use third party technology or content in our products and services, we may not be able to sell the affected products, which would in turn have a negative impact on our revenue and operating results. Third parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products. From time to time, we have received claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others. As the number of products in the software industry increases and the functionality of these products further overlap, and as we acquire technology through acquisitions or licenses, we believe that we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims, including patent, copyright, and trademark infringement claims. We expect that software products in general will increasingly be subject to these claims as the number of products and competitors increase, the functionality of products overlap and as the patenting of software functionality continues to grow. We have, from time to time, received allegations of patent infringement claims in the past and may receive more claims in the future based on allegations that our products infringe upon patents held by third parties. The receipt of a notice alleging infringement may require us to obtain a costly opinion of counsel to prevent an allegation of intentional infringement. Future claims could present an exposure of uncertain magnitude. We believe that we would be able to obtain any necessary licenses or other rights to disputed intellectual property rights on commercially reasonable terms. However, the ultimate outcome of any allegation is uncertain and, regardless of outcome, any such claim, with or without merit, could be time consuming to defend, result in costly litigation, divert managements time and attention from our business, require us to stop selling, to delay shipping or to redesign our products, or require us to pay monetary damages for royalty or licensing arrangements, or to satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers. Our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights, or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims could adversely affect our business. In addition, we license and use software from third parties in our business. These third party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms. Also, these third parties may from time to time receive claims that they have infringed the intellectual property rights of others, including patent and copyright infringement claims, which may affect our ability to continue licensing their software. Our inability to use any of this third party software could result in shipment delays or other disruptions in our business, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results. 48 Table of Contents Our acquisition activity could disrupt our ongoing business and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions. We have acquired and may continue to acquire companies, products and technologies that complement our strategic direction. These acquisitions may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including: inability to successfully integrate the acquired technology and operations into our business and maintain uniform standards, controls, policies, and procedures; distraction of managements attention away from normal business operations; challenges retaining the key employees of the acquired operation; insufficient revenue generation to offset liabilities assumed; expenses associated with the acquisition; and unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence process, including product quality issues and legal contingencies. Acquisitions are inherently risky. We can not be certain that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect the conduct, operating results or financial condition of our business. We have generally paid cash for our recent acquisitions. If we issue common stock or other equity related purchase rights as consideration in an acquisition, current shareholders percentage ownership and earnings per share may become diluted. If we fail to operate our outsourced payroll business effectively our revenue and profitability will be harmed. Our payroll business handles a significant amount of dollar and transaction volume. Due to the size and volume of transactions that we handle effective processing systems and controls are essential to ensure that transactions are handled appropriately. Despite our efforts, it is possible that we may make errors or that funds may be misappropriated. In addition to any direct damages and fines that any such problems would create, which could be substantial, the loss of customer confidence in our accuracy and controls would seriously harm our business. Our payroll business has grown largely through acquisitions and our systems are comprised of multiple technology platforms that are difficult to scale. We must constantly continue to upgrade our systems and processes to ensure that we process customer data in an accurate, reliable and timely manner. These upgrades must also meet the various regulatory requirements and deadlines associated with employer related payroll activities. Any failure of our systems or processes in critical switch over times, such as in January when many businesses elect to change payroll service providers, would be detrimental to our business. If we failed to timely deliver any of our payroll products, it could cause our current and prospective customers to choose a competitors product for that years payroll and not to purchase Intuit products in the future. To generate sustained growth in our payroll business we must successfully develop and manage a more proactive inside and field sales operation. If these efforts are not successful our revenue growth and profitability will decline. Interest income attributable to payroll customer deposits may fluctuate or be eliminated, causing our revenue and profitability to decline. We currently record revenue from interest earned on customer deposits that we hold pending payment of funds to taxing authorities or to customers employees. If interest rates decline, or there are regulatory changes that diminish the amount of time that we are required or permitted to hold such funds, our interest revenue will decline. We face a number of risks in our merchant card processing business that could result in a reduction in our revenues and profits. Our merchant card processing service business is subject to the following risks: if merchants for whom we process credit card transactions are unable to pay refunds due to their customers in connection with disputed or fraudulent merchant transactions we may be required to pay those amounts and our payments may exceed the amount of the customer reserves we have established to make such payments; 49 Table of Contents we will not be able to conduct our business if the bank sponsors and card payment processors and other service providers that we rely on to process bank card transactions terminate their relationships with us and we are not able to secure or successfully migrate our business elsewhere; we could be required to stop providing payment processing services for Visa and MasterCard if we or our bank sponsors fail to adhere to the standards of the Visa and MasterCard credit card associations; we depend on independent sales organizations, some of which do not serve us exclusively, to acquire and retain merchant accounts; our profit margins will be reduced if for competitive reasons we cannot increase our fees at times when Visa and MasterCard increase the fees that we pay to process merchant transactions through their systems; unauthorized disclosure of merchant and cardholder data, whether through breach of our computer systems or otherwise, could expose us to protracted and costly litigation; and we may encounter difficulties scaling our business systems to support our growth. Should any of these risks be realized our business could be harmed and our financial results will suffer. Increased state tax filing mandates, such as the required use of specific technologies, could significantly increase our costs. We are required to comply with a variety of state revenue agency standards in order to successfully operate our tax preparation and electronic filing services. Changes in state imposed requirements by one or more of the states, including the required use of specific technologies or technology standards, could significantly increase the costs of providing those services to our customers and could prevent us from delivering a quality product to our customers in a timely manner. We may be unable to attract and retain key personnel. Much of our future success depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel, including members of our executive team, and those in technical, marketing and staff positions. Experienced personnel in the software and services industries are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley and San Diego, California, where the majority of our employees are located. Although we strive to be an employer of choice, we may not be able to continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel which would cause our business to suffer. Our insurance policies are costly, may be inadequate and potentially expose us to unrecoverable risks. Insurance availability, coverage terms and pricing continue to vary with market conditions. We endeavor to obtain appropriate insurance coverage for insurable risks that we identify, however, we may fail to correctly anticipate or quantify insurable risks, we may not be able to obtain appropriate insurance coverage, and insurers may not respond as we intend to cover insurable events that may occur. We have observed rapidly changing conditions in the insurance markets relating to nearly all areas of traditional corporate insurance. Such conditions have resulted in higher premium costs, higher policy deductibles, and lower coverage limits. For some risks, because of cost or availability, we do not have insurance coverage. For these reasons, we are retaining a greater portion of insurable risks than we have in the past at relatively greater cost. Required expensing of stock options will significantly reduce our net income and earnings per share. Although we were not previously required to record any compensation expense in connection with option grants to employees that have an exercise price at or above fair market value, a change in generally accepted accounting principles requires us to treat all employee stock options as compensation expense beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. The increased compensation expense will significantly reduce our net income and earnings per share under generally accepted accounting principles. See Recent Accounting Pronouncements earlier in this Item 7. 50 Table of Contents We are frequently a party to litigation that is costly to defend and consumes the time of our management. Due to our financial position and the large number of customers that we serve we are often forced to defend litigation. For example, we are currently being sued in an action for claims related to Quicken Brokerage powered by Siebert, a strategic alliance between the two companies. Although we believe that this case has no merit and we are defending the matter vigorously, defending such matters consumes the time of our management and is expensive for Intuit. Even though we often seek insurance coverage for litigation defense costs, there is no assurance that our defense costs, which can be substantial, will be covered in all cases. In addition, by its nature, litigation is unpredictable and we may not prevail even in cases where we strongly believe a plaintiffs case has no valid claims. If we do not prevail in litigation we may be required to pay substantial monetary damages or alter our business operations. Regardless of the outcome, litigation is expensive and consumes the time of our management and may ultimately reduce our income. Unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results. Our future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Our stock price may be volatile. Our stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between our actual and anticipated financial results and as a result of our announcements and those of our competitors. In addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. These factors, as well as general economic and political conditions, may materially adversely affect the market price of our stock in the future. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to detect fraud or report our financial results accurately, which could harm our business and the trading price of our common stock. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to detect and prevent fraud. We periodically assess our system of internal controls, and the internal controls of service providers upon which we rely, to review their effectiveness and identify potential areas of improvement. These assessments may conclude that enhancements, modifications or changes to our system of internal controls are necessary. In addition, from time to time we acquire businesses, many of which have limited infrastructure and systems of internal controls. Performing assessments of internal controls, implementing necessary changes, and maintaining an effective internal controls process is expensive and requires considerable management attention, particularly in the case of newly acquired entities. Internal control systems are designed in part upon assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and all such systems, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. If we fail to implement and maintain an effective system of internal controls or prevent fraud, we could suffer losses, could be subject to costly litigation, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information and our brand and operating results could be harmed, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act, we and our independent registered public accounting firm must certify the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting annually. Identification of material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting by us or our independent registered public accounting firm could adversely affect our competitive position in our business, especially our outsourced payroll business, and the market price for our common stock. 51 Table of Contents Business interruptions could adversely affect our future operating results. Several of our major business operations are subject to interruption by earthquake, fire, power shortages, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, and other events beyond our control. The majority of our research and development activities, our corporate headquarters, our principal information technology systems, and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults. We do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake related losses. While we maintain disaster recovery facilities for most of our data centers that support the information systems, networks and databases that are necessary to operate our business, we are still in the process of establishing disaster recovery facilities for some of our data centers. Our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or man made disaster.

We caution investors that forward looking statements are only predictions based on our current expectations about future events and are not guarantees of future performance. Because these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict, there are important factors that could cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward looking statements. These factors include those discussed in this Item 7 under the caption Risks That Could Affect Future Results. We encourage you to read that section carefully along with the other information provided in this Report and in our other filings with the SEC before deciding to invest in our stock or to maintain or change your investment. These forward looking statements are based on information as of the filing date of this Report, and we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward looking statement for any reason. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Investment Portfolio We do not hold derivative financial instruments in our portfolio of investments and funds held for payroll customers. Our investments and funds held for payroll customers consist of instruments that meet quality standards consistent with our investment policy. This policy specifies that, except for direct obligations of the United States government, securities issued by agencies of the United States government, and money market or cash management funds, we diversify our holdings by limiting our investments and funds held for payroll customers with any individual issuer. The following table presents our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments as of July 31, 2005 by stated maturity. The table is classified by the original maturity date listed on the security and includes cash equivalents and investments that are part of funds held for payroll customers on our balance sheet. Cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds. Approximately 90% of our available for sale debt securities have an interest reset date, put date or mandatory call date within one year. As of July 31, 2005 the weighted average interest rate earned on our money market accounts was 3.19% and the weighted average interest rate earned on our investments was 3.05%. Years Ending July 31, 2011 and 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Cash equivalents $ 252,995 $ $ $ $ $ $ 252,995 Investments 193,782 58,032 3,205 14,830 734,545 1,004,394 $ 446,777 $ 58,032 $ $ 3,205 $ 14,830 $ 734,545 $ 1,257,389 Interest Rate Risk Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of investments and funds held for payroll customers are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents, investments and funds held for payroll customers and the value of those investments. Should interest rates increase by 10% or about 30 basis points from the levels of July 31, 2005, the value of our investments and funds held for payroll customers would decline by approximately $0.8 million. Should interest rates increase by 100 basis points from the levels of July 31, 2005, the value of our investments and funds held for payroll customers would decline by approximately $2.6 million. Impact of Foreign Currency Rate Changes Since we translate foreign currencies (primarily Canadian dollars and British pounds) into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes, currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results. The historical impact of currency fluctuations has generally been immaterial. We believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not significant primarily because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies. Due primarily to the effect of the weakening U.S. dollar on intercompany balances with our Canadian subsidiary, we recorded foreign currency exchange gains of $5.1 million in fiscal 2003 and $2.7 million in fiscal 2004. In the third quarter of fiscal 2004, we converted a significant portion of our Canadian intercompany balances to long term investments in that subsidiary, which reduced our statement of operations exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. We recorded a nominal foreign currency exchange loss in fiscal 2005. Although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial in the past and we believe that for the reasons cited above currency fluctuations will not be significant in the future, there can be no guarantee that the impact of currency fluctuations will not be material in the future. As of July 31, 2005 we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities. 53 Table of Contents
