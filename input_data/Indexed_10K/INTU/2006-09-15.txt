ITEM 7 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MDA) includes the following sections: Executive Overview that discusses at a high level our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business. Critical Accounting Policies that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments underlying our financial statements. Results of Operations that begins with an overview followed by a more detailed discussion of our revenue and expenses. Liquidity and Capital Resources which discusses key aspects of our statements of cash flows, changes in our balance sheets and our financial commitments. You should note that this MDA discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Please see the section entitled Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors at the beginning of Item 1A for important information to consider when evaluating such statements. You should read this MDA in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes in Item 8. As discussed below, we sold our Intuit Information Technology Solutions business in fiscal 2006 and our Intuit Public Sector Solutions business in fiscal 2005. We accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations and have accordingly reclassified our financial statements for all periods prior to the sales to reflect them as discontinued operations. Unless otherwise noted, the following discussion pertains only to our continuing operations. Our Board of Directors authorized a two for one stock split which was effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend on July 6, 2006 to stockholders of record on June 21, 2006. All share and per share figures in this Item 7 and in the statements of operations and notes to the financial statements in Item 8 retroactively reflect this stock split. Executive Overview This overview provides a high level discussion of our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business. We believe that an understanding of these trends is important in order to understand our financial results for fiscal 2006 as well as our future prospects. This summary is not intended to be exhaustive, nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. About Intuit Intuit is a leading provider of business and financial management solutions for small businesses, consumers and accountants. We organize our business into the following five segments: Our QuickBooks segment includes QuickBooks accounting and business management software and technical support as well as financial supplies for small businesses. Payroll and Payments includes payroll products and services and merchant services for small businesses. 31 Table of Contents Consumer Tax includes our TurboTax consumer and small business tax return preparation products and services. Professional Tax includes our Lacerte and ProSeries professional tax products and services. Other Businesses includes our Quicken personal finance products and services, Intuit Real Estate Solutions, Intuit Distribution Management Solutions, and our business in Canada. Overview of Financial Results Total net revenue for fiscal 2006 was $2.3 billion, up 15% compared with fiscal 2005. Three quarters of the fiscal 2006 revenue increase was due to growth in our Consumer Tax and Payroll and Payments segments. Consumer Tax revenue was 25% higher in fiscal 2006, driven by a 57% increase in federal TurboTax Online units sold and to a lesser extent by growth in revenue from attach services such as electronic filing. We believe that the continuing trend among individual taxpayers toward the use of both online and desktop software, rather than manual methods, to prepare their own income tax returns will continue to be important to the growth of our Consumer Tax business. Payroll and Payments revenue was 24% higher in fiscal 2006, with combined payroll offerings accounting for slightly more than half of the increase and merchant services representing slightly less than half of the increase. See Total Net Revenue below for additional information. We recorded operating income from continuing operations of $559.5 million for fiscal 2006 compared with $524.1 million for fiscal 2005. Operating income from continuing operations for fiscal 2006 was reduced by $66.0 million in pre tax share based compensation expense for stock options and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan that we recorded as a result of our adoption of SFAS 123(R) on August 1, 2005. The revenue growth that we experienced in fiscal 2006 was partially offset by these share based compensation expenses and by higher spending for new product development, marketing and customer support. Our net income from continuing operations of $377.4 million for fiscal 2006 was flat compared with $375.0 million for fiscal 2005. Our net income from continuing operations for fiscal 2005 would have been approximately $80 million lower if it had included pro forma share based compensation expense and excluded certain discrete tax benefits. Diluted net income per share from continuing operations of $1.05 for fiscal 2006 increased 6% compared with $0.99 for fiscal 2005 due to the net reduction in average shares outstanding. Average shares outstanding declined as a result of repurchases of common stock under our stock repurchase programs, partially offset by the issuance of shares in connection with the exercise of stock options and purchases under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. In December 2005 we sold our Intuit Information Technology Solutions (ITS) business for approximately $200 million in cash. The decision to sell ITS was a result of our desire to focus resources on our core products and services. We recorded total net income from ITS discontinued operations of $39.5 million or $0.11 per diluted share for fiscal 2006, including $34.3 million or $0.10 per share for the net gain on disposal of that business. In May 2006 we sold our Master Builder construction management software and solutions business, which was part of Intuit Construction Business Solutions in our Other Businesses segment. The Master Builder business had quarterly revenue of approximately $5 million. We recorded a $7.7 million net loss on disposal of the business, including income tax expense of $10.1 million. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long lived Assets, we have not accounted for this transaction as a discontinued operation. We ended fiscal 2006 with cash and investments totaling $1.2 billion. In fiscal 2006 we generated cash from continuing operations, from the sale of our ITS business and from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans. In this period we used $784.2 million in cash for repurchases of common stock under our stock repurchase programs. At July 31, 2006, authorized funds of $506.6 million remained available for stock repurchases. Seasonality Our QuickBooks, Consumer Tax and Professional Tax businesses are highly seasonal. Some of our other offerings are also seasonal, but to a lesser extent. Revenue from many of our small business software products, including QuickBooks, tends to be concentrated around calendar year end. Sales of income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from November through April. As a result, our total net revenue is 32 Table of Contents usually highest during our second quarter ending January 31 and third quarter ending April 30. We typically report losses in our first quarter ending October 31 and fourth quarter ending July 31, when revenue from our tax businesses is minimal while operating expenses continue at relatively consistent levels. Critical Accounting Policies In preparing our financial statements, we make estimates, assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue, operating income or loss and net income or loss, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Senior management has reviewed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and their disclosure in this Annual Report on Form 10 K with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Net Revenue Revenue Recognition We derive revenue from the sale of packaged software products, license fees, software subscriptions, product support, professional services, payroll services, merchant services, transaction fees and multiple element arrangements that may include any combination of these items. We follow the appropriate revenue recognition rules for each type of revenue. For additional information, see Net Revenue in Note 1 to the financial statements. We generally recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable. However, determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report. For example, for multiple element arrangements we must make assumptions and judgments in order to allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver, to determine whether undelivered services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services, to determine whether vendor specific evidence of fair value exists for each undelivered element and to determine whether and when each element has been delivered. If we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments, it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period. Amounts for fees collected or invoiced and due relating to arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized when the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied. In connection with the sale of certain products, we provide a limited amount of free technical support assistance to customers. We do not defer the recognition of any revenue associated with sales of these products since the cost of providing this free technical support is insignificant. The technical support is generally provided within one year after the associated revenue is recognized and free product enhancements are minimal and infrequent. Net Revenue Return and Rebate Reserves As part of our revenue recognition policy, we estimate future product returns and rebate payments and establish reserves against revenue at the time of sale based on these estimates. Our return policy allows distributors and retailers, subject to contractual limitations, to return purchased products. Product returns by distributors and retailers relate primarily to the return of excess and obsolete products. In determining our product returns reserves, we consider the volume and price mix of products in the retail channel, historical return rates for prior releases of the product, trends in retailer inventory and economic trends that might impact customer demand for our products (including the competitive environment and the timing of new releases of our products). We fully reserve for excess and obsolete products in the distribution channels. Our rebate reserves include distributor and retailer sales incentive rebates and end user rebates. Our estimated reserves for distributor and retailer incentive rebates are based on distributors and retailers actual performance against the terms and conditions of rebate programs, which we typically establish annually. Our reserves for end user rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the specific promotional rebate program, actual sales during the promotion and historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program. In the past, actual returns and rebates have not differed significantly from the reserves that we have established. However, actual returns and rebates in any future period are inherently uncertain. If we were to change our assumptions and estimates, our revenue reserves would change, which would impact the net revenue we report. If 33 Table of Contents actual returns and rebates are significantly greater than the reserves we have established, the actual results would decrease our future reported revenue. Conversely, if actual returns and rebates are significantly less than our reserves, this would increase our future reported revenue. For example, if we had increased our fiscal 2006 returns reserves by 1% of non consignment sales to retailers for QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken, our fiscal 2006 total net revenue would have been $3.5 million lower. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We make ongoing assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable. The accounts receivable amount on our balance sheet includes a reserve for accounts that might not be paid. In determining the amount of the reserve, we consider our historical level of credit losses. We also make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations, and we assess current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future. Our reserves have generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses. However, since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, we cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be adequate. If actual credit losses are significantly greater than the reserve we have established, that would increase our general and administrative expenses and reduce our reported net income. Conversely, if actual credit losses are significantly less than our reserve, this would eventually decrease our general and administrative expenses and increase our reported net income. Goodwill, Purchased Intangible Assets and Other Long Lived Assets Impairment Assessments We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than temporary impairment in the remaining value of the assets recorded on our balance sheet may exist. We test the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise. The timing of the formal annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods. In order to estimate the fair value of long lived assets, we typically make various assumptions about the future prospects for the business that the asset relates to, consider market factors specific to that business and estimate future cash flows to be generated by that business. We evaluate cash flows at the lowest operating level and the number of reporting units that we have identified may make impairment more probable than it would be at a company with fewer reporting units and integrated operations following acquisitions. Based on these assumptions and estimates, we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset stated on our balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results. More conservative assumptions of the anticipated future benefits from these businesses could result in impairment charges, which would decrease net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet. Conversely, less conservative assumptions could result in smaller or no impairment charges, higher net income and higher asset values. In fiscal 2004 we recorded an impairment charge of $18.7 million on goodwill associated with our Intuit Public Sector Solutions business, which was subsequently sold. At July 31, 2006 we had $505.0 million in goodwill and $59.5 million in net purchased intangible assets on our balance sheet. Accounting for Share Based Compensation Plans Prior to August 1, 2005, we accounted for our share based employee compensation plans under the measurement and recognition provisions of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations, as permitted by Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. We recorded no share based employee compensation expense for options granted under our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan or its predecessor plans prior to August 1, 2005 as all options granted under those plans had exercise prices equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. We also recorded no compensation expense in connection with our Employee Stock Purchase Plan as the purchase price of the stock was not less than 85% of the lower of the fair market value of our common stock at the beginning of each offering period or at the end of each purchase period. In accordance with SFAS 123 and SFAS 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation 34 Table of Contents Transition and Disclosure, we disclosed our net income or loss and net income or loss per share as if we had applied the fair value based method in measuring compensation expense for our share based incentive programs. Effective August 1, 2005, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123(R), Share Based Payment, using the modified prospective transition method. Under that transition method, compensation expense that we recognize beginning on that date includes: (a) period compensation expense for all share based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of, August 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, and (b) period compensation expense for all share based payments granted on or after August 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123(R). Because we elected to use the modified prospective transition method, results for prior periods have not been restated. At July 31, 2006, there was $103.6 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested share based compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans which we will amortize to expense in the future. Total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures. We expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average vesting period of 2.2 years. We estimate the fair value of options granted using the Black Scholes option valuation model and the assumptions shown in Note 12 to the financial statements. Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we estimated the expected term of options granted based on implied exercise patterns using a binomial model. Prior to that, we estimated the expected term of options granted based on historical exercise patterns. We estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the implied volatility of publicly traded one year and two year options on our common stock, consistent with SFAS 123(R) and Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107. Our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. We base the risk free interest rate that we use in the Black Scholes option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues with equivalent remaining terms. We have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we use an expected dividend yield of zero in the Black Scholes option valuation model. SFAS 123(R) requires us to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. For options granted before August 1, 2005, we amortize the fair value on an accelerated basis. This is the same basis on which we amortized options granted before August 1, 2005 for our pro forma disclosures under SFAS 123. For options granted on or after August 1, 2005, we amortize the fair value on a straight line basis. All options are amortized over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods. We may elect to use different assumptions under the Black Scholes option valuation model in the future, which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share. In May 2006 we began a voluntary review of our historical stock option granting activities and related accounting treatment. Our Board of Directors formed a special committee of independent directors to conduct this review with the assistance of independent legal counsel and independent forensic accounting support. The primary scope of this review covered the period from August 1, 1997 to the present. On August 16, 2006 we announced the completion of our independent review, which uncovered no evidence of fraud or intentional wrongdoing in our historical stock option granting practices. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings, and Note 15 to the financial statements. Legal Contingencies We are subject to certain legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business. We review the status of each significant matter quarterly and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability and an expense for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our accruals are based on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Potential legal liabilities and the revision of estimates of potential legal liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. 35 Table of Contents Income Taxes Estimates of Effective Tax Rates, Deferred Taxes and Valuation Allowance When we prepare our financial statements, we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We record an additional amount in our provision for income taxes in the period in which we determine that our recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate tax assessment to be. If in a later period we determine that payment of this additional amount is unnecessary, we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit in that later period. As a result, our ongoing assessments of the probable outcomes of the audit issues and related tax positions require judgment and can materially increase or decrease our effective tax rate and materially affect our operating results. This also requires us to estimate our current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which we show on our balance sheet. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized. To the extent we believe that realization is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. When we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period, we record a corresponding tax expense in our statement of operations. Our net deferred tax asset at July 31, 2006 was $191.9 million, net of the valuation allowance of $4.4 million. We recorded the valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets (consisting primarily of certain state capital loss and net operating loss carryforwards) before they expire. The valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable. While we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, we could be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize. An increase in the valuation allowance would have an adverse impact, which could be material, on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we make the increase. Results of Operations Financial Overview Impact of Fiscal 2006 Option / ESPP Expense (Dollars in millions, except Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal 2006 2005 2005 2004 % per share amounts) 2006 2005 2004 % Change % Change Amount Change Total net revenue $ 2,342.3 $ 2,037.7 $ 1,802.2 15 % 13 % Operating income from continuing operations 559.5 524.1 419.5 7 % 25 % $(66.0 ) 13 % Net income from continuing operations 377.4 375.0 323.3 1 % 16 % (42.2 ) 11 % Diluted net income per share from continuing operations $1.05 $0.99 $0.81 6 % 22 % $(0.12 ) 12 % Net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations $595.5 $589.9 $552.5 1 % 7 % 36 Table of Contents Total net revenue increased 15% in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005, driven by strong growth in our Consumer Tax and Payroll and Payments segments. Consumer Tax revenue was 25% higher in fiscal 2006, driven by a 57% increase in federal TurboTax Online units sold and to a lesser extent by growth in revenue from attach services such as electronic filing. Payroll and Payments revenue increased 24% in fiscal 2006. See Total Net Revenue below for additional information. Effective August 1, 2005, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123(R), Share Based Payment, using the modified prospective transition method. Under that transition method, compensation expense that we recognized for the twelve months ended July 31, 2006 included: (a) period compensation expense for all share based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of, August 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, and (b) period compensation expense for all share based payments granted on or after August 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123(R). In fiscal 2006 we recorded pre tax share based compensation expense for stock options and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan totaling $66.0 million or $0.12 per diluted share as a result of our adoption of SFAS 123(R). Because we elected to use the modified prospective transition method, results for prior periods have not been restated. At July 31, 2006, there was $103.6 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested share based compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans which we will amortize to expense in the future. Total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures. We expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average vesting period of 2.2 years. Excluding the share based compensation expense for stock options and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan that we recorded in accordance with SFAS 123(R), higher revenue in fiscal 2006 was partially offset by higher expenses of approximately $75 million for new product development and approximately $60 million for additional advertising and other marketing programs and improved customer support service levels. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 was approximately 38%, compared with approximately 33% for fiscal 2005. In fiscal 2005 our effective tax rate benefited from the reversal of approximately $25.7 million in reserves related to potential income tax exposures that were resolved. If we had excluded these and other discrete tax benefits from our fiscal 2005 effective tax rate, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2005 would have been approximately five percentage points higher and our net income from continuing operations for that period would have been approximately $30 million lower. Our diluted net income per share from continuing operations increased more rapidly than our net income from continuing operations in fiscal 2006 due to the net reduction of average shares outstanding. Average shares outstanding declined as a result of repurchases of 31.0 million shares under our stock repurchase programs, partially offset by the issuance of 16.6 million shares in connection with the exercise of stock options and purchases under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. In December 2005 we sold our Intuit Information Technology Solutions (ITS) business for approximately $200 million in cash. The buyer deposited approximately $20 million of the total purchase price in a third party escrow account to be held through December 2006 to cover breaches of representations and warranties set forth in the purchase agreement, should they arise. The full escrow amount is included in other current assets on our balance sheet at July 31, 2006. We recorded total net income from ITS discontinued operations of $39.5 million or $0.11 per diluted share in fiscal 2006, including $34.3 million or $0.10 per diluted share for the net gain on disposal of that business. In May 2006 we sold our Master Builder construction management software and solutions business, which was part of Intuit Construction Business Solutions in our Other Businesses segment. The Master Builder business had quarterly revenue of approximately $5 million. We recorded a $7.7 million net loss on disposal of the business, including income tax expense of $10.1 million. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long lived Assets, we have not accounted for this transaction as a discontinued operation. At July 31, 2006, our cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $1.2 billion, an increase of $202.9 million from July 31, 2005. In fiscal 2006 we generated $595.5 million in cash from continuing operations, approximately $200 million in cash from the sale of our ITS business and $279.3 million in cash from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans. During the same period, we repurchased 31.0 million shares of our common stock under our repurchase programs at an average price of $25.28 for a total price of $784.2 million. At July 31, 2006, authorized funds of $506.6 million remained available for stock repurchases. 37 Table of Contents Total Net Revenue The table below and the discussion of total net revenue that follows it are organized in accordance with our five reportable business segments. See Note 8 to the financial statements for descriptions of product, service and other revenue for each segment. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 we revised our reportable segments to reflect the way we currently manage and view our business. We transferred our QuickBooks Payroll and merchant services businesses from our fiscal 2005 QuickBooks Related segment to a new segment called Payroll and Payments and renamed our QuickBooks Related segment QuickBooks. We also transferred our outsourced payroll business from our fiscal 2005 Intuit Branded Small Business segment to the new Payroll and Payments segment. Finally, we transferred the remaining businesses in our fiscal 2005 Intuit Branded Small Business segment to our Other Businesses segment. We made no changes to our Consumer Tax and Professional Tax segments. We have reclassified previously reported fiscal 2005 and 2004 segment results to be consistent with the fiscal 2006 presentation. % Total % Total % Total Fiscal Net Fiscal Net Fiscal Net 2006 2005 2005 2004 (Dollars in millions) 2006 Revenue 2005 Revenue 2004 Revenue % Change % Change QuickBooks Product $461.6 $436.4 $395.3 Service 61.8 60.4 72.7 Other 11.2 6.2 5.3 Subtotal 534.6 23 % 503.0 25 % 473.3 26 % 6 % 6 % Payroll and Payments Product 194.1 157.2 139.8 Service 267.5 211.6 133.4 Other 0.4 3.0 18.1 Subtotal 462.0 20 % 371.8 18 % 291.3 16 % 24 % 28 % Consumer Tax Product 270.4 242.2 231.7 Service 439.8 328.2 257.9 Other 0.3 0.3 0.4 Subtotal 710.5 30 % 570.7 28 % 490.0 27 % 25 % 16 % Professional Tax Product 245.0 233.5 226.1 Service 27.9 31.5 25.8 Other Subtotal 272.9 12 % 265.0 13 % 251.9 14 % 3 % 5 % Other Businesses Product 180.5 173.4 186.2 Service 113.5 92.3 65.7 Other 68.3 61.5 43.8 Subtotal 362.3 15 % 327.2 16 % 295.7 17 % 11 % 11 % Total Company Product 1,351.6 1,242.7 1,179.1 Service 910.5 724.0 555.5 Other 80.2 71.0 67.6 Total net revenue $2,342.3 100 % $2,037.7 100 % $1,802.2 100 % 15 % 13 % 38 Table of Contents Total Net Revenue by Business Segment QuickBooks Fiscal 2006 Compared with Fiscal 2005. QuickBooks total net revenue increased $31.6 million or 6% in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005. Total QuickBooks software unit sales were up 14% in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005. This higher unit volume more than offset lower average selling prices for QuickBooks software due to price reductions for new users and the elimination of upgrade rebates. We believe that the higher unit volume was a result of product improvements, successful execution of our QuickBooks 2006 product launch and growth in the category that was driven by publicity surrounding a significant new market entrant. Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004. QuickBooks total net revenue increased $29.7 million or 6% in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 on 18% higher unit volume resulting from an increase in new customers and on proportionately more sales of our higher priced products (favorable product mix). Payroll and Payments Fiscal 2006 Compared with Fiscal 2005. Payroll and Payments total net revenue increased $90.2 million or 24% in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005. Our combined payroll offerings accounted for slightly more than half of the fiscal 2006 revenue increase while our merchant services represented slightly less than half of the revenue increase. QuickBooks Payroll revenue was 23% higher in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 because of a combination of favorable product mix, 7% growth in the customer base and the residual effects of a price increase that we implemented in fiscal 2005. Revenue from our other payroll offerings increased 11% in fiscal 2006, driven by 17% growth in the number of QuickBooks Assisted Payroll and Complete Payroll customers processing payrolls, price increases and increased interest income on funds held for payroll customers, partially offset by attrition in the Premier Payroll Service customer base. Merchant services revenue increased 47% in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 due to 32% growth in the customer base and 18% higher transaction volume per customer in fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004. Payroll and Payments total net revenue increased $80.5 million or 28% in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004. Our merchant services accounted for slightly more than half of the fiscal 2005 revenue increase while our combined payroll offerings represented slightly less than half of the revenue increase. The 99% increase in merchant services revenue was due to growth in the customer base, higher transaction volume per customer and our discontinuation of the outsourcing of certain merchant processing services beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. In fiscal 2005 we completed the transition to recognizing the full revenue from processing merchant transactions that were formerly processed through two major banks rather than the smaller profit sharing fees we would have received under our prior arrangement with those banks. We recorded fees for outsourced merchant processing services as Other revenue while we recorded fees for merchant processing services we perform ourselves as Service revenue. QuickBooks Payroll revenue was 20% higher in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 because of growth in the customer base, price increases and the successful launch of our higher priced Enhanced Payroll offering, including its bundling with unspecified Quickbooks software upgrades. Revenue from our other payroll businesses increased 10% in fiscal 2005, driven by growth in the number of QuickBooks Assisted Payroll and Complete Payroll customers processing payrolls, price increases and higher interest income on funds held for payroll customers, partially offset by attrition in the Premier Payroll Service customer base. Consumer Tax Fiscal 2006 Compared with Fiscal 2005. Consumer Tax total net revenue increased $139.8 million or 25% in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005. Paid federal TurboTax unit sales were up 20% in fiscal 2006, driven by a 57% increase in federal TurboTax Online units sold which accounted for the majority of the revenue increase for that period. To a lesser extent, higher fiscal 2006 revenue was due to growth in revenue from attach services such as electronic filing. We believe that the continuing trend among individual taxpayers toward the use of both online and desktop software, rather than manual methods, to prepare their own income tax returns will continue to be important to the growth of our Consumer Tax business. We also believe that fiscal 2006 Consumer Tax revenue growth was positively affected by changes in our offering and pricing strategies that included eliminating rebates and bundling federal and state consumer tax products. These changes were designed to simplify our offerings in response to customer feedback. 39 Table of Contents Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004. Consumer Tax total net revenue increased $80.7 million or 16% in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 due to 20% higher federal TurboTax Online units and to volume and price increases in electronic filing and other attach services. Professional Tax Fiscal 2006 Compared with Fiscal 2005. Professional Tax total net revenue increased $7.9 million or 3% in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 due to overall growth in the Professional Tax customer base that was partially offset by a shift in product mix toward our lower priced offerings. Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004. Professional Tax total net revenue increased $13.1 million or 5% in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 due to an increase in Lacerte product revenue driven by improved customer retention rates and to bank product transmission services volume from our new ProSeries Express product. Other Businesses Fiscal 2006 Compared with Fiscal 2005. Other Businesses total net revenue increased $35.1 million or 11% in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005. Quicken revenue was 3% lower in fiscal 2006. Canadian revenue increased 23% in fiscal 2006 due to strong growth in sales of QuickBooks products and to a lesser extent to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004. Other Businesses total net revenue increased $31.5 million or 11% in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004. Quicken revenue was 3% higher in fiscal 2005 due to growth in our bill payment customer base. Canadian revenue increased 17% in fiscal 2005 due to market share gains for QuickBooks software and higher subscription revenue for payroll services that was driven by improvements in service levels.

Fiscal 2006 Compared with Fiscal 2005. Cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue was the same in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005. Growth in TurboTax units came disproportionately through our web TurboTax offer, which has lower costs per unit than our desktop offerings. This was offset by higher cost of product revenue in our QuickBooks segment, which resulted from 14% QuickBooks unit growth. Cost of service revenue as a percentage of service revenue was the same in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005. Growth in our Consumer Tax electronic filing revenue, Assisted Payroll revenue and merchant services revenue, all of which had lower relative cost increases associated with their related revenue increases, was offset by higher costs in our QuickBooks segment, which resulted from improvements in service levels for technical support plan customers. 40 Table of Contents Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004. Cost of service revenue as a percentage of service revenue decreased in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 due to growth in our Consumer Tax electronic filing revenue and merchant services revenue, both of which had minimal cost increases associated with the related revenue increases, and to customer service efficiencies in our small business payroll business.

Total operating expenses in dollars increased $216.1 million in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005. Share based compensation expense for stock options and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan that we recorded as a result of our adoption of SFAS 123(R) on August 1, 2005 accounted for $63.0 million of that increase. In fiscal 2006 total operating expenses also increased by approximately $75 million for new product development and approximately $60 million for additional advertising and other marketing programs and improved customer support service levels, particularly in our QuickBooks and Consumer Tax segments. Excluding the impact of share based compensation expense, sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue declined due to lower direct selling costs associated with our fiscal 2006 focus on the retail channel. We continue to invest in research and development and expect that our fiscal 2007 research and development expenses as a percentage of total net revenue will be higher than they were in fiscal 2006. Total operating expenses in dollars increased $111.1 million in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 due to spending for infrastructure, implementation of our new information systems, new product development and promotion, and Sarbanes Oxley compliance. Segment Operating Income (Loss) Segment operating income or loss is segment net revenue less segment cost of revenue and operating expenses. Segment expenses do not include certain costs, such as corporate general and administrative expenses and share based compensation expenses, which are not allocated to specific segments. These unallocated costs totaled $466.3 million in fiscal 2006, $383.0 million in fiscal 2005 and $344.7 million in fiscal 2004. Share based compensation expenses for stock options and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan that we began recording in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 accounted for $66.0 million of the increase in unallocated costs for fiscal 2006. See Note 1 and Note 12 to the financial statements. Segment expenses also do not include amortization of purchased intangible assets, acquisition related charges, and impairment of goodwill and purchased intangible assets. In addition, segment expenses do not include interest and other income and realized net gains or losses on marketable equity securities and other investments. See Note 8 to the financial statements for reconciliations of total segment operating income to income from continuing operations for each fiscal year presented. 41 Table of Contents % of % of % of Fiscal Related Fiscal Related Fiscal Related (Dollars in millions) 2006 Revenue 2005 Revenue 2004 Revenue QuickBooks $168.0 31 % $199.9 40 % $189.6 40 % Payroll and Payments 181.9 39 % 133.5 36 % 82.6 28 % Consumer Tax 466.9 66 % 379.8 67 % 320.3 65 % Professional Tax 135.8 50 % 132.7 50 % 138.5 55 % Other Businesses 96.4 27 % 88.0 27 % 66.8 23 % Total segment operating income $1,049.0 45 % $933.9 46 % $797.8 44 % QuickBooks Fiscal 2006 Compared with Fiscal 2005. QuickBooks segment operating income and segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue decreased in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005. Higher fiscal 2006 QuickBooks revenue resulted from higher unit volume that more than offset the impact of lower average selling prices. However, lower average selling prices yielded lower profit per unit. Higher unit volume in fiscal 2006 resulted in higher customer support costs. We also spent more on QuickBooks product development and on improvements to technical support service levels in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004. QuickBooks segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue was the same in fiscal 2005 and 2004. The fiscal 2005 revenue increase of 6% was offset by increased spending for QuickBooks product development, technical support and marketing. Payroll and Payments Fiscal 2006 Compared with Fiscal 2005. Payroll and Payments segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue increased in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005. More of the revenue growth in that segment came from products and services with lower costs of revenue, such as QuickBooks Payroll and merchant services. Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004. Payroll and Payments segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue increased in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004. More of the revenue growth in that segment came from products and services with lower costs of revenue, such as QuickBooks Payroll and merchant services. Outsourced payroll revenue growth combined with customer service efficiencies, the consolidation of regional sales facilities and a reorganization of the sales force that resulted in lower spending in that business also contributed to the improvement in segment operating income in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004. Consumer Tax Fiscal 2006 Compared with Fiscal 2005. Consumer Tax segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue was nearly the same in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005. Higher revenue and lower rebate processing fees were partially offset by higher expenses for television and web advertising and to a lesser extent for product development and customer support in fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004. Consumer Tax segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue was slightly higher in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004. Higher revenue from TurboTax federal units and volume and price increases in electronic filing and refund transfer services was offset by higher expenses for advertising, product development, customer support and retail merchandising. 42 Table of Contents Professional Tax Fiscal 2006 Compared with Fiscal 2005. Professional Tax segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue was the same in fiscal 2006 and 2005. Revenue and operating expenses were similar in the two periods. Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004. Professional Tax segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue decreased in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004. A 5% revenue increase was more than offset by higher spending for overall customer support and for product development and marketing related to our new ProSeries Basic and ProSeries Express products in fiscal 2005. Other Businesses Fiscal 2006 Compared with Fiscal 2005. Other Businesses segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue was the same in fiscal 2006 and 2005. Quicken revenue was slightly lower while expenses to develop and market new offerings increased in fiscal 2006. Higher revenue combined with relatively stable spending produced better operating margins in Canada. Fiscal 2005 Compared with Fiscal 2004. Other Businesses segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue increased in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004. Quicken revenue was higher while Quicken cost of revenue was relatively flat in fiscal 2005 due to savings resulting from the outsourcing of our Quicken.com web site. Higher revenue and relatively stable spending resulted in an increase in segment operating income in Canada.

Total interest and other income for all periods presented included royalties from trademark license and distribution agreements that we entered into when we sold our Quicken Loans mortgage business in July 2002. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate was approximately 38% for fiscal 2006, approximately 33% for fiscal 2005 and approximately 28% for fiscal 2004. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 differed from the federal statutory rate due to state income taxes and the taxable gain on the sale of our Master Builder business, which were partially offset by the benefit we received from tax exempt interest income, federal and state research and experimental credits and the domestic production activities deduction. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2005 differed from the federal statutory rate due to the net effect of the reversal of $25.7 million in reserves related to potential income tax exposures that were resolved, the federal research and experimental credit and to the benefit received from tax exempt interest income offset by state taxes. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2004 differed from the federal statutory rate due to the net effect of the reversal of $35.7 million in reserves related to potential income tax exposures that were resolved, the federal research and experimental credit and to the benefit received from tax exempt interest income offset by state taxes and acquisition related charges. See Note 11 to the financial statements. 43 Table of Contents At July 31, 2006 we had net deferred tax assets of $191.9 million, which included a valuation allowance of $4.4 million for certain state capital loss and net operating loss carryforwards. The allowance reflects managements assessment that we may not receive the benefit of certain loss carryforwards in certain state jurisdictions. While we believe our current valuation allowance is sufficient, it may be necessary to increase this amount if it becomes more likely that we will not realize a greater portion of the net deferred tax assets. We assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. See Note 11 to the financial statements. Dispositions and Discontinued Operations Sale of Master Builder Business In May 2006 we sold our Master Builder construction management software and solutions business, which was part of Intuit Construction Business Solutions in our Other Businesses segment. The Master Builder business had quarterly revenue of approximately $5 million. We recorded a $7.7 million net loss on disposal of the business, including income tax expense of $10.1 million. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long lived Assets, we have not accounted for this transaction as a discontinued operation. See Note 7 to the financial statements. Intuit Information Technology Solutions Discontinued Operations In May 2005 our Board of Directors formally approved a plan to sell our Intuit Information Technology Solutions (ITS) business. In December 2005 we sold ITS for approximately $200 million in cash. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 144, we have segregated the operating results of ITS from continuing operations in our statements of operations for all periods prior to the sale. We recorded a $34.3 million net gain on disposal of ITS which is included in net income from discontinued operations in our fiscal 2006 statement of operations. See Note 7 to the financial statements. Intuit Public Sector Solutions Discontinued Operations In December 2004 we sold our Intuit Public Sector Solutions (IPSS) business for approximately $11 million in cash and accounted for the sale as a discontinued operation. In accordance with SFAS 144, we have segregated the operating results of IPSS from continuing operations in our statements of operations for all periods prior to the sale. In fiscal 2005 we recorded a $4.8 million net loss on disposal of IPSS that included an income tax provision of $4.3 million for the estimated tax payable in connection with the expected tax gain on the transaction. These amounts are included in net income from discontinued operations in our fiscal 2005 statement of operations. The fiscal 2004 net loss from Intuit Public Sector Solutions discontinued operations included a goodwill impairment charge of $18.7 million. See Note 7 to the financial statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources Statements of Cash Flows At July 31, 2006 our cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $1.2 billion, an increase of $202.9 million from July 31, 2005. We generated $595.5 million in cash from continuing operations during fiscal 2006. We also generated cash from the sale of our ITS business for approximately $200 million in cash. We used cash for financing activities during fiscal 2006, primarily for the repurchase of $784.2 million in common stock under our stock repurchase programs. See Item 5, Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers, Stock Repurchase Programs below and Note 12 to the financial statements. This was partially offset by proceeds of $279.3 million that we received from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options and purchases under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. 44 Table of Contents The following table summarizes selected items from our statements of cash flows for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004. See the financial statements in Item 8 for complete statements of cash flows for those periods.

We used cash for investing activities during fiscal 2006 and 2004, including acquisitions of businesses, net purchases of available for sale debt securities, purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of internal use software. Purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of internal use software offset net sales of available for sale securities in fiscal 2005. We used cash for financing activities in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, primarily for the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase programs. See Stock Repurchase Programs below and Note 12 to the financial statements. This was partially offset by proceeds that we received from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans in each of these fiscal years. Stock Split Our Board of Directors authorized a two for one stock split which was effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend on July 6, 2006 to stockholders of record on June 21, 2006. All share and per share figures in this Item 7 and in the statements of operations and notes to the financial statements in Item 8 retroactively reflect this stock split. Stock Repurchase Programs Our Board of Directors has authorized a series of common stock repurchase programs. Shares of common stock repurchased under these programs become treasury shares. During fiscal 2006 we repurchased 31.0 million shares of our common stock for $784.2 million under our repurchase programs. At July 31, 2006, authorized funds of $506.6 million remained available for stock repurchases. 45 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the historical activity under our stock repurchase programs as of July 31, 2006. These figures retroactively reflect our July 2006 stock split. See Note 1 and Note 12 to the financial statements.

Loans to executive officers and other employees at July 31, 2006 excluded a $5.0 million secured loan to one executive officer who ceased to be an Intuit employee in the third quarter of fiscal 2005. We transferred this loan to other long term assets on our balance sheet in that quarter. Loans to executive officers and other employees at July 31, 2006 were relocation loans secured by real property with original terms of 10 years. Of the total loans at July 31, 2006, $4.4 million accrue no interest for the term of the note. The remaining loans at that date accrue interest at rates equal to applicable federal rates in effect at the time the loans were made. At July 31, 2006 no loans were in default and all interest payments were current in accordance with the terms of the loan agreements. All of the loans were approved by the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of our Board of Directors, which consists solely of independent directors. Consistent with the requirements of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, no loans to executive officers have been made or modified since July 30, 2002 and we do not intend to make or modify loans to executive officers in the future. See Note 16 to the financial statements. Repurchases of Vested Restricted Stock In the third quarters of fiscal 2005 and 2004, we entered into share repurchase agreements with Stephen M. Bennett, our chief executive officer, pursuant to which we repurchased shares of our common stock from Mr. Bennett at the closing price quoted on The Nasdaq Stock Market on the dates of repurchase. We repurchased 31,890 shares of our common stock at $20.91 per share from Mr. Bennett in fiscal 2005 and 34,314 shares at $22.32 per share in fiscal 2004. All of the proceeds from these repurchases were remitted to federal and state taxing authorities to satisfy Mr. Bennetts federal, state and Medicare tax withholding obligations resulting from the vesting of 75,000 shares of our common stock in each of those two quarters under his January 2000 new hire restricted stock awards. These repurchases were approved by the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of our Board of Directors, which consists solely of independent directors. See Note 16 to the financial statements. Other We evaluate, on an ongoing basis, the merits of acquiring technology or businesses, or establishing strategic relationships with and investing in other companies. We may decide to use cash and cash equivalents to fund such activities in the future. We believe that our cash, cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. 46 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At July 31, 2006, we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S K. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our known contractual obligations to make future payments at July 31, 2006: Payments Due by Period Less than 1 3 3 5 More than (In millions) 1 year years years 5 years Total Amounts due under executive deferred compensation plan $27.8 $ $ $ $27.8 Capital lease obligations 0.8 0.2 1.0 Other obligations 1.4 0.9 0.4 2.7 Purchase obligations (1) 22.9 10.2 33.1 Operating leases (2) 33.4 73.6 59.7 131.0 297.7 Total contractual obligations $86.3 $84.9 $60.1 $131.0 $362.3 (1) Represents agreements to purchase products and services that are enforceable, legally binding and specify terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the payments. (2) Includes our lease on San Diego office space that is currently under construction by the landlord. See Item 2, Properties. Innovative Merchant Solutions Loan and Buyout Commitments In April 2005 our wholly owned subsidiary, Innovative Merchant Solutions (IMS), became a member of Superior Bankcard Services, LLC (SBS), a newly formed entity that acquires merchant accounts for IMS. Our consolidated financial statements include the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of SBS, after elimination of all significant intercompany balances and transactions. See Note 1 to the financial statements. In connection with the formation of this entity IMS agreed to provide to SBS revolving loans in an amount of up to $24.5 million under the terms of a credit agreement. In June 2006 IMS entered into an amendment to the credit agreement to increase the amount of funds IMS may loan under that agreement to $40.0 million. The credit agreement expires in July 2013, although certain events, such as a sale of SBS, can trigger earlier termination. Amounts outstanding under the agreement at July 31, 2006 and July 31, 2005 totaled $11.9 million and $3.3 million at interest rates ranging from 6.75% to 9.25%. There are no scheduled repayments on the outstanding loan balance. All unpaid principal amounts and the related accrued interest are due and payable in full at the loan expiration date. The operating agreement of SBS requires that, no later than July 2009, either IMS agree to purchase the minority members interests in SBS at a price to be set by negotiation or arbitration, or IMS and the minority members pursue a sale of their interests in SBS to a third party. Recent Accounting Pronouncements SFAS 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections In June 2005 the FASB issued SFAS 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, which replaces APB 20, Accounting Changes, and SFAS 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements. SFAS 154 applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle, and changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial 47 Table of Contents statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable. APB 20 previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. Earlier application is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after June 1, 2005. We will adopt SFAS 154 on August 1, 2006 and we do not expect our adoption of this new standard to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. SFAS 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Instruments In February 2006 the FASB issued SFAS 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Instruments, which amends SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and SFAS 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. SFAS 155 allows financial instruments that have embedded derivatives to be accounted for as a whole (eliminating the need to bifurcate the derivative from its host) if the holder elects to account for the whole instrument on a fair value basis. SFAS 155 also clarifies and amends certain other provisions of SFAS 133 and SFAS 140. This statement is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued in fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2006. We do not expect our adoption of this new standard to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes In June 2006 the FASB issued Financial Interpretation No. (FIN) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. It also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The requirements of FIN 48 are effective for our fiscal year beginning August 1, 2007. We are in the process of evaluating this guidance and therefore have not yet determined the impact that FIN 48 will have on our financial position or results of operations upon adoption. ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Investment Portfolio We do not hold derivative financial instruments in our portfolio of investments and funds held for payroll customers. Our investments and funds held for payroll customers consist of instruments that meet quality standards consistent with our investment policy. This policy specifies that, except for direct obligations of the United States government, securities issued by agencies of the United States government, and money market or cash management funds, we diversify our holdings by limiting our investments and funds held for payroll customers with any individual issuer. The following table presents our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments as of July 31, 2006 by stated maturity. The table is classified by the original maturity date listed on the security and includes cash equivalents and investments that are part of funds held for payroll customers on our balance sheet. Cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds. Approximately 93% of our available for sale debt securities have an interest reset date, put date or mandatory call date within one year. At July 31, 2006, the weighted average interest rate earned on our money market accounts was 5.17% and the weighted average interest rate earned on our investments was 6.32%. Years Ending July 31, 2012 and (In thousands) 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total Cash equivalents $423,127 $ $ $ $ $ $423,127 Investments 178,856 67,941 3,124 861,698 1,111,619 Total $601,983 $67,941 $3,124 $ $ $861,698 $1,534,746 48 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of investments and funds held for payroll customers are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents, investments and funds held for payroll customers and the value of those investments. Should the Federal Reserve Target Rate increase by 10% or about 53 basis points from the level of July 31, 2006, the value of our investments and funds held for payroll customers would decline by approximately $1.4 million. Should interest rates increase by 100 basis points from the level of July 31, 2006, the value of our investments and funds held for payroll customers would decline by approximately $2.6 million. Impact of Foreign Currency Rate Changes The functional currency of our international operating subsidiaries is the local currency. Assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue, costs and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange in effect during the period. We report translation gains and losses as a separate component of stockholders equity. We include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in our statements of operations. Since we translate foreign currencies (primarily Canadian dollars and British pounds) into U.S dollars for financial reporting purposes, currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results. The historical impact of currency fluctuations has generally been immaterial. We believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not significant primarily because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies. Although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial in the past and we believe that for the reasons cited above currency fluctuations will not be significant in the future, there can be no guarantee that the impact of currency fluctuations will not be material in the future. As of July 31, 2006 we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities. 49 Table of Contents
