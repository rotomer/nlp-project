ITEM 7 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MDA) includes the following sections: Executive Overview that discusses at a high level our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments underlying our financial statements. Results of Operations that includes a more detailed discussion of our revenue and expenses. Liquidity and Capital Resources which discusses key aspects of our statements of cash flows, changes in our balance sheets and our financial commitments. You should note that this MDA discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Please see the section entitled Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors at the beginning of Item 1A for important information to consider when evaluating such statements. You should read this MDA in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes in Item 8. As discussed below, in February 2007 we completed the acquisition of Digital Insight Corporation for a total purchase price of approximately $1.34 billion. Accordingly, we have included Digital Insights results of operations in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition. We have also reclassified our financial statements for all periods presented to reflect certain businesses we have sold as discontinued operations. See Results of Operations Dispositions and Discontinued Operations later in this Item 7 for more information. Unless otherwise noted, the following discussion pertains only to our continuing operations. Executive Overview This overview provides a high level discussion of our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business. We believe that an understanding of these trends is important in order to understand our financial results for fiscal 2007 as well as our future prospects. This summary is not intended to be exhaustive, nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Seasonality Our QuickBooks, Consumer Tax and Professional Tax businesses are highly seasonal. Some of our other offerings are also seasonal, but to a lesser extent. Revenue from many of our small business software products, including QuickBooks, tends to be at its peak around calendar year end, although the timing of new product releases or changes in our offerings can materially shift revenue between quarters. Sales of income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from November through April. In our Consumer Tax business, a greater proportion of our revenue has been occurring later in this seasonal period due in part to the growth in sales of TurboTax Online, for which revenue is recognized upon filing. These seasonal patterns mean that our total net revenue is usually highest during our second quarter ending January 31 and third quarter ending April 30. We typically report losses in our first quarter ending October 31 and fourth quarter ending July 31, when revenue from our tax businesses is minimal while operating expenses continue at relatively consistent levels. We believe the seasonality of our revenue is likely to continue in the future. Overview of Financial Results Total net revenue for fiscal 2007 was $2.7 billion, up 17% compared with fiscal 2006. We acquired Digital Insight and created a new Financial Institutions segment in February 2007. Excluding revenue from our Financial Institutions segment, fiscal 2007 total net revenue increased 11% compared with fiscal 2006. Almost 30% of the fiscal 2007 revenue increase was due to 15% higher revenue in our Consumer Tax segment. Our QuickBooks segment and our Payroll and Payments segment each contributed about 15% of the fiscal 2007 revenue increase. 36 Table of Contents Operating income from continuing operations of $637.6 million for fiscal 2007 increased 13% compared with $565.6 million for fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2007 revenue growth was partially offset by higher total operating costs and expenses. Higher operating expenses in fiscal 2007 reflect our acquisition of Digital Insight, continued investment in research and development for new and existing offerings as well as increases in advertising and other marketing spending to support the launch of our QuickBooks and Consumer Tax offerings. The effects of these factors are described in more detail below. Net income from continuing operations of $443.5 million for fiscal 2007 increased 16% compared with $381.0 million for fiscal 2006. Interest expense on the debt we issued in connection with our February 2007 acquisition of Digital Insight was partially offset by higher interest income. We recorded a pre tax net gain of $31.7 million on the sale of certain outsourced payroll assets in fiscal 2007. Our effective tax rates for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 were approximately 36% and 38%. Diluted net income per share from continuing operations of $1.25 for fiscal 2007 increased 18% compared with $1.06 for fiscal 2006. Average shares outstanding declined as a result of repurchases of common stock under our stock repurchase programs, partially offset by the issuance of shares in connection with our employee stock plans. On February 6, 2007 we completed the acquisition of Digital Insight for a total purchase price of approximately $1.34 billion. In order to finance a portion of this transaction, on February 6, 2007 we borrowed $1 billion under a bridge credit facility, which we retired on March 12, 2007 with the proceeds of our issuance of $1 billion in senior notes. We funded the remainder of the purchase price with our existing cash balances. Our future operating results will reflect interest expense related to the senior notes. In March 2007 we completed the sale of certain assets related to our Complete Payroll and Premier Payroll Service businesses to Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP) for a price of up to approximately $135 million in cash. The final purchase price is contingent upon the number of customers that transition to ADP. Due to actual customer attrition during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we currently estimate the maximum sales price to be approximately $120 million. We will recognize the gain on the sale of the assets as customers are transitioned pursuant to the agreement over a period not to exceed one year from the date of the sale. We recognized a pre tax net gain of $31.7 million on the sale of the assets in fiscal 2007. In July 2007 we signed a definitive agreement to sell our Intuit Distribution Management Solutions (IDMS) business. The sale was completed in August 2007 for approximately $100 million in cash. IDMS was part of our Other Businesses segment. We have accounted for IDMS as a discontinued operation and segregated the net assets and operating results of IDMS from continuing operations for all periods presented. We expect to record a gain on the sale of IDMS in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. We ended fiscal 2007 with cash and investments totaling $1.3 billion. In fiscal 2007 we generated cash from operations, from the issuance of long term debt and, to a lesser extent, from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans. During the same period we used cash for the purchase of Digital Insight and for purchases of property and equipment. We also repurchased 17.1 million shares of our common stock for $506.6 million under our stock repurchase programs in fiscal 2007. At July 31, 2007, we had authorization from our Board to expend $800 million for future stock repurchases. On March 22, 2007 we entered into an agreement with certain institutional lenders for a $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire on March 22, 2012. We may use amounts borrowed under this credit facility for general corporate purposes or for future acquisitions or expansion of our business. To date we have not borrowed under the credit facility, but we may borrow under the credit facility from time to time as opportunities and needs arise. See Liquidity and Capital Resources Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility below for more information. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates In preparing our financial statements, we make estimates, assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue, operating income or loss and net income or loss, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Senior management has reviewed the development and selection of these 37 Table of Contents critical accounting policies and their disclosure in this Annual Report on Form 10 K with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Net Revenue Revenue Recognition We derive revenue from the sale of packaged software products, license fees, software subscriptions, product support, professional services, payroll services, merchant services, transaction fees and multiple element arrangements that may include any combination of these items. We follow the appropriate revenue recognition rules for each type of revenue. For additional information, see Net Revenue in Note 1 to the financial statements in Item 8. We generally recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable. However, determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report. For example, for multiple element arrangements we must make assumptions and judgments in order to allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver, to determine whether undelivered services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services, to determine whether vendor specific evidence of fair value exists for each undelivered element and to determine whether and when each element has been delivered. If we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments, it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period. Amounts for fees collected or invoiced and due relating to arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized when the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied. In connection with the sale of certain products, we provide a limited amount of free technical support assistance to customers. We do not defer the recognition of any revenue associated with sales of these products since the cost of providing this free technical support is insignificant. The technical support is generally provided within one year after the associated revenue is recognized and free product enhancements are minimal and infrequent. We accrue the estimated cost of providing this free support upon product shipment. Net Revenue Return and Rebate Reserves As part of our revenue recognition policy, we estimate future product returns and rebate payments and establish reserves against revenue at the time of sale based on these estimates. Our return policy allows distributors and retailers, subject to contractual limitations, to return purchased products. Product returns by distributors and retailers relate primarily to the return of excess and obsolete products. In determining our product returns reserves, we consider the volume and price mix of products in the retail channel, historical return rates for prior releases of the product, trends in retailer inventory and economic trends that might impact customer demand for our products (including the competitive environment and the timing of new releases of our products). We fully reserve for excess and obsolete products in the distribution channels. Our rebate reserves include distributor and retailer sales incentive rebates and end user rebates. Our estimated reserves for distributor and retailer incentive rebates are based on distributors and retailers actual performance against the terms and conditions of rebate programs, which we typically establish annually. Our reserves for end user rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the specific promotional rebate program, actual sales during the promotion and historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program. In the past, actual returns and rebates have not differed significantly from the reserves that we have established. However, actual returns and rebates in any future period are inherently uncertain. If we were to change our assumptions and estimates, our revenue reserves would change, which would impact the net revenue we report. If actual returns and rebates are significantly greater than the reserves we have established, the actual results would decrease our future reported revenue. Conversely, if actual returns and rebates are significantly less than our reserves, this would increase our future reported revenue. For example, if we had increased our fiscal 2007 returns reserves by 1% of non consignment sales to retailers for QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken, our fiscal 2007 total net revenue would have been $3.3 million lower. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We make ongoing assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable. The accounts receivable amount on our balance sheet includes a reserve for accounts that might not be paid. In determining the amount of the 38 Table of Contents reserve, we consider our historical level of credit losses. We also make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations, and we assess current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future. Our reserves have generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses. However, since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, we cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be adequate. If actual credit losses are significantly greater than the reserve we have established, that would increase our general and administrative expenses and reduce our reported net income. Conversely, if actual credit losses are significantly less than our reserve, this would eventually decrease our general and administrative expenses and increase our reported net income. Business Combinations Purchase Accounting Under the purchase method of accounting, we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. We record the excess of purchase price over the aggregate fair values as goodwill. We engage third party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. These valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing purchased technology, customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets. If the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, we could experience impairment charges. In addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. If our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed. Goodwill, Purchased Intangible Assets and Other Long Lived Assets Impairment Assessments We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than temporary impairment in the remaining value of the assets recorded on our balance sheet may exist. We test the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise. The timing of the formal annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods. In order to estimate the fair value of long lived assets, we typically make various assumptions about the future prospects for the business that the asset relates to, consider market factors specific to that business and estimate future cash flows to be generated by that business. We evaluate cash flows at the lowest operating level and the number of reporting units that we have identified may make impairment more probable than it would be at a company with fewer reporting units and integrated operations following acquisitions. Based on these assumptions and estimates, we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset stated on our balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results. More conservative assumptions of the anticipated future benefits from these businesses could result in impairment charges, which would decrease net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet. Conversely, less conservative assumptions could result in smaller or no impairment charges, higher net income and higher asset values. At July 31, 2007, we had $1.5 billion in goodwill and $292.9 million in net purchased intangible assets on our balance sheet. Accounting for Share Based Compensation Plans Prior to August 1, 2005, we accounted for our share based employee compensation plans under the measurement and recognition provisions of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations, as permitted by Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. We recorded no share based employee compensation expense for options granted under our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan or its predecessor plans prior to August 1, 2005 as all options granted under those plans had exercise prices equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. We also recorded no compensation expense in connection with our Employee Stock Purchase Plan as the purchase price of the stock was not less than 85% of the 39 Table of Contents lower of the fair market value of our common stock at the beginning of each offering period or at the end of each purchase period. In accordance with SFAS 123 and SFAS 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, we disclosed our net income or loss and net income or loss per share as if we had applied the fair value based method in measuring compensation expense for our share based incentive programs. Effective August 1, 2005, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123(R), Share Based Payment, using the modified prospective transition method. Under that transition method, compensation expense that we recognize beginning on that date includes: (a) period compensation expense for all share based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of, August 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, and (b) period compensation expense for all share based payments granted on or after August 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123(R). Because we elected to use the modified prospective transition method, results for prior periods have not been restated. At July 31, 2007, there was $178.5 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested share based compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans which we will amortize to expense in the future. Total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures. We expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average vesting period of 2.2 years. Effective August 1, 2006, we began using a lattice binomial model and the assumptions shown in Note 12 to the financial statements in Item 8 to estimate the fair value of stock options granted. Prior to that date we used the Black Scholes valuation model. This change did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our stock options have various restrictions, including vesting provisions and restrictions on transfer, and are often exercised prior to their contractual maturity. We therefore believe that lattice binomial models are more capable of incorporating the features of our stock options than closed form models such as the Black Scholes model. Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we estimated the expected term of options granted based on implied exercise patterns using a binomial model. Prior to that, we estimated the expected term of options granted based on historical exercise patterns. We estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the implied volatility of publicly traded one year and two year options on our common stock, consistent with SFAS 123(R) and Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107. Our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. We base the risk free interest rate that we use in our option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on constant maturity U.S. Treasury issues with equivalent remaining terms. We have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we use an expected dividend yield of zero in our option valuation model. SFAS 123(R) requires us to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. For options granted before August 1, 2005, we amortize the fair value on an accelerated basis. This is the same basis on which we amortized options granted before August 1, 2005 for our pro forma disclosures under SFAS 123. For options granted on or after August 1, 2005, we amortize the fair value on a straight line basis. All options are amortized over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods. We may elect to use different assumptions under our option valuation model in the future, which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share. Legal Contingencies We are subject to certain legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business. We review the status of each significant matter quarterly and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability and an expense for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our accruals are based on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Potential legal liabilities and the revision of estimates of potential legal liabilities could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. 40 Table of Contents Income Taxes Estimates of Effective Tax Rates, Deferred Taxes and Valuation Allowance When we prepare our financial statements, we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We record an additional amount in our provision for income taxes in the period in which we determine that our recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate tax assessment to be. If in a later period we determine that payment of this additional amount is unnecessary, we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit in that later period. As a result, our ongoing assessments of the probable outcomes of the audit issues and related tax positions require judgment and can materially increase or decrease our effective tax rate and materially affect our operating results. This also requires us to estimate our current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which we show on our balance sheet. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized. To the extent we believe that realization is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. When we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period, we record a corresponding tax expense in our statement of operations. Our net deferred tax asset at July 31, 2007 was $156.7 million, net of the valuation allowance of $2.5 million. We recorded the valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets (consisting primarily of certain state net operating loss carryforwards) before they expire. The valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable. While we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, we could be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize. An increase in the valuation allowance would have an adverse impact, which could be material, on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we make the increase.

Total net revenue was higher in fiscal 2007 due to our February 2007 acquisition of Digital Insight, to revenue growth in our Consumer Tax segment and, to a lesser extent, to revenue growth in our QuickBooks segment and our Payroll and Payments segment. Revenue from our Financial Institutions segment, which includes Digital Insight, was $150.4 million in fiscal 2007 compared with $24.4 million in fiscal 2006. Consumer Tax revenue increased $106.8 million or 15% in fiscal 2007 due to 16% growth in federal online units, excluding units donated through the Free File Alliance, and to price increases. QuickBooks segment revenue increased $59.3 million or 11% in fiscal 2007 due to unit growth and favorable product mix. Payroll and Payments revenue increased $54.6 million or 12% in fiscal 2007 due to growth in the QuickBooks Payroll and the Payments customer bases, favorable Payroll product mix and higher transaction 41 Table of Contents volume per customer in our Payments business. See Total Net Revenue by Business Segment below for more information. Higher revenue in fiscal 2007 was partially offset by higher expenses, including increases compared with fiscal 2006 of approximately $87 million for product development expenses, approximately $85 million for advertising and other selling and marketing expenses and approximately $80 million for cost of revenue associated with our revenue growth. See Operating Expenses below for more information. Net income from continuing operations increased $62.5 million or 16% in fiscal 2007. Interest expense on the debt we issued in connection with our February 2007 acquisition of Digital Insight of $27.1 million was partially offset by $13.0 million higher interest income in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006. Interest income increased in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 due to higher interest rates and higher average invested balances. We recorded a pre tax net gain of $31.7 million on the sale of certain outsourced payroll assets in fiscal 2007. Our effective tax rates for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 were approximately 36% and 38%. See Income Taxes later in this Item 7 for more information. Diluted net income per share from continuing operations increased 18% to $1.25 in fiscal 2007 compared with $1.06 in fiscal 2006. Average shares outstanding declined during fiscal 2007 as a result of repurchases of 17.1 million shares of common stock under our stock repurchase programs, partially offset by the issuance of 12.1 million shares in connection with our employee stock plans. At July 31, 2007, our cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $1.3 billion, an increase of $106.5 million from July 31, 2006. In fiscal 2007 we generated $726.8 million in cash from our continuing operations and received approximately $1 billion in cash from the issuance of long term debt and $211.4 million in cash from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans. During the same period we used approximately $1.2 billion in cash for the purchase of Digital Insight (net of cash acquired) and $153.2 million in cash for purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of internal use software. We also repurchased 17.1 million shares of our common stock for $506.6 million under our stock repurchase programs during fiscal 2007. At July 31, 2007, we had authorization from our Board to expend $800 million for future stock repurchases. Total Net Revenue The table below and the discussion of net revenue by business segment that follows it are organized in accordance with our six reportable business segments. See Note 8 to the financial statements in Item 8 for descriptions of product revenue and service and other revenue for each segment. In February 2007 we completed the acquisition of Digital Insight, a provider of outsourced online banking applications and services to banks and credit unions. We combined Digital Insight with our existing financial institutions group, which had been part of our Other Businesses segment, to create a new Financial Institutions segment during fiscal 2007. We have reclassified our existing financial institutions business from our Other Businesses segment to our Financial Institutions segment for all periods presented. We have also reclassified segment results for all periods presented to reflect the transfer of our MyCorporation business from our Consumer Tax segment to our QuickBooks segment. MyCorporation revenue was $7.9 million in fiscal 2007 and $4.4 million in fiscal 2006. MyCorporation revenue was not significant in fiscal 2005. 42 Table of Contents % Total % Total % Total Fiscal Net Fiscal Net Fiscal Net 2007 2006 2006 2005 (Dollars in millions) 2007 Revenue 2006 Revenue 2005 Revenue % Change % Change QuickBooks Product revenue $ 507.4 $ 466.2 $ 436.4 Service and other revenue 90.8 72.7 66.6 Subtotal 598.2 22 % 538.9 23 % 503.0 25 % 11 % 7 % Payroll and Payments Product revenue 208.9 194.1 157.2 Service and other revenue 307.8 268.0 214.6 Subtotal 516.7 19 % 462.1 20 % 371.8 19 % 12 % 24 % Consumer Tax Product revenue 300.7 265.8 242.2 Service and other revenue 512.2 440.3 328.5 Subtotal 812.9 31 % 706.1 31 % 570.7 29 % 15 % 24 % Professional Tax Product revenue 261.3 245.0 233.5 Service and other revenue 30.4 27.9 31.5 Subtotal 291.7 11 % 272.9 12 % 265.0 13 % 7 % 3 % Financial Institutions Product revenue 0.2 0.2 Service and other revenue 150.2 24.2 19.1 Subtotal 150.4 6 % 24.4 1 % 19.1 1 % 516 % 27 % Other Businesses Product revenue 168.9 164.1 154.5 Service and other revenue 134.1 124.5 109.0 Subtotal 303.0 11 % 288.6 13 % 263.5 13 % 5 % 10 % Total Company Product revenue 1,447.4 1,335.4 1,223.8 Service and other revenue 1,225.5 957.6 769.3 Total net revenue $ 2,672.9 100 % $ 2,293.0 100 % $ 1,993.1 100 % 17 % 15 % Total Net Revenue by Business Segment QuickBooks Fiscal 2007 Compared with Fiscal 2006. QuickBooks segment net revenue increased $59.3 million or 11% in fiscal 2007 compared with 2006. Total QuickBooks software unit sales were 10% higher in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 due in part to new promotions, including our first ever QuickBooks television advertisements. Revenue 43 Table of Contents growth in fiscal 2007 was also driven by favorable product mix, with QuickBooks Premier units increasing 25% in fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2006 Compared with Fiscal 2005. QuickBooks segment net revenue increased $35.9 million or 7% in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005. Total QuickBooks software unit sales were up 14% in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005. This higher unit volume more than offset lower average selling prices for QuickBooks software due to price reductions for new users and the elimination of upgrade rebates. We believe that the higher unit volume was a result of product improvements, successful execution of our QuickBooks 2006 product launch and growth in the category that was driven by publicity surrounding a significant new market entrant. Payroll and Payments Fiscal 2007 Compared with Fiscal 2006. Payroll and Payments net revenue increased $54.6 million or 12% in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006. In our Payments business, merchant services revenue increased 36% in fiscal 2007 due to 22% growth in the customer base and 9% higher transaction volume per customer. Merchant services revenue slowed in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 due to new customer acquisition remaining relatively constant on a larger customer base. Small business payroll revenue grew 3% in fiscal 2007 due to 4% growth in the customer base and, to a lesser extent, to favorable product mix that resulted in higher revenue per customer. We estimate that revenue growth in our Payroll and Payments segment in fiscal 2007 would have been approximately 16% if the sale of portions of our Complete Payroll and Premier Payroll Services customer base to ADP had not occurred. Fiscal 2006 Compared with Fiscal 2005. Payroll and Payments net revenue increased $90.3 million or 24% in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005. Our combined payroll offerings accounted for slightly more than half of the fiscal 2006 revenue increase while our merchant services represented slightly less than half of the revenue increase. QuickBooks Payroll revenue was 23% higher in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 because of a combination of favorable product mix, 7% growth in the customer base and the residual effects of a price increase that we implemented in fiscal 2005. Revenue from our other payroll offerings increased 11% in fiscal 2006, driven by 17% growth in the number of QuickBooks Assisted Payroll and Complete Payroll customers processing payrolls, price increases and increased interest income on funds held for payroll customers, partially offset by attrition in the Premier Payroll Service customer base. Merchant services revenue increased 47% in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 due to 32% growth in the customer base and 18% higher transaction volume per customer. Consumer Tax Fiscal 2007 Compared with Fiscal 2006. Consumer Tax net revenue increased $106.8 million or 15% in 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 due to 16% growth in federal online units, excluding units donated through the Free File Alliance, and to price increases. Consumer Tax net revenue for fiscal 2007 included the impact of approximately $9 million in refunds to customers who experienced delays in electronically preparing or filing their income tax returns on April 17, 2007. We believe that the continuing trend among individual taxpayers toward the use of software, rather than manual methods, to prepare their own income tax returns will continue to be important to the growth of our Consumer Tax business. Fiscal 2006 Compared with Fiscal 2005. Consumer Tax net revenue increased $135.4 million or 24% in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005. Paid federal TurboTax unit sales were up 20% in fiscal 2006, driven by a 57% increase in federal TurboTax Online units sold which accounted for the majority of the revenue increase for that period. To a lesser extent, higher fiscal 2006 revenue was due to growth in revenue from attach services such as electronic filing. We believe that fiscal 2006 Consumer Tax revenue growth was positively affected by changes in our offering and pricing strategies that included eliminating rebates and bundling federal and state consumer tax products. These changes were designed to simplify our offerings in response to customer feedback. Professional Tax Fiscal 2007 Compared with Fiscal 2006. Professional Tax net revenue increased $18.8 million or 7% in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 due to add on product penetration and price increases. 44 Table of Contents Fiscal 2006 Compared with Fiscal 2005. Professional Tax net revenue increased $7.9 million or 3% in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 due to overall growth in the Professional Tax customer base that was partially offset by a shift in product mix toward our lower priced offerings. Financial Institutions Fiscal 2007 Compared with Fiscal 2006. Financial Institutions net revenue increased $126.0 million to $150.4 million in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 due almost entirely to our February 2007 acquisition of Digital Insight. Other Businesses Fiscal 2007 Compared with Fiscal 2006. Other Businesses net revenue increased $14.4 million or 5% in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006. Quicken revenue was flat while revenue from our business in Canada increased 11% and revenue from our Intuit Real Estate Solutions business grew 28%. Fiscal 2006 Compared with Fiscal 2005. Other Businesses total net revenue increased $25.1 million or 10% in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005. Quicken revenue was slightly lower in fiscal 2006. Canadian revenue increased 23% in fiscal 2006 due to strong growth in sales of QuickBooks products and to a lesser extent to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Cost of Revenue % of % of % of Fiscal Related Fiscal Related Fiscal Related (Dollars in millions) 2007 Revenue 2006 Revenue 2005 Revenue Cost of product revenue $ 169.1 12 % $ 165.9 12 % $ 154.3 13 % Cost of service and other revenue 309.4 25 % 232.6 24 % 196.3 26 % Amortization of purchased intangible assets 30.9 n/a 8.8 n/a 9.1 n/a Total cost of revenue $ 509.4 19 % $ 407.3 18 % $ 359.7 18 % Our cost of revenue has three components: (1) cost of product revenue, which includes the direct costs of manufacturing and shipping our software products; (2) cost of service and other revenue, which reflects direct costs associated with providing services, including data center costs related to delivering Internet based services, and costs associated with revenue sharing and online transactions revenue; (3) amortization of purchased intangible assets, which represents the cost of amortizing over their useful lives developed technologies that we obtained through acquisitions. Fiscal 2007 Compared with Fiscal 2006. Cost of service and other revenue as a percentage of service and other revenue increased slightly to 25% in fiscal 2007 from 24% in fiscal 2006. The impact of growth in TurboTax Online and electronic tax filing services, which have relatively lower costs of revenue, was offset by the impact of our acquisition of Digital Insight, which has relatively higher costs of revenue. Amortization of purchased intangible assets increased in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 due to the amortization of Digital Insight purchased intangible assets that we acquired in February 2007. Fiscal 2006 Compared with Fiscal 2005. Cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue decreased to 12% in fiscal 2006 compared with 13% in fiscal 2005. Growth in TurboTax units came disproportionately through our Web TurboTax offer, which had lower costs per unit than our desktop offerings. This was partially offset by higher cost of product revenue in our QuickBooks segment, which resulted from 14% QuickBooks unit growth. Cost of service and other revenue as a percentage of service and other revenue decreased to 24% in fiscal 2006 from 26% in fiscal 2005. Growth in our Consumer Tax electronic filing revenue, Assisted Payroll revenue and merchant 45 Table of Contents services revenue, all of which had lower relative cost increases associated with their related revenue increases, was mostly offset by higher costs in our QuickBooks segment, which resulted from improvements in service levels for technical support plan customers.

Individually and in the aggregate, operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenue were generally consistent in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006. Total operating expenses in dollars increased $205.9 million in fiscal 2007, approximately $60 million of which was due to our February 2007 acquisition of Digital Insight. Including Digital Insight, approximately 42% of the fiscal 2007 increase in total operating expenses was due to higher research and development expenses. During fiscal 2007 we continued to invest in research and development for existing offerings as well as for new offerings. Approximately 41% of the fiscal 2007 increase in total operating expenses was due to higher selling and marketing expenses that included increases in radio, television and online advertising expenses for our Consumer Tax and QuickBooks offerings as well as additional investments in direct marketing and product management. Acquisition related charges increased in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 due to the amortization of Digital Insight purchased intangible assets that we acquired in February 2007. Fiscal 2006 Compared with Fiscal 2005. Individually and in the aggregate, operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenue were generally consistent in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005. Total operating expenses in dollars increased $215.4 million in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005. Share based compensation expense for stock options and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan that we recorded as a result of our adoption of SFAS 123(R) on August 1, 2005 accounted for approximately $63 million of that increase. In fiscal 2006 total operating expenses also increased by approximately $75 million for new product development and approximately $60 million for additional advertising and other marketing programs and improved customer support service levels, particularly in our QuickBooks and Consumer Tax segments. Excluding the impact of share based compensation expense, sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue declined due to lower direct selling costs associated with our fiscal 2006 focus on the retail channel. Segment Operating Income (Loss) Segment operating income or loss is segment net revenue less segment cost of revenue and operating expenses. Segment expenses do not include certain costs, such as corporate general and administrative expenses and share based compensation expenses, which are not allocated to specific segments. These unallocated costs totaled $506.2 million in fiscal 2007, $465.2 million in fiscal 2006 and $383.0 million in fiscal 2005. Share based compensation expenses for stock options and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan that we began recording in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 accounted for $65.0 million of the increase in unallocated costs for fiscal 2006. See Note 1 and Note 12 to the financial statements in Item 8. Segment expenses also do not include amortization of purchased intangible 46 Table of Contents assets, acquisition related charges, and impairment of goodwill and purchased intangible assets. In addition, segment expenses do not include interest expense, interest and other income, and realized net gains or losses on marketable equity securities and other investments. See Note 8 to the financial statements in Item 8 for reconciliations of total segment operating income to income from continuing operations for each fiscal year presented. % of % of % of Fiscal Related Fiscal Related Fiscal Related (Dollars in millions) 2007 Revenue 2006 Revenue 2005 Revenue QuickBooks $ 180.2 30 % $ 167.8 31 % $ 199.9 40 % Payroll and Payments 215.4 42 % 181.9 39 % 133.5 36 % Consumer Tax 508.6 63 % 467.1 66 % 379.8 67 % Professional Tax 152.2 52 % 135.8 50 % 132.7 50 % Financial Institutions 38.8 26 % 12.2 50 % 14.0 73 % Other Businesses 99.5 33 % 84.3 29 % 73.7 28 % Total segment operating income $ 1,194.7 45 % $ 1,049.1 46 % $ 933.6 47 % QuickBooks Fiscal 2007 Compared with Fiscal 2006. QuickBooks segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue was approximately the same in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006. The $59.3 million growth in QuickBooks segment revenue in fiscal 2007 was partially offset by higher expenses, including increases of approximately $11 million for cost of revenue, approximately $16 million for selling and marketing expenses (which consisted primarily of higher radio and television advertising expenses and additional investments in direct marketing and product management) and approximately $18 million for product development expenses in fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2006 Compared with Fiscal 2005. QuickBooks segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue decreased to 31% in fiscal 2006 from 40% in fiscal 2005. Higher fiscal 2006 QuickBooks revenue resulted from higher unit volume that more than offset the impact of lower average selling prices. However, lower average selling prices yielded lower profit per unit. Higher unit volume in fiscal 2006 also resulted in higher customer support costs. We also spent more on QuickBooks product development and on improvements to technical support service levels in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005. Payroll and Payments Fiscal 2007 Compared with Fiscal 2006. Payroll and Payments segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue increased to 42% in fiscal 2007 from 39% in fiscal 2006. Most of the fiscal 2007 revenue growth in this segment came from products and services with relatively lower costs of revenue, such as QuickBooks Payroll, Assisted Payroll and merchant services. The $54.6 million higher Payroll and Payments revenue in fiscal 2007 was partially offset by higher expenses, including increases of approximately $7 million for product development expenses, approximately $5 million for selling and marketing expenses and approximately $6 million for general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2006 Compared with Fiscal 2005. Payroll and Payments segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue increased to 39% in fiscal 2006 from 36% in fiscal 2005. More of the fiscal 2006 revenue growth in this segment came from products and services with relatively lower costs of revenue, such as QuickBooks Payroll and merchant services. Consumer Tax Fiscal 2007 Compared with Fiscal 2006. Consumer Tax segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue decreased to 63% in fiscal 2007 from 66% in fiscal 2006. The $106.8 million growth in Consumer Tax revenue in fiscal 2007 was partially offset by higher expenses, including increases of approximately $45 million for selling and marketing expenses (including higher radio, television and online advertising expenses as well as higher direct marketing expenses) and approximately $18 million for product development expenses in fiscal 2007. 47 Table of Contents Fiscal 2006 Compared with Fiscal 2005. Consumer Tax segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue was approximately the same in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005. Higher revenue and lower rebate processing fees were partially offset by higher expenses for television and Web advertising and to a lesser extent for product development and customer support in fiscal 2006. Professional Tax Fiscal 2007 Compared with Fiscal 2006. Professional Tax segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue increased to 52% in fiscal 2007 from 50% in fiscal 2006. Professional Tax revenue increased $18.8 million while expenses were relatively stable in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2006 Compared with Fiscal 2005. Professional Tax segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue was the same in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005. Revenue and operating expenses were similar in the two periods. Financial Institutions Fiscal 2007 Compared with Fiscal 2006. Financial Institutions segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue decreased to 26% in fiscal 2007 from 50% in fiscal 2006. The change in segment operating income structure is due to our February 2007 acquisition of Digital Insight, which we combined with our existing financial institutions business to create a new Financial Institutions segment. This new segment is significantly larger and has higher costs than the Intuit financial institutions business that preceded it. Other Businesses Fiscal 2007 Compared with Fiscal 2006. Other Businesses segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue increased to 33% in fiscal 2007 from 29% in fiscal 2006. The fiscal 2007 improvement in segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue was due to the May 2006 sale of our MasterBuilder business, which had relatively low operating margins. Fiscal 2006 Compared with Fiscal 2005. Other Businesses segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue was nearly the same in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005. Quicken revenue was slightly lower while expenses to develop and market new offerings increased in fiscal 2006. Higher revenue combined with relatively stable spending produced better operating margins in Canada. Non Operating Income and Expenses Interest Expense In order to finance a portion of our acquisition of Digital Insight, on February 6, 2007 we borrowed $1 billion under a bridge credit facility, which we retired on March 12, 2007 with the proceeds of our issuance of $1 billion in senior notes. Interest expense for fiscal 2007 included interest on the $1 billion bridge credit facility at 5.77% while it was outstanding, interest on $500 million in principal amount of the senior notes at 5.40% and interest on $500 million in principal amount of the senior notes at 5.75%. The senior notes are due in March 2012 and March 2017 and are redeemable by Intuit at any time, subject to a make whole premium. We are amortizing a total of $7.3 million in debt issuance costs to interest expense over the terms of the related senior notes. 48 Table of Contents Interest and Other Income Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal (In millions) 2007 2006 2005 Interest income $ 44.0 $ 31.0 $ 17.4 Quicken Loans royalties and fees 9.3 9.3 9.8 Net foreign exchange gain (loss) (0.1 ) 0.1 (0.1 ) Pre tax gain on sale of certain assets of our ICBS business 2.4 Other (0.5 ) 0.2 (0.5 ) Total interest and other income $ 52.7 $ 43.0 $ 26.6 Higher interest rates and higher average invested balances resulted in increases in interest income in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 and in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005. Total interest and other income for all periods presented included royalties and fees from trademark license and distribution agreements that we entered into when we sold our Quicken Loans mortgage business in July 2002. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate was approximately 36% for fiscal 2007, approximately 38% for fiscal 2006 and approximately 33% for fiscal 2005. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 differed from the federal statutory rate of 35% due to state income taxes, which were partially offset by the benefit we received from tax exempt interest income, federal and state research and experimental credits and the domestic production activities deduction. In addition, in fiscal 2007 we benefited from the retroactive extension of the federal research and experimental credit as it related to fiscal 2006. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 differed from the federal statutory rate of 35% due to state income taxes and the taxable gain on the sale of our Master Builder business, which were partially offset by the benefit we received from tax exempt interest income, federal and state research and experimental credits and the domestic production activities deduction. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2005 differed from the federal statutory rate of 35% due to the net effect of the reversal of $25.7 million in reserves related to potential income tax exposures that were resolved, the federal research and experimental credit and to the benefit received from tax exempt interest income offset by state taxes. See Note 11 to the financial statements in Item 8. In December 2006 the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 was signed into law. The Act includes a reinstatement of the federal research and experimental credit retroactive to January 1, 2006. We recorded a discrete tax benefit of $3.7 million for the retroactive amount related to fiscal 2006 during the second quarter of fiscal 2007. The credit as reinstated has an expiration date of December 31, 2007. We acquired Digital Insight on February 6, 2007. See Note 6 to the financial statements in Item 8. Digital Insight had approximately $76 million in federal net operating loss carryforwards at the date of acquisition. We have recorded the tax effects of these carryforwards and other federal tax credit carryforwards, which together totaled $34.4 million, as deferred tax assets at the date of acquisition. The carryforwards will not result in an income tax provision benefit, but they will reduce income taxes payable and cash paid for income taxes as they are utilized. At July 31, 2007, we had total federal net operating loss carryforwards and federal tax credit carryforwards of $25.3 million and $4.9 million. At July 31, 2007, we had net deferred tax assets of $156.7 million which included a valuation allowance of $2.5 million for certain state net operating loss carryforwards. The allowance reflects managements assessment that we may not receive the benefit of loss carryforwards in certain state jurisdictions. While we believe our current valuation allowance is sufficient, it may be necessary to increase this amount if it becomes more likely that we will not realize a greater portion of the net deferred tax assets. We assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. See Note 11 to the financial statements in Item 8. 49 Table of Contents Dispositions and Discontinued Operations During fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 we sold the assets and businesses described below. See Note 7 to the financial statements in Item 8 for a more complete description of these dispositions and discontinued operations and for a summary of the impact that discontinued operations have had on our statements of operations for those fiscal years. Intuit Distribution Management Solutions Discontinued Operations In July 2007 we signed a definitive agreement to sell our Intuit Distribution Management Solutions (IDMS) business. The sale was completed in August 2007 for approximately $100 million in cash. IDMS was part of our Other Businesses segment. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long lived Assets, we determined that IDMS became a discontinued operation in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. We have therefore segregated the operating results of IDMS from continuing operations in our statements of operations for all periods presented. We expect to record a gain on the sale of IDMS in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. Sale of Outsourced Payroll Assets In March 2007 we sold certain assets related to our Complete Payroll and Premier Payroll Service businesses to ADP for a price of up to approximately $135 million in cash. The final purchase price is contingent upon the number of customers that transition to ADP. Due to actual customer attrition during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we currently estimate the maximum sales price to be approximately $120 million. The assets were part of our Payroll and Payments segment. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 144, we have not accounted for this transaction as a discontinued operation. We will recognize the net gain on the sale of the assets as customers are transitioned pursuant to the agreement over a period not to exceed one year from the date of the sale. In fiscal 2007 we recorded a pre tax net gain of $31.7 million in our statement of operations for customers who transitioned to ADP during that period. Sale of Master Builder Business In May 2006 we sold our Master Builder construction management software and solutions business, which was part of Intuit Construction Business Solutions (ICBS) in our Other Businesses segment. The Master Builder business had quarterly revenue of approximately $5 million. We recorded a $7.7 million net loss on disposal of the business, including income tax expense of $10.1 million, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 144, we have not accounted for this transaction as a discontinued operation. Intuit Information Technology Solutions Discontinued Operations In December 2005 we sold our Intuit Information Technology Solutions (ITS) business for approximately $200 million in cash. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 144, we have segregated the operating results of ITS from continuing operations in our statements of operations for all periods prior to the sale. We recorded a $34.3 million net gain on disposal of ITS which is included in net income from discontinued operations in our fiscal 2006 statement of operations. Intuit Public Sector Solutions Discontinued Operations In December 2004 we sold our Intuit Public Sector Solutions (IPSS) business for approximately $11 million in cash and accounted for the sale as a discontinued operation. In accordance with SFAS 144, we have segregated the operating results of IPSS from continuing operations in our statements of operations for all periods prior to the sale. In fiscal 2005 we recorded a $4.8 million net loss on disposal of IPSS that included an income tax provision of $4.3 million for the estimated tax payable in connection with the expected tax gain on the transaction. These amounts are included in net income from discontinued operations in our fiscal 2005 statement of operations. 50 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Statements of Cash Flows At July 31, 2007 our cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $1.3 billion, an increase of $106.5 million from July 31, 2006. We generated $726.8 million in cash from our continuing operations during fiscal 2007. We used $1.4 billion in cash for investing activities during that period, including approximately $1.2 billion for our purchase of Digital Insight (net of cash acquired) and $153.2 million for purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of internal use software. We generated $733.9 million in cash from financing activities during fiscal 2007, including approximately $1 billion from the issuance of long term debt and $211.4 million from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans partially offset by $506.6 million for the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase programs. See Item 5, Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers, Stock Repurchase Programs below and Note 12 to the financial statements in Item 8. Our expenditures for property and equipment increased from $44.5 million in fiscal 2006 to $104.9 million in fiscal 2007 primarily due to the construction of our new San Diego facility. We expect our expenditures for property and equipment and capitalized internal use software to increase from a total of $153.2 million in fiscal 2007 to approximately $300 million in fiscal 2008. This planned increase in capital expenditures is related to investments in infrastructure, offices and data centers to support the expected growth in our business. The following table summarizes selected items from our statements of cash flows for fiscal 2007, fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005. See the financial statements in Item 8 for complete statements of cash flows for those periods. Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal (In millions) 2007 2006 2005 Net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations $ 726.8 $ 595.5 $ 589.9 Net income from continuing operations 441.1 377.4 375.0 Depreciation 94.2 94.2 100.0 Share based compensation 77.3 71.4 5.5 Acquisition related costs 55.9 23.2 26.8 Net cash used in investing activities of continuing operations (1,412.5 ) (210.0 ) (1.6 ) Acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired (1,271.8 ) (42.2 ) (4.3 ) Net liquidation (purchases) of available for sale debt securities 59.8 (111.1 ) 69.9 Purchases of property and equipment (104.9 ) (44.5 ) (38.2 ) Capitalization of internal use software (48.3 ) (37.6 ) (31.4 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 733.9 (478.8 ) (548.0 ) Issuance of long term debt, net of discounts 997.8 Purchase of treasury stock (506.8 ) (784.2 ) (709.9 ) Net proceeds from issuance of common stock 211.4 279.3 165.8 Net cash provided by discontinued operations 19.8 185.9 17.3 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 75.6 95.8 57.9 We generated cash from our operating activities during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, primarily from net income from continuing operations in each of those years. We used cash for investing activities during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, including acquisitions of businesses, purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of internal use software. We generated cash from financing activities in fiscal 2007 primarily from the issuance of long term debt in connection with our acquisition of Digital Insight and from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans, partially offset by the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase programs. We used cash for financing activities in fiscal 2006 and 2005 primarily for the repurchase of common stock under our stock 51 Table of Contents repurchase programs, partially offset by proceeds that we received from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans in each of these fiscal years. Stock Split On July 6, 2006 we implemented a two for one stock split in the form of a 100% stock dividend. All share and per share figures in this Item 7 and in the statements of operations and notes to the financial statements in Item 8 retroactively reflect this stock split. Stock Repurchase Programs Our Board of Directors has authorized a series of common stock repurchase programs. Shares of common stock repurchased under these programs become treasury shares. During fiscal 2007 we repurchased 17.1 million shares of our common stock for $506.6 million under our repurchase programs. From the inception of these programs in May 2001 through the end of fiscal 2007, we repurchased 158.7 million shares of our common stock for $3.8 billion. At July 31, 2007, we had authorization from our Board to expend $800 million for future stock repurchases. Digital Insight Acquisition On February 6, 2007 we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Digital Insight for a total purchase price of approximately $1.34 billion including the value of vested options assumed. See Note 6 to the financial statements in Item 8. We borrowed $1 billion under a one year unsecured bridge credit facility with two institutional lenders in order to pay a portion of the purchase price of Digital Insight. This bridge facility accrued interest at a rate of 5.77%. On March 12, 2007 we retired this bridge credit facility with the proceeds of our issuance of $1 billion in long term senior unsecured notes. We issued $500 million of 5.40% senior unsecured notes due on March 15, 2012 (the 2012 Notes) and $500 million of 5.75% senior unsecured notes due on March 15, 2017 (the 2017 Notes). The 2012 Notes and the 2017 Notes are redeemable by Intuit at any time, subject to a make whole premium. The 2012 Notes and the 2017 Notes include covenants that limit our ability to grant liens on our facilities and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions, subject to significant allowances. Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility On March 22, 2007 we entered into an agreement with certain institutional lenders for a $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire on March 22, 2012. Advances under the credit facility will accrue interest at rates that are equal to, at our election, either Citibanks base rate or the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin that ranges from 0.18% to 0.575% based on our senior debt credit ratings. The applicable interest rate will be increased by 0.05% for any period in which the total principal amount of advances and letters of credit under the credit facility exceeds $250 million. The agreement includes covenants that require us to maintain a ratio of total debt to annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of not greater than 3.25 to 1.00 and a ratio of annual EBITDA to interest payable of not less than 3.00 to 1.00. We may use amounts borrowed under this credit facility for general corporate purposes or for future acquisitions or expansion of our business. To date we have not borrowed under the credit facility, but we may borrow under the credit facility from time to time as opportunities and needs arise. See Note 9 to the financial statements in Item 8. Loans to Officers Outstanding loans to officers totaled $8.9 million at July 31, 2007 and July 31, 2006. Loans to officers at July 31, 2007 were relocation loans secured by real property with original terms of 10 years. Of the total loans at July 31, 2007, $4.4 million accrue no interest for the term of the note. The remaining loans at that date accrue interest at rates equal to applicable federal rates in effect at the time the loans were made. At July 31, 2007 no loans were in default and all interest payments were current in accordance with the terms of the loan agreements. All of the loans were approved by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors, which consists solely of independent directors. Consistent with the requirements of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, no loans to officers have been made or modified since July 30, 2002 and we do not intend to make or modify loans to officers in the future. See Note 16 to the financial statements in Item 8. 52 Table of Contents Other We evaluate, on an ongoing basis, the merits of acquiring technology or businesses, or establishing strategic relationships with and investing in other companies. We may decide to use cash and cash equivalents, investments, and the revolving line of credit facility described above to fund such activities in the future. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, contractual obligations, commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for at least the next 12 months. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At July 31, 2007, we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S K. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our known contractual obligations to make future payments at July 31, 2007: Payments Due by Period Less than 1 3 3 5 More than (In millions) 1 year years years 5 years Total Amounts due under executive deferred compensation plan $ 35.9 $ $ $ $ 35.9 Senior unsecured notes 500.0 500.0 1,000.0 Capital lease obligations 0.9 1.4 0.2 2.5 Interest and fees due on long term obligations 56.3 112.5 112.4 143.8 425.0 Purchase obligations (1) 39.4 53.3 4.3 0.5 97.5 Operating leases (2) 43.9 98.5 84.7 155.6 382.7 Other obligations 2.9 1.8 0.1 4.8 Total contractual obligations $ 179.3 $ 267.5 $ 701.7 $ 799.9 $ 1,948.4 (1) Represents agreements to purchase products and services that are enforceable, legally binding and specify terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the payments. (2) Includes our lease on Woodland Hills, California office space that is currently under construction by the landlord. See Item 2, Properties. Innovative Merchant Solutions Loan and Buyout Commitments In April 2005 our wholly owned subsidiary, Innovative Merchant Solutions (IMS), became a member of Superior Bankcard Services, LLC (SBS), a newly formed entity that acquires merchant accounts for IMS. Our consolidated financial statements include the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of SBS, after elimination of all significant intercompany balances and transactions, including amounts outstanding under the credit agreement described below. See Note 1 to the financial statements in Item 8. In connection with the formation of this entity IMS agreed to provide to SBS revolving loans in an amount of up to $24.5 million under the terms of a credit agreement. In June 2006 IMS entered into an amendment to the credit agreement to increase the amount of funds IMS may loan under that agreement to $40.0 million. The credit agreement expires in July 2013, although certain events, such as a sale of SBS, can trigger earlier termination. Amounts outstanding under the agreement at July 31, 2007 totaled $11.2 million at an interest rate of 9.25%. There are no scheduled repayments on the outstanding loan 53 Table of Contents balance. All unpaid principal amounts and the related accrued interest are due and payable in full at the loan expiration date. The operating agreement of SBS requires that, no later than July 2009, either IMS agree to purchase the minority members interests in SBS at a price to be set by negotiation or arbitration, or IMS and the minority members pursue a sale of their interests in SBS to a third party. Recent Accounting Pronouncements FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes In June 2006 the FASB issued Financial Interpretation No. (FIN) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. It also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, which means that it will be effective for our fiscal year beginning August 1, 2007. We are in the process of evaluating this guidance and therefore have not yet determined the impact that the adoption of FIN 48 will have on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. SFAS 157, Fair Value Measurements In September 2006 the FASB issued SFAS 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS 157 provides enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. The standard also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. SFAS 157 applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value. This standard does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, which means that it will be effective for our fiscal year beginning August 1, 2008. We are in the process of evaluating this standard and therefore have not yet determined the impact that the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. SFAS 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities In February 2007 the FASB issued SFAS 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. SFAS 159 provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The standards objective is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently. The standard requires companies to provide additional information that will help investors and other users of financial statements to more easily understand the effect of the companys choice to use fair value on its earnings. It also requires companies to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the company has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet. The new standard does not eliminate disclosure requirements included in other accounting standards, including requirements for disclosures about fair value measurements included in SFAS 157, Fair Value Measurements, and SFAS 107, Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, which means that it will be effective for our fiscal year beginning August 1, 2008. We are in the process of evaluating this standard and therefore have not yet determined the impact that the adoption of SFAS 159 will have on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 54 Table of Contents ITEM 7AQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Investment Portfolio We do not hold derivative financial instruments in our portfolio of investments and funds held for payroll customers. Our investments and funds held for payroll customers consist of instruments that meet quality standards consistent with our investment policy. This policy specifies that, except for direct obligations of the United States government, securities issued by agencies of the United States government, and money market or cash management funds, we diversify our holdings by limiting our investments and funds held for payroll customers with any individual issuer. The following table presents our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments as of July 31, 2007 by stated maturity. The table is classified by the original maturity date listed on the security and includes cash equivalents and investments that are part of funds held for payroll customers on our balance sheet. Cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds. Approximately 94% of our available for sale debt securities have an interest reset date, put date or mandatory call date within one year. At July 31, 2007, the weighted average interest rate earned on our money market accounts was 5.52% and the weighted average tax adjusted interest rate earned on our investments was 6.20%. Years Ending July 31, 2013 and (In thousands) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Cash equivalents $ 538,217 $ $ $ $ $ $ 538,217 Investments 159,488 25,808 14,700 11,050 9,300 828,124 1,048,470 Total $ 697,705 $ 25,808 $ 14,700 $ 11,050 $ 9,300 $ 828,124 $ 1,586,687 Interest Rate Risk Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of investments and funds held for payroll customers are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents, investments and funds held for payroll customers and the value of those investments. Should the Federal Reserve Target Rate increase by 10% or about 53 basis points from the level of July 31, 2007, the value of our investments and funds held for payroll customers would decline by approximately $1.0 million. Should interest rates increase by 100 basis points from the level of July 31, 2007, the value of our investments and funds held for payroll customers would decline by approximately $1.9 million. We are also exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates as they affect our $500 million revolving credit facility. Advances under the credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to Citibanks base rate or the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin that ranges from 0.18% to 0.575% based on our senior debt credit ratings. Consequently, our interest expense would fluctuate with changes in the general level of these interest rates if we were to borrow any amounts under the credit facility. At July 31, 2007, no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. In connection with our acquisition of Digital Insight, on March 12, 2007 we issued $500 million of 5.40% senior unsecured notes due on March 15, 2012 and $500 million of 5.75% senior unsecured notes due on March 15, 2017. Since these senior notes bear interest at fixed rates, they are not subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Impact of Foreign Currency Rate Changes The functional currency of our international operating subsidiaries is the local currency. Assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue, costs and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange in effect during the period. We report translation gains and losses as a 55 Table of Contents separate component of stockholders equity. We include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in our statements of operations. Since we translate foreign currencies (primarily Canadian dollars, British pounds and Indian rupees) into U.S dollars for financial reporting purposes, currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results. The historical impact of currency fluctuations has generally been immaterial. We believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not significant primarily because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies. Although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial in the past and we believe that for the reasons cited above currency fluctuations will not be significant in the future, there can be no guarantee that the impact of currency fluctuations will not be material in the future. As of July 31, 2007 we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities. 56 Table of Contents
