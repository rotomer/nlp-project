ITEM 7 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MDA) includes the following sections: Executive Overview that discusses at a high level our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments underlying our financial statements. Results of Operations that includes a more detailed discussion of our revenue and expenses. Liquidity and Capital Resources which discusses key aspects of our statements of cash flows, changes in our balance sheets and our financial commitments. You should note that this MDA discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Please see the section entitled Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors at the beginning of Item 1A for important information to consider when evaluating such statements. You should read this MDA in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes in Item 8. In February 2007 we completed the acquisition of Digital Insight Corporation (Digital Insight) for a total purchase price of approximately $1.34 billion. In December 2007 we acquired Homestead Technologies Inc. (Homestead) for total consideration of approximately $170 million and in February 2008 we acquired Electronic Clearing House, Inc. (ECHO) for a total purchase price of approximately $131 million. Accordingly, we have included the results of operations for these companies in our consolidated results of operations from their respective dates of acquisition. During fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2008 we transitioned certain outsourced payroll customers in connection with a sale of assets to Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP). We have also reclassified our financial statements for all periods presented to reflect our Intuit Information Technology Solutions and Intuit Distribution Management Solutions businesses as discontinued operations. See Results of Operations Dispositions and Discontinued Operations later in this Item 7 for more information. Unless otherwise noted, the following discussion pertains only to our continuing operations. Executive Overview This overview provides a high level discussion of our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business. We believe that an understanding of these trends is important in order to understand our financial results for fiscal 2008 as well as our future prospects. This summary is not intended to be exhaustive, nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Overview of Financial Results Total net revenue for fiscal 2008 was $3.1 billion, up 15% compared with fiscal 2007. The fiscal 2008 revenue increase was driven by our acquisition of Digital Insight and revenue growth in our Consumer Tax segment. Excluding the impact of our acquisitions of Digital Insight, Homestead, and ECHO and the transition of certain outsourced payroll customers in connection with a sale of assets to ADP, we estimate that total net revenue for fiscal 2008 would have increased 11% compared with fiscal 2007. Operating income from continuing operations of $650.8 million for fiscal 2008 increased 2% compared with $637.6 million for fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2008 revenue growth was almost completely offset by higher costs of revenue and higher operating expenses. Higher costs and expenses in fiscal 2008 reflect our acquisition of Digital Insight, which has a higher cost structure than our other businesses; higher costs of revenue associated with revenue growth in our other segments; increased investment in research and development for new and existing offerings; and increases in advertising and other marketing spending to support our Consumer Tax offerings. In addition, share based compensation expense increased approximately $37 million in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007, and we recorded a $23 million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 in connection with a reallocation of resources to key growth businesses. The effects of these factors are described in more detail under Cost of Revenue and Operating Expenses below. 37 Table of Contents Net income from continuing operations of $450.8 million for fiscal 2008 increased 2% compared with $443.5 million for fiscal 2007 and diluted net income per share from continuing operations of $1.33 for fiscal 2008 increased 6% compared with $1.25 for fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2008 we incurred interest expense of $52.3 million, compared with $27.1 million in fiscal 2007. Interest expense for both periods related primarily to the senior notes we issued in March 2007. We also recorded a pre tax gain of $51.6 million on the sale of certain outsourced payroll assets to ADP in fiscal 2008, compared with $31.7 million in fiscal 2007. Our effective tax rates for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 were approximately 35% and 36%. Average shares outstanding declined during fiscal 2008 as a result of repurchases of 27.2 million shares of common stock under our stock repurchase programs, partially offset by the issuance of 10.6 million shares in connection with our employee stock plans. In August 2007 we sold our Intuit Distribution Management Solutions (IDMS) business for approximately $100 million in cash and recorded a net gain on disposal of $27.5 million. IDMS was part of our Other Businesses segment. We have accounted for IDMS as a discontinued operation and segregated the operating results of IDMS from continuing operations for all periods presented. In December 2007 we acquired Homestead Technologies Inc. for total consideration of approximately $170 million on a fully diluted basis. Homestead is a provider of Web site design and hosting services to small businesses and became part of our QuickBooks segment. In February 2008 we acquired Electronic Clearing House, Inc. for a total purchase price of approximately $131 million in cash. ECHO is a provider of electronic payment processing services to small businesses and became part of our Payroll and Payments segment. During the third quarter of fiscal 2008 we completed the transition of certain outsourced payroll customers in connection with a sale of assets to ADP. See Non Operating Income and Expenses Dispositions and Discontinued Operations later in this Item 7 for more information. We ended fiscal 2008 with cash, cash equivalents and investments totaling $827.8 million, a decrease of $475.9 million from July 31, 2007. This decrease was due in part to the reclassification of $285.3 million in municipal auction rate securities to long term investments during fiscal 2008. See Liquidity and Capital Resources Auction Rate Securities, later in this Item 7 for more information. In fiscal 2008 we generated $830.2 million in cash from continuing operations, $347.9 million from sales of investments, $194.7 million from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans, and $97.1 million from the sale of our IDMS business. During the same period we used $800 million in cash for the repurchase of shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, $306.1 million for capital expenditures, and $264.5 million for acquisitions of businesses, including Homestead and ECHO. At July 31, 2008, we had authorization from our Board to expend up to $600 million for stock repurchases through May 15, 2011. Seasonality Our QuickBooks, Consumer Tax and Accounting Professionals businesses are highly seasonal. Some of our other offerings are also seasonal, but to a lesser extent. Revenue from our QuickBooks software products tends to be highest during our second and third fiscal quarters, although the timing of new product releases or changes in our offerings can materially shift revenue between quarters. Sales of income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from November through April. In our Consumer Tax business, a greater proportion of our revenue has been occurring later in this seasonal period due in part to the growth in sales of TurboTax Online, for which revenue is recognized upon printing or electronic filing of a tax return. The seasonality of our Consumer Tax and Accounting Professionals revenue is also affected by the timing of the availability of tax forms from taxing agencies and the ability of those agencies to receive electronic tax return submissions. Delays in the availability of tax forms or the ability of taxing agencies to receive submissions can cause revenue to shift from our second fiscal quarter to our third fiscal quarter. These seasonal patterns mean that our total net revenue is usually highest during our second quarter ending January 31 and third quarter ending April 30. We typically report losses in our first quarter ending October 31 and fourth quarter ending July 31, when revenue from our tax businesses is minimal while operating expenses continue at relatively consistent levels. We believe the seasonality of our revenue is likely to continue in the future. 38 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates In preparing our financial statements, we make estimates, assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue, operating income or loss and net income or loss, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Senior management has reviewed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and their disclosure in this Annual Report on Form 10 K with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition We derive revenue from the sale of packaged software products, license fees, software subscriptions, product support, hosting services, payroll services, merchant services, professional services, transaction fees and multiple element arrangements that may include any combination of these items. We follow the appropriate revenue recognition rules for each type of revenue. For additional information, see Revenue Recognition in Note 1 to the financial statements in Item 8. We generally recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable. However, determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report. For example, for multiple element arrangements we must make assumptions and judgments in order to allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver, to determine whether undelivered services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services, to determine whether vendor specific evidence of fair value exists for each undelivered element and to determine whether and when each element has been delivered. If we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments, it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period. Amounts for fees collected or invoiced and due relating to arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized when the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied. In connection with the sale of certain products, we provide a limited amount of free technical support assistance to customers. We do not defer the recognition of any revenue associated with sales of these products since the cost of providing this free technical support is insignificant. The technical support is generally provided within one year after the associated revenue is recognized and free product enhancements are minimal and infrequent. We accrue the estimated cost of providing this free support upon product shipment. Return and Rebate Reserves As part of our revenue recognition policy, we estimate future product returns and rebate payments and establish reserves against revenue at the time of sale based on these estimates. Our return policy allows distributors and retailers, subject to contractual limitations, to return purchased products. Product returns by distributors and retailers relate primarily to the return of excess and obsolete products. In determining our product returns reserves, we consider the volume and price mix of products in the retail channel, historical return rates for prior releases of the product, trends in retailer inventory and economic trends that might impact customer demand for our products (including the competitive environment and the timing of new releases of our products). We fully reserve for excess and obsolete products in the distribution channels. Our rebate reserves include distributor and retailer sales incentive rebates and end user rebates. Our estimated reserves for distributor and retailer incentive rebates are based on distributors and retailers actual performance against the terms and conditions of rebate programs, which we typically establish annually. Our reserves for end user rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the specific promotional rebate program, actual sales during the promotion and historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program. In the past, actual returns and rebates have not differed significantly from the reserves that we have established. However, actual returns and rebates in any future period are inherently uncertain. If we were to change our assumptions and estimates, our revenue reserves would change, which would impact the net revenue we report. If actual returns and rebates are significantly greater than the reserves we have established, the actual results would decrease our future reported revenue. Conversely, if actual returns and rebates are significantly less than our 39 Table of Contents reserves, this would increase our future reported revenue. For example, if we had increased our fiscal 2008 returns reserves by 1% of non consignment sales to retailers for QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken, our total net revenue for fiscal 2008 would have been $3.0 million lower. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We make ongoing assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable. The accounts receivable amount on our balance sheet includes a reserve for accounts that might not be paid. In determining the amount of the reserve, we consider our historical level of credit losses. We also make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations, and we assess current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future. Our reserves have generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses. However, since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, we cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be adequate. If actual credit losses are significantly greater than the reserve we have established, that would increase our general and administrative expenses and reduce our reported net income. Conversely, if actual credit losses are significantly less than our reserve, this would eventually decrease our general and administrative expenses and increase our reported net income. Business Combinations Purchase Accounting Under the purchase method of accounting, we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. We record the excess of purchase price over the aggregate fair values as goodwill. We engage third party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. These valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing purchased technology, customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets. If the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, we could experience impairment charges. In addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. If our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed. Goodwill, Purchased Intangible Assets and Other Long Lived Assets Impairment Assessments We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than temporary impairment in the remaining value of the assets recorded on our balance sheet may exist. We test the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise. The timing of the formal annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods. In order to estimate the fair value of long lived assets, we typically make various assumptions about the future prospects for the business that the asset relates to, consider market factors specific to that business and estimate future cash flows to be generated by that business. We evaluate cash flows at the lowest operating level and the number of reporting units that we have identified may make impairment more probable than it would be at a company with fewer reporting units and integrated operations following acquisitions. Based on these assumptions and estimates, we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset stated on our balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results. More conservative estimates of the anticipated future benefits from these businesses could result in impairment charges, which would decrease net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet. Conversely, less conservative estimates could result in smaller or no impairment charges, higher net income and higher asset values. At July 31, 2008, we had $1.7 billion in goodwill and $273.1 million in net purchased intangible assets on our balance sheet. 40 Table of Contents Accounting for Share Based Compensation Plans We account for share based compensation using the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123(R), Share Based Payment. At July 31, 2008, there was $221.5 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested share based compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans which we will amortize to expense in the future. Total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures. We expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average vesting period of 2.2 years. We use a lattice binomial model and the assumptions shown in Note 12 to the financial statements in Item 8 to estimate the fair value of stock options granted. We estimate the expected term of options granted based on implied exercise patterns using a binomial model. We estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the implied volatility of publicly traded one year and two year options on our common stock, consistent with SFAS 123(R) and Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107. Our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. We base the risk free interest rate that we use in our option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on constant maturity U.S. Treasury issues with equivalent remaining terms. We have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we use an expected dividend yield of zero in our option valuation model. In accordance with SFAS 123(R), we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. We amortize the fair value of options on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods. We may elect to use different assumptions under our option valuation model in the future, which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share. We value restricted stock units using the intrinsic value method. We amortize the value of restricted stock units on a straight line basis over the restriction period. Legal Contingencies We are subject to certain legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business. We review the status of each significant matter quarterly and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability and an expense for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our accruals are based on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Potential legal liabilities and the revision of estimates of potential legal liabilities could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. Income Taxes Estimates of Effective Tax Rates, Deferred Taxes and Valuation Allowance When we prepare our financial statements, we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing jurisdiction. We estimate our current tax liability and assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which we show on our balance sheet. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized. To the extent we believe that realization is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. When we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period, we record a corresponding tax expense in our statement of operations. Our net deferred tax asset at July 31, 2008 was $154.2 million and we had no valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets at that date. While we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we could in the future be required to record a valuation allowance to take into account deferred tax assets 41 Table of Contents that we may be unable to realize. An increase in a valuation allowance would have an adverse impact, which could be material, on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we record the increase. We adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 on August 1, 2007. See Note 11 to the financial statements in Item 8. As a result of our adoption of FIN 48 we recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, using a two step approach. The first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. We evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. Our evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues. Changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change, which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results. Results of Operations Financial Overview Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal 2008 2007 2007 2006 (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2008 2007 2006 % Change % Change Total net revenue $ 3,071.0 $ 2,672.9 $ 2,293.0 15 % 17 % Operating income from continuing operations 650.8 637.6 565.6 2 % 13 % Net income from continuing operations 450.8 443.5 381.0 2 % 16 % Diluted net income per share from continuing operations $ 1.33 $ 1.25 $ 1.06 6 % 18 % Total net revenue increased $398.1 million or 15% in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. Total net revenue was higher in fiscal 2008 due to our February 2007 acquisition of Digital Insight, to revenue growth in our Consumer Tax segment and, to a lesser extent, to revenue growth in our QuickBooks segment and our Payroll and Payments segment. Revenue from our Financial Institutions segment, which includes Digital Insight, was $298.6 million in fiscal 2008 compared with $150.4 million in fiscal 2007. Consumer Tax revenue increased $116.5 million or 14% in fiscal 2008 due to growth in TurboTax online units. Revenue in our QuickBooks segment was up $35.6 million or 6% in fiscal 2008 and Payroll and Payments revenue increased $44.1 million or 9% compared with fiscal 2007. Payroll and Payments segment revenue for fiscal 2008 increased 14% when adjusted for our acquisition of ECHO and the transition of certain outsourced payroll customers in connection with a sale of assets to ADP. See Total Net Revenue by Business Segment below for more information. Higher revenue in fiscal 2008 was almost completely offset by higher costs and expenses, including those of Digital Insight, which are relatively higher as a percentage of revenue than the costs and expenses for our other businesses. In addition, share based compensation expense increased approximately $37 million in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007, and we recorded a $23 million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 in connection with a reallocation of resources to key growth businesses. Including Digital Insight, share based compensation expense and these restructuring charges, increases in costs and expenses for fiscal 2008 were approximately $90 million for cost of revenue, approximately $133 million for product development expenses, approximately $117 million for selling and marketing expenses, and approximately $41 million for the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition related charges. See Cost of Revenue and Operating Expenses below for more information. 42 Table of Contents Net income from continuing operations increased 2% to $450.8 million in fiscal 2008 compared with $443.5 million in fiscal 2007 and diluted net income per share from continuing operations increased 6% to $1.33 in fiscal 2008 compared with $1.25 in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2008 we incurred interest expense of $52.3 million, compared with $27.1 million in fiscal 2007. Interest expense for both periods related primarily to the senior notes we issued in March 2007. We also recorded a pre tax gain of $51.6 million on the sale of certain outsourced payroll assets to ADP in fiscal 2008, compared with $31.7 million in fiscal 2007. Our effective tax rates for fiscal 2008 and 2007 were approximately 35% and 36%. See Income Taxes later in this Item 7 for more information. Average shares outstanding declined during fiscal 2008 as a result of repurchases of 27.2 million shares of common stock under our stock repurchase programs, partially offset by the issuance of 10.6 million shares in connection with our employee stock plans. Total Net Revenue by Business Segment The table below and the discussion of total net revenue that follows it are organized in accordance with our six reportable business segments. See Note 8 to the financial statements in Item 8 for descriptions of product revenue and service and other revenue for each segment. We have reclassified segment results for all periods presented to reflect changes that align our product groups more closely with the customers they serve. We transferred QuickBooks Premier Accountant Edition and ProAdvisor Program product revenue from our QuickBooks segment to our Professional Tax segment and renamed that segment Accounting Professionals. Revenue from these products was $31.5 million in fiscal 2008, $22.5 million in fiscal 2007 and $20.0 million in fiscal 2006. We also transferred QuickBase service revenue from our Other Businesses segment to our QuickBooks segment. QuickBase revenue was $15.6 million in fiscal 2008, $10.5 million in fiscal 2007 and $7.1 million in fiscal 2006. 43 Table of Contents % Total % Total % Total Fiscal Net Fiscal Net Fiscal Net 2008 2007 2007 2006 (Dollars in millions) 2008 Revenue 2007 Revenue 2006 Revenue % Change % Change QuickBooks Product revenue $ 471.8 $ 484.9 $ 446.2 Service and other revenue 150.0 101.3 79.8 Subtotal 621.8 20 % 586.2 22 % 526.0 23 % 6 % 11 % Payroll and Payments Product revenue 219.3 208.9 194.1 Service and other revenue 341.5 307.8 268.0 Subtotal 560.8 18 % 516.7 19 % 462.1 20 % 9 % 12 % Consumer Tax Product revenue 311.6 300.7 265.8 Service and other revenue 617.8 512.2 440.3 Subtotal 929.4 30 % 812.9 30 % 706.1 31 % 14 % 15 % Accounting Professionals Product revenue 301.5 283.8 265.0 Service and other revenue 25.2 30.4 27.9 Subtotal 326.7 11 % 314.2 12 % 292.9 13 % 4 % 7 % Financial Institutions Product revenue 0.8 0.2 0.2 Service and other revenue 297.8 150.2 24.2 Subtotal 298.6 10 % 150.4 6 % 24.4 1 % 99 % 516 % Other Businesses Product revenue 191.7 168.9 164.1 Service and other revenue 142.0 123.6 117.4 Subtotal 333.7 11 % 292.5 11 % 281.5 12 % 14 % 4 % Total Company Product revenue 1,496.7 1,447.4 1,335.4 Service and other revenue 1,574.3 1,225.5 957.6 Total net revenue $ 3,071.0 100 % $ 2,672.9 100 % $ 2,293.0 100 % 15 % 17 % QuickBooks Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007. QuickBooks segment total net revenue increased $35.6 million or 6% in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. Excluding about $15 million in revenue from Homestead, which we acquired in December 2007, QuickBooks segment total net revenue increased 4% in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. Total QuickBooks software unit sales, including activations of our free Simple Start offering, were up slightly in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. Revenue growth in fiscal 2008 was driven by a 14% increase in QuickBooks 44 Table of Contents Online subscribers, a 22% increase in the number of active QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions customers, and 8% growth in revenue from secondary products and services sold in conjunction with QuickBooks software units. Fiscal 2007 Compared with Fiscal 2006. QuickBooks segment total net revenue increased $60.2 million or 11% in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006. Total QuickBooks software unit sales were 10% higher in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 due in part to new promotions, including our first ever QuickBooks television advertisements. Revenue growth in fiscal 2007 was also driven by favorable product mix, with QuickBooks Premier units increasing 25% compared with fiscal 2006. Payroll and Payments Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007. Payroll and Payments total net revenue increased $44.1 million or 9% in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. In our Payments business, revenue increased 33% in fiscal 2008 due to 18% growth in our core merchant services customer base and about $16 million in revenue from ECHO, which we acquired in February 2008. Payroll revenue decreased 3% in fiscal 2008 as we completed the transition of portions of our Complete Payroll and Premier Payroll Services customer base in connection with a sale of assets to ADP. We estimate that revenue growth in our Payroll and Payments segment in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 would have been approximately 14% when adjusted for the impact of our acquisition of ECHO and the sale of those payroll customers. Fiscal 2007 Compared with Fiscal 2006. Payroll and Payments total net revenue increased $54.6 million or 12% in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006. In our Payments business, revenue increased 36% in fiscal 2007 due to 22% growth in the customer base and 9% higher transaction volume per customer. Merchant services revenue slowed in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 due to new customer acquisition remaining relatively constant on a larger customer base. Payroll revenue grew 3% in fiscal 2007 due to 4% growth in the customer base and, to a lesser extent, to favorable product mix that resulted in higher revenue per customer. We estimate that revenue growth in our Payroll and Payments segment in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 would have been approximately 16% when adjusted for the impact of the sale of certain payroll customers to ADP. Consumer Tax Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007. Consumer Tax total net revenue increased $116.5 million or 14% in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. The fiscal 2008 revenue increase was due to 17% growth in total federal TurboTax units, which was driven by 37% growth in TurboTax Online units. We believe that the continuing trend among individual taxpayers toward the use of software, rather than manual methods, to prepare their own income tax returns will continue to be important to the growth of our Consumer Tax business. Fiscal 2007 Compared with Fiscal 2006. Consumer Tax total net revenue increased $106.8 million or 15% in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 due to 16% growth in federal TurboTax Online units and to price increases. Consumer Tax net revenue for fiscal 2007 included the impact of approximately $9 million in refunds to customers who experienced delays in electronically preparing or filing their income tax returns on April 17, 2007. Accounting Professionals Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007. Accounting Professionals total net revenue increased $12.5 million or 4% in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. We discontinued our ProSeries Express product line in fiscal 2008, which we estimate resulted in a loss of five percentage points of growth for the Accounting Professionals segment in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2007 Compared with Fiscal 2006. Accounting Professionals total net revenue increased $21.3 million or 7% in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 due to add on product penetration and price increases. Financial Institutions Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007. Financial Institutions total net revenue increased $148.2 million to $298.6 million in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 due mainly to revenue from Digital Insight, which we acquired in February 2007. In fiscal 2008 Internet banking end users grew 10% and bill pay end users grew 16%. 45 Table of Contents Fiscal 2007 Compared with Fiscal 2006. Financial Institutions total net revenue increased $126.0 million to $150.4 million in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 due almost entirely to our February 2007 acquisition of Digital Insight. Other Businesses Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007. Other Businesses total net revenue increased $41.2 million or 14% in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2008 revenue from our businesses in Canada and the United Kingdom increased 28%, revenue from our Intuit Real Estate Solutions business grew 17%, and Quicken revenue was flat compared with fiscal 2007. The weaker U.S. dollar contributed to Canadian revenue growth, accounting for approximately five percentage points of Other Businesses segment revenue growth in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2007 Compared with Fiscal 2006. Other Businesses total net revenue increased $11.0 million or 4% in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006.

Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007. Cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue decreased to 10% in fiscal 2008 from 12% in fiscal 2007 due to cost efficiencies achieved for our QuickBooks 2008 and Consumer Tax product lines. Cost of service and other revenue as a percentage of service and other revenue increased slightly to 26% in fiscal 2008 from 25% in fiscal 2007. The impact of our acquisition of Digital Insight, which has relatively higher costs of service revenue, was partially offset by the impact of $105.6 million growth in revenue from TurboTax Online and electronic tax filing services, which have relatively lower costs of service revenue compared with our other service offerings. Amortization of purchased intangible assets increased in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 due primarily to the amortization of Digital Insight purchased intangible assets, which we acquired in February 2007. Fiscal 2007 Compared with Fiscal 2006. Cost of service and other revenue as a percentage of service and other revenue increased slightly to 25% in fiscal 2007 from 24% in fiscal 2006. The impact of our acquisition of Digital Insight, which has relatively higher costs of service revenue, was partially offset by the impact of $71.9 million growth in revenue from TurboTax Online and electronic tax filing services, which have relatively lower costs of service revenue compared with our other service offerings.

Total operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenue increased to 59% in fiscal 2008 compared with 57% in fiscal 2007. Total operating expenses in dollars increased about $270 million in fiscal 2008, approximately $109 million of which was due to our acquisitions of Digital Insight, Homestead and ECHO and approximately $37 million of which was due to higher share based compensation expense. Share based compensation expense was higher in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 due to our broad use of restricted stock units in addition to stock options. We also recorded a $23 million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 in connection with a reallocation of resources to key growth businesses. Including Digital Insight, Homestead, ECHO, share based compensation expense and the restructuring charge, about half of the increase in total operating expenses in dollars for fiscal 2008 was due to higher research and development expenses. During this period, we continued to invest in research and development for existing offerings as well as for new offerings. Almost 45% of the fiscal 2008 increase in total operating expenses in dollars was due to higher selling and marketing expenses. Of the total increase in selling and marketing expenses in dollars for this period about a third was due to our acquisition of Digital Insight, whose selling costs are relatively higher compared with our other businesses because they sell their services to financial institutions through a direct sales force. About 20% of the fiscal 2008 increase in selling and marketing expenses in dollars was due to higher advertising and other marketing expenses to support our Consumer Tax offerings. Excluding the impact of the increase in share based compensation expense, general and administrative expenses declined about $5 million in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. Acquisition related charges increased in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 primarily due to the amortization of Digital Insight purchased intangible assets, which we acquired in February 2007. Fiscal 2007 Compared with Fiscal 2006. Individually and in the aggregate, operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenue were generally consistent in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006. Total operating expenses in dollars increased about $206 million in fiscal 2007, approximately $60 million of which was due to our February 2007 acquisition of Digital Insight. Including Digital Insight, approximately 42% of the fiscal 2007 increase in total operating expenses in dollars was due to higher research and development expenses. During fiscal 2007 we continued to invest in research and development for existing offerings as well as for new offerings. Approximately 41% of the fiscal 2007 increase in total operating expenses in dollars was due to higher selling and marketing expenses that included increases in radio, television and online advertising expenses for our Consumer Tax and QuickBooks offerings as well as additional investments in direct marketing and product management. 47 Table of Contents Acquisition related charges increased in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 due to the amortization of Digital Insight purchased intangible assets, which we acquired in February 2007. Segment Operating Income (Loss) Segment operating income or loss is segment net revenue less segment cost of revenue and operating expenses. Segment expenses do not include certain costs, such as corporate selling and marketing, product development, and general and administrative expenses and share based compensation expenses, which are not allocated to specific segments. These unallocated costs totaled $561.4 million in fiscal 2008, $506.2 million in fiscal 2007 and $465.2 million in fiscal 2006. Unallocated costs increased approximately $55 million in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. This increase was due to $37 million in higher share based compensation expenses and approximately $27 million in higher expenses for shared product development and marketing functions, partially offset by a decline in corporate general and administrative expenses. Segment expenses also do not include amortization of purchased intangible assets, acquisition related charges, and impairment of goodwill and purchased intangible assets. In addition, segment expenses do not include interest expense, interest and other income, and realized net gains or losses on marketable equity securities and other investments. See Note 8 to the financial statements in Item 8 for reconciliations of total segment operating income to income from continuing operations for each fiscal year presented. % of % of % of Fiscal Related Fiscal Related Fiscal Related (Dollars in millions) 2008 Revenue 2007 Revenue 2006 Revenue QuickBooks $ 172.3 28 % $ 178.8 31 % $ 167.4 32 % Payroll and Payments 216.3 39 % 215.4 42 % 181.9 39 % Consumer Tax 594.5 64 % 508.6 63 % 467.1 66 % Accounting Professionals 162.6 50 % 154.4 49 % 136.7 47 % Financial Institutions 57.0 19 % 38.8 26 % 12.2 50 % Other Businesses 101.0 30 % 98.7 34 % 83.8 30 % Total segment operating income $ 1,303.7 42 % $ 1,194.7 45 % $ 1,049.1 46 % QuickBooks Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007. QuickBooks segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue decreased to 28% in fiscal 2008 from 31% in fiscal 2007. QuickBooks segment revenue grew $35.6 million in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007, including about $15 million in revenue from Homestead. Cost of revenue increased approximately $4 million as cost efficiencies achieved for our QuickBooks 2008 product line partially offset higher costs associated with QuickBooks services. Including Homestead, selling and marketing expenses increased approximately $18 million, product development expenses increased approximately $15 million and general and administrative expenses increased approximately $5 million in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2007 Compared with Fiscal 2006. QuickBooks segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue decreased slightly to 31% in fiscal 2007 from 32% in fiscal 2006. The $60.2 million growth in QuickBooks segment revenue in fiscal 2007 was partially offset by higher expenses, including increases of approximately $11 million for cost of revenue, approximately $16 million for selling and marketing expenses (which consisted primarily of higher radio and television advertising expenses and additional investments in direct marketing and product management) and approximately $18 million for product development expenses in fiscal 2007. Payroll and Payments Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007. Payroll and Payments segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue decreased to 39% in fiscal 2008 from 42% in fiscal 2007. Total Payroll and Payments revenue increased $44.1 million in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007, with higher merchant services revenue and about $16 million in revenue from ECHO more than offsetting lower total payroll revenue. Although merchant services 48 Table of Contents revenue has relatively higher costs of revenue than our combined payroll business, low growth in cost of revenue in the segment was achieved through our transition of certain full service payroll customers, which also have relatively higher costs of revenue, to ADP. Higher gross margins in fiscal 2008 were partially offset by higher expenses, including increases of approximately $11 million for selling and marketing expenses, approximately $17 million for product development expenses, approximately $6 million for infrastructure costs and approximately $4 million in lease termination costs. About a third of the fiscal 2008 increase in Payroll and Payments costs and expenses was associated with our acquisition of ECHO. Fiscal 2007 Compared with Fiscal 2006. Payroll and Payments segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue increased to 42% in fiscal 2007 from 39% in fiscal 2006. Most of the fiscal 2007 revenue growth in this segment came from products and services with relatively lower costs of revenue, such as QuickBooks Payroll, Assisted Payroll and merchant services. The $54.6 million higher Payroll and Payments revenue in fiscal 2007 was partially offset by higher expenses, including increases of approximately $7 million for product development expenses, approximately $5 million for selling and marketing expenses and approximately $6 million for general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2007. Consumer Tax Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007. Consumer Tax segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue increased slightly to 64% in fiscal 2008 from 63% in fiscal 2007. The $116.5 million growth in Consumer Tax revenue in fiscal 2008 was partially offset by higher expenses, including increases of approximately $25 million for selling and marketing expenses (including higher radio, television and online advertising expenses as well as higher direct marketing expenses) and approximately $12 million for product development expenses. Lower cost of revenue partially offset the increases in selling and marketing expenses and product development expenses. Fiscal 2007 Compared with Fiscal 2006. Consumer Tax segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue decreased to 63% in fiscal 2007 from 66% in fiscal 2006. The $106.8 million growth in Consumer Tax revenue in fiscal 2007 was partially offset by higher expenses, including increases of approximately $45 million for selling and marketing expenses (including higher radio, television and online advertising expenses as well as higher direct marketing expenses) and approximately $18 million for product development expenses. Accounting Professionals Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007. Accounting Professionals segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue increased slightly to 50% in fiscal 2008 from 49% in fiscal 2007. Accounting Professionals revenue increased $12.5 million while expenses were relatively stable in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2007 Compared with Fiscal 2006. Accounting Professionals segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue increased to 49% in fiscal 2007 from 47% in fiscal 2006. Accounting Professionals revenue increased $21.3 million while expenses were relatively stable in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006. Financial Institutions Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007. Financial Institutions segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue decreased to 19% in fiscal 2008 from 26% in fiscal 2007. The fiscal 2008 decrease in segment operating income was due to our February 2007 acquisition of Digital Insight, which has higher costs and expenses, including relatively higher costs of service revenue and higher selling expenses, than the Intuit financial institutions business that existed prior to the acquisition. Fiscal 2007 Compared with Fiscal 2006. Financial Institutions segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue decreased to 26% in fiscal 2007 from 50% in fiscal 2006. The fiscal 2007 decrease in segment operating income was due to our February 2007 acquisition of Digital Insight, which we combined with our existing financial institutions business to create a new Financial Institutions segment. This new segment is significantly larger and has higher costs, including relatively higher cost of service revenue and higher selling expenses, than the Intuit financial institutions business that preceded it. 49 Table of Contents Other Businesses Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007. Other Businesses segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue decreased to 30% in fiscal 2008 from 34% in fiscal 2007. About a quarter of the $41.2 million in fiscal 2008 revenue growth in this segment came from our Intuit Real Estate Solutions business, which sells its products and services through a direct sales force and therefore has a higher cost structure than the other businesses in this segment. While revenue from our business in Canada was higher in fiscal 2008 due in part to the weaker U.S. dollar, total costs and expenses for this business also increased due to the impact of foreign exchange rates. In addition, fiscal 2008 selling and marketing expenses in our business in Canada increased in support of our latest QuickBooks and consumer tax offerings. Fiscal 2007 Compared with Fiscal 2006. Other Businesses segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue increased to 34% in fiscal 2007 from 30% in fiscal 2006. The fiscal 2007 improvement in segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue was due to the May 2006 sale of our MasterBuilder business, which had relatively low operating margins. Non Operating Income and Expenses Interest Expense In March 2007 we issued $1 billion in senior notes to finance a portion of our February 2007 acquisition of Digital Insight and to fund our operations. Interest expense of $52.3 million for fiscal 2008 and $27.1 million for fiscal 2007 consisted primarily of interest on $500 million in principal amount of the senior notes at 5.40% and interest on $500 million in principal amount of the senior notes at 5.75%. The senior notes are due in March 2012 and March 2017 and are redeemable by Intuit at any time, subject to a make whole premium.

Lower interest rates and lower average invested balances resulted in lower interest income in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. Higher interest rates and higher average invested balances resulted in higher interest income in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006. Total interest and other income for all periods presented included royalties and fees from trademark license and distribution agreements that we entered into when we sold our Quicken Loans mortgage business in July 2002. 50 Table of Contents Income Taxes Effective Tax Rate Our effective tax rate was approximately 35% for fiscal 2008, approximately 36% for fiscal 2007 and approximately 38% for fiscal 2006. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 did not differ significantly from the federal statutory rate. State income taxes were offset primarily by the benefit we received from tax exempt interest income, the domestic production activities deduction, and federal and state research and experimental credits. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 differed from the federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to state income taxes, which were partially offset by the benefit we received from tax exempt interest income, federal and state research and experimental credits and the domestic production activities deduction. In addition, in fiscal 2007 we benefited from the retroactive extension of the federal research and experimental credit as it related to fiscal 2006. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 differed from the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to state income taxes and the taxable gain on the sale of our Master Builder business, which were partially offset by the benefit we received from tax exempt interest income, federal and state research and experimental credits and the domestic production activities deduction. See Note 11 to the financial statements in Item 8 for more information. In December 2006 the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 was signed into law. The Act included a reinstatement of the federal research and experimental credit through December 31, 2007 that was retroactive to January 1, 2006. We recorded a discrete tax benefit of $3.7 million for the retroactive amount related to fiscal 2006 during fiscal 2007. Tax Carryforwards We acquired Electronic Clearing House and Homestead in fiscal 2008 and Digital Insight in fiscal 2007. See Note 6 to the financial statements in Item 8. These companies had federal net operating loss carryforwards at their respective dates of acquisition that totaled approximately $164 million. We have recorded the tax effects of these carryforwards and other federal tax credit carryforwards, which together totaled approximately $66 million, as deferred tax assets at the respective dates of acquisition. The carryforwards do not result in an income tax provision benefit, but they reduce income taxes payable and cash paid for income taxes as we utilize them. At July 31, 2008, we had total federal net operating loss carryforwards of $95.0 million that will expire starting in fiscal 2019. Net Deferred Tax Assets At July 31, 2008, we had net deferred tax assets of $154.2 million and no valuation allowance. While we believe no valuation allowance was appropriate at that date, it may be necessary to record a valuation allowance if it becomes more likely that we will not realize some portion of the net deferred tax assets. We assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. The assessment is based on our estimates of future sources of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the periods over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable. See Note 11 to the financial statements in Item 8 for more information. Dispositions and Discontinued Operations During fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 we sold the assets and businesses described below. See Note 7 to the financial statements in Item 8 for a more complete description of these dispositions and discontinued operations and for a summary of the impact that discontinued operations have had on our statements of operations for those fiscal years. Intuit Distribution Management Solutions Discontinued Operations In August 2007 we sold our Intuit Distribution Management Solutions (IDMS) business for approximately $100 million in cash and recorded a net gain on disposal of $27.5 million. IDMS was part of our Other Businesses segment. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long lived Assets, we have accounted for IDMS as a discontinued operation and segregated its operating results from continuing operations in our statements of operations for all periods prior to the sale. Revenue from IDMS was $1.9 million in fiscal 2008, $52.0 million in fiscal 2007 and $49.3 million in fiscal 2006. 51 Table of Contents Sale of Outsourced Payroll Assets In March 2007 we sold certain assets related to our Complete Payroll and Premier Payroll Service businesses to ADP for a purchase price of up to approximately $135 million in cash. The final purchase price was contingent upon the number of customers that transitioned to ADP pursuant to the purchase agreement over a period of approximately one year from the date of sale. We recorded pre tax gains of $51.6 million in fiscal 2008 and $31.7 million in fiscal 2007 in our statement of operations for customers who transitioned to ADP during those periods. We received a total purchase price of $93.6 million and recorded a total pre tax gain of $83.2 million from the inception of this transaction through its completion in the third quarter of fiscal 2008. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 144, we did not account for this transaction as a discontinued operation. The assets were part of our Payroll and Payments segment. Intuit Information Technology Solutions Discontinued Operations In December 2005 we sold our Intuit Information Technology Solutions (ITS) business for approximately $200 million in cash and recorded a net gain on disposal of $34.3 million. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 144, we have accounted for ITS as a discontinued operation and segregated its operating results from continuing operations in our statements of operations for all periods prior to the sale. Revenue from ITS was $20.2 million in fiscal 2006. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview At July 31, 2008, our cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $827.8 million, a decrease of $475.9 million from July 31, 2007. This decrease was due to the reclassification of $285.3 million in municipal auction rate securities to long term investments (see Auction Rate Securities below) and to the factors described in Statements of Cash Flows below. Our primary source of liquidity has been cash from operations, which entails the collection of accounts receivable for products and services. Our primary uses of cash have been for research and development programs, selling and marketing activities, capital projects, debt service costs, repurchases of common stock and acquisitions of businesses. In March 2007 we issued five year and ten year senior unsecured notes totaling $1 billion. We also have a $500 million unsecured revolving line of credit facility that is described later in this Item 7. To date we have not borrowed under the facility. The following table summarizes selected measures of our liquidity and capital resources at the dates indicated: July 31, July 31, $ % (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 Change Change Cash, cash equivalents and investments $ 827.8 $ 1,303.7 $ (475.9 ) (37 %) Long term investments 288.3 288.3 NM Long term debt 998.0 997.8 0.2 0 % Working capital 306.3 791.8 (485.5 ) (61 %) Ratio of current assets to current liabilities 1.2 : 1 1.7 : 1 NM Not Meaningful Auction Rate Securities At July 31, 2008, we held $285.3 million in municipal auction rate securities. These securities are collateralized long term debt instruments that provide liquidity through a Dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined intervals, typically every 35 days. Due to a decrease in liquidity in the global credit markets, in February 2008 auctions began failing for the municipal auction rate securities we held. Regularly scheduled 52 Table of Contents auctions for these securities have generally continued to fail since that time. When these auctions initially failed, higher interest rates for many of the securities went into effect. Of the total auction rate securities we held at July 31, 2008, the underlying assets of $220.7 million or 77% were student loans which are guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Education and $241.2 million or 85% were rated AAA/Aaa by the major credit rating agencies. We estimated the fair values of the municipal auction rate securities we held at July 31, 2008 based on valuation reports from third parties and a discounted cash flow model that we prepared. Using the valuation reports from third parties and our discounted cash flow model we determined that the fair values of the municipal auction rate securities we held at July 31, 2008 were substantially equal to their par values. As a result, we recorded no decrease in the fair values of those securities for the twelve months then ended. Based on our ability and intent to hold these auction rate securities until liquidity returned to the market or they matured, we classified them as long term investments on our balance sheet at July 31, 2008. In August 2008 the broker dealers for our auction rate securities announced settlements under which they may provide liquidity solutions for, or purchase, the auction rate securities held by their institutional clients. Details of the agreements are still being finalized. Based on our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash, we do not believe that the reduction in liquidity of our municipal auction rate securities will have a material impact on our overall ability to meet our liquidity needs. Statements of Cash Flows The following table summarizes selected items from our statements of cash flows for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006. See the financial statements in Item 8 for complete statements of cash flows for those periods.

This included net income from continuing operations of $477.5 million, adjustments for depreciation and amortization of $216.5 million, and an adjustment for share based compensation of $113.3 million. Depreciation expense increased in fiscal 2008 53 Table of Contents compared with fiscal 2007 due in part to the amortization of leasehold improvements for new office facilities that we occupied in early fiscal 2008. Amortization expense increased in the same period primarily due to our February 2007 acquisition of Digital Insight. Share based compensation increased in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 due to our broad use of restricted stock units in addition to stock options. During fiscal 2007 we generated $726.8 million in cash from our continuing operations. This included net income from continuing operations of $441.1 million, adjustments for depreciation and amortization of $158.6 million, and an adjustment for share based compensation of $77.3 million. Amortization expense increased in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 due to our February 2007 acquisition of Digital Insight. During fiscal 2006 we generated $595.5 million in cash from our continuing operations. This included net income from continuing operations of $377.4 million, adjustments for depreciation and amortization of $126.7 million, and an adjustment for share based compensation of $71.4 million. Investing Activities Investing activities used $86.1 million in cash during fiscal 2008, including $264.5 million for acquisitions of businesses (primarily Homestead and ECHO) and $306.1 million for capital expenditures, partially offset by the receipt of $347.9 million from sales of investments and the receipt of $132.0 million from the sale of our Intuit Distribution Management Solutions business and certain outsourced payroll assets. Investing activities used $1.4 billion in cash during fiscal 2007, including $1.3 billion for the acquisition of Digital Insight and $153.2 million for capital expenditures. Investing activities used $210.0 million in cash during fiscal 2006, including $111.1 million for purchases of investments and $82.1 million in cash for capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures increased from a total of $153.2 million in fiscal 2007 to a total of $306.1 million in fiscal 2008. This increase in capital expenditures was related to investments in a new data center and expansion of office capacity to support the expected growth in our business. We expect total capital expenditures to decrease to approximately $200 million in fiscal 2009. Financing Activities We used $586.5 million in cash for financing activities during fiscal 2008, including $800 million for the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase programs partially offset by $194.7 million from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans. Financing activities provided $733.9 million during fiscal 2007, including $1 billion from the issuance of senior notes and $211.4 million from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans, partially offset by the use of $506.8 million for the repurchase of common stock. We used $478.8 million in cash for financing activities during fiscal 2006, including $784.2 million for the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase programs partially offset by $279.3 million from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans. Stock Split On July 6, 2006 we implemented a two for one stock split in the form of a 100% stock dividend. All share and per share figures in this Item 7 and in the statements of operations and notes to the financial statements in Item 8 retroactively reflect this stock split. Stock Repurchase Programs Our Board of Directors has authorized a series of common stock repurchase programs. Shares of common stock repurchased under these programs become treasury shares. During fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 we repurchased 27.2 million, 17.1 million and 31.0 million shares of our common stock for $800.0 million, $506.6 million and $784.2 million under our repurchase programs. From the inception of these programs in May 2001 through the end of fiscal 2008, we repurchased 185.9 million shares of our common stock for $4.6 billion. At July 31, 2008, we had authorization from our Board to expend up to $600 million for stock repurchases through May 15, 2011. Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility On March 22, 2007 we entered into an agreement with certain institutional lenders for a $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire on March 22, 2012. Advances under the credit facility will accrue interest at rates that are equal to, at our election, either Citibanks base rate or the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) 54 Table of Contents plus a margin that ranges from 0.18% to 0.575% based on our senior debt credit ratings. The applicable interest rate will be increased by 0.05% for any period in which the total principal amount of advances and letters of credit under the credit facility exceeds $250 million. The agreement includes covenants that require us to maintain a ratio of total debt to annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of not greater than 3.25 to 1.00 and a ratio of annual EBITDA to interest payable of not less than 3.00 to 1.00. We may use amounts borrowed under this credit facility for general corporate purposes or for future acquisitions or expansion of our business. To date we have not borrowed under the credit facility, but we may borrow under the credit facility from time to time as opportunities and needs arise. See Note 9 to the financial statements in Item 8. Liquidity and Capital Resource Requirements We evaluate, on an ongoing basis, the merits of acquiring technology or businesses, or establishing strategic relationships with and investing in other companies. We may decide to use cash and cash equivalents, investments, and our revolving line of credit facility to fund such activities in the future. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, contractual obligations, commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for at least the next 12 months. As discussed above in this Item 7 under Auction Rate Securities, we do not believe that the reduction in the liquidity of our municipal auction rate securities will have a material impact on our overall ability to meet our liquidity needs. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At July 31, 2008, we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S K. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our known contractual obligations to make future payments at July 31, 2008: Payments Due by Period Less than 1 3 3 5 More than (In millions) 1 year years years 5 years Total Amounts due under executive deferred compensation plan $ 38.2 $ $ $ $ 38.2 Senior unsecured notes 500.0 500.0 1,000.0 Interest and fees due on long term obligations 55.8 112.5 84.9 115.0 368.2 Capital lease obligations 0.4 0.5 0.9 Operating leases (1) 52.1 101.6 81.4 140.2 375.3 Purchase obligations (2) 55.0 41.7 2.7 99.4 Total contractual obligations (3) $ 201.5 $ 256.3 $ 669.0 $ 755.2 $ 1,882.0 (1) Includes our lease on Woodland Hills, California office space that is currently under construction by the landlord. See Item 2, Properties. (2) Represents agreements to purchase products and services that are enforceable, legally binding and specify terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the payments. (3) Excludes $47.9 million of non current uncertain tax benefits under FIN 48, which are included in other long term obligations on our balance sheet at July 31, 2008. We have not included this amount in the table above because we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate regarding the timing of settlements with taxing authorities, if any. 55 Table of Contents Innovative Merchant Solutions Loan and Buyout Commitments In April 2005 our wholly owned subsidiary, Innovative Merchant Solutions (IMS), became a member of Superior Bankcard Services, LLC (SBS), a newly formed entity that acquires merchant accounts for IMS. In connection with the formation of this entity IMS agreed to provide to SBS revolving loans in an amount of up to $24.5 million under the terms of a credit agreement. In June 2006 IMS entered into an amendment to the credit agreement to increase the amount of funds IMS may loan under that agreement to $40.0 million. The credit agreement expires in July 2013, although certain events, such as a sale of SBS, can trigger earlier termination. Amounts outstanding under the agreement at July 31, 2008 totaled $8.5 million at interest rates of 6.0% to 8.5%. Amounts outstanding under the agreement at July 31, 2007 totaled $11.2 million at an interest rate of 9.25%. There are no scheduled repayments on the outstanding loan balance. All unpaid principal amounts and the related accrued interest are due and payable in full at the loan expiration date. The operating agreement of SBS requires that, no later than July 2009, either IMS agree to purchase the minority members interests in SBS at a price to be set by negotiation or arbitration, or IMS and the minority members pursue a sale of their interests in SBS to a third party. Recent Accounting Pronouncements SFAS 157, Fair Value Measurements In September 2006 the FASB issued SFAS 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS 157 provides enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. The standard also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. SFAS 157 applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value. This standard does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, which means that it will be effective for our fiscal year beginning August 1, 2008. We are in the process of evaluating this standard and therefore have not yet determined the impact that the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. SFAS 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities In February 2007 the FASB issued SFAS 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. SFAS 159 provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The standards objective is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently. The standard requires companies to provide additional information that will help investors and other users of financial statements to more easily understand the effect of the companys choice to use fair value on its earnings. It also requires companies to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the company has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet. The new standard does not eliminate disclosure requirements included in other accounting standards, including requirements for disclosures about fair value measurements included in SFAS 157, Fair Value Measurements, and SFAS 107, Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, which means that it will be effective for our fiscal year beginning August 1, 2008. We are in the process of evaluating this standard and therefore have not yet determined the impact that the adoption of SFAS 159 will have on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. SFAS 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations In December 2007 the FASB issued SFAS 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations. SFAS 141R will significantly change the accounting for business combinations in a number of areas, including the measurement of assets and liabilities acquired and the treatment of contingent consideration, contingencies, acquisition costs, in process research and development and restructuring costs. In addition, under SFAS 141R, changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties in a business combination after the measurement period will affect the income tax provision. SFAS 141R is effective for business combinations for which the 56 Table of Contents acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2008, which means that it will be effective for our fiscal year beginning August 1, 2009. Early adoption is prohibited. We are in the process of evaluating this standard and therefore have not yet determined the impact that the adoption of SFAS 141R will have on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. SFAS 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements In December 2007 the FASB issued SFAS 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling (minority) interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS 160 is effective for business arrangements entered into in fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008, which means that it will be effective for our fiscal year beginning August 1, 2009. Early adoption is prohibited. We are in the process of evaluating this standard and therefore have not yet determined the impact that the adoption of SFAS 160 will have on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. FSP SFAS 142 3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets In April 2008 the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) SFAS 142 3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets. FSP SFAS 142 3 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. This new staff position is intended to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS 142 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under SFAS 141(R), Business Combinations. FSP SFAS 142 3 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, which means that it will be effective for our fiscal year beginning August 1, 2009. We are in the process of evaluating this staff position and therefore have not yet determined the impact that adoption of FSP SFAS 142 3 will have on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Investment Portfolio Our investments consist of instruments that meet quality standards that are consistent with our investment policy. This policy specifies that, except for direct obligations of the United States government, securities issued by agencies of the United States government, and money market funds, we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer. We do not hold derivative financial instruments in our portfolio of investments. See Note 2 to the financial statements in Item 8, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources, in Item 7; and Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for a description of market events that have affected the liquidity of certain municipal auction rate securities that we held at July 31, 2008. The following table presents our portfolio of cash equivalents and available for sale debt securities as of July 31, 2008 by stated maturity. The table is classified by the original maturity date listed on the security and includes cash equivalents, which consist primarily of money market funds. At July 31, 2008, the weighted average interest rate earned on our money market accounts was 2.73% and the weighted average tax adjusted interest rate earned on our investments was 6.03%. Years Ending July 31, 2014 and (In thousands) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Cash equivalents $ 382,702 $ $ $ $ $ $ 382,702 Investments 109,562 193,444 10,402 1,992 1,251 97,842 414,493 Long term investments 14,700 270,625 285,325 Total $ 492,264 $ 208,144 $ 10,402 $ 1,992 $ 1,251 $ 368,467 $ 1,082,520 Interest Rate Risk Our cash equivalents and investments are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents and investments and the value of those investments. Should the Federal Reserve Target Rate increase by 25 basis points from the level of July 31, 2008, the value of our investments would decline by approximately $1.1 million. Should interest rates increase by 100 basis points from the level of July 31, 2008, the value of our investments would decline by approximately $4.4 million. We are also exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates as they affect our $500 million revolving credit facility. Advances under the credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to Citibanks base rate or the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin that ranges from 0.18% to 0.575% based on our senior debt credit ratings. Consequently, our interest expense would fluctuate with changes in the general level of these interest rates if we were to borrow any amounts under the credit facility. At July 31, 2008, no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. On March 12, 2007 we issued $500 million of 5.40% senior unsecured notes due on March 15, 2012 and $500 million of 5.75% senior unsecured notes due on March 15, 2017. Since these senior notes bear interest at fixed rates, they are not subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Impact of Foreign Currency Rate Changes The functional currencies of our international operating subsidiaries are the local currencies. We translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. We translate their revenue, costs and expenses at the average rates of exchange in effect during the period. We include translation 58 Table of Contents gains and losses in the stockholders equity section of our balance sheet. We include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in interest and other income in our statements of operations. Since we translate foreign currencies (primarily Canadian dollars, British pounds and Indian rupees) into U.S dollars for financial reporting purposes, currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results. The historical impact of currency fluctuations has generally been immaterial. We believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not significant primarily because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies. Although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial in the past and we believe that for the reasons cited above currency fluctuations will not be significant in the future, there can be no guarantee that the impact of currency fluctuations will not be material in the future. As of July 31, 2008 we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities. 59 Table of Contents
