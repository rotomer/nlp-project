ITEM 7 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MDA) includes the following sections: Executive Overview that discusses at a high level our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments underlying our financial statements. Results of Operations that includes a more detailed discussion of our revenue and expenses. Liquidity and Capital Resources which discusses key aspects of our statements of cash flows, changes in our balance sheets and our financial commitments. You should note that this MDA discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Please see the section entitled Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors at the beginning of Item 1A for important information to consider when evaluating such statements. You should read this MDA in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes in Item 8. In February 2007 we completed the acquisition of Digital Insight Corporation for a total purchase price of approximately $1.34 billion. In December 2007 we acquired Homestead Technologies Inc. for total consideration of approximately $170 million and in February 2008 we acquired Electronic Clearing House, Inc. (ECHO) for a total purchase price of approximately $131 million. In July 2009 we acquired PayCycle, Inc. for a total purchase price of approximately $169 million. Accordingly, we have included the results of operations for these companies in our consolidated results of operations from their respective dates of acquisition. During fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2008 we transitioned certain outsourced payroll customers in connection with a sale of assets to Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP). We have also reclassified our financial statements for all periods presented to reflect our Intuit Distribution Management Solutions business as discontinued operations. See Results of Operations Dispositions and Discontinued Operations later in this Item 7 for more information. Unless otherwise noted, the following discussion pertains only to our continuing operations. In fiscal 2009 we reclassified segment results for all periods presented to reflect the continued evolution of our business. We no longer combine results for our Payroll business with results for our Payments business because management currently views these businesses separately. We also changed the name of our QuickBooks segment to Financial Management Solutions, our new Payroll segment to Employee Management Solutions, and our new Payments segment to Payments Solutions. We transferred revenue for our Point of Sale offerings from our Financial Management Solutions segment to our Payments Solutions segment to align this product group more closely with the customers they serve. Total Point of Sale revenue was less than $40 million for all periods presented. We also reclassified certain retail sales expenses from common expenses to segment income or loss, consistent with how management now views these expenses. These expenses were less than $25 million for all periods presented. Executive Overview This overview provides a high level discussion of our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business. We believe that an understanding of these trends is important in order to understand our financial results for fiscal 2009 as well as our future prospects. This summary is not intended to be exhaustive, nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Overview of Financial Results Total net revenue for fiscal 2009 was $3.2 billion, an increase of 4% compared with fiscal 2008. The fiscal 2009 revenue increase was due to revenue growth in our Consumer Tax, Payments Solutions, Employee Management Solutions, Accounting Professionals and Financial Institutions segments, partially offset by revenue decreases in our Other Businesses and Financial Management Solutions segments. Consumer Tax revenue increased $67.0 million or 7% due to growth in TurboTax Online units, which more than offset a decrease in TurboTax desktop units. 32 Table of Contents Operating income from continuing operations of $682.1 million for fiscal 2009 increased $31.3 million or 5% compared with fiscal 2008. Fiscal 2009 revenue grew $111.5 million and total costs and expenses increased $80.2 million. Total costs and expenses for fiscal 2009 increased due to our fiscal 2008 acquisitions of Homestead and ECHO; higher advertising and other marketing expenses to support the launch and subsequent promotion of TurboTax and QuickBooks 2009; higher depreciation expense for investments in our infrastructure; higher share based compensation expense; and a charge for the historical use of certain technology licensing rights. Decreases in total costs and expenses due to lower performance incentive payouts as well as other compensation and benefit savings due to lower staffing and lower severance charges partially offset these increases. Net income from continuing operations of $447.0 million for fiscal 2009 decreased $3.8 million or 1% compared with fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2008 we recorded a pre tax gain of $51.6 million on the sale of certain outsourced payroll assets; there was no comparable transaction in fiscal 2009. In addition, interest income decreased in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 due to the impact of lower interest rates that more than offset the impact of higher invested balances. Due to the foregoing factors, diluted net income per share from continuing operations of $1.35 in fiscal 2009 increased 2% compared with $1.33 in fiscal 2008. In July 2009 we acquired PayCycle, Inc. for a total purchase price of approximately $169 million. PayCycle is a provider of online payroll services to small businesses and became part of our Employee Management Solutions segment. We ended fiscal 2009 with cash, cash equivalents and investments totaling $1.3 billion, an increase of $519.2 million from July 31, 2008. Cash, cash equivalents and investments at July 31, 2009 included $150.9 in municipal auction rate securities. We did not classify any of the municipal auction rate securities we held at July 31, 2008 as cash, cash equivalents and investments. At July 31, 2009 and 2008, we also held $93.6 million and $285.3 million in municipal auction rate securities that we classified as long term investments on our balance sheet. See Liquidity and Capital Resources Auction Rate Securities, later in this Item 7 for more information. In fiscal 2009 we generated $812.4 million in cash from continuing operations and $183.6 million from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans. During the same period we used $300.2 million in cash for the repurchase of shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, $182.5 million for capital expenditures, and $187.4 million for acquisitions of businesses (primarily PayCycle) and intangible assets. At July 31, 2009, we had authorization from our Board of Directors to expend up to an additional $299.8 million for stock repurchases through May 15, 2011. On September 11, 2009 we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Mint Software Inc., a provider of online personal finance management services. The cash transaction is valued at approximately $170 million, including the assumption of Mint outstanding stock options. Mint will become part of our Other Businesses segment. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions. We expect the transaction to close before the end of calendar 2009. Seasonality Our QuickBooks, Consumer Tax and Accounting Professionals offerings are highly seasonal. Some of our other offerings are also seasonal, but to a lesser extent. Revenue from our QuickBooks software products tends to be highest during our second and third fiscal quarters. Sales of income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from November through April. In our Consumer Tax business, a greater proportion of our revenue has been occurring later in this seasonal period due in part to the growth in sales of TurboTax Online, for which revenue is recognized upon printing or electronic filing of a tax return. The seasonality of our Consumer Tax and Accounting Professionals revenue is also affected by the timing of the availability of tax forms from taxing agencies and the ability of those agencies to receive electronic tax return submissions. Delays in the availability of tax forms or the ability of taxing agencies to receive submissions can cause revenue to shift from our second fiscal quarter to our third fiscal quarter. These seasonal patterns mean that our total net revenue is usually highest during our second quarter ending January 31 and third quarter ending April 30. We typically report losses in our first quarter ending October 31 and fourth quarter ending July 31, when revenue from our tax businesses is minimal while operating expenses continue at relatively consistent levels. In addition, the timing and composition of new 33 Table of Contents customer offerings that include both product and service elements can materially shift revenue between quarters. We believe the seasonality of our revenue is likely to continue in the future. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates In preparing our financial statements, we make estimates, assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue, operating income or loss and net income or loss, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Senior management has reviewed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and their disclosure in this Annual Report on Form 10 K with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition We derive revenue from the sale of packaged software products, license fees, software subscriptions, product support, hosting services, payroll services, merchant services, professional services, transaction fees and multiple element arrangements that may include any combination of these items. We follow the appropriate revenue recognition rules for each type of revenue. For additional information, see Revenue Recognition in Note 1 to the financial statements in Item 8. We generally recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable. However, determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report. For example, for multiple element arrangements we must make assumptions and judgments in order to allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver, to determine whether undelivered services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services, to determine whether vendor specific evidence of fair value exists for each undelivered element and to determine whether and when each element has been delivered. If we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments, it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period. Amounts for fees collected or invoiced and due relating to arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized when the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied. In connection with the sale of certain products, we provide a limited amount of free technical support assistance to customers. We do not defer the recognition of any revenue associated with sales of these products since the cost of providing this free technical support is insignificant. The technical support is generally provided within one year after the associated revenue is recognized and free product enhancements are minimal and infrequent. We accrue the estimated cost of providing this free support upon product shipment. Return and Rebate Reserves As part of our revenue recognition policy, we estimate future product returns and rebate payments and establish reserves against revenue at the time of sale based on these estimates. Our return policy allows distributors and retailers, subject to contractual limitations, to return purchased products. Product returns by distributors and retailers relate primarily to the return of excess and obsolete products. In determining our product returns reserves, we consider the volume and price mix of products in the retail channel, historical return rates for prior releases of the product, trends in retailer inventory and economic trends that might impact customer demand for our products (including the competitive environment and the timing of new releases of our products). We fully reserve for excess and obsolete products in the distribution channels. Our rebate reserves include distributor and retailer sales incentive rebates and end user rebates. Our estimated reserves for distributor and retailer incentive rebates are based on distributors and retailers actual performance against the terms and conditions of rebate programs, which we typically establish annually. Our reserves for end user rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the specific promotional rebate program, actual sales during the promotion and historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program. In the past, actual returns and rebates have not differed significantly from the reserves that we have established. However, actual returns and rebates in any future period are inherently uncertain. If we were to change our 34 Table of Contents assumptions and estimates, our revenue reserves would change, which would impact the net revenue we report. If actual returns and rebates are significantly greater than the reserves we have established, the actual results would decrease our future reported revenue. Conversely, if actual returns and rebates are significantly less than our reserves, this would increase our future reported revenue. For example, if we had increased our fiscal 2009 returns reserves by 1% of non consignment sales to retailers for QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken, our total net revenue for fiscal 2009 would have been about $3.0 million lower. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We make ongoing assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable. The accounts receivable amount on our balance sheet includes a reserve for accounts that might not be paid. In determining the amount of the reserve, we consider our historical level of credit losses. We also make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations, and we assess current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future. Our reserves have generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses. However, since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, we cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be adequate. If actual credit losses are significantly greater than the reserve we have established, that would increase our general and administrative expenses and reduce our reported net income. Conversely, if actual credit losses are significantly less than our reserve, this would eventually decrease our general and administrative expenses and increase our reported net income. Fair Value of Investments We estimate the fair value of our available for sale securities each quarter. These investments consist of cash equivalents, municipal bonds, U.S. agency securities, corporate notes and municipal auction rate securities. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. When identical or similar assets are traded in active markets, the level of judgment required to estimate their fair value is relatively low. This is generally true for our cash equivalents, municipal bonds, U.S. agency securities and corporate notes. However, significant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities when observable inputs are not available. For example, we use a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of our municipal auction rate securities because we have determined that the market for those securities is inactive. We based this determination on the fact that due to a decrease in liquidity in the global credit markets, regularly scheduled auctions for the municipal auction rate securities we hold have generally failed since February 2008. Some of the key inputs to our discounted cash flow model are inherently uncertain. The key inputs include projected future interest rates; the likely timing of principal repayments; the probability of full repayment; publicly available pricing data for recently issued similar securities that are not subject to auctions; and the impact of the reduced liquidity for auction rate securities. At July 31, 2009, we held a total of $244.5 million in municipal auction rate securities. We record unrealized gains and losses on our available for sale securities in other comprehensive income in the equity section of our balance sheet until the security is sold or we determine that the decrease in fair value is other than temporary. We consider a number of factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge, including the reason for the decrease in fair value, the severity of the decrease in fair value, the length of time that the fair value has been less than the cost basis of the security, the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, and whether we intend to sell or may be required to sell the security before anticipated recovery of our cost basis. Changes in our estimates of the fair values of our available for sale securities may result in material increases or decreases in our net income in the period in which the change occurs. Business Combinations Purchase Accounting Under the purchase method of accounting, we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. We record the excess of purchase price over the aggregate fair values as goodwill. We engage third party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. These valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing purchased technology, customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets. If the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying 35 Table of Contents business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, we could experience impairment charges. In addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. If our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed. Goodwill, Purchased Intangible Assets and Other Long Lived Assets Impairment Assessments We estimate the fair value of purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets that have finite useful lives whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. We test for potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or whenever indicators of impairment arise. The timing of the annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods. In order to estimate the fair value of goodwill, we use a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow model (known as the income approach) and comparisons to publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses (known as the market approach). The income approach requires us to use a number of assumptions, including market factors specific to the business, the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the business over an extended period of time, long term growth rates for the business, and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money. We evaluate cash flows at the reporting unit level and the number of reporting units that we have identified may make impairment more probable than it would be at a company with fewer reporting units and more integrated operations following acquisitions. Although the assumptions we use in our discounted cash flow model are consistent with the assumptions we use to generate our internal strategic plans and forecasts, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows from each reporting unit and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows. When using the market approach, we make judgments about the comparability of publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses. We base our judgments on factors such as size, growth rates, profitability, risk, and return on investment. We also make judgments when adjusting market multiples of revenue, operating income, and earnings for these companies to reflect their relative similarity to our own businesses. We had a total of $1.8 billion in goodwill on our balance sheet at July 31, 2009. See Note 4 to the financial statements in Item 8 for a summary of goodwill by reportable segment. In order to estimate the fair value of purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets that have finite useful lives, we estimate the present value of future cash flows from those assets. The key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model are the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money. Significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows. We also make judgments about the remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets that have finite lives. We had a total of $293.0 million in net purchased intangible assets on our balance sheet at July 31, 2009. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. For example, if our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of one or more of our reporting units, we may be required to record future impairment charges for goodwill and purchased intangible assets. Impairment charges could materially decrease our future net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet. Accounting for Share Based Compensation Plans At July 31, 2009, there was $240.0 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested share based compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans which we will amortize to expense in the future. Total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures. We expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average vesting period of 2.1 years. 36 Table of Contents We use a lattice binomial model and the assumptions shown in Note 12 to the financial statements in Item 8 to estimate the fair value of stock options granted. We estimate the expected term of options granted based on implied exercise patterns using a binomial model. We estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the implied volatility of publicly traded one year and two year options on our common stock. Our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. We base the risk free interest rate that we use in our option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on constant maturity U.S. Treasury issues with equivalent remaining terms. We have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we use an expected dividend yield of zero in our option valuation model. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. We amortize the fair value of options on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods. We may elect to use different assumptions under our option valuation model in the future, which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share. We value restricted stock units using the intrinsic value method. We amortize the value of restricted stock units on a straight line basis over the restriction period. Legal Contingencies We are subject to certain legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business. We review the status of each significant matter quarterly and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability and an expense for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our accruals are based on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Potential legal liabilities and the revision of estimates of potential legal liabilities could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. Income Taxes Estimates of Effective Tax Rates, Deferred Taxes and Valuation Allowance When we prepare our financial statements, we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing jurisdiction. We estimate our current tax liability and assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which we show on our balance sheet. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized. To the extent we believe that realization is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. When we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period, we record a corresponding tax expense in our statement of operations. At July 31, 2009, we had net deferred tax assets of $128.7 million which included a valuation allowance of $5.7 million for certain state net operating loss carryforwards. We recorded the valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets before they expire. The valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable. While we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we could in the future be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize. An increase in the valuation allowance would have an adverse impact, which could be material, on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we record the increase. We recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a two step approach. The first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely 37 Table of Contents of being realized upon settlement. Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. We evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. Our evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues. Changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change, which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results. Results of Operations Financial Overview Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal 2009 2008 2008 2007 (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2009 2008 2007 % Change % Change Total net revenue $ 3,182.5 $ 3,071.0 $ 2,672.9 4 % 15 % Operating income from continuing operations 682.1 650.8 637.6 5 % 2 % Net income from continuing operations 447.0 450.8 443.5 1 % 2 % Diluted net income per share from continuing operations $ 1.35 $ 1.33 $ 1.25 2 % 6 % Total net revenue increased $111.5 million or 4% in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. Consumer Tax segment revenue increased $67.0 million or 7% in fiscal 2009 due to 36% growth in TurboTax Online units, which more than offset an 11% decrease in TurboTax desktop units. Payments Solutions segment revenue increased $37.4 million or 15% in fiscal 2009 due to growth in the core merchant services customer base and revenue from ECHO, partially offset by a decline in transaction processing volume per customer. Employee Management Solutions segment revenue increased $27.9 million or 8% in fiscal 2009 due to the realization of the full effect of pricing changes made in fiscal 2008. Accounting Professionals segment revenue increased $25.1 million or 8% in fiscal 2009 due to price increases and Financial Institutions revenue increased $12.5 million or 4% due to growth in Internet banking and bill pay end users, partially offset by a decline in revenue per end user. Revenue in our Other Businesses segment decreased $45.1 million or 14% in fiscal 2009 and revenue in our Financial Management Solutions segment decreased $13.3 million or 2%. We believe that fiscal 2009 revenue in these two segments was affected by slower small business and consumer spending. See Total Net Revenue by Business Segment later in this Item 7 for more information. Operating income from continuing operations for fiscal 2009 increased $31.3 million or 5% compared with fiscal 2008. The increase in operating income was due to $111.5 million in higher revenue partially offset by $80.2 million in higher costs and expenses. In fiscal 2009 total costs and expenses increased about $49 million due to our fiscal 2008 acquisitions of Homestead and ECHO; about $31 million due to higher advertising and other marketing expenses to support the launch and subsequent promotion of TurboTax 2008 and QuickBooks 2009; about $27 million due to higher depreciation expense for investments in our infrastructure; about $20 million due to higher share based compensation expense; and $12.6 million due to a charge for the historical use of certain technology licensing rights. These increases in total costs and expenses were partially offset by decreases of about $45 million due to lower performance incentive payouts and about $33 million in compensation and benefit savings due to lower staffing levels and lower severance related charges in fiscal 2009. See Cost of Revenue and Operating Expenses later in this Item 7 for more information. Net income from continuing operations decreased $3.8 million or 1% in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2008 we recorded a pre tax gain of $51.6 million on the sale of certain outsourced payroll assets; there was no comparable transaction in fiscal 2009. See Dispositions and Discontinued Operations later in this Item 7 for more information. In addition, interest and other income decreased $25.0 million in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. The impact of lower interest rates more than offset the impact of higher average invested balances and resulted in $18.5 million lower interest income. Due to certain discrete tax items, our effective tax rate for fiscal 38 Table of Contents 2009 was 31%. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 was 35%. See Income Taxes later in this Item 7 for more information about our effective tax rates for these periods. Due to the foregoing factors, diluted net income per share from continuing operations of $1.35 in fiscal 2009 increased 2% compared with $1.33 in fiscal 2008. Total Net Revenue by Business Segment The table below and the discussion of total net revenue that follows it are organized in accordance with our seven reportable business segments. See Note 15 to the financial statements in Item 8 for descriptions of product revenue and service and other revenue for each segment. We have reclassified segment results for all periods presented to reflect the continued evolution of our business. We no longer combine results for our Payroll operating segment with results for our Payments operating segment because management currently views these businesses separately. We also changed the name of our QuickBooks segment to Financial Management Solutions, our new Payroll segment to Employee Management Solutions, and our new Payments segment to Payments Solutions. We transferred revenue for our Point of Sale offerings from our Financial Management Solutions segment to our Payments Solutions segment to align this product group more closely with the customers they serve. Total Point of Sale revenue was less than $40 million for all periods presented. We also reclassified certain retail sales expenses from common expenses to segment income or loss, consistent with how management now views these expenses. These expenses were less than $25 million for all periods presented. % Total % Total % Total Fiscal Net Fiscal Net Fiscal Net 2009 2008 2008 2007 (Dollars in millions) 2009 Revenue 2008 Revenue 2007 Revenue % Change % Change Financial Management Solutions (QuickBooks) Product revenue $ 383.0 $ 445.8 $ 453.8 Service and other revenue 195.8 146.3 97.4 Subtotal 578.8 18 % 592.1 19 % 551.2 20 % 2 % 7 % Employee Management Solutions (Payroll) Product revenue 236.5 212.7 200.7 Service and other revenue 128.3 124.2 147.6 Subtotal 364.8 12 % 336.9 11 % 348.3 13 % 8 % 3 % Payments Solutions Product revenue 28.4 32.6 39.3 Service and other revenue 262.6 221.0 164.1 Subtotal 291.0 9 % 253.6 8 % 203.4 8 % 15 % 25 % Consumer Tax Product revenue 256.4 311.6 300.7 Service and other revenue 740.0 617.8 512.2 Subtotal 996.4 31 % 929.4 30 % 812.9 30 % 7 % 14 % Accounting Professionals Product revenue 321.6 301.5 283.8 Service and other revenue 30.2 25.2 30.4 Subtotal 351.8 11 % 326.7 11 % 314.2 12 % 8 % 4 % Financial Institutions Product revenue 0.3 0.8 0.2 Service and other revenue 310.8 297.8 150.2 Subtotal 311.1 10 % 298.6 10 % 150.4 6 % 4 % 99 % Other Businesses Product revenue 157.8 191.7 168.9 Service and other revenue 130.8 142.0 123.6 Subtotal 288.6 9 % 333.7 11 % 292.5 11 % 14 % 14 % Total Company Product revenue 1,384.0 1,496.7 1,447.4 Service and other revenue 1,798.5 1,574.3 1,225.5 Total net revenue $ 3,182.5 100 % $ 3,071.0 100 % $ 2,672.9 100 % 4 % 15 % 39 Table of Contents Financial Management Solutions (formerly known as QuickBooks) Fiscal 2009 Compared with Fiscal 2008.

Excluding revenue from Homestead, which we acquired in December 2007, Financial Management Solutions total net revenue decreased 6% in fiscal 2009. Total QuickBooks software unit sales, including activations of our free Simple Start offering, were up 6% in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. Revenue per QuickBooks unit was lower in fiscal 2009 due to price promotion programs in some of our sales channels. QuickBooks Online subscriptions grew 11% and active QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions customers were up 12% in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007. Financial Management Solutions total net revenue increased $40.9 million or 7% in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. Excluding revenue from Homestead, which we acquired in December 2007, Financial Management Solutions total net revenue increased 5% in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. Total QuickBooks software unit sales, including activations of our free Simple Start offering, were up slightly in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. Revenue growth in fiscal 2008 was driven by a 14% increase in QuickBooks Online subscribers, a 22% increase in the number of active QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions customers, and 8% growth in revenue from secondary products and services sold in conjunction with QuickBooks software units. Employee Management Solutions (formerly known as Payroll) Fiscal 2009 Compared with Fiscal 2008. Employee Management Solutions total net revenue increased $27.9 million or 8% in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 due predominantly to the realization of the full effect in fiscal 2009 of pricing changes made in fiscal 2008. PayCycle, which we acquired in July 2009, had a negligible effect on fiscal 2009 Employee Management Solutions revenue. Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007. Employee Management Solutions total net revenue decreased $11.4 million or 3% in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 as we completed the transition of portions of our Complete Payroll and Premier Payroll Services customer base in connection with a sale of assets to ADP. We estimate that revenue growth in this segment in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 would have been approximately 9% when adjusted for the impact of the sale of those payroll customers. Payments Solutions Fiscal 2009 Compared with Fiscal 2008. Payments Solutions total net revenue increased $37.4 million or 15% in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. Revenue in fiscal 2009 increased due to 14% growth in our core merchant services customer base and revenue from ECHO, which we acquired in February 2008. Transaction volume per customer was down about 8% in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008, reflecting an overall reduction in consumer spending associated with the current economic environment. Excluding revenue from ECHO, Payments Solutions segment revenue increased approximately 8% in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007. Payments Solutions total net revenue increased $50.2 million or 25% in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 due to 18% growth in our core merchant services customer base and revenue from ECHO, which we acquired in February 2008. We estimate that revenue growth in our Payments Solutions segment in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 would have been approximately 17% when adjusted for the impact of our acquisition of ECHO. Consumer Tax Fiscal 2009 Compared with Fiscal 2008. Consumer Tax total net revenue increased $67.0 million or 7% in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. The fiscal 2009 revenue increase was due to 36% growth in federal TurboTax Online units, which more than offset an 11% decrease in federal TurboTax desktop units. We included federal electronic filing services with our TurboTax desktop software for the first time in the 2008 tax year. Net of related price increases, we estimate that this decision resulted in a reduction of about $25 million in Consumer Tax revenue for fiscal 2009. 40 Table of Contents Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007. Consumer Tax total net revenue increased $116.5 million or 14% in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. The fiscal 2008 revenue increase was due to 17% growth in total federal TurboTax units, which was driven by 37% growth in TurboTax Online units. TurboTax desktop units were flat in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. Accounting Professionals Fiscal 2009 Compared with Fiscal 2008. Accounting Professionals total net revenue increased $25.1 million or 8% in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 due to price increases. Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007. Accounting Professionals total net revenue increased $12.5 million or 4% in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. We discontinued our ProSeries Express product line in fiscal 2008, which we estimate resulted in a loss of five percentage points of growth for the Accounting Professionals segment in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. Financial Institutions Fiscal 2009 Compared with Fiscal 2008. Financial Institutions total net revenue increased $12.5 million or 4% in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. Internet banking end users increased 3% and bill pay end users were up 20% in fiscal 2009. Lower revenue per user partially offset growth in the Internet banking and bill pay customer bases. Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007. Financial Institutions total net revenue increased $148.2 million to $298.6 million in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 due mainly to revenue from Digital Insight, which we acquired in February 2007. In fiscal 2008 Internet banking end users grew 10% and bill pay end users grew 16%. Other Businesses Fiscal 2009 Compared with Fiscal 2008. Other Businesses total net revenue decreased $45.1 million or 14% in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. Quicken sales were down 15% in fiscal 2009 due to the overall reduction in consumer spending. In addition, the stronger U.S. dollar contributed to a decline in Canadian revenue and revenue from our business in the UK, lowering Other Businesses segment revenue growth by approximately seven percentage points in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007. Other Businesses total net revenue increased $41.2 million or 14% in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2008 revenue from our businesses in Canada and the United Kingdom increased 28%, revenue from our Intuit Real Estate Solutions business grew 17%, and Quicken revenue was flat compared with fiscal 2007. The weaker U.S. dollar contributed to Canadian revenue growth, accounting for approximately five percentage points of Other Businesses segment revenue growth in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007.

Fiscal 2009 Compared with Fiscal 2008. Cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue increased slightly to 11% in fiscal 2009 from 10% in fiscal 2008 due to product mix. Cost of service and other revenue as a percentage of service and other revenue decreased slightly to 25% in fiscal 2009 from 26% in fiscal 2008 due to an increase of $122.2 million in revenue from TurboTax Online and consumer electronic tax filing services, which have relatively lower costs of service revenue compared with our other service offerings. Partially offsetting this benefit, fiscal 2009 cost of service and other revenue included a $12.6 million charge for the historical use of certain technology licensing rights that we acquired in May 2009. Amortization of purchased intangible assets increased in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 due primarily to the amortization of Homestead and ECHO purchased intangible assets, which we acquired in fiscal 2008. Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007. Cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue decreased to 10% in fiscal 2008 from 12% in fiscal 2007 due to cost efficiencies achieved for our QuickBooks 2008 and Consumer Tax product lines. Cost of service and other revenue as a percentage of service and other revenue increased slightly to 26% in fiscal 2008 from 25% in fiscal 2007. The impact of our acquisition of Digital Insight, which has relatively higher costs of service revenue, was partially offset by the impact of $105.6 million growth in revenue from TurboTax Online and consumer electronic tax filing services, which have relatively lower costs of service revenue compared with our other service offerings. Amortization of purchased intangible assets increased in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 due primarily to the amortization of Digital Insight purchased intangible assets, which we acquired in February 2007.

Total operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenue decreased to 57% in fiscal 2009 from 59% in fiscal 2008 due to $111.5 million higher revenue partially offset by $27.6 million higher total operating expenses in fiscal 2009. Total operating expenses in fiscal 2009 included an increase of about $32 million for the operating expenses of acquired businesses; an increase of about $31 million for advertising and other marketing expenses to support the launch and subsequent promotion of TurboTax 2008 and QuickBooks 2009; an increase of about $27 million due to higher depreciation expense for investments in our infrastructure; and an increase of about $18 million due to higher share based compensation expense. Share based compensation expense was higher in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 due to our broad use of restricted stock units in addition to stock options. These increases were partially offset by decreases of about $45 million due to lower performance 42 Table of Contents incentive payouts and about $33 million in compensation and benefit savings due to lower staffing levels and lower severance related charges in fiscal 2009. Acquisition related charges increased in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 primarily due to the amortization of Homestead and ECHO purchased intangible assets, which we acquired in fiscal 2008. Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007. Total operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenue increased to 59% in fiscal 2008 from 57% in fiscal 2007. Total operating expenses in dollars increased about $270 million in fiscal 2008, approximately $109 million of which was due to our acquisitions of Digital Insight, Homestead and ECHO and approximately $37 million of which was due to higher share based compensation expense. Share based compensation expense was higher in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 due to our broad use of restricted stock units in addition to stock options. We also recorded a $23 million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 in connection with a reallocation of resources to key growth businesses. Including Digital Insight, Homestead, ECHO, share based compensation expense and the restructuring charge, about half of the increase in total operating expenses in dollars for fiscal 2008 was due to higher research and development expenses. During this period, we continued to invest in research and development for existing offerings as well as for new offerings. Almost 45% of the fiscal 2008 increase in total operating expenses in dollars was due to higher selling and marketing expenses. Of the total increase in selling and marketing expenses in dollars for this period about a third was due to our acquisition of Digital Insight, whose selling costs are relatively higher compared with our other businesses because they sell their services to financial institutions through a direct sales force. About 20% of the fiscal 2008 increase in selling and marketing expenses in dollars was due to higher advertising and other marketing expenses to support our Consumer Tax offerings. Excluding the impact of the increase in share based compensation expense, general and administrative expenses declined about $5 million in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. Acquisition related charges increased in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 primarily due to the amortization of Digital Insight purchased intangible assets, which we acquired in February 2007. Segment Operating Income (Loss) Segment operating income or loss is segment net revenue less segment cost of revenue and operating expenses. Segment expenses do not include certain costs, such as corporate selling and marketing, product development, and general and administrative expenses and share based compensation expenses, which are not allocated to specific segments. These unallocated costs totaled $516.8 million in fiscal 2009, $543.0 million in fiscal 2008 and $486.4 million in fiscal 2007. Segment expenses also do not include amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition related charges.

Financial Management Solutions revenue was $13.3 million lower in fiscal 2009 while total costs and expenses increased. Selling and marketing expenses increased approximately $41 million in fiscal 2009, including about $13 million due to our fiscal 2008 acquisition of Homestead and about $15 million due to higher advertising and other marketing expenses to support the launch and subsequent promotion of QuickBooks 2009. Product development expenses increased approximately $7 million in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007. Financial Management Solutions segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue decreased to 29% in fiscal 2008 from 31% in fiscal 2007. Financial Management Solutions revenue grew $40.9 million in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007, including revenue from Homestead. Cost of revenue increased approximately $4 million as cost efficiencies achieved for our QuickBooks 2008 product line partially offset higher costs associated with QuickBooks services. Including Homestead, selling and marketing expenses increased approximately $17 million, product development expenses increased approximately $15 million and general and administrative expenses increased approximately $5 million in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. Employee Management Solutions (formerly known as Payroll) Fiscal 2009 Compared with Fiscal 2008. Employee Management Solutions segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue increased to 57% in fiscal 2009 from 49% in fiscal 2008. Segment revenue grew $27.9 million in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 while costs and expenses decreased approximately $13 million due to about $22 million in lower Small Business Group common cost allocations partially offset by about $9 million in charges for asset write downs and consolidation of workforces that resulted from our July 2009 acquisition of PayCycle. Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007. Employee Management Solutions segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue increased to 49% in fiscal 2008 from 47% in fiscal 2007. Segment revenue decreased $11.4 million in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. During fiscal 2008 we continued to transition certain full service payroll customers, which have relatively higher costs of revenue, to ADP. Higher gross margins in fiscal 2008 were partially offset by higher expenses, including an increase of approximately $6 million for product development expenses. Payments Solutions Fiscal 2009 Compared with Fiscal 2008. Payments Solutions segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue decreased to 11% in fiscal 2009 from 17% in fiscal 2008. Segment revenue grew $37.4 million in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 while costs and expenses increased about $49 million. In fiscal 2009 total segment expense increased about $15 million due to our February 2008 acquisition of ECHO; about $11 million due to higher cost of revenue in the core merchant services business; about $7 million due to higher sales and marketing expenses in the core merchant services business; about $4 million due to higher product development expenses in the core merchant services business; and about $4 million due to higher depreciation from infrastructure investments. Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007. Payments Solutions segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue decreased to 17% in fiscal 2008 from 25% in fiscal 2007. Segment revenue increased $50.2 million in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 while costs and expenses increased about $16 million due to our February 2007 acquisition of ECHO and about $10 million for infrastructure and lease termination costs. Consumer Tax Fiscal 2009 Compared with Fiscal 2008. Consumer Tax segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue was flat at 63% in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008. The $67.0 million growth in Consumer Tax revenue in fiscal 2009 was partially offset by an increase of about $16 million in advertising and other marketing expenses to support 44 Table of Contents the launch and subsequent promotion of TurboTax 2008 and an increase of about $7 million in research and development expenses. Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007. Consumer Tax segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue increased slightly to 63% in fiscal 2008 from 62% in fiscal 2007. The $116.5 million growth in Consumer Tax revenue in fiscal 2008 was partially offset by higher expenses, including increases of approximately $25 million for selling and marketing expenses (including higher radio, television and online advertising expenses as well as higher direct marketing expenses) and approximately $12 million for product development expenses. Lower cost of revenue partially offset the increases in selling and marketing expenses and product development expenses. Accounting Professionals Fiscal 2009 Compared with Fiscal 2008. Accounting Professionals segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue increased to 53% in fiscal 2009 from 50% in fiscal 2008. Accounting Professionals revenue increased $25.1 million while costs and expenses were relatively stable in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007.

Financial Institutions segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue increased to 22% in fiscal 2009 from 19% in fiscal 2008. Financial Institutions revenue increased $12.5 million while costs and expenses were relatively stable in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007. Financial Institutions segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue decreased to 19% in fiscal 2008 from 26% in fiscal 2007. The fiscal 2008 decrease in segment operating income was due to our February 2007 acquisition of Digital Insight, which has higher costs and expenses, including relatively higher costs of service revenue and higher selling expenses, than the Intuit financial institutions business that existed prior to the acquisition. Other Businesses Fiscal 2009 Compared with Fiscal 2008. Other Businesses segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue decreased to 23% in fiscal 2009 from 30% in fiscal 2008 due to the decrease in segment revenue in fiscal 2009. While revenue from our businesses in Canada and the UK was lower in fiscal 2009 by approximately $23 million due to the stronger U.S. dollar, total costs and expenses for this segment were also lower by approximately $13 million due to the impact of foreign exchange rates. Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007. Other Businesses segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue decreased to 30% in fiscal 2008 from 33% in fiscal 2007. About a quarter of the $41.2 million in fiscal 2008 revenue growth in this segment came from our Intuit Real Estate Solutions business, which sells its products and services through a direct sales force and therefore has a higher cost structure than the other businesses in this segment. While revenue from our business in Canada was higher in fiscal 2008 due in part to the weaker U.S. dollar, total costs and expenses for this business also increased due to the impact of foreign exchange rates. In addition, fiscal 2008 selling and marketing expenses in our business in Canada increased in support of our latest QuickBooks and consumer tax offerings. Non Operating Income and Expenses Interest Expense In March 2007 we issued $1 billion in senior notes. Interest expense of $51.2 million for fiscal 2009, $52.3 million for fiscal 2008 and $27.1 million for fiscal 2007 consisted primarily of interest on $500 million in principal amount of the senior notes at 5.40% and interest on $500 million in principal amount of the senior notes at 5.75%. The 45 Table of Contents senior notes are due in March 2012 and March 2017 and are redeemable by Intuit at any time, subject to a make whole premium. See Note 9 to the financial statements in Item 8 for more information. Interest and Other Income Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal (In millions) 2009 2008 2007 Interest income $ 20.5 $ 39.0 $ 45.0 Net losses on executive deferred compensation plan assets (5.9 ) (3.4 ) (1.0 ) Quicken Loans royalties and fees 7.5 7.5 9.3 Gain on sale of assets 2.7 Net foreign exchange gain (loss) (0.6 ) 0.5 (0.1 ) Other 0.2 (0.5 ) Total interest and other income $ 21.5 $ 46.5 $ 52.7 Interest and other income consists primarily of interest income. The impact of lower interest rates more than offset the impact of higher average invested balances and resulted in lower interest income in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. Lower interest rates and lower average invested balances resulted in lower interest income in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. We record gains and losses associated with executive deferred compensation plan assets in interest and other income and gains and losses associated with the related liabilities in operating expense. The amounts recorded in operating expense generally offset the amounts recorded in interest and other income. Total interest and other income for all periods presented included royalties and fees from trademark license and distribution agreements that we entered into when we sold our Quicken Loans mortgage business in July 2002. Income Taxes Effective Tax Rate Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 was approximately 31%. Excluding discrete tax benefits primarily related to a favorable agreement we entered into with a tax authority and the retroactive reinstatement of the federal research and experimentation credit, our effective tax rate for that period was approximately 35% and did not differ significantly from the federal statutory rate of 35%. State income taxes were partially offset primarily by the benefit we received from federal and state research and experimentation credits, the domestic production activities deduction, and tax exempt interest income. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 was 35% and did not differ significantly from the federal statutory rate of 35%. State income taxes were offset primarily by the benefit we received from tax exempt interest income, the domestic production activities deduction, and federal and state research and experimentation credits. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 was 36% and did not differ significantly from the federal statutory rate of 35%. State income taxes were partially offset by the benefit we received from tax exempt interest income, federal and state research and experimentation credits and the domestic production activities deduction. In addition, in fiscal 2007 we benefited from the retroactive extension of the federal research and experimentation credit. In January 2009 we entered into a favorable agreement with a state tax authority with respect to certain tax years including years ended prior to fiscal 2009. As a result of this agreement, we recorded a discrete tax benefit of $18.0 million during the twelve months ended July 31, 2009. In October 2008 changes in federal tax law resulted in the reinstatement of the federal research and experimentation credit through December 31, 2009 that was retroactive to January 1, 2008. In December 2006 changes in federal tax law resulted in the reinstatement of the federal research and experimentation credit through December 31, 2007 that was retroactive to January 1, 2006. We recorded discrete tax benefits of approximately $6.9 million and $3.7 million for the retroactive amounts related to fiscal years 2008 and 2006 during the twelve months ended July 31, 2009 and 2007. 46 Table of Contents See Note 11 to the financial statements in Item 8 for more information about our effective tax rates. Tax Carryforwards We acquired PayCycle in fiscal 2009 and ECHO and Homestead in fiscal 2008. See Note 6 to the financial statements in Item 8. These companies had federal net operating loss carryforwards at their respective dates of acquisition that totaled approximately $126 million. We have recorded the tax effects of these carryforwards, which together totaled approximately $44 million, as deferred tax assets at the respective dates of acquisition. The carryforwards do not result in an income tax provision benefit, but they reduce income taxes payable and cash paid for income taxes as we utilize them. At July 31, 2009, we had total federal net operating loss carryforwards of $104.0 million that will expire starting in fiscal 2019. Net Deferred Tax Assets At July 31, 2009, we had net deferred tax assets of $128.7 million which included a valuation allowance of $5.7 million for certain state net operating loss carryforwards. We recorded the valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets before they expire. While we believe our current valuation allowance is sufficient, we could in the future be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize. We assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. The assessment is based on our estimates of future sources of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the periods over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable. See Note 11 to the financial statements in Item 8 for more information. Dispositions and Discontinued Operations During fiscal 2008 and 2007 we sold the assets and businesses described below. See Note 7 to the financial statements in Item 8 for a more complete description of these dispositions and discontinued operations and for a summary of the impact that discontinued operations have had on our statements of operations for those fiscal years. Intuit Distribution Management Solutions Discontinued Operations In August 2007 we sold our Intuit Distribution Management Solutions (IDMS) business for approximately $100 million in cash and recorded a net gain on disposal of $27.5 million. IDMS was part of our Other Businesses segment. We have accounted for IDMS as a discontinued operation and segregated its operating results from continuing operations in our statements of operations for all periods prior to the sale. Revenue from IDMS was $1.9 million in fiscal 2008 and $52.0 million in fiscal 2007. Sale of Outsourced Payroll Assets In March 2007 we sold certain assets related to our Complete Payroll and Premier Payroll Service businesses to ADP. The final purchase price was contingent upon the number of customers that transitioned to ADP pursuant to the purchase agreement over a period of approximately one year from the date of sale. We recorded pre tax gains of $51.6 million in fiscal 2008 and $31.7 million in fiscal 2007 in our statement of operations for customers who transitioned to ADP during those periods. We received a total purchase price of $93.6 million and recorded a total pre tax gain of $83.2 million from the inception of this transaction through its completion in the third quarter of fiscal 2008. The assets were part of our Employee Management Solutions segment. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview At July 31, 2009, our cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $1.3 billion, an increase of $519.2 million from July 31, 2008 due to the factors described in Statements of Cash Flows below. Cash, cash equivalents and investments at July 31, 2009 included $150.9 in municipal auction rate securities. We did not classify any of the municipal auction rate securities we held at July 31, 2008 as cash, cash equivalents and investments. At July 31, 47 Table of Contents 2009 and 2008, we also held $93.6 million and $285.3 million in municipal auction rate securities that we classified as long term investments on our balance sheet. See Auction Rate Securities below for more information. Our primary source of liquidity has been cash from operations, which entails the collection of accounts receivable for products and services. Our primary uses of cash have been for research and development programs, selling and marketing activities, capital projects, acquisitions of businesses, debt service costs and repurchases of common stock. In March 2007 we issued five year and ten year senior unsecured notes totaling $1 billion in connection with our acquisition of Digital Insight. We also have a $500 million unsecured revolving line of credit facility that is described later in this Item 7. To date we have not borrowed under the facility. The following table summarizes selected measures of our liquidity and capital resources at the dates indicated: July 31, July 31, $ % (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Change Change Cash, cash equivalents and investments $ 1,347.0 $ 827.8 $ 519.2 63 % Long term investments 97.1 288.3 (191.2 ) (66 %) Long term debt 998.2 998.0 0.2 0 % Working capital 884.0 306.3 577.7 189 % Ratio of current assets to current liabilities 1.8 : 1 1.2 : 1 Auction Rate Securities At July 31, 2009, we held a total of $244.5 million in municipal auction rate securities. Based on the maturities of the underlying securities and the put option described below, we classified $150.9 million of these securities as short term investments and $93.6 million of these securities as long term investments on our balance sheet at that date. All of the municipal auction rate securities we held at July 31, 2009 were rated A or better by the major credit rating agencies and 86% were collateralized by student loans guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Education. These securities are long term debt instruments that are intended to provide liquidity through a Dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined intervals, typically every 35 days. Due to a decrease in liquidity in the global credit markets, in February 2008 auctions began failing for the municipal auction rate securities we held. Regularly scheduled auctions for these securities have generally continued to fail since that time. When these auctions initially failed, higher interest rates for many of the securities went into effect in accordance with the terms of the prospectus for each security. As of July 31, 2009, we had received all interest payments in accordance with the contractual terms of these securities. During fiscal 2009 issuers redeemed at par value $40.8 million of municipal auction rate securities that we held. In August 2008 the broker dealers for our municipal auction rate securities announced settlements under which they may provide liquidity solutions, or purchase, the auction rate securities held by their institutional clients. On November 4, 2008 we accepted an offer from UBS AG (UBS), one of the broker dealers for our municipal auction rate securities, that gives us the option to sell UBS a total of $140.9 million in municipal auction rate securities at par value at any time during a two year period beginning June 30, 2010. The offer also gives UBS the discretion to buy any or all of these municipal auction rate securities from us at par value at any time. To date UBS has not purchased any of these securities from us. We currently intend to exercise our option to sell UBS all of these municipal auction rate securities at par value in accordance with the terms of the offer within the next twelve months. We continue to have counter party risk associated with UBS. Based on our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash, we do not believe that the reduction in liquidity of our municipal auction rate securities will have a material impact on our overall ability to meet our liquidity needs. 48 Table of Contents Statements of Cash Flows The following table summarizes selected items from our statements of cash flows for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007. See the financial statements in Item 8 for complete statements of cash flows for those periods. Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal (In millions) 2009 2008 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations $ 812.4 $ 830.2 $ 726.8 Net income from continuing operations 447.0 477.5 441.1 Depreciation 149.1 116.6 94.2 Amortization of intangible assets 125.6 99.9 64.4 Share based compensation 132.8 113.3 77.3 Net cash used in investing activities of continuing operations (432.4 ) (86.1 ) (1,412.5 ) Acquisitions of businesses and intangible assets, net of cash acquired (187.4 ) (264.5 ) (1,271.8 ) Net (purchases) sales of available for sale debt securities (66.7 ) 347.9 59.8 Purchases of property and equipment (182.5 ) (306.1 ) (153.2 ) Proceeds from sales of assets and divestitures of businesses 132.0 54.9 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (110.3 ) (586.5 ) 733.9 Issuance of long term debt, net of discounts 997.8 Purchase of treasury stock (300.2 ) (800.0 ) (506.8 ) Net proceeds from issuance of common stock under employee stock plans 183.6 196.9 211.4 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 265.6 158.1 75.6 Operating Activities During fiscal 2009 we generated $812.4 million in cash from our continuing operations. This included net income from continuing operations of $447.0 million, adjustments for depreciation and amortization of $274.7 million, and an adjustment for share based compensation of $132.8 million. Depreciation expense increased in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 due in part to depreciation for a new data center that we began occupying in the second half of fiscal 2009. Share based compensation increased in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 due to our broad use of restricted stock units in addition to stock options. During fiscal 2008 we generated $830.2 million in cash from our continuing operations. This included net income from continuing operations of $477.5 million, adjustments for depreciation and amortization of $216.5 million, and an adjustment for share based compensation of $113.3 million. Depreciation expense increased in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 due in part to the amortization of leasehold improvements for new office facilities that we occupied in early fiscal 2008. Amortization expense increased in the same period primarily due to our February 2007 acquisition of Digital Insight. Share based compensation increased in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 due to our broad use of restricted stock units in addition to stock options. During fiscal 2007 we generated $726.8 million in cash from our continuing operations. This included net income from continuing operations of $441.1 million, adjustments for depreciation and amortization of $158.6 million, and an adjustment for share based compensation of $77.3 million. Amortization expense increased in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 due to our February 2007 acquisition of Digital Insight. Investing Activities Investing activities used $432.4 million in cash during fiscal 2009, including $187.4 million for the acquisition of businesses (primarily PayCycle) and intangible assets, $182.5 million for capital expenditures and $66.7 million for 49 Table of Contents net purchases of investments. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2009 included investments in a new data center which we began occupying in the second half of fiscal 2009. Investing activities used $86.1 million in cash during fiscal 2008, including $264.5 million for acquisitions of businesses (primarily Homestead and ECHO) and $306.1 million for capital expenditures, partially offset by the receipt of $347.9 million from sales of investments and the receipt of $132.0 million from the sale of our Intuit Distribution Management Solutions business and certain outsourced payroll assets. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2008 included investments in a new data center and expansion of office capacity to support the expected growth in our business. Investing activities used $1.4 billion in cash during fiscal 2007, including $1.3 billion for the acquisition of Digital Insight and $153.2 million for capital expenditures. Financing Activities We used $110.3 million in cash for financing activities during fiscal 2009, including $300.2 million for the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase programs partially offset by $183.6 million from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans. At July 31, 2009, we had authorization from our Board of Directors to expend up to an additional $299.8 million for stock repurchases through May 15, 2011. We used $586.5 million in cash for financing activities during fiscal 2008, including $800 million for the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase programs partially offset by $196.9 million from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans. Financing activities provided $733.9 million during fiscal 2007, including $1 billion from the issuance of senior notes and $211.4 million from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans, partially offset by the use of $506.8 million for the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase programs. Stock Repurchase Programs Our Board of Directors has authorized a series of common stock repurchase programs. Shares of common stock repurchased under these programs become treasury shares. During fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 we repurchased 10.9 million, 27.2 million and 17.1 million shares of our common stock for $300.2 million, $800.0 million and $506.6 million under our repurchase programs. At July 31, 2009, we had authorization from our Board of Directors to expend up to an additional $299.8 million for stock repurchases through May 15, 2011. Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility On March 22, 2007 we entered into an agreement with certain institutional lenders for a $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire on March 22, 2012. Advances under the credit facility will accrue interest at rates that are equal to, at our election, either Citibanks base rate or the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin that ranges from 0.18% to 0.575% based on our senior debt credit ratings. The applicable interest rate will be increased by 0.05% for any period in which the total principal amount of advances and letters of credit under the credit facility exceeds $250 million. The agreement includes covenants that require us to maintain a ratio of total debt to annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of not greater than 3.25 to 1.00 and a ratio of annual EBITDA to interest payable of not less than 3.00 to 1.00. We may use amounts borrowed under this credit facility for general corporate purposes or for future acquisitions or expansion of our business. To date we have not borrowed under the credit facility. We monitor counterparty risk associated with the institutional lenders that are providing the credit facility. We currently believe that the credit facility will be available to us should we choose to borrow under it. Acquisition of Mint Software Inc. On September 11, 2009 we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Mint Software Inc., a provider of online personal finance management services. The cash transaction is valued at approximately $170 million, including the assumption of Mint outstanding stock options. Mint will become part of our Other Businesses segment. The 50 Table of Contents transaction is subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions. We expect the transaction to close before the end of calendar 2009. Liquidity and Capital Resource Requirements We evaluate, on an ongoing basis, the merits of acquiring technology or businesses, or establishing strategic relationships with and investing in other companies. We may decide to use cash and cash equivalents, investments, and our revolving line of credit facility to fund such activities in the future. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, contractual obligations, commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for at least the next 12 months. As discussed above in this Item 7 under Auction Rate Securities, we do not believe that the reduction in the liquidity of our municipal auction rate securities will have a material impact on our overall ability to meet our liquidity needs. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At July 31, 2009, we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S K. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our known contractual obligations to make future payments at July 31, 2009: Payments Due by Period Less than 1 3 3 5 More than (In millions) 1 year years years 5 years Total Amounts due under executive deferred compensation plan $ 36.7 $ $ $ $ 36.7 Senior unsecured notes 500.00 500.0 1,000.0 Interest and fees due on long term obligations 56.3 111.9 57.5 86.3 312.0 License fee payable (1) 10.0 20.0 20.0 50.0 100.0 Operating leases 54.0 93.0 73.7 102.4 323.1 Purchase obligations (2) 47.4 30.8 0.5 78.7 Total contractual obligations (3) $ 204.4 $ 755.7 $ 151.7 $ 738.7 $ 1,850.5 (1) In May 2009 we entered into an agreement to license certain technology for $20 million in cash and $100 million payable over the next ten fiscal years. See Note 4 and Note 9 to the financial statements in Item 8. (2) Represents agreements to purchase products and services that are enforceable, legally binding and specify terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the payments. (3) Excludes $47.6 million of non current uncertain tax benefits under FIN 48, which are included in other long term obligations on our balance sheet at July 31, 2009. We have not included this amount in the table above because we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate regarding the timing of settlements with taxing authorities, if any. 51 Table of Contents Innovative Merchant Solutions Loan and Buyout Commitments In April 2005 our wholly owned subsidiary, Innovative Merchant Solutions (IMS), became a member of Superior Bankcard Services, LLC (SBS), a newly formed entity that acquires merchant accounts for IMS. In connection with the formation of this entity IMS agreed to provide to SBS revolving loans in an amount of up to $40.0 million under the terms of a credit agreement. The credit agreement expires in July 2013, although certain events, such as a sale of SBS, could trigger earlier termination. Amounts outstanding under the agreement at July 31, 2009 totaled $6.8 million at interest rates of 4.3% to 5.0%. Amounts outstanding under the agreement at July 31, 2008 totaled $8.5 million at interest rates of 6.0% to 8.5%. There are no scheduled repayments on the outstanding loan balance. All unpaid principal amounts and the related accrued interest are due and payable in full at the loan expiration date. The operating agreement of SBS outlines a process for minority members and IMS to negotiate a buyout of the minority member interests. This process began in July 2009. If the parties are not able to reach agreement, the SBS operating agreement provides for a possible sale of SBS to a third party. Recent Accounting Pronouncements For a description of recent accounting pronouncements and the potential impact of these pronouncements on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows, see Note 1 to the financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Investment Portfolio There has been significant deterioration and instability in the financial markets during fiscal 2009. This period of extraordinary disruption and readjustment in the financial markets exposes us to additional investment risk. The value and liquidity of the securities in which we invest could deteriorate rapidly and the issuers of these securities could be subject to credit rating downgrades. In light of the current market conditions and these additional risks, we actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities in which we invest. We believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highly rated securities and diversify our portfolio of investments. While we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment related risks, such risks cannot be fully eliminated because of market circumstances that are outside our control. Our investments consist of instruments that meet quality standards that are consistent with our investment policy. This policy specifies that, except for direct obligations of the United States government, securities issued by agencies of the United States government, and money market funds, we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer. We do not hold derivative financial instruments in our portfolio of investments. See Note 10 to the financial statements in Item 8, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources, in Item 7; and Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for a description of market events that have affected the liquidity of certain municipal auction rate securities that we held at July 31, 2009. The following table presents our portfolio of cash equivalents and available for sale debt securities as of July 31, 2009 by stated maturity. The table is classified by the original maturity date listed on the security and includes cash equivalents, which consist primarily of money market funds. At July 31, 2009, the weighted average tax adjusted interest rate earned on our money market accounts was 0.57% and the weighted average tax adjusted interest rate earned on our investments was 1.20%. Years Ending July 31, 2015 and (In thousands) 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total Cash equivalents $ 893,021 $ $ $ $ $ $ 893,021 Investments 185,367 160,185 4,997 4,242 16,542 296,785 668,118 Long term investments 93,650 93,650 Total $ 1,078,388 $ 160,185 $ 4,997 $ 4,242 $ 16,542 $ 390,435 $ 1,654,789 Interest Rate Risk Our cash equivalents and investments are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents and investments and the value of those investments. Should the Federal Reserve Target Rate increase by 25 basis points from the level of July 31, 2009, the value of our investments would decrease by approximately $0.9 million. Should the Federal Reserve Target Rate increase by 100 basis points from the level of July 31, 2009, the value of our investments would decrease by approximately $3.6 million. We are also exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates as they affect our $500 million revolving credit facility. Advances under the credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to Citibanks base rate or the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin that ranges from 0.18% to 0.575% based on our senior debt credit ratings. Consequently, our interest expense would fluctuate with changes in the general level of these interest rates if we were to borrow any amounts under the credit facility. At July 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. 53 Table of Contents On March 12, 2007 we issued $500 million of 5.40% senior unsecured notes due on March 15, 2012 and $500 million of 5.75% senior unsecured notes due on March 15, 2017. Since these senior notes bear interest at fixed rates, they are not subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Impact of Foreign Currency Rate Changes The functional currencies of our international operating subsidiaries are the local currencies. We translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. We translate their revenue, costs and expenses at the average rates of exchange in effect during the period. We include translation gains and losses in the stockholders equity section of our balance sheets. We include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in interest and other income in our statements of operations. Since we translate foreign currencies (primarily Canadian dollars, British pounds, Indian rupees and Singapore dollars) into U.S dollars for financial reporting purposes, currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results. The historical impact of currency fluctuations has generally been immaterial. We believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not significant primarily because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies. Although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial in the past and we believe that for the reasons cited above currency fluctuations will not be significant in the future, there can be no guarantee that the impact of currency fluctuations will not be material in the future. As of July 31, 2009 we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities. 54 Table of Contents
