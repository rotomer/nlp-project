Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments underlying our financial statements. Results of Operations that includes a more detailed discussion of our revenue and expenses. Liquidity and Capital Resources which discusses key aspects of our statements of cash flows, changes in our balance sheets and our financial commitments. You should note that this MDA discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Please see the section entitled Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors at the beginning of Item 1A for important information to consider when evaluating such statements. You should read this MDA in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes in Item 8 of this report. In fiscal 2008 we acquired Homestead Technologies Inc. and Electronic Clearing House, Inc. (ECHO), in fiscal 2009 we acquired PayCycle, Inc., and in fiscal 2010 we acquired Mint Software Inc. and Medfusion, Inc. We have included the results of operations for each of them in our consolidated results of operations from their respective dates of acquisition. We have reclassified our financial statements for all periods presented to reflect our Intuit Distribution Management Solutions and Intuit Real Estate Solutions businesses as discontinued operations. See Results of Operations Discontinued Operations and Dispositions later in this Item 7 for more information. Unless otherwise noted, the following discussion pertains only to our continuing operations. Executive Overview This overview provides a high level discussion of our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business. We believe that an understanding of these trends is important in order to understand our financial results for fiscal 2010 as well as our future prospects. This summary is not intended to be exhaustive, nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Overview of Financial Results Total net revenue for fiscal 2010 was $3.5 billion, an increase of 11% compared with fiscal 2009. Revenue was higher in all of our business segments. Consumer Tax segment revenue increased $150 million or 15% due to growth in TurboTax Online units. Operating income from continuing operations increased 26% in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009. Cost of service and other revenue as a percentage of related revenue was slightly lower in fiscal 2010 due to unit growth in TurboTax Online units. Operating expenses increased due to incentive compensation that was directly related to our financial results and the addition of operating expenses for acquired businesses. Net income from continuing operations increased 21% in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was approximately 34% and our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 was approximately 31%. Due to all of the foregoing factors, diluted net income per share from continuing operations of $1.66 for fiscal 2010 grew 23% compared with fiscal 2009. We ended fiscal 2010 with cash, cash equivalents and investments totaling $1.6 billion. In fiscal 2010 we generated cash from operations, from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans, and from the sale of our Intuit Real Estate Solutions business. During the same period we used cash for the repurchase of shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, for net purchases of investments, for the acquisitions of Mint and Medfusion, and for capital expenditures. At July 31, 2010, we had expended all funds authorized by our Board of Directors for stock repurchases. On August 19, 2010 we announced a new stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to an additional $2 billion of our common stock from time to time over a three year period ending on August 16, 2013. 33 Table of Contents Seasonality Our QuickBooks, Consumer Tax and Accounting Professionals offerings are highly seasonal. Revenue from our QuickBooks software products tends to be highest during our second and third fiscal quarters. Sales of income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from November through April. In our Consumer Tax business, a greater proportion of our revenue has been occurring later in this seasonal period due in part to the growth in sales of TurboTax Online, for which revenue is recognized upon printing or electronic filing of a tax return. These seasonal patterns mean that our total net revenue is usually highest during our second quarter ending January 31 and third quarter ending April 30. We typically report losses in our first quarter ending October 31 and fourth quarter ending July 31, when revenue from our tax businesses is minimal while operating expenses continue at relatively consistent levels. We believe the seasonality of our revenue and profitability is likely to continue in the future. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates In preparing our financial statements, we make estimates, assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue, operating income or loss and net income or loss, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Senior management has reviewed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and their disclosure in this Annual Report on Form 10 K with the Audit and Risk Committee of our Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition We derive revenue from the sale of packaged software products, license fees, software subscriptions, product support, hosting services, payroll services, merchant services, professional services, transaction fees and multiple element arrangements that may include any combination of these items. We follow the appropriate revenue recognition rules for each type of revenue. For additional information, see Revenue Recognition in Note 1 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this report. We generally recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable. However, determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report. For example, for multiple element arrangements we must make assumptions and judgments in order to allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver, to determine whether undelivered services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services, to determine whether vendor specific evidence of fair value exists for each undelivered element and to determine whether and when each element has been delivered. If we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments, it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period. Amounts for fees collected or invoiced and due relating to arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized when the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied. In connection with the sale of certain products, we provide a limited amount of free technical support assistance to customers. We do not defer the recognition of any revenue associated with sales of these products since the cost of providing this free technical support is insignificant. The technical support is generally provided within one year after the associated revenue is recognized and free product enhancements are minimal and infrequent. We accrue the estimated cost of providing this free support upon product shipment. Return and Rebate Reserves As part of our revenue recognition policy, we estimate future product returns and rebate payments and establish reserves against revenue at the time of sale based on these estimates. Our return policy allows distributors and retailers, subject to contractual limitations, to return purchased products. Product returns by distributors and retailers relate primarily to the return of excess and obsolete products. In determining our product returns reserves, we consider the volume and price mix of products in the retail channel, historical return rates for prior releases of the 34 Table of Contents product, trends in retailer inventory and economic trends that might impact customer demand for our products (including the competitive environment and the timing of new releases of our products). We fully reserve for excess and obsolete products in the distribution channels. Our rebate reserves include distributor and retailer sales incentive rebates and end user rebates. Our estimated reserves for distributor and retailer incentive rebates are based on distributors and retailers actual performance against the terms and conditions of rebate programs, which we typically establish annually. Our reserves for end user rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the specific promotional rebate program, actual sales during the promotion and historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program. In the past, actual returns and rebates have not differed significantly from the reserves that we have established. However, actual returns and rebates in any future period are inherently uncertain. If we were to change our assumptions and estimates, our revenue reserves would change, which would impact the net revenue we report. If actual returns and rebates are significantly greater than the reserves we have established, the actual results would decrease our future reported revenue. Conversely, if actual returns and rebates are significantly less than our reserves, this would increase our future reported revenue. For example, if we had increased our fiscal 2010 returns reserves by 1% of non consignment sales to retailers for QuickBooks, TurboTax and Quicken, our total net revenue for fiscal 2010 would have been about $3 million lower. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We make ongoing assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable. The accounts receivable amounts presented on our balance sheets include reserves for accounts that might not be paid. In determining the amount of these reserves, we consider our historical level of credit losses. We also make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations, and we assess current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future. Our reserves have generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses. However, since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, we cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be adequate. If actual credit losses are significantly greater than the reserve we have established, that would increase our general and administrative expenses and reduce our reported net income. Conversely, if actual credit losses are significantly less than our reserve, this would eventually decrease our general and administrative expenses and increase our reported net income. We had a total of $157 million in gross accounts receivable on our balance sheet at July 31, 2010. Fair Value of Investments As described in Note 2 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this report, we estimate the fair value of our available for sale securities each quarter. These investments consist of cash equivalents, municipal bonds, U.S. treasury securities, U.S. agency securities, corporate notes and municipal auction rate securities. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. When identical or similar assets are traded in active markets, the level of judgment required to estimate their fair value is relatively low. This is generally true for our cash equivalents, which we consider to be Level 1 assets, and our municipal bonds, U.S. agency securities and corporate notes, which we consider to be Level 2 assets. However, significant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities when observable inputs are not available (Level 3). For example, we use a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of our municipal auction rate securities because we have determined that the market for those securities is inactive. We based this determination on the fact that due to a decrease in liquidity in the global credit markets, regularly scheduled auctions for the municipal auction rate securities we hold have generally failed since February 2008. Some of the key inputs to our discounted cash flow model are inherently uncertain. The key inputs include projected future interest rates; the likely timing of principal repayments; the probability of full repayment; publicly available pricing data for recently issued similar securities that are not subject to auctions; and the impact of the reduced liquidity for auction rate securities. At July 31, 2010, we held a total of $87 million in municipal auction rate securities. We record unrealized gains and losses on our available for sale securities in other comprehensive income in the equity section of our balance sheet until the security is sold or we determine that the decrease in fair value is other than temporary. We consider a number of factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge, including the reason for the decrease in fair value, the severity of the decrease in fair value, the length of time that 35 Table of Contents the fair value has been less than the cost basis of the security, the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, and whether we intend to sell or may be required to sell the security before anticipated recovery of our cost basis. Changes in our estimates of the fair values of our available for sale securities may result in material increases or decreases in our net income in the period in which the change occurs. Fair Value of Nonfinancial Assets and Nonfinancial Liabilities We estimate the fair values of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that we do not recognize or disclose at fair value on a recurring basis (at least annually) in accordance with authoritative guidance. These include nonfinancial assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, reporting units measured at fair value in a goodwill impairment test, and other nonfinancial assets or liabilities measured at fair value for impairment testing. We define fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Given the nature of nonfinancial assets and liabilities, evaluating their fair value from the perspective of a market participant is inherently complex. For example, if there are no known markets or we do not have access to any markets, we are required to identify hypothetical market participants and develop a hypothetical market based on the expected assumptions of those market participants. In addition, we are required to consider and use all appropriate valuation methods. Using multiple valuation methods can yield a range of possible results, which we must evaluate in order to choose the most representative point within the range. Assumptions and estimates about future values can be affected by a variety of internal and external factors. Changes in these factors may require us to revise our estimates and record future impairment charges for goodwill and acquired intangible assets, or retroactively adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in connection with business combinations. These charges and adjustments could materially decrease our operating income and net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet. Business Combinations As described in Note 1, Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Business Combinations, in Item 8 of this report, under the acquisition method of accounting we generally recognize the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interests in an acquiree at their fair values as of the date of acquisition. We measure goodwill as the excess of consideration transferred, which we also measure at fair value, over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The acquisition method of accounting requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition, including the fair values of identifiable intangible assets, deferred tax asset valuation allowances, liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, and contingencies. This method also requires us to refine these estimates over a one year measurement period to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. If we are required to retroactively adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions, these adjustments could materially decrease our operating income and net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet. Significant estimates and assumptions in estimating the fair value of acquired technology, customer lists, and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets. If the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, we could record impairment charges. In addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. If our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed. 36 Table of Contents Goodwill, Acquired Intangible Assets and Other Long Lived Assets Impairment Assessments We estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets and other long lived assets that have finite useful lives whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. We test for potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or whenever indicators of impairment arise. The timing of the annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods. As described in Note 1 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this report, in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill we use a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow model (known as the income approach) and comparisons to publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses (known as the market approach). The income approach requires us to use a number of assumptions, including market factors specific to the business, the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the business over an extended period of time, long term growth rates for the business, and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money. We evaluate cash flows at the reporting unit level and the number of reporting units that we have identified may make impairment more probable than it would be at a company with fewer reporting units and more integrated operations following acquisitions. Although the assumptions we use in our discounted cash flow model are consistent with the assumptions we use to generate our internal strategic plans and forecasts, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows from each reporting unit and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows. When using the market approach, we make judgments about the comparability of publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses. We base our judgments on factors such as size, growth rates, profitability, risk, and return on investment. We also make judgments when adjusting market multiples of revenue, operating income, and earnings for these companies to reflect their relative similarity to our own businesses. We had a total of $1.9 billion in goodwill on our balance sheet at July 31, 2010. See Note 5 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this report for a summary of goodwill by reportable segment. We estimate the recoverability of acquired intangible assets and other long lived assets that have finite useful lives by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that we expect the asset to generate. In order to estimate the fair value of those assets, we estimate the present value of future cash flows from those assets. The key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model are the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money. Significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows. We also make judgments about the remaining useful lives of acquired intangible assets and other long lived assets that have finite lives. We had a total of $256 million in net acquired intangible assets on our balance sheet at July 31, 2010. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. For example, if our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of one or more of our reporting units, we may be required to record future impairment charges for goodwill and acquired intangible assets. Impairment charges could materially decrease our future net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test. As described in Note 1, Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill, Acquired Intangible Assets and Other Long Lived Assets, in step one of that test we compared the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The estimated fair values of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and we concluded that they were not impaired. Consequently, we recorded no goodwill impairment charges for the twelve months ended July 31, 2010. During our fiscal 2010 goodwill impairment analysis, we concluded that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values. The estimated fair value of our Financial Services reporting unit exceeded its carrying value of $1.1 billion by approximately 18%, compared with approximately 5% 37 Table of Contents in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. In the course of estimating the fair value of our Financial Services reporting unit, we considered the extent to which it was consistently meeting or exceeding internal financial expectations and key business milestones, and the extent to which it was consistently meeting or exceeding the financial performance of similar lines of business within comparable companies. The fiscal 2010 increase in fair value for this reporting unit was predominantly due to increases in revenue, operating income, and earnings multiples for comparable publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses, which are key inputs to the market approach analysis that we perform. As discussed above, estimates of fair value for all of our reporting units can be affected by a variety of external and internal factors. The recent global economic downturn has caused significant disruptions in global financial markets and in the banking and financial services industry. Potential events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the key assumptions we used in estimating the fair value of our Financial Institutions reporting unit include the consolidation or failure of financial institutions, which may result in a smaller market for our products and services and may cause us to lose relationships with key customers, and cost cutting efforts by financial institutions, which may cause us to lose current or potential customers or achieve less revenue per customer. If the estimated fair value of our Financial Institutions reporting unit declines due to any of these factors, we may be required to record future goodwill impairment charges. Accounting for Share Based Compensation Plans At July 31, 2010, there was $280 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested share based compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans which we will amortize to expense in the future. Total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures. We expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average vesting period of 2.1 years. We use a lattice binomial model and the assumptions described in Note 12 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this report to estimate the fair value of stock options granted. We estimate the expected term of options granted based on implied exercise patterns using a binomial model. We estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the implied volatility of publicly traded one year and two year options on our common stock. Our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. We base the risk free interest rate that we use in our option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on constant maturity U.S. Treasury issues with equivalent remaining terms. We have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we use an expected dividend yield of zero in our option valuation model. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. We amortize the fair value of options on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods. We may elect to use different assumptions under our option valuation model in the future, which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share. Restricted stock units (RSUs) granted typically vest based on continued service. We value these time based RSUs at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method and amortize those values on a straight line basis adjusted for estimated forfeitures over the restriction period. Certain RSUs granted to senior management vest based on the achievement of pre established performance or market goals. We estimate the fair value of performance based RSUs at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method and the probability that the specified performance criteria will be met. We amortize those fair values over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award. We estimate the fair value of market based RSUs at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation methodology and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award. Legal Contingencies We are subject to certain legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business. We review the status of each significant matter quarterly and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount 38 Table of Contents can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability and an expense for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our accruals are based on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Potential legal liabilities and the revision of estimates of potential legal liabilities could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. Income Taxes Estimates of Deferred Taxes, Valuation Allowances and Uncertain Tax Positions We estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the United States Internal Revenue Service or other taxing jurisdictions. We estimate our current tax liability and assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which we show on our balance sheet. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized. To the extent we believe that realization is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. When we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period, we record a corresponding tax expense in our statement of operations. At July 31, 2010, we had net deferred tax assets of $158 million which included a valuation allowance of $8 million for certain state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards. We recorded the valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets before they expire. The valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable. While we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we could in the future be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize. An increase in the valuation allowance would have an adverse impact, which could be material, on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we record the increase. We recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a two step approach. The first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. We evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. Our evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues. Changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change, which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results. 39 Table of Contents Results of Operations Financial Overview Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal 2010 2009 2009 2008 (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2010 2009 2008 % Change % Change Total net revenue $ 3,455 $ 3,109 $ 2,993 11 % 4 % Operating income from continuing operations 863 683 644 26 % 6 % Net income from continuing operations 539 447 447 21 % 0 % Diluted net income per share from continuing operations $ 1.66 $ 1.35 $ 1.32 23 % 2 % Fiscal 2010 Compared with Fiscal 2009 Total net revenue increased $346 million or 11% in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009. In our Small Business Group, Financial Management Solutions segment revenue increased 6% due to strength in Intuit Websites and higher average selling prices for QuickBooks. Employee Management Solutions segment revenue increased 15% due to our July 2009 acquisition of PayCycle and price increases for desktop payroll customers. Payment Solutions segment revenue increased 8% due to growth in the merchant customer base, partially offset by lower transaction volume per merchant. In our Tax businesses, Consumer Tax segment revenue increased 15% due to 19% growth in TurboTax Online units. Accounting Professionals segment revenue grew 6% due to price increases. Financial Services segment revenue increased 7% due to growth in bill pay end users and transaction volumes and higher FinanceWorks revenue. Other Businesses segment revenue increased 22% due to higher Quicken revenue and a favorable currency impact in our Canadian business. Operating income from continuing operations increased $180 million or 26% in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009. Total costs and expenses were $166 million higher in fiscal 2010. Total costs and expenses for fiscal 2010 increased about $38 million due to higher cost of service and other revenue associated with growth in service and other revenue; about $42 million due to higher incentive compensation expenses that were directly related to our financial performance; and about $46 million due to operating expenses for PayCycle, Mint and Medfusion. See Cost of Revenue and Operating Expenses later in this Item 7 for more information. Net income from continuing operations increased $92 million or 21% in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was approximately 34% and our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 was approximately 31%. See Income Taxes later in this item 7 for more information on the discrete tax items that affected both of these effective tax rates. Due to all of the foregoing factors, diluted net income per share from continuing operations of $1.66 in fiscal 2010 increased 23% compared with $1.35 in fiscal 2009. Fiscal 2009 Compared with Fiscal 2008 Total net revenue increased $116 million or 4% in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. Consumer Tax segment revenue increased $67 million or 7% in fiscal 2009 due to 36% growth in TurboTax Online units, which more than offset an 11% decrease in TurboTax desktop units. Payment Solutions segment revenue increased $37 million or 15% in fiscal 2009 due to growth in the core merchant services customer base and revenue from ECHO, partially offset by a decline in transaction processing volume per customer. Employee Management Solutions segment revenue increased $28 million or 8% in fiscal 2009 due to the realization of the full effect of pricing changes made in fiscal 2008. Accounting Professionals segment revenue increased $25 million or 8% in fiscal 2009 due to price increases and Financial Services revenue increased $12 million or 4% due to growth in online banking and bill pay end users, partially offset by a decline in revenue per end user. Revenue in our Other Businesses segment decreased $41 million or 16% in fiscal 2009 and revenue in our Financial Management Solutions segment decreased $13 40 Table of Contents million or 2%. We believe that fiscal 2009 revenue in these two segments was affected by slower small business and consumer spending. See Business Segment Results later in this Item 7 for more information. Operating income from continuing operations for fiscal 2009 increased $39 million or 6% compared with fiscal 2008. Total costs and expenses were $77 million higher in fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2009 total costs and expenses increased about $49 million due to our fiscal 2008 acquisitions of Homestead and ECHO; about $31 million due to higher advertising and other marketing expenses to support the launch and subsequent promotion of TurboTax 2008 and QuickBooks 2009; about $27 million due to higher depreciation expense for investments in our infrastructure; about $19 million due to higher share based compensation expense; and about $13 million due to a charge for the historical use of certain technology licensing rights. These increases in total costs and expenses were partially offset by decreases of about $45 million due to lower performance incentive payouts and about $33 million in compensation and benefit savings due to lower staffing levels and lower severance related charges in fiscal 2009. See Cost of Revenue and Operating Expenses later in this Item 7 for more information. Net income from continuing operations was flat in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2008 we recorded a pre tax gain of $52 million on the sale of certain outsourced payroll assets; there was no comparable transaction in fiscal 2009. See Discontinued Operations and Dispositions later in this Item 7 for more information. In addition, interest and other income decreased $25 million in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. The impact of lower interest rates more than offset the impact of higher average invested balances and resulted in $19 million lower interest income. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 was approximately 31% and our effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 was approximately 35%. See Income Taxes later in this Item 7 for more information about our effective tax rates for these periods. Due to the foregoing factors, diluted net income per share from continuing operations of $1.35 in fiscal 2009 increased 2% compared with $1.32 in fiscal 2008. Business Segment Results The information below is organized in accordance with our seven reportable business segments. Results for our Other Businesses segment have been adjusted for all periods presented to exclude results for our Intuit Real Estate Solutions business, which became a discontinued operation in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. See Note 8 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this report for more information. Segment operating income is segment net revenue less segment cost of revenue and operating expenses. Segment expenses do not include certain costs, such as corporate selling and marketing, product development, and general and administrative expenses and share based compensation expenses, which are not allocated to specific segments. These unallocated costs totaled $609 million in fiscal 2010, $514 million in fiscal 2009 and $542 million in fiscal 2008. Unallocated costs increased in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 due to increases in corporate selling and marketing expenses in support of the growth of our businesses. Segment expenses also do not include amortization of acquired technology and amortization of other acquired intangible assets. See Note 15 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this report for reconciliations of total segment operating income to consolidated operating income for each fiscal year presented. We calculate revenue growth rates and segment operating margin figures using dollars in thousands. Those results may vary slightly from figures calculated using the dollars in millions presented. 41 Table of Contents Financial Management Solutions Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal 2010 2009 2009 2008 (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 % Change % Change Product revenue $ 382 $ 383 $ 446 Service and other revenue 229 196 146 Total segment revenue $ 611 $ 579 $ 592 6 % 2 % % of total revenue 18 % 19 % 20 % Segment operating income $ 152 $ 113 $ 170 34 % 33 % % of related revenue 25 % 20 % 29 % Financial Management Solutions (FMS) product revenue is derived primarily from QuickBooks desktop software products and financial supplies such as paper checks, envelopes, invoices, business cards and business stationery. FMS service and other revenue is derived primarily from QuickBooks Online; QuickBooks support plans; Intuit Websites, which provides website design and hosting services for small and medium sized businesses; QuickBase; and royalties from small business online services. Fiscal 2010 Compared with Fiscal 2009 FMS total net revenue increased $32 million or 6% in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009. About half of this increase was due to Intuit Websites customer growth. In our QuickBooks desktop business, higher average selling prices more than offset a 2% decline in total paid QuickBooks software units. Average selling prices were higher in fiscal 2010 because we offered fewer promotional discounts compared with fiscal 2009. QuickBooks Online and QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions customer growth also contributed to higher revenue in fiscal 2010. FMS segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue increased to 25% in fiscal 2010 from 20% in fiscal 2009 due to the increase in revenue described above, partially offset by higher cost of revenue and customer service expenses associated with growth in Intuit Websites. Fiscal 2010 operating income also benefited from a decrease of about $16 million in staffing expenses compared with fiscal 2009. Fiscal 2009 Compared with Fiscal 2008 FMS total net revenue decreased $13 million or 2% in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. Excluding revenue from Homestead (now known as Intuit Websites), which we acquired in December 2007, FMS total net revenue decreased 6% in fiscal 2009. Total QuickBooks software unit sales, including activations of our free Simple Start offering, were up 6% in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. Revenue per QuickBooks unit was lower in fiscal 2009 due to price promotion programs in some of our sales channels. QuickBooks Online subscriptions grew 11% and active QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions customers were up 12% in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. FMS segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue decreased to 20% in fiscal 2009 from 29% in fiscal 2008 due to the decrease in revenue described above and higher costs and expenses. Selling and marketing expenses increased approximately $41 million in fiscal 2009, including about $13 million due to our fiscal 2008 acquisition of Homestead and about $15 million due to higher advertising and other marketing expenses to support the launch and subsequent promotion of QuickBooks 2009. Product development expenses increased approximately $7 million in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. 42 Table of Contents Employee Management Solutions Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal 2010 2009 2009 2008 (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 % Change % Change Product revenue $ 249 $ 237 $ 213 Service and other revenue 169 128 124 Total segment revenue $ 418 $ 365 $ 337 15 % 8 % % of total revenue 12 % 12 % 11 % Segment operating income $ 253 $ 208 $ 166 22 % 25 % % of related revenue 60 % 57 % 49 % Employee Management Solutions (EMS) product revenue is derived primarily from QuickBooks Basic Payroll and QuickBooks Enhanced Payroll, which are products sold on a subscription basis that offer payroll tax tables, payroll reports, federal and state payroll tax forms, and electronic tax payment and filing to small businesses that prepare their own payrolls. EMS service and other revenue is derived primarily from QuickBooks Online Payroll, Intuit Online Payroll, fees for direct deposit services, and other small business payroll and employee management services. Service and other revenue for this segment also includes interest earned on funds held for customers. Fiscal 2010 Compared with Fiscal 2009 EMS total net revenue increased $53 million or 15% in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009. Revenue was higher in fiscal 2010 due to our July 2009 acquisition of PayCycle and price increases for desktop payroll customers. EMS segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue increased to 60% in fiscal 2010 from 57% in fiscal 2009. Higher revenue was partially offset by higher costs and expenses due to our acquisition of PayCycle. Fiscal 2009 Compared with Fiscal 2008 EMS total net revenue increased $28 million or 8% in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 due predominantly to the realization of the full effect in fiscal 2009 of pricing changes made in fiscal 2008. PayCycle, which we acquired in July 2009, had a negligible effect on fiscal 2009 EMS revenue. EMS segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue increased to 57% in fiscal 2009 from 49% in fiscal 2008 due to higher revenue and lower costs and expenses. Total EMS costs and expenses decreased approximately $13 million due to about $22 million in lower Small Business Group common cost allocations partially offset by about $9 million in charges for asset write downs and consolidation of workforces that resulted from our July 2009 acquisition of PayCycle.

Service and other revenue for this segment also includes interest earned on funds held for customers. Fiscal 2010 Compared with Fiscal 2009 Payment Solutions total net revenue increased $22 million or 8% in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009, driven by 17% growth in the merchant customer base. Transaction volume per merchant declined 3% in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009, reflecting continued lower levels of consumer spending. Payment Solutions segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue increased to 21% in fiscal 2010 from 11% in fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2010, operating income was higher due to the increase in revenue described above and decreases of about $9 million in the allocation of facilities expenses and about $8 million in staffing expenses. Fiscal 2009 Compared with Fiscal 2008 Payment Solutions total net revenue increased $37 million or 15% in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. Revenue in fiscal 2009 increased due to 14% growth in our core merchant services customer base and revenue from ECHO, which we acquired in February 2008. Transaction volume per customer was down about 8% in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008, reflecting an overall reduction in consumer spending associated with the economic environment. Excluding revenue from ECHO, Payment Solutions segment revenue increased approximately 8% in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. Payment Solutions segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue decreased to 11% in fiscal 2009 from 17% in fiscal 2008. Higher fiscal 2009 revenue as described above was more than offset by a $49 million increase in segment costs and expenses. In fiscal 2009 total segment expense included increases of about $15 million due to our February 2008 acquisition of ECHO; about $11 million for higher cost of revenue in the core merchant services business; about $7 million for higher sales and marketing expenses and about $4 million for higher product development expenses in the core merchant services business; and about $4 million for higher depreciation from infrastructure investments.

Total federal TurboTax units were up 11% and TurboTax Online federal units grew 19% in fiscal 2010. Online federal units represented more than 70% of total federal TurboTax units for the 2009 consumer tax season. Consumer Tax segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue increased to 65% in fiscal 2010 from 63% in fiscal 2009. The growth in fiscal 2010 Consumer Tax revenue was partially offset by higher segment costs and expenses, including an increase of about $11 million in advertising and other marketing and sales expenses to support the launch and subsequent promotion of TurboTax 2009. Fiscal 2009 Compared with Fiscal 2008 Consumer Tax total net revenue increased $67 million or 7% in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. The fiscal 2009 revenue increase was due to 36% growth in federal TurboTax Online units, which more than offset an 11% decrease in federal TurboTax desktop units. We included federal electronic filing services with our TurboTax desktop software for the first time in the 2008 tax year. Net of related price increases, we estimate that this decision resulted in a reduction of about $25 million in Consumer Tax segment revenue for fiscal 2009. Consumer Tax segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue was flat at 63% in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008. The growth in fiscal 2009 Consumer Tax revenue was partially offset by higher segment costs and expenses, including an increase of about $16 million in advertising and other marketing expenses to support the launch and subsequent promotion of TurboTax 2008 and an increase of about $7 million in research and development expenses.

Financial Services service and other revenue is derived primarily from outsourced online banking software products that are hosted in our data centers and delivered as on demand service offerings to banks and credit unions. Fiscal 2010 Compared with Fiscal 2009 Financial Services total net revenue increased $21 million or 7% in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009. Revenue growth was driven about equally by higher bill pay revenue and higher FinanceWorks revenue. Bill pay revenue grew due to an 18% increase in bill pay end users and higher transaction volumes. Lower revenue per user partially offset growth in the bill pay end user customer base. FinanceWorks was introduced during fiscal 2009. Financial Services segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue decreased slightly to 21% in fiscal 2010 from 22% in fiscal 2009 due to higher revenue partially offset by higher segment costs and expenses. Cost of revenue increased about $14 million due to volume, sales mix and higher data center costs. Fiscal 2009 Compared with Fiscal 2008 Financial Services total net revenue increased $13 million or 4% in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. Internet banking end users increased 3% and bill pay end users were up 20% in fiscal 2009. Lower revenue per user partially offset growth in the Internet banking and bill pay customer bases. Financial Services segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue increased to 22% in fiscal 2009 from 19% in fiscal 2008 due to higher revenue and relatively stable costs and expenses in fiscal 2009. 46 Table of Contents Other Businesses Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal 2010 2009 2009 2008 (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 % Change % Change Product revenue $ 172 $ 150 $ 178 Service and other revenue 90 65 78 Total segment revenue $ 262 $ 215 $ 256 22 % 16 % % of total revenue 7 % 7 % 8 % Segment operating income $ 64 $ 62 $ 90 5 % 31 % % of related revenue 25 % 29 % 35 % Other Businesses consist primarily of Quicken, Mint.com, Intuit Health (anchored by Medfusion, Inc., which we acquired in May 2010) and our businesses in Canada and the United Kingdom. Quicken product revenue is derived primarily from Quicken desktop software products. Quicken service and other revenue is derived primarily from fees from consumer online transactions and Quicken Loans trademark royalties. Mint.com service revenue is derived primarily from lead generation fees. Intuit Health service revenue is derived from online patient to provider communication services. In Canada, product revenue is derived primarily from localized versions of QuickBooks and Quicken as well as consumer desktop tax return preparation software and professional tax preparation products. Service revenue in Canada consists primarily of revenue from payroll services and QuickBooks support plans. In the United Kingdom, product revenue is derived primarily from localized versions of QuickBooks and QuickBooks Payroll. Fiscal 2010 Compared with Fiscal 2009 Other Businesses total net revenue increased $47 million or 22% in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009. Revenue increased in fiscal 2010 due to 23% higher Quicken revenue that was driven by higher unit sales and a favorable foreign currency impact in our Canadian business. The weaker U.S. dollar accounted for approximately seven percentage points of Other Businesses segment revenue growth in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009. Other Businesses segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue decreased to 25% in fiscal 2010 from 29% in fiscal 2009. Higher fiscal 2010 revenue as described above was offset by higher costs and expenses associated with our November 2009 acquisition of Mint and by our continued investment in emerging market opportunities. Canadian costs and expenses were also higher in the 2010 periods due to the weaker U.S. dollar. Fiscal 2009 Compared with Fiscal 2008 Other Businesses total net revenue decreased $41 million or 16% in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. Quicken sales were down 15% in fiscal 2009, which we believe was due to the overall reduction in consumer spending. In addition, the stronger U.S. dollar contributed to a decline in revenues from our businesses in Canada and the UK, lowering Other Businesses segment revenue growth by approximately seven percentage points in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. Other Businesses segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue decreased to 29% in fiscal 2009 from 35% in fiscal 2008 due to the decrease in segment revenue in fiscal 2009. The impact of foreign exchange rates lowered revenue from our businesses in Canada and the United Kingdom by approximately $23 million, and also lowered total segment costs and expenses by approximately $13 million. 47 Table of Contents Cost of Revenue % of % of % of Fiscal Related Fiscal Related Fiscal Related (Dollars in millions) 2010 Revenue 2009 Revenue 2008 Revenue Cost of product revenue $ 144 10 % $ 156 11 % $ 154 10 % Cost of service and other revenue 460 23 % 422 24 % 381 25 % Amortization of acquired technology 49 n/a 59 n/a 55 n/a Total cost of revenue $ 653 19 % $ 637 20 % $ 590 20 % Our cost of revenue has three components: (1) cost of product revenue, which includes the direct costs of manufacturing and shipping our desktop software products; (2) cost of service and other revenue, which reflects direct costs associated with providing services, including data center costs related to delivering online services, and costs associated with revenue sharing and online transactions revenue; and (3) amortization of acquired technology, which represents the cost of amortizing developed technologies that we have obtained through acquisitions over their useful lives. Fiscal 2010 Compared with Fiscal 2009 Cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue decreased slightly to 10% in fiscal 2010 from 11% in fiscal 2009 due to product mix. Cost of service and other revenue as a percentage of service and other revenue decreased to 23% in fiscal 2010 from 24% in fiscal 2009 due to unit growth in TurboTax Online, which has relatively lower costs of revenue compared with our other service offerings. Amortization of acquired technology decreased in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 due to the completion of the amortization for certain Intuit Financial Services intangible assets that we acquired in fiscal 2007. Partially offsetting this decrease, we recorded a charge of $6 million for certain acquired technology that we no longer intend to use in our Financial Management Solutions segment. Fiscal 2009 Compared with Fiscal 2008 Cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue increased slightly to 11% in fiscal 2009 from 10% in fiscal 2008 due to product mix. Cost of service and other revenue as a percentage of service and other revenue decreased slightly to 24% in fiscal 2009 from 25% in fiscal 2008 due to unit growth in TurboTax Online and consumer electronic tax filing services, which have relatively lower costs of service revenue compared with our other service offerings. Partially offsetting this benefit, fiscal 2009 cost of service and other revenue included a $13 million charge for the historical use of certain technology licensing rights that we acquired in May 2009. Amortization of acquired technology increased in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 due primarily to the amortization of Homestead and ECHO purchased intangible assets, which we acquired in fiscal 2008. 48 Table of Contents Operating Expenses % of % of % of Total Total Total Fiscal Net Fiscal Net Fiscal Net (Dollars in millions) 2010 Revenue 2009 Revenue 2008 Revenue Selling and marketing $ 976 28 % $ 907 29 % $ 841 28 % Research and development 573 17 % 556 18 % 593 20 % General and administrative 348 10 % 284 9 % 290 10 % Amortization of other purchased intangible assets 42 1 % 42 1 % 35 1 % Total operating expenses $ 1,939 56 % $ 1,789 57 % $ 1,759 59 % Fiscal 2010 Compared with Fiscal 2009 Total operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenue decreased slightly to 56% in fiscal 2010 from 57% in fiscal 2009. Revenue grew $346 million and total operating expenses increased $150 million in fiscal 2010. Total operating expenses increases included about $42 million due to higher expenses for incentive compensation that were directly related to our financial results and about $46 million for the operating expenses of acquired businesses. Fiscal 2009 Compared with Fiscal 2008 Total operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenue decreased to 57% in fiscal 2009 from 59% in fiscal 2008. Revenue grew $116 million and total operating expenses increased $30 million. Total operating expenses increased about $32 million for the operating expenses of acquired businesses; about $31 million for advertising and other marketing expenses to support the launch and subsequent promotion of TurboTax 2008 and QuickBooks 2009; about $27 million due to higher depreciation expense for investments in our infrastructure; and about $17 million due to higher share based compensation expense. Share based compensation expense was higher in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 due to our broad use of restricted stock units in addition to stock options. These increases were partially offset by decreases of about $45 million due to lower performance incentive payouts and about $33 million in compensation and benefit savings due to lower staffing levels and lower severance related charges in fiscal 2009. Acquisition related charges increased in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 primarily due to the amortization of Homestead and ECHO purchased intangible assets, which we acquired in fiscal 2008. Non Operating Income and Expenses Interest Expense In March 2007 we issued $1 billion in senior notes. Interest expense of $61 million in fiscal 2010, $51 million in fiscal 2009, and $52 million in fiscal 2008 consisted primarily of interest on $500 million in principal amount of the senior notes at 5.40% and interest on $500 million in principal amount of the senior notes at 5.75%. The senior notes are due in March 2012 and March 2017 and are redeemable by Intuit at any time, subject to a make whole premium. 49 Table of Contents Interest and Other Income Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal (In millions) 2010 2009 2008 Interest income $ 9 $ 21 $ 39 Net gains (losses) on executive deferred compensation plan assets 4 (6 ) (3 ) Quicken Loans royalties and fees 8 8 Net foreign exchange gain (loss) 1 (1 ) 1 Other (1 ) (1 ) 1 Total interest and other income $ 13 $ 21 $ 46 Interest and other income consists primarily of interest income. The impact of lower interest rates more than offset the impact of higher average invested balances and resulted in lower interest income in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 and in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we record gains and losses associated with executive deferred compensation plan assets in interest and other income and gains and losses associated with the related liabilities in operating expense. The total amounts recorded in operating expense generally offset the total amounts recorded in interest and other income. Total interest and other income for fiscal 2009 and 2008 included royalties and fees from trademark license and distribution agreements that we entered into when we sold our Quicken Loans mortgage business in July 2002. Income Taxes Effective Tax Rate Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was approximately 34%. In that year we recorded discrete tax benefits of approximately $20 million that were related to foreign tax credit benefits associated with the distribution of profits from certain of our non U.S. subsidiaries and our plans to indefinitely reinvest substantially all remaining non U.S. earnings in support of our international expansion plans. Excluding those discrete tax benefits, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was approximately 36% and did not differ significantly from the federal statutory rate of 35%. State income taxes were partially offset by the benefit we received from the domestic production activities deduction and the federal research and experimentation credit. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 was approximately 31%. In that year we recorded discrete tax benefits of approximately $18 million for a favorable agreement with a state tax authority with respect to certain tax years including years ended prior to fiscal 2009 and approximately $7 million for the reinstatement of the federal research and experimentation credit through December 31, 2009 that was retroactive to January 1, 2008. Excluding those discrete tax benefits, our effective tax rate for that period was approximately 35% and did not differ significantly from the federal statutory rate of 35%. State income taxes were offset by the benefit we received from the federal research and experimentation credit, the domestic production activities deduction, and tax exempt interest income. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 was approximately 35% and did not differ significantly from the federal statutory rate of 35%. State income taxes were offset by the benefit we received from tax exempt interest income, the domestic production activities deduction, and the federal research and experimentation credit. See Note 11 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this report for more information about our effective tax rates. Tax Carryforwards At July 31, 2010, we had total federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $84 million that will start to expire in fiscal 2020. Utilization of the net operating losses is subject to annual limitation. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization. 50 Table of Contents At July 31, 2010, we had excess federal foreign tax credits of approximately $22 million, of which $2 million can be carried back and $20 million can be carried forward. The foreign tax credit carryforwards will start to expire in fiscal 2020. Our ability to utilize foreign tax credits is dependent upon having sufficient foreign source income during the carryforward period. The foreign source income limitation may result in the expiration of foreign tax credits before utilization. At July 31, 2010, we had total state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $163 million for which we have recorded a deferred tax asset of $9 million and a valuation allowance of $7 million. The state net operating losses will start to expire in fiscal 2014. Utilization of the net operating losses is subject to annual limitation. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization. Net Deferred Tax Assets At July 31, 2010, we had net deferred tax assets of $158 million which included a valuation allowance of $8 million for certain state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards. We recorded the valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets before they expire. While we believe our current valuation allowance is sufficient, we could in the future be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize. We assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. The assessment is based on our estimates of future sources of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the periods over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable. See Note 11 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this report for more information. Discontinued Operations and Dispositions During fiscal 2010 and 2008 we sold the businesses and assets described below. See Note 8 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this report for a more complete description of these discontinued operations and dispositions and for a summary of the impact that they have had on our statements of operations for those fiscal years. Intuit Real Estate Solutions Discontinued Operations In January 2010 we sold our Intuit Real Estate Solutions (IRES) business for $128 million in cash and recorded a net gain on disposal of $35 million. IRES was part of our Other Businesses segment. We have accounted for IRES as a discontinued operation and segregated its operating results from continuing operations in our statements of operations for all periods prior to the sale. Revenue from IRES was $33 million in fiscal 2010, $74 million in fiscal 2009 and $78 million in fiscal 2008. Intuit Distribution Management Solutions Discontinued Operations In August 2007 we sold our Intuit Distribution Management Solutions (IDMS) business for $100 million in cash and recorded a net gain on disposal of $28 million. IDMS was part of our Other Businesses segment. We have accounted for IDMS as a discontinued operation and segregated its operating results from continuing operations in our statements of operations for all periods prior to the sale. Revenue from IDMS was $2 million in fiscal 2008. Sale of Outsourced Payroll Assets In March 2007 we sold certain assets related to our Complete Payroll and Premier Payroll Service businesses to Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP). Pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement, customers transitioned to ADP over a period of approximately one year from the date of sale. We recorded a pre tax gain of $52 million in fiscal 2008 for customers who transitioned to ADP during that year. We recorded a total pre tax gain of $83 million from the inception of this transaction through its completion in the third quarter of fiscal 2008. The assets were part of our Employee Management Solutions segment. 51 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview At July 31, 2010, our cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $1.6 billion, an increase of $275 million from July 31, 2009 due to the factors described in Statements of Cash Flows below. Our primary source of liquidity has been cash from operations, which entails the collection of accounts receivable for products and services. Our primary uses of cash have been for research and development programs, selling and marketing activities, capital projects, acquisitions of businesses, debt service costs and repurchases of our common stock. On August 19, 2010 we announced a new stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to an additional $2 billion of our common stock from time to time over a three year period ending on August 16, 2013. See Stock Repurchase Programs later in this Item 7 for more information. In March 2007 we issued five year and ten year senior unsecured notes totaling $1 billion. We also have a $500 million unsecured revolving line of credit facility. To date we have not borrowed under the facility. The senior notes and the revolving line of credit are described later in this Item 7. The following table summarizes selected measures of our liquidity and capital resources at the dates indicated: July 31, July 31, $ % (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Change Change Cash, cash equivalents and investments $ 1,622 $ 1,347 $ 275 20 % Long term investments 91 97 (6 ) (6 %) Long term debt 998 998 0 % Working capital 1,074 884 190 21 % Ratio of current assets to current liabilities 1.9 : 1 1.8 : 1 Auction Rate Securities At July 31, 2010, we held a total of $87 million in municipal auction rate securities which we classified as long term investments based on the maturities of the underlying securities. All of these securities are rated A or better by the major credit rating agencies and are generally collateralized by student loans guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Education. Due to a decrease in liquidity in the global credit markets, in February 2008 auctions began failing for the municipal auction rate securities we held and in accordance with authoritative guidance we began estimating their fair value based on a discounted cash flow model that we prepared. See Note 2 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this report for more information. In November 2008 we accepted an offer from UBS AG (UBS), one of the broker dealers for our municipal auction rate securities, which gave us the option to sell UBS all of the municipal auction rate securities that we held through them at par. In June 2010 UBS settled the remaining balance of $110 million in municipal auction rate securities subject to the offer at par. Based on our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash, we do not believe that the reduction in liquidity of the municipal auction rate securities we held at July 31, 2010 will have a material impact on our overall ability to meet our liquidity needs. 52 Table of Contents Statements of Cash Flows The following table summarizes selected items from our statements of cash flows for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008. See the financial statements in Item 8 of this report for complete statements of cash flows for those periods. Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 998 $ 812 $ 830 Investing activities (997 ) (432 ) (87 ) Financing activities (467 ) (110 ) (586 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1 (4 ) 1 Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (465 ) $ 266 $ 158 Operating Activities During fiscal 2010 we generated $998 million in cash from our continuing operations. This included net income from continuing operations of $539 million, and adjustments for depreciation and amortization of $256 million and share based compensation of $135 million. Amortization expense was lower in fiscal 2010 compared with 2009 due to the completion of the amortization for certain Intuit Financial Services intangible assets that we acquired in fiscal 2007. Partially offsetting this decrease, fiscal 2010 amortization expense included a charge of $6 million for the write off of certain acquired technology that we no longer intend to use in our Financial Management Solutions segment. During fiscal 2009 we generated $812 million in cash from our continuing operations. This included net income from continuing operations of $447 million, and adjustments for depreciation and amortization of $275 million and share based compensation of $133 million. Depreciation expense increased in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 due in part to depreciation for a new data center that we began occupying in the second half of fiscal 2009. Share based compensation increased in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 due to our broad use of restricted stock units in addition to stock options. During fiscal 2008 we generated $830 million in cash from our continuing operations. This included net income from continuing operations of $447 million, and adjustments for depreciation and amortization of $217 million and share based compensation of $113 million. Depreciation expense increased in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 due in part to the amortization of leasehold improvements for new office facilities that we occupied in early fiscal 2008. Amortization expense increased in the same period primarily due to our February 2007 acquisition of Digital Insight. Share based compensation increased in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 due to our broad use of restricted stock units in addition to stock options. Investing Activities We used $997 million in cash for investing activities during fiscal 2010. We received a net $122 million in cash from the sale of our Intuit Real Estate Solutions business. We used $895 million in cash for net purchases of investments, $218 million in cash for acquisitions of businesses (primarily Mint and Medfusion), and $130 million in cash for capital expenditures. We used $432 million in cash for investing activities during fiscal 2009, including $161 million for the acquisition of businesses (primarily PayCycle), $182 million for capital expenditures, and $67 million for net purchases of investments. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2009 included investments in a new data center which we began occupying in the second half of fiscal 2009. We used $87 million in cash for investing activities during fiscal 2008, including $256 million for acquisitions of businesses (primarily Homestead and ECHO) and $306 million for capital expenditures, partially offset by the receipt of $348 million from net sales of investments and the receipt of $132 million from the sale of our Intuit 53 Table of Contents Distribution Management Solutions business and certain outsourced payroll assets. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2008 included investments in a new data center and expansion of office capacity to support the expected growth in our business. Financing Activities We used $467 million in cash for financing activities during fiscal 2010, including $900 million for the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase programs partially offset by the receipt of $440 million from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans. We used $110 million in cash for financing activities during fiscal 2009, including $300 million for the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase programs partially offset by receipt of $198 million from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans. We used $586 million in cash for financing activities during fiscal 2008, including $800 million for the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase programs partially offset by $203 million from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans. Stock Repurchase Programs Our Board of Directors has authorized a series of common stock repurchase programs. Shares of common stock repurchased under these programs become treasury shares. During fiscal 2010 we repurchased 28.7 million shares of our common stock under these programs for $900 million; during fiscal 2009 we repurchased 10.9 million shares for $300 million; and during fiscal 2008 we repurchased 27.2 million shares for $800 million. At July 31, 2010, we had expended all funds authorized by our Board of Directors for stock repurchases. On August 19, 2010 we announced a new stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to an additional $2 billion of our common stock from time to time over a three year period ending on August 16, 2013. Business Combinations We completed the business combinations and acquisitions described below during the three fiscal years ended July 31, 2010. We have included the results of operations for each of them in our consolidated results of operations from their respective dates of acquisition. Their results of operations for periods prior to the dates of acquisition were not material, individually or in the aggregate, when compared with our consolidated results of operations. On May 21, 2010 we acquired privately held Medfusion, Inc. for total consideration of approximately $89 million. The total consideration included approximately $10 million for the fair value of cash retention bonuses that will be charged to expense over a three year service period. Medfusion is a provider of online patient to provider communication solutions and became part of our Other Businesses segment. On November 2, 2009 we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of Mint Software Inc. for total consideration of approximately $170 million. The total consideration included approximately $24 million for cash retention bonuses and the fair value of assumed equity awards and Intuit common stock issued to the holder of Mint Series D Preferred Stock. The total of $24 million will be charged to expense over a three year service period. Mint is a provider of online personal finance services and became part of our Other Businesses segment. On July 23, 2009 we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of PayCycle, Inc. for a total purchase price of approximately $169 million, including the fair value of certain assumed stock options. PayCycle is a provider of online payroll solutions to small businesses and became part of our Employee Management Solutions segment. On February 29, 2008 we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of Electronic Clearing House, Inc. (ECHO) for a total purchase price of approximately $131 million in cash. ECHO is a provider of electronic payment processing services to small businesses and became part of our Payment Solutions segment. On December 18, 2007 we acquired Homestead Technologies Inc., including all of its outstanding equity interests, for total consideration of approximately $170 million on a fully diluted basis. The total consideration was comprised of the purchase price of $146 million (which included the fair value of vested stock options assumed) plus the $24 54 Table of Contents million fair value of unvested stock options and restricted stock units assumed. Homestead is a provider of website design and hosting services to small businesses and became part of our Financial Management Solutions segment. Commitments for Senior Unsecured Notes On March 12, 2007 we issued $500 million of 5.40% senior unsecured notes due on March 15, 2012 (the 2012 Notes) and $500 million of 5.75% senior unsecured notes due on March 15, 2017 (the 2017 Notes) (together, the Notes). The Notes are redeemable by Intuit at any time, subject to a make whole premium. Interest is payable semiannually on March 15 and September 15. At July 31, 2010, our maximum commitment for interest payments under the Notes was $255 million. We monitor the credit markets as part of our ongoing cash management activities. We currently intend to either pay off the 2012 Notes when they become due using operating cash or refinance those notes if the credit markets are favorable at that time. Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility On March 22, 2007 we entered into an agreement with certain institutional lenders for a $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire on March 22, 2012. Advances under the credit facility will accrue interest at rates that are equal to, at our election, either Citibanks base rate or the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin that ranges from 0.18% to 0.575% based on our senior debt credit ratings. The applicable interest rate will be increased by 0.05% for any period in which the total principal amount of advances and letters of credit under the credit facility exceeds $250 million. The agreement includes covenants that require us to maintain a ratio of total debt to annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of not greater than 3.25 to 1.00 and a ratio of annual EBITDA to interest payable of not less than 3.00 to 1.00. We were in compliance with these covenants at July 31, 2010. We may use amounts borrowed under this credit facility for general corporate purposes or for future acquisitions or expansion of our business. To date we have not borrowed under the credit facility. We monitor counterparty risk associated with the institutional lenders that are providing the credit facility. We currently believe that the credit facility will be available to us should we choose to borrow under it. Liquidity and Capital Resource Requirements We evaluate, on an ongoing basis, the merits of acquiring technology or businesses, or establishing strategic relationships with and investing in other companies. We may decide to use cash and cash equivalents, investments, and our revolving line of credit facility to fund such activities in the future. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, contractual obligations, commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for at least the next 12 months. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At July 31, 2010, we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S K. 55 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our known contractual obligations to make future payments at July 31, 2010: Payments Due by Period Less than 1 3 3 5 More than (In millions) 1 year years years 5 years Total Amounts due under executive deferred compensation plan $ 43 $ $ $ $ 43 Senior unsecured notes 500 500 1,000 Interest and fees due on long term obligations 56 84 58 57 255 License fee payable (1) 10 20 20 40 90 Operating leases 53 88 70 71 282 Purchase obligations (2) 61 31 6 98 Total contractual obligations (3) $ 223 $ 723 $ 154 $ 668 $ 1,768 (1) In May 2009 we entered into an agreement to license certain technology for $20 million in cash and $100 million payable over ten fiscal years. See Note 10 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this report for more information. (2) Represents agreements to purchase products and services that are enforceable, legally binding and specify terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the payments. (3) Excludes $20 million of non current uncertain tax benefits which are included in other long term obligations on our balance sheet at July 31, 2010. We have not included this amount in the table above because we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate regarding the timing of settlements with taxing authorities, if any. Recent Accounting Pronouncements For a description of recent accounting pronouncements and the potential impact of these pronouncements on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows, see Note 1 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this report. 56 Table of Contents ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Investment Portfolio There has been significant deterioration and instability in the financial markets during fiscal 2009 and 2010. This period of extraordinary disruption and readjustment in the financial markets exposes us to additional investment risk. The value and liquidity of the securities in which we invest could deteriorate rapidly and the issuers of these securities could be subject to credit rating downgrades. In light of the current market conditions and these additional risks, we actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities in which we invest. We believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highly rated securities and diversify our portfolio of investments. While we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment related risks, such risks cannot be fully eliminated because of market circumstances that are outside our control. Our investments consist of instruments that meet quality standards that are consistent with our investment policy. This policy specifies that, except for direct obligations of the United States government, securities issued by agencies of the United States government, and money market funds, we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer. We do not hold derivative financial instruments in our portfolio of investments. The following table presents our portfolio of cash equivalents and available for sale debt securities as of July 31, 2010 by stated maturity. The table is classified by the original maturity date listed on the security and includes cash equivalents, which consist primarily of money market funds. At July 31, 2010, the weighted average tax adjusted interest rate earned on our money market accounts was 0.42% and the weighted average tax adjusted interest rate earned on our investments was 1.10%. Years Ending July 31, 2016 and (In millions) 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total Cash equivalents $ 330 $ $ $ $ $ $ 330 Investments 433 366 164 10 4 581 1,558 Long term investments 87 87 Total $ 763 $ 366 $ 164 $ 10 $ 4 $ 668 $ 1,975 Interest Rate Risk Our cash equivalents and investments are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents and investments and the value of those investments. Should the Federal Reserve Target Rate increase by 25 basis points from the level of July 31, 2010, the value of our investments would decrease by approximately $3 million. Should the Federal Reserve Target Rate increase by 100 basis points from the level of July 31, 2010, the value of our investments would decrease by approximately $11 million. We are also exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates as they affect our $500 million revolving credit facility. Advances under the credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to Citibanks base rate or the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin that ranges from 0.18% to 0.575% based on our senior debt credit ratings. Consequently, our interest expense would fluctuate with changes in the general level of these interest rates if we were to borrow any amounts under the credit facility. At July 31, 2010, no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. On March 12, 2007 we issued $500 million of 5.40% senior unsecured notes due on March 15, 2012 and $500 million of 5.75% senior unsecured notes due on March 15, 2017. We carry these senior notes at face value less unamortized discount on our balance sheets. Since these senior notes bear interest at fixed rates, we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of these notes fluctuates when interest rates change. See Note 2 and Note 10 to the financial statements in Part 8 of this report for more information. 57 Table of Contents Impact of Foreign Currency Rate Changes The functional currencies of our international operating subsidiaries are generally the local currencies. We translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. We translate their revenue, costs and expenses at the average rates of exchange in effect during the period. We include translation gains and losses in the stockholders equity section of our balance sheets. We include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in interest and other income in our statements of operations. Since we translate foreign currencies (primarily Canadian dollars, British pounds, Indian rupees and Singapore dollars) into U.S dollars for financial reporting purposes, currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results. The historical impact of currency fluctuations has generally been immaterial. We believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not significant primarily because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies. Although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial in the past and we believe that for the reasons cited above currency fluctuations will not be significant in the future, there can be no guarantee that the impact of currency fluctuations will not be material in the future. As of July 31, 2010 we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities. 58 Table of Contents
