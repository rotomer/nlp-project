PROPERTIES Forestlands The principal raw material used by International Paper is wood in various forms. As of December 31, 2002, the Company or its subsidiaries owned or managed approximately 9 million acres of forestlands in the United States, 1.5 million acres in Brazil and had, through licenses and forest management agreements, harvesting rights on government owned timberlands in Canada and Russia. An additional 810,000 acres of forestlands in New Zealand were held through Carter Holt Harvey, a consolidated subsidiary of International Paper. During 2002, the Companys U.S. forestlands supplied 15.5 million tons of roundwood to its U.S. facilities, representing 30% of its wood fiber requirements. The balance was acquired from other private industrial and non industrial forestland owners, with only an insignificant amount coming from public lands of the United States government. In addition, in 2002, 6.2 million tons of wood were sold to other users. In November 1994, we adopted the Sustainable Forestry Principles developed by the American Forest and Paper Association in August 1994. Mills and Plants A listing of our production facilities, the vast majority of which we own, can be found in Appendix I hereto, which is incorporated herein by reference. The Companys facilities are in good operating condition and are suited for the purposes for which they are presently being used.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Corporate Overview Results of Operations For the year ended December 31, 2002, International Paper reported a net loss of $880 million ($1.83 per share) compared with a net loss of $1.2 billion ($2.50 per share) in 2001 and net earnings of $142 million ($.32 per share) in 2000. Amounts include the effects of special charges, extraordinary items and the cumulative effect of accounting changes. Special charges in 2002 included a charge of $199 million before taxes and minority interest ($130 million after taxes and minority interest) for asset shutdowns of excess internal capacity and cost reduction actions, a $450 million pre tax charge ($278 million after taxes) for additional exterior siding legal reserves, a $46 million charge before taxes and minority interest ($27 million after taxes and minority interest) for early debt retirement costs, $41 million before taxes and minority interest ($101 million after taxes and minority interest) of gains on sales of businesses held for sale, and a $68 million pre tax credit ($43 million after taxes) for the reversal of reserves no longer required. In addition, a $46 million credit was recorded to reduce the 2002 income tax provision in the fourth quarter for a reduction of deferred state income tax liabilities. Results for 2002 also included a charge of $1.2 billion after minority interest ($2.44 per share) for the cumulative effect of an accounting change to record the transitional impairment charge for the adoption of SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." In addition, a $1.5 billion after tax direct charge to equity (with no impact on operating results) was recorded in the 2002 fourth quarter related to International Papers qualified pension plans. These two items were non cash charges and had no adverse effect on existing debt covenants.

Earnings in 2002 benefited by approximately $185 million, or $.38 per share, from the exclusion of goodwill amortization as compared with 2001 amounts. After adjusting for this goodwill amortization difference, operating earnings improved nearly 40% in 2002 versus 2001. This improvement was principally due to the implementation of cost reduction initiatives and operational efficiencies despite lower average prices across all of our business segments. Results in 2002 also benefited from lower energy costs than in 2001. The earnings decline in 2002 versus 2000 was due mainly to lower prices and volumes. Earnings in 2000 included six months of Champions results of operations from the date of acquisition. Segment operating profit of $1.9 billion in 2002, was up from $1.8 billion in 2001, but down from $2.7 billion reported in 2000. Non price improvements, including lower overhead and raw material costs, combined with a favorable product mix accounted for about a $690 million operating profit improvement in 2002 compared with 2001. In addition, higher volume contributed another $60 million. Price declines experienced in 2002 resulted in lower operating profits of about $600 million. The improved return on investment (ROI) in 2002 was primarily due to better operating performance. ROI also benefited from working capital reductions and facility rationalizations. ROI before 7 special charges was 4.0% in 2002, 2.9% in 2001, and 5.3% in 2000. Cost reduction initiatives have been broad based. In 2002, the Printing Papers business restructured certain European operations and implemented a reduction in force plan in its coated papers mills. The Consumer Packaging business implemented a business reorganization plan and eliminated duplicative facilities. xpedx, our distribution business, consolidated facilities and began to streamline its transaction processing. Carter Holt Harvey made additional progress in improving the cost structure of its Kinleith mill. Also in 2002, International Paper continued to realign administrative functions across all businesses and staff support groups to reduce overhead costs. International Paper continued to balance our production with customer orders in 2002, taking about 600,000 tons of market related downtime across its mill system. This was down from 1.7 million tons in 2001, due mainly to capacity reductions. Approximately one million tons of capacity reduction actions were taken in 2001, with another 100,000 tons removed through the closure of our Hudson River mill in Corinth, New York in November 2002. Also, subsequent to year end, we announced plans to close our Natchez, Mississippi dissolving pulp mill in mid 2003. International Papers major focus is on three core businesses paper, packaging and forest products. In 2000, we announced a program to exit certain businesses that we considered to be non core or that did not meet our ROI criteria, and to sell certain other non strategic assets. During 2002, we completed the sales of our oriented strand board facilities and Decorative Products operations. Since the inception of this program, International Papers divestitures have generated proceeds in excess of $3 billion. In June 2002, International Paper discontinued plans to divest both the Arizona Chemical and Industrial Papers businesses while other small businesses and non strategic assets continue to be marketed. Net sales in 2002 totaled $25.0 billion, below both 2001 and 2000 net sales of $26.4 billion and $28.2 billion, respectively. The decrease from 2001 was primarily due to the impact of our divested businesses and lower average prices across most of our business segments. International net sales (including U.S. exports) totaled $7.5 billion, or 30% of total sales in 2002. This compares to sales of $7.1 billion in 2001 and $7.6 billion in 2000. The increase in 2002 versus 2001 is mainly due to increased revenues from Carter Holt Harvey. Export sales of $1.3 billion in 2002 were flat with 2001, but down from $1.6 billion in 2000, primarily due to the strong U.S. dollar that made U.S. products less competitive. Over the last few years, the softness in the U.S. economy, a weakening global economy and the strong dollar have had a significant negative impact on profits for International Paper and the Forest Products industry. One measure that we believe provides a reflection of International Papers improvement in operating performance is the companys return on investment before special charges compared with a peer group of competitors in the Forest Products industry. This comparison indicates that International Paper has moved from the bottom quartile in operating ROI in 1999 to a position of third in the peer group* of eight companies in 2002. We are pleased with these results, and we will continue to focus our efforts on further improvement in this comparative ROI measure in future years. Looking forward, we expect a slow but steady improvement in the business environment in 2003 following a weak first quarter that reflects a current general economic softness and seasonal factors. Continued geopolitical unrest and uncertainty could likely impede any improvement in the economy. Energy costs are also expected to be higher in 2003 than in 2002. We will continue to focus on cost reduction, manufacturing reliability and delivering greater value to our customers. *The 2002 peer group includes Boise, Georgia Pacific, MeadWestvaco, Smurfit Stone, Stora Enso, UPM Kymmene, Weyerhaeuser and International Paper. Description of Industry Segments International Papers industry segments discussed below are consistent with the internal structure used to manage these businesses. All segments, except for Carter Holt Harvey, are differentiated on a common product, common customer basis consistent with the business segmentation generally used in the Forest Products industry.

Industry Segment Results Printing Papers Printing Papers net sales for 2002 were down 4% from 2001 and increased 4% from 2000. Operating profits in 2002 were 4% lower than 2001 and were 44% lower than 2000. Lower earnings in our Coated Papers and Market Pulp businesses in 2002 more than offset increased profits from the Uncoated Papers business. Lower costs in 2002, including the benefits of broad based cost reduction efforts, lower energy and raw material costs, and rationalization benefits offset about 70% of the approximately $400 million negative effect of lower average prices versus 2001. Higher sales volumes and a more favorable product mix also helped to mitigate the negative price effect. The Printing Papers segment took 655,000 tons of downtime during 2002, including 325,000 tons of lack of order downtime to align production with customer demand. This compared with 1,015,000 tons of downtime in 2001, of which 700,000 related to lack oforders. In 2002, Printing Papers permanently shut down the Hudson River mill located in Corinth, New York, reducing coated paper capacity by approximately 100,000 tons. Capacity reductions announced during 2001 totaled about 350,000 tons. Printing Papers In millions 2002 2001 2000 Sales $7,510 $7,815 $7,210 Operating Profit $ 519 $ 538 $ 930 Uncoated Papers sales were $4.8 billion in 2002, down slightly from $4.9 billion in 2001 and flat compared with 2000. Overall average prices in 2002 declined from both 2001 and 2000. Annual 2002 shipments were relatively flat compared with 2001, with some volume growth in Europe and domestic operations maintaining volumes. Also, total capacity in the industry declined leading to higher operating rates. Operating profits increased 36% from 2001 and 15% from 2000 benefiting from manufacturing cost reductions, favorable operating efficiencies and lower administrative costs in our U.S. and European operations. In addition to the cost and efficiency initiatives, the businesss increased marketing focus on key customers in targeted business segments had a positive impact on earnings. U.S. operating results benefited from improved operating efficiencies and capacity reductions that led to higher machine operating rates. Price increases implemented in the fall of 2002 remained in effect through the end of the year. Uncoated paper prices in Europe recovered somewhat from the 2001 fourth quarter, although the momentum slowed during the fourth quarter of 2002. Continued growth in eastern Europe more than offset weaker western European markets. Coated Papers sales were $1.5 billion in 2002, compared with $1.6 billion in 2001 and $1.2 billion in 2000. The business operated at a loss in 2002, primarily as a result of lower average sales prices, but was profitable in both 2001 and 2000. Shipments in 2002 increased 5%, while average prices were down about 15% following a 7% decline in 2001. Profits benefited from record level machine efficiency as well as cost reduction efforts, which partially offset the impact of lower prices during 2002. 10 Market Pulp sales from our U.S., European and Canadian facilities were $765 million in 2002 compared with $815 million and $925 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Operating losses increased in 2002 compared with both 2001 and 2000 as average pulp prices eroded. Pulp prices showed some improvement beginning in the second quarter of 2002, but declined again during the fourth quarter. U.S. pulp volumes in 2002 were 6% higher than 2001, and were slightly higher in Canada, while volumes in Europe declined slightly. Successful cost reduction initiatives and strong manufacturing performance in 2002 helped to reduce the operating losses. Brazilian Paper sales were $440 million in 2002 compared with $460 million in 2001 and $270 million in 2000. Operating profits in 2002 were slightly lower than 2001, but were 69% greater than 2000, which included six months of operations after the acquisition of Champion. Volumes improved in 2002 versus 2001, although the effects of this increase could not fully offset the unfavorable impact of weaker export prices. The increases in sales and earnings in 2002 and 2001 over 2000 reflect a full year of reported operations versus six months in 2000 following the Champion acquisition in June 2000. Looking forward to 2003, we anticipate a slow but steady improvement in market conditions following a slow first quarter. Operationally, we continue to focus on key performance indicators including operating machine efficiency, on time shipping performance and cost to serve. The Printing Papers segment is well positioned to benefit when economic expansion begins. Industrial and Consumer Packaging Industrial and Consumer Packaging net sales for 2002 were down 3% and 8% from 2001 and 2000, respectively. Operating profits in 2002 were up 2% from 2001 and were down 30% from 2000. Lower average 2002 prices resulted in a $190 million decline in revenues and operating profits, which was offset by lower overhead, energy and material costs and a more favorable product/customer mix ($150 million) and increased sales volumes ($50 million). Downtime in this segment in 2002 declined more than 50% compared with 2001, largely reflecting facility rationalizations in 2002 and 2001. Industrial and Consumer Packaging In millions 2002 2001 2000 Sales $6,095 $6,280 $6,625 Operating Profit $ 517 $ 508 $ 741 Industrial Packaging net sales for 2002 were $3.6 billion compared with $3.7 billion in 2001 and $4.0 billion in 2000. The effect of a 6% reduction in average prices in 2002 versus 2001 was partially offset by a 4% improvement in volume. Operating profits in 2002 declined 21% and 48% from 2001 and 2000, respectively. Weak U.S. demand, coupled with pricing pressure, continued to adversely affect results for this business. Domestic box and board average prices declined by 6% in 2002. Domestic box shipments ended the year 2% higher than in 2001 despite generally soft market conditions and the loss of a large poultry customer early in the year. Containerboard price increases announced in mid 2002 took effect more slowly than anticipated and prices averaged 9% lower than in 2001. The markets in 2002 for the Kraft Paper business were weaker than in 2001. Further rationalization and production realignments between the mills had a positive impact on results. Overall business conditions for the European Container business were relatively stable during 2002. Internal process improvement programs were the major factor in increased earnings during 2002. In addition, the Etienne paper machine rebuild completed during the fourth quarter of 2001 led to improved results for 2002. During 2002, the Industrial Packaging business took 260,000 tons of lack of order downtime, continuing its policy of adjusting our production to be in line with customer demand. Consumer Packaging sales were $2.5 billion in 2002 compared with $2.6 billion in both 2001 and 2000. Overall, 2002 average prices were down about 6%, while shipments were slightly higher than 2001. Operating profits in 2002 increased 48% over 2001 and 13% over 2000 as a result of aggressive cost curtailment initiatives and favorable raw material prices that more than offset the effects of weaker average product pricing and mix. Our mills ran virtually at capacity for the year as our internal capacity was well balanced with favorable customer demand. Average bleached board prices declined in 2002 despite some improvement in the middle of the year. Earnings in the bleached board business were adversely affected by a paper machine upgrade completed in the third quarter that will have a positive impact going forward. Efforts to reduce controllable costs were a major contributor to Consumer Packagings improved operating profits in 2002. These efforts included the rationalization of Shorewoods capacity, the exiting of the Aseptic business, and the further realignment of the domestic Beverage Packaging and Foodservice systems. Looking forward to 2003, we are not expecting improvement in demand. Markets will remain tight with price pressure continuing. Our customer focused market initiatives combined with our cost control programs are expected to have a favorable impact on future operating results. 11 Distribution Distributions 2002 net sales declined 7% and 13% from 2001 and 2000, respectively. Operating profits in 2002 were significantly higher than 2001, but were 23% lower than 2000. Lower operating costs, reflecting the impact of restructuring and cost control efforts in 2001 and 2002, added approximately $50 million to operating profits in 2002. Additionally, an improved mix of products and increased focus on key customer relationships added another $40 million. Lower bad debt expense was also a positive factor. However, lower sales volumes offset approximately $45 million of these improvements. Market conditions were difficult in 2002, but were improved compared with a very depressed period in 2001. Distribution In millions 2002 2001 2000 Sales $6,345 $6,790 $7,255 Operating Profit $ 92 $ 21 $ 120 xpedx, our North American distribution operation, posted sales of $6 billion, down 6% and 13% from 2001 and 2000 levels, respectively. The weaker market conditions experienced in 2001 continued during the first quarter of 2002. Sales leveled off in the first half of 2002, then gradually improved over the balance of the year. Sales in our two primary U.S. customer segments, paper and supplies for the commercial printing industry and packaging supplies for the industrial sector, declined 10% and 7%, respectively, in 2002 from 2001. Earnings in 2002, however, were more than four times higher than 2001, although about 20% lower than 2000. The cost reduction plans, initiated in 2001 and continuing into 2002, were the primary drivers in our profit improvement in 2002. We continued our facility consolidation and cost reduction plans in 2002, reducing headcount by an additional 700 people, bringing the total since January 2001 to 1,800, or an 18% work force reduction. Additionally in 2002, progress was made on internal business initiatives to leverage our size and efficiency in transaction processing. Bad debt expense in 2002 decreased 45% from 2001 when the business experienced a number of customer bankruptcies. A higher ROI was achieved in 2002 due to improved earnings and aggressive working capital management, mainly reflected in lower inventories and accounts receivable. European distribution operations posted sales of $375 million, up 7% from 2001 and about the same as in 2000. The European businesses recorded a slight gain in 2002 following a small loss in 2001 and profits in 2000. For 2003, we expect a continued slow recovery as economic growth resumes. As of the end of 2002, we have completed most of our restructuring activity. Future operating results will continue to benefit from the cost reduction actions implemented in 2002 and 2001, and from further simplification of business processes and focused marketing initiatives. Forest Products Forest Products net sales for 2002 were 8% higher than in 2001, and were 30% above 2000 totals. Operating profits in 2002 were 7% and 24% higher than 2001 and 2000, respectively. Earnings in 2002 reflected stronger contributions from Forest Resources operations. The negative effects of lower average building materials prices, slightly lower stumpage prices, and lower sales volumes were partly offset by lower raw material costs. Also, overhead and operating costs declined, reflecting reorganization actions taken in recent years. The increase in sales and earnings in 2002 and 2001 over 2000 also reflects the operations of Champion that were acquired in June 2000. Forest Products In millions 2002 2001 2000 Sales $3,090 $2,855 $2,380 Operating Profit $ 700 $ 655 $ 564 Forest Resources sales in 2002 were $1.2 billion compared with $960 million in 2001 and $848 million in 2000. Operating profit was 6% higher than 2001 and 17% higher than 2000, primarily due to higher timberland sales, lower operating costs and lower cost of timber harvested. Harvest volumes declined about 20% in 2002 compared with 2001 and 2000 levels, reflecting a lower inventory in 2002 of mature timber. Average stumpage prices in 2002 were below 2001 and 2000 levels, with southern pine sawtimber and pulpwood prices declining slightly versus 2001 prices. Earnings from sales of timberlands were approximately $25 million higher in the 2002 fourth quarter than in the third quarter, resulting in a 14% increase in timberland sales earnings in 2002 versus 2001. Earnings from timberland sales in 2001 were 58% higher than in 2000 reflecting the larger overall land base following the Champion acquisition in June 2000. International Paper monetizes its forest assets in various ways, including sales of short and long term harvest rights, on a pay as cut or lump sum bulk sale basis, as well as sales of timberlands. We expect harvest volumes and sales of timberlands in 2003 to be lower than in 2002, and stumpage prices for southern yellow pine to decrease slightly, as lumber markets continue to be adversely impacted by imports, partially offset by reduced U.S. lumber capacity. 12 Wood Products sales in the United States in 2002 of $1.3 billion were lower than the $1.4 billion in 2001 and even with 2000, principally due to lower average lumber and panel prices, partially offset by improved manufacturing operations and costs. Average prices were down 4% for lumber in 2002 versus 2001 while volumes declined 2%. Average 2002 plywood prices were down about 5%, although volume was up 5%, compared with 2001. Although housing starts were up slightly, lumber imports increased in 2002, contributing to weaker average prices during the year. The April 2002 sale of the oriented strand board facilities will have a positive impact on future U.S. wood products results. Canadian wood products, operated through Weldwood of Canada, reported net sales of $565 million in 2002 compared with $480 million in 2001 and $190 million from the second half of 2000, after the June 2000 acquisition of Champion. Operating profits in 2002 were 36% higher than 2001. Average prices for lumber in 2002 were about the same as in 2001 while plywood prices showed improvement year over year. The favorable impact of higher productivity and marketing initiatives the business implemented in 2002 was a major factor in the earnings improvement. Looking forward, we expect pricing in 2003 will be mixed with earnings improvement to be driven primarily by lower operating costs and reduced downtime. Carter Holt Harvey International Papers results shown below for this segment differ from those reported by Carter Holt Harvey in New Zealand in three major respects: 1. Carter Holt Harveys earnings include only our share of Carter Holt Harveys operating earnings. Segment sales, however, represent 100% of Carter Holt Harveys sales. 2. Carter Holt Harvey reports in New Zealand dollars but our segment results are reported in U.S. dollars. The weighted average currency exchange rate used to translate New Zealand dollars to U.S. dollars was 0.47 in 2002, 0.41 in 2001 and 0.46 in 2000. 3. Carter Holt Harvey reports under New Zealand accounting standards, but our segment results comply with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The major differences relate to cost of timber harvested (COTH), goodwill amortization, pensions, deferred taxes and financial instruments. These differences reduced segment earnings by approximately $24 million in 2002, $30 million in 2001 and $20 million in 2000. Carter Holt Harvey In millions 2002 2001 2000 Sales $1,910 $1,710 $1,675 Operating Profit $ 56 $ 13 $ 71 Carter Holt Harveys 2002 net sales were 12% higher than 2001 and were 14% higher than 2000. Operating profits in 2002 were significantly improved over 2001s results but were 21% less than in 2000, when pulp prices were at a five year high. Essentially all of the increase in operating profits from 2001 was due to the effects of cost and margin control initiatives. Forest and Wood Products results improved significantly in 2002 as the residential housing markets in Australia and New Zealand strengthened, resulting in increased volumes. 2002 log exports were at similar levels to 2001 while log prices were slightly higher. The Pulp and Paper business recorded a loss for the year primarily due to weakening pulp sales prices. Tissue results improved in 2002 compared with 2001, benefiting from lower pulp prices and successful marketing initiatives. Higher earnings in the Packaging business reflect the margin improvement and cost control programs that were implemented during 2002. Operating results for 2003 will be dependent on changes in global economic conditions. Economic growth in 2003 for Australia and New Zealand is expected to drop from the strong 2002 levels. The housing market in Australia is expected to decrease in 2003 from the record high levels experienced in 2002. However, prices for key commodities such as pulp and logs are expected to improve on 2002 prices. Specialty Businesses and Other The Specialty Businesses and Other segment includes Arizona Chemical, Chemical Cellulose Pulp and Industrial Papers. Also included are businesses identified in our divestiture program whose results are included in this segment for periods prior to their sale. Specialty Businesses and Other In millions 2002 2001 2000 Sales $1,535 $2,325 $4,230 Operating Profit $ 51 $ 52 $ 233 Chemicals sales were $595 million in 2002, compared with $566 million in 2001 and $632 million in 2000. Operating profits in 2002 were about 7% lower than in 2001, and about half of the 2000 level, as cost reduction efforts partially offset the negative impact of higher material costs and lower average prices. Industrial Papers sales were $436 million in 2002 compared with sales of $451 million in 2001 and $498 million in 2000. Operating profit in 2002 was up 62% and 11% from 2001 and 2000, respectively. Lower input costs, mix improvements, and less downtime, partially offset by weaker prices, contributed to the improvement in operating profits in 2002. 13 Other businesses in the above totals include operations that have been sold, including Masonite, the oil and gas and mineral royalty business, Decorative Products, Zanders, Flexible Packaging, Retail Packaging, Bush Boake Allen, the former Champion Hamilton Mill, and the Curtis/Palmer hydroelectric facility. Sales for these businesses were approximately $500 million in 2002 compared with $1.3 billion in 2001 and $3.1 billion in 2000. Also included is the Chemical Cellulose Pulp business. In January 2003, we announced that the Natchez, Mississippi, dissolving pulp mill comprising this business would be closed in mid 2003. Corporate Items and Interest Expense For the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, corporate net expense was $253 million compared with $369 million in 2001 and $285 million in 2000. The decrease in 2002 was primarily due to the elimination of goodwill amortization, higher net foreign exchange gains, lower natural gas hedging costs and income from the sale of shares received from an insurance company demutualization, offset in part by lower pension income and higher benefit and inventory related costs. Net interest expense decreased to $783 million in 2002 compared with $929 million in 2001 and $816 million in 2000. The decrease in 2002 reflects lower interest rates and the reductions in long term debt in 2001. The increase in 2001 included a full year of interest on debt incurred in connection with the Champion acquisition compared with a half year in 2000. Proceeds received from the sale of assets in 2002, 2001 and 2000, were used to reduce debt and for other general corporate purposes. Minority interest expense, net of taxes, decreased to $130 million in 2002, compared with $147 million in 2001 and $238 million in 2000. The decreases reflect lower earnings in 2002 compared with both 2001 and 2000, as well as divestitures in 2001. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Provided by Operations Cash provided by operations totaled $2.1 billion for 2002, compared with $1.7 billion in 2001 and $2.4 billion in 2000. The increase in operating cash flow in 2002 reflects lower working capital requirements and higher earnings before special items and the cumulative effect of an accounting change. Excluding special and extraordinary items and the cumulative effect of accounting changes, net earnings after taxes and minority interest for 2002 increased $326 million from 2001, due principally to higher operating earnings reflecting lower depreciation and amortization expense. A decrease in working capital increased 2002 operating cash flow by $368 million. The decrease in operating cash flow in 2001 reflects lower earnings before special and extraordinary items and accounting changes. Excluding special and extraordinary items and accounting changes, after taxes and minority interest, net earnings for 2001 decreased $755 million from 2000. Working capital changes increased 2001 operating cash flow by $279 million and decreased 2000 operating cash flow by $146 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $1.6 billion in 2002 and $1.9 billion in both 2001 and 2000. Investment Activities Capital spending was $1.0 billion in 2002, or 64% of depreciation and amortization as compared to $1.0 billion, or 56% of depreciation and amortization in 2001, and $1.4 billion, or 71% of depreciation and amortization in 2000. Higher spending in 2000 was the result of capital projects for Champion. As part of our emphasis on improving return on investment, we have continued to hold annual capital spending well below annual depreciation and amortization expense. Discretionary capital spending has been focused on cost reduction, process stabilization and customer service improvement. The following table presents capital spending by each of our business segments for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. In millions 2002 2001 2000 Printing Papers $ 399 $ 374 $ 447 Industrial and Consumer Packaging 249 246 296 Distribution 5 16 24 Forest Products 127 175 217 Carter Holt Harvey 69 85 100 Specialty Businesses and Other 71 82 172 Subtotal 920 978 1,256 Corporate and other 89 71 96 Total $1,009 $1,049 $1,352 We expect capital expenditures in 2003 to be about $1.3 billion, or about 81% of depreciation and amortization. Mergers and Acquisitions In December 2002, Carter Holt Harvey acquired Starwood Australias Bell Bay medium density fiberboard plant in Tasmania for $28 million in cash. In April 2001, Carter Holt Harvey acquired Norske Skogs Tasman Kraft pulp manufacturing business for $130 million in cash. In June 2000, International Paper completed the acquisition of Champion, a leading manufacturer of paper for business 14 communications, commercial printing and publications, with significant market pulp, plywood and lumber manufacturing operations. Champion shareholders received $50 in cash per share and $25 worth of International Paper common stock for each Champion share. Champion shares were acquired for approximately $5 billion in cash and 68.7 million shares of International Paper common stock with a fair market value of $2.4 billion. Approximately $2.8 billion of Champion debt was assumed. In April 2000, Carter Holt Harvey purchased CSR Limiteds medium density fiberboard and particleboard businesses and its Oberon sawmill for approximately $200 million in cash. In March 2000, International Paper acquired Shorewood, a leader in the manufacture of premium retail packaging, for approximately $640 million in cash and the assumption of $280 million of debt. All of the above acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method. The operating results of these mergers and acquisitions have been included in the consolidated statement of earnings from the dates of acquisition. In March 2001, International Paper and Carter Holt Harvey each acquired a 25% interest in International Paper Pacific Millennium Limited. The resulting investment is accounted for under the equity method and is included in Investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Financing Activities Financing activities during 2002 included debt issuances of $2.0 billion and retirements of $3.0 billion, for a net debt reduction of $1.0 billion. Debt issuances in 2002 included $1.2 billion of 5.85% Senior Unsecured Notes due October 30, 2012, the proceeds of which were used to retire most of International Papers $1.2 billion of 8.0% notes due July 2003 that were issued in connection with the Champion acquisition. Financing activities during 2001 included a net debt reduction of $1.4 billion, primarily from proceeds from divestitures. Debt issuances in 2001 included $1.0 billion of 6.75% Senior Unsecured Notes due September 1, 2011, which yielded proceeds of $993 million, and $2.1 billion of zero coupon Convertible Senior Debentures due June 20, 2021, which yielded proceeds of approximately $1.0 billion. Financing activities during 2000 included $6.3 billion of debt issuances, including $4.3 billion in long term debt and $2 billion of short term debt instruments (largely commercial paper) issued mainly to finance the Champion and Shorewood acquisitions. In addition, we assumed approximately $3.0 billion of debt associated with acquisitions, and subsequently reduced the acquired debt balances by $450 million. We repaid $600 million of maturing long term debt and $1.0 billion in short term debt from divestiture proceeds and operating cash flows, as well as $700 million of Carter Holt Harvey debt from proceeds received on the sale of its interest in COPEC. Dividend payments totaled $482 million in both 2002 and 2001, and $447 million in 2000. The International Paper common stock dividend remained at $1.00 per share during the three year period. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, cash and temporary investments totaled $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. Capital Resources Outlook for 2003 International Paper has the ability to fund capital expenditures, service existing debt, and meet working capital and dividend requirements during 2003 through various sources of short and long term capital. In addition to existing cash balances and cash provided from operations, short term liquidity requirements can be met using commercial paper funding. International Paper currently holds short term credit ratings by Standard & Poors and Moodys Investors Services of A 2 and P 2, respectively. At December 31, 2002, International Paper had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. Should a ratings change or market event affect International Papers ability to access the commercial paper market, short term liquidity needs could be met through committed revolving credit facilities in excess of $2.0 billion. At December 31, 2002, these facilities were unused. In addition, International Paper has the ability to raise up to $600 million through an asset backed accounts receivable securitization program established in 2001. At December 31, 2002, this facility was also unused. International Paper believes that these sources will be adequate to fund capital requirements in 2003. International Paper has approximately $485 million of debt scheduled for repayment in 2003. We anticipate using new debt issuances to refinance maturing debt balances. Contractual obligations for future payments under existing debt and lease commitments at December 31, 2002 were as follows: In millions 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Thereafter Long term debt $ $1,800 $1,700 $709 $488 $8,345 Lease obligations 229 167 180 99 84 263 Total $229 $1,967 $1,880 $808 $572 $8,608 The majority of International Papers debt is accessed through global public capital markets where we have a wide base of investors. 15 Special Items Including Restructuring and Business Improvement Actions: Divestitures In 2000, International Paper announced a divestment program following the Champion acquisition and the completion of a strategic analysis to focus on International Papers core businesses. Through December 31, 2002, more than $3 billion had been realized under the program, including cash and notes received plus debt assumed by the buyers. Net (Gains) Losses on Sales and Impairments of Businesses Held for Sale 2002: In the fourth quarter of 2002, International Paper recorded a $10 million pre tax credit ($4 million after taxes) to adjust estimated accrued costs of businesses previously sold. In the third quarter of 2002, International Paper completed the sale of its Decorative Products operations to an affiliate of Kohlberg & Co. for approximately $100 million in cash and a note receivable with a fair market value of $13 million. This transaction resulted in no gain or loss as these assets had previously been written down to fair market value. Also during the third quarter of 2002, a net gain of $3 million before taxes ($1 million after taxes) was recorded related to adjustments of previously recorded costs of businesses held for sale. During the second quarter of 2002, a net gain on sales of businesses held for sale of $28 million before taxes and minority interest ($96 million after taxes and minority interest) was recorded, including a pre tax gain of $63 million ($40 million after taxes) from the sale in April 2002 of International Papers oriented strand board facilities to Nexfor Inc. for $250 million, and a net charge of $35 million before taxes and minority interest (a gain of $56 million after taxes and minority interest) relating to other sales and adjustments of previously recorded estimated costs of businesses held for sale. This net pre tax charge included: (1) a $2 million net loss associated with the sales of the Wilmington carton plant and Carter Holt Harveys distribution business; (2) an additional loss of $12 million to write down the net assets of Decorative Products to the amount realized on the subsequent sale; (3) $11 million of additional expenses relating to the decision to continue to operate Arizona Chemical, including a $3 million adjustment of previously estimated costs incurred in connection with the prior sale effort and an $8 million charge to permanently close a production facility; and (4) a $10 million charge for additional expenses relating to prior divestitures. The impairment charge recorded for Arizona Chemical in the fourth quarter of 2001 (see below) included a tax expense based on the form of sale being negotiated at that time. As a result of the decision in the second quarter of 2002 to discontinue sale efforts and to hold and operate Arizona Chemical in the future, this provision was no longer required. Consequently, special items for the second quarter included a gain of $28 million before taxes and minority interest, with an associated $96 million benefit after taxes and minority interest. The 2002 net gains, totaling $41 million (discussed above) are included in Net (gains) losses on sales and impairments of businesses held for sale in the accompanying consolidated statement of earnings. 2001: In the fourth quarter of 2001, a pre tax impairment loss of $582 million ($524 million after taxes) was recorded, including $576 million to write down the net assets of Arizona Chemical, Decorative Products and Industrial Papers to an estimated realizable value of approximately $550 million, and $6 million of severance for the reduction of 189 employees in the Chemical Cellulose Pulp business. Also in the fourth quarter, International Paper sold its Mobile, Alabama Retail Packaging facility to Ampac, resulting in a pre tax loss of $9 million. In the third quarter of 2001, International Paper sold Masonite Corporation (Masonite) to Premdor Inc. of Toronto, Canada, resulting in a pre tax loss of $87 million, its Flexible Packaging business to Exo Tech Packaging, LLC, resulting in a pre tax loss of $31 million, and its Curtis/Palmer hydroelectric generating project in Corinth, New York to TransCanada Pipelines Limited, resulting in a pre tax gain of $215 million. Additionally, a pre tax impairment loss of $50 million ($32 million after taxes) was recorded in the third quarter to write down the Chemical Cellulose assets to their expected realizable value of approximately $25 million. In the second quarter of 2001, a pre tax impairment loss of $85 million ($55 million after taxes) was recorded to reduce the carrying value of the Flexible Packaging assets to their expected realizable value of approximately $85 million based on preliminary offers received. The 2001 losses discussed above, totaling $629 million, are included in Net (gains) losses on sales and impairments of businesses held for sale in the accompanying consolidated statement of earnings. Structured Transactions In connection with a sale of forestlands in the state of Washington in 2001, International Paper received notes having a value of approximately $480 million on the date of 16 sale. During 2001, International Paper transferred the Notes to an unconsolidated entity in exchange for a preferred interest in that entity valued at approximately $480 million, and accounted for this transfer as a sale of the Notes for financial reporting purposes with no associated gain or loss. Also during 2001, the entity acquired approximately $561 million of other International Paper debt obligations for cash. At December 31, 2001, International Paper offset, for financial reporting purposes, the $480 million of International Paper debt obligations held by the entity since International Paper had, and intended to effect, a legal right to net settle these two amounts. In December 2002, International Paper acquired an option to purchase the third partys interest in the unconsolidated entity and modified the terms of the entitys special loss allocation between the third party and International Paper. These actions required International Paper to consolidate this entity at December 31, 2002, resulting in increases in installment notes receivable (included in Deferred charges and other assets) of $480 million, Long term debt of $460 million and Minority interest of $20 million. Also, in connection with the sale of the oil and gas properties and fee mineral and royalty interests in 2001, International Paper received a non controlling preferred limited partnership interest valued at approximately $234 million. The unconsolidated partnership also loaned $244 million to International Paper in 2001. Since International Paper has, and intends to effect, a legal right to net settle these two amounts, we have offset for financial reporting purposes the preferred interest against the note payable. Restructuring and Other Charges International Paper continually evaluates its operations for opportunities for improvement. These evaluations are targeted to (a) focus our portfolio on our core businesses of paper, packaging and forest products, (b) operate fewer facilities with the same revenue capability, (c) reduce costs, and (d) rationalize and realign capacity. Annually, strategic operating plans are developed by each of our businesses to demonstrate that they will achieve a return at least equal to their cost of capital over an economic cycle. If it subsequently becomes apparent that a facilitys plan will not be achieved, a decision is then made to either (a) shut down the facility and record the corresponding charge, or (b) evaluate the expected recovery of the carrying value of the facility to determine if an impairment of the asset value of the facility has occurred under SFAS No. 144. In recent years, this policy has led to the shutdown of a number of facilities and the recording of significant asset impairment charges and severance costs. As this profit improvement initiative is ongoing, it is possible that significant additional charges and costs will be incurred in future periods in our core businesses should such triggering events occur. 2002: During 2002, restructuring and other charges of $695 million before taxes and minority interest ($435 million after taxes and minority interest) were recorded. These charges included a $199 million charge before taxes and minority interest ($130 million after taxes and minority interest) for asset shutdowns of excess internal capacity and cost reduction actions, a $450 million pre tax charge ($278 million after taxes) for additional exterior siding legal reserves, and a charge of $46 million before taxes and minority interest ($27 million after taxes and minority interest) for early debt retirement costs. In addition, a $68 million pre tax credit ($43 million after taxes) was recorded in 2002 for the reversal of 2001 and 2000 reserves no longer required. The $199 million charge for the asset shutdowns of excess internal capacity and cost reduction actions consisted of a $101 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2002, a $19 million charge in the third quarter of 2002 and a $79 million charge in the second quarter of 2002. The fourth quarter charge included $29 million of asset write downs and $72 million of severance and other charges. The third quarter charge included $9 million of asset write downs and $10 million of severance and other charges. The second quarter charge consisted of $42 million of asset write downs and $37 million of severance and other charges. 2001: During 2001, restructuring and other charges before taxes and minority interest of $1.1 billion ($752 million after taxes and minority interest) were recorded. These charges included an $892 million charge before taxes and minority interest ($606 million after taxes and minority interest) for asset shutdowns of excess internal capacity and cost reduction actions, and a $225 million pre tax charge ($146 million after taxes) for additional exterior siding legal reserves. In addition, a $17 million pre tax credit ($11 million after taxes) was recorded in 2001 for the reversal of excess 2000 and 1999 restructuring reserves. The $892 million charge for the asset shutdowns of excess internal capacity and cost reduction actions consisted of a $171 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2001, a $256 million charge in the third quarter of 2001 and a $465 million charge in the second quarter of 2001. The fourth quarter charge consisted of $84 million of asset write downs and $87 million of severance and other charges. The third quarter charge consisted of $183 million of asset write downs and $73 million of severance and other charges. The second quarter charge consisted of $240 million of asset write downs and $225 million of severance and other charges. 17 2000: During 2000, restructuring and other charges before taxes and minority interest of $949 million ($589 million after taxes and minority interest) were recorded. These charges included an $824 million charge before taxes and minority interest ($509 million after taxes and minority interest) for asset shutdowns of excess internal capacity and cost reduction actions, and a $125 million pre tax charge ($80 million after taxes) for additional exterior siding legal reserves. In addition, a $34 million pre tax credit ($21 million after taxes) was recorded in 2000 for the reversal of excess 1999 restructuring reserves and Union Camp mergerrelated termination benefit reserves. The $824 million charge for the asset shutdowns of excess internal capacity and cost reduction actions consisted of a $753 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2000 and a $71 million charge in the second quarter of 2000. The fourthquarter charge consisted of $536 million of asset write downs and $217 million of severance and other charges. The second quarter charge consisted of $40 million of asset write downs and $31 million of severance and other charges. A further discussion of restructuring and business improvement charges and exterior siding legal reserves can be found in Notes 6 and 11, respectively, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in
