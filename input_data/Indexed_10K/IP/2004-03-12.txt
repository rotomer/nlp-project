The balance was acquired from other private industrial and nonindustrial forestland owners, with only an insignificant amount coming from public lands of the United States government. In addition, in 2003, 4.6 million tons of wood were sold to other users. All of our forestlands are independently third party certified under the operating standards of the Sustainable Forestry Principles developed by the American Forest and Paper Association. Mills and Plants A listing of our production facilities, the vast majority of which we own, can be found in Appendix I hereto, which is incorporated herein by reference.

PROPERTIES Forestlands The principal raw material used by International Paper is wood in various forms. As of December 31, 2003, the Company or its subsidiaries owned or managed approximately 8.3 million acres of forestlands in the United States, 1.5 million acres in Brazil and had, through licenses and forest management agreements, harvesting rights on government owned forestlands in Canada and Russia. An additional 795,000 acres of forestlands in New Zealand were held through Carter Holt Harvey, a consolidated subsidiary of International Paper. 4 During 2003, the Companys U.S. forestlands supplied 15.6 million tons of roundwood to its U.S. facilities, representing 25% of its wood fiber requirements. The balance was acquired from other private industrial and nonindustrial forestland owners, with only an insignificant amount coming from public lands of the United States government. In addition, in 2003, 4.6 million tons of wood were sold to other users. All of our forestlands are independently third party certified under the operating standards of the Sustainable Forestry Principles developed by the American Forest and Paper Association. Mills and Plants A listing of our production facilities, the vast majority of which we own, can be found in Appendix I hereto, which is incorporated herein by reference. The Companys facilities are in good operating condition and are suited for the purposes for which they are presently being used. We continue to study the economics of modernization or adopting other alternatives for higher cost facilities.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Executive Summary The business environment for International Paper in 2003 was difficult. Demand for paper and packaging products declined from 2002. Average prices were also lower than in 2002, except for wood products, pulp, coated papers and bleached board. Total industry segment operating profits were down from 2002 as benefits from cost reduction initiatives, and improved operating performance and a more favorable product mix, were more than offset by higher energy and raw material costs and lower prices. Looking forward to 2004, we expect a seasonally slow first quarter, with continuing low prices and high wood and energy costs. However, due to signs of increasing strength in U.S. and world economies, and growth in business activity at many of our customers, we expect improvements in demand as 2004 progresses. Given the generally low levels of inventories at our facilities, along with better order backlogs, we have announced price increases in containerboard, uncoated free sheet, pulp and certain bleached board grades. While these price increases will have only a slight impact on margins in the first quarter, their benefits will progressively flow through to earnings as the year progresses. The weaker U.S. dollar should also benefit our exports and reduce the competitiveness of imports of competitor products into the United States. The outlook for wood products operating results as 2004 begins is favorable. Forestland sales continue to be dependent upon various factors including tract location and the level of investor interest. Results of Operations Industry segment operating profits are used by International Papers management to measure the earnings performance of its businesses. Management believes that this measure allows a better understanding of trends in costs, operating efficiencies, prices and volumes. Industry segment operating profits are defined as earnings before taxes and minority interest, interest expense, corporate items and special corporate items. Industry segment operating profits are defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as a non GAAP financial measure, and are not GAAP alternatives to net income or any other operating measure prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. International Paper operates in six segments: Printing Papers, Industrial and Consumer Packaging, Distribution, Forest Products, Carter Holt Harvey, and Specialty Businesses and Other. The following table shows the components of net earnings (loss) for each of the last three years: In millions 2003 2002 2001 Industry segment operating profits $1,801 $ 1,935 $ 1,787 Corporate items (466) (253) (369) Special items* (290) (586) (1,771) Interest expense, net (766) (783) (929) Minority interest (56) (72) (130) Income tax benefit 92 54 270 Accounting changes and extraordinary items (13) (1,175) (62) Net earnings (loss) $ 302 $ (880) $(1,204) *Special items include restructuring and other charges, net (gains) losses on sales and impairments of businesses held for sale, and reversals of reserves no longer required. Industry segment operating profits declined by $134 million in 2003 due principally to higher energy and raw material costs ($270 million) and lower average prices ($75 million), partially offset by the effect of cost reduction initiatives, improved operating performance and a more favorable product mix ($245 million). Description of Graph The following graph compares 2002 with 2003 segment operating profit in bar chart format (in millions). The first bar is 2002 segment operating profits of $1,935. This is followed by bars representing major changes in segment operating profit including: Costs/Operations/Mix of $245, Energy/Raw Materials of $(270), Price of $(75), and Volume/Other of $(34). The last bar is 2003 segment operating profits of $1,801. Segment Operating Profit (in millions) [BAR CHART] 2002 $1,935 Costs/Operations/Mix $ 245 Energy/Raw Materials $ (270) Price $ (75) Volume/Other $ (34) 2003 $1,801 The principal changes by segment were as follows: Printing Papers profits were $68 million lower as higher raw material and energy costs were partially offset by improved operations and lower overhead costs. Industrial and Consumer Packagings profits were down $100 million. Higher raw material costs and lower prices more than offset the effect of reduced overhead costs and improved operations. Forest Products profit was $41 million higher. Higher average prices for wood products, lower raw material costs and improved plant operations offset the effect of lower harvest volumes and lower earnings from Weldwood of Canada. Corporate items, a $466 million net expense in 2003, increased from $253 million in 2002 due to higher pension and supply chain initiative costs, offset in part by gains on energy hedging transactions. In addition, 2002 charges were reduced by gains from an insurance company demutualization stock sale and foreign exchange. 9 Special items, including restructuring and other charges, gains/losses on sales and impairments of businesses held for sale, and reversals of reserves no longer required, declined to $290 million from $586 million in 2002, and from $1.8 billion in 2001. The decline in 2003 reflects lower restructuring charges that relate to excess capacity shutdowns and sales of non core businesses, and lower legal costs. The multi year corporate consolidation program following the Champion acquisition is now essentially complete. Interest expense, net, decreased to $766 million in 2003, compared with $783 million in 2002 and $929 million in 2001. The decline in 2003 compared with both 2002 and 2001 is principally the result of lower interest rates from the refinancing of high coupon rate debt. The $92 million income tax benefit in 2003 included $123 million of benefits for significant tax items occurring in 2003. The $54 million benefit in 2002 also reflected adjustments for special tax items. The $270 million tax benefit in 2001 reflected a pre tax loss due largely to restructuring and other charges. Accounting changes in 2002 reflect a $1.2 billion charge for the adoption of the new goodwill accounting standard. Liquidity and Capital Resources International Paper generated $1.8 billion of operating cash flow in 2003. Capital spending totaled $1.2 billion in 2003, or 71% of depreciation and amortization expense, and is anticipated to be $1.3 billion, or 80% of depreciation and amortization expense, in 2004. We issued $2.4 billion of debt and preferred securities and used the proceeds to repay $1.4 billion of existing debt and preferred securities, with $1.0 billion subsequently used to retire additional high coupon rate debt in January 2004. Approximately $2.5 billion of debt, including the $1 billion of debt retired in January and $300 million of debt at Carter Holt Harvey, is scheduled for refinancing or repayment in 2004. We intend to meet these obligations with a combination of cash from operations and refinancings. In addition, the holders of $1.1 billion of zero coupon Convertible Senior Debentures have the option to require the Company to repurchase these securities in June 2004. If this occurs, the repurchase can be settled in either cash or International Paper stock at the Companys option. Our liquidity position continues to be strong, supported by existing credit facilities that we believe to be adequate to meet future short term liquidity requirements. We continue to maintain an investment grade rating for our long term debt, which is a core element of our overall financial strategy. Our focus in 2004 will be to continue maximizing financial flexibility and preserving liquidity while further reducing interest expense through repayment or refinancing of high coupon rate debt. Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Accounting Estimates Accounting policies that may have a significant effect on our financial position and results of operations, and that require judgments by management, include accounting for contingent liabilities, impairments of long lived assets and goodwill, pensions and postretirement benefits, income taxes and accounting for stock options. Pension charges for our U.S. plans increased by $135 million for 2003 due to a reduction in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and an increase in the amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses. A further increase of approximately $46 million is expected in 2004 due also to an increase in amortization of unrecognized losses and a decrease in the assumed discount rate. The actual return on plan assets was 26% in 2003 versus a loss of 6.7% in 2002. In 2002, a $1.5 billion after tax charge to Shareholders equity was recorded, with no impact on earnings or cash flow, due to a decline in the market value of plan assets for the U.S. qualified pension plan. Recent Accounting Developments While several new accounting standards and interpretations were effective for International Paper for 2003, the application of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51," had the largest impact. This resulted in several balance sheet changes, including a $1.3 billion reduction in mandatorily redeemable preferred securities and a $1.0 billion increase in debt, and an income statement effect of a $3 million after tax charge for a cumulative effect of an accounting change. Legal Claims and payments relating to exterior siding and roofing actions continue to be in line with projections made in 2002. Class action claims brought by corrugated sheet and container purchasers were settled in 2003 for $24.4 million. Additionally, a class action was certified in 2003 relating to alleged price fixing by International Papers Nevamar division (which was sold as part of Decorative Products in late 2002) and others in sales of high pressure laminates. Additional information on these matters is included in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Corporate Overview While the operating results for International Papers various business segments are driven by a number of business specific factors, changes in International Papers operating results are closely tied to changes in general economic conditions in the United States, Europe and Asia. Factors that 10 impact the demand for our products include industrial non durable goods production, consumer spending, commercial printing and advertising activity, white collar employment levels, new home construction and repair and remodeling activity, and movements in currency exchange rates. Product prices also tend to follow general economic trends and are also affected by inventory levels, currency movements and changes in worldwide operating rates. In addition to these revenue related factors, net earnings are impacted by various cost drivers, the more significant of which include changes in raw material costs, principally wood fiber and chemical costs, energy costs, salary and benefits costs, including pensions, and manufacturing conversion costs. The following is a discussion of International Papers results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2003, and the major factors affecting these results compared to 2002 and 2001. Results of Operations For the year ended December 31, 2003, International Paper reported net sales of $25.2 billion, compared with 2002 and 2001 net sales of $25.0 billion and $26.4 billion, respectively. International net sales (including U.S. exports) totaled $8.4 billion, or 33% of total sales in 2003. This compares to international sales of $7.5 billion in 2002 and $7.1 billion in 2001. The increase in 2003 versus 2002 is mainly due to the translation of sales invoiced in foreign currencies that appreciated against the U.S. dollar. Export sales of $1.4 billion in 2003 were about flat with both 2002 and 2001. Net earnings totaled $302 million ($0.63 per share) in 2003, compared with a net loss of $880 million ($1.83 per share) in 2002 and a net loss of $1.2 billion ($2.50 per share) in 2001. Amounts include extraordinary items and the cumulative effect of accounting changes. Earnings before extraordinary items and the cumulative effect of accounting changes in 2003 were $315 million, compared with earnings before extraordinary items and the cumulative effect of an accounting change of $295 million in 2002 and a loss before extraordinary items and the cumulative effect of an accounting change of $1.1 billion in 2001. Earnings in 2003 benefited from cost reduction initiatives, improved mill operations, a lower effective tax rate and reduced special charges compared with 2002, although these benefits were partially offset by increased energy and wood fiber costs, higher pension expense, lower average prices and volumes and other items. See Industry Segment Results on pages 16 20 for a discussion of the impact of these factors by segment. Description of Graph The following graph compares 2002 and 2003 earnings before extraordinary items and cumulative effect of accounting changes (after taxes) in bar chart format (in millions). The first bar is the 2002 earnings amount of $295. This is followed by bars representing major changes in earnings including: Costs/Operations/Mix of $200, Tax Rate Change of $70, Energy/Raw Materials of $(175), Pension of $(115), Price of $(60), Volume of $(15), other of $(60), and Special Items of $175.

Results for 2002 included a charge of $1.2 billion after minority interest for the cumulative effect of an accounting change to record the transitional impairment charge for the adoption of SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." Results for 2001 included a charge of $16 million after taxes and minority interest for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for derivatives and hedging activities. During 2001, pre tax losses totaling $73 million ($46 million after taxes) were recorded, including $60 million ($38 million after taxes) for impairment losses to reduce the assets of Masonite Corporation to their estimated realizable value based on offers received, and $13 million ($8 million after taxes) from a loss on the sale of oil and gas properties and fee mineral and royalty interests. Pursuant to the pooling of interest rules, these losses were recorded as extraordinary items. Income Tax Benefit While the Company reported pre tax income in 2003, a net income tax benefit was recorded reflecting decreases totaling $123 million in the provision for income taxes for significant items. These included a $13 million reduction in the fourth quarter ($26 million before minority interest) for a favorable settlement with Australian tax authorities of net operating loss carry forwards, a $60 million reduction in the third quarter reflecting a favorable revision of estimated tax accruals upon filing the 2002 Federal income tax return and increased research and development credits, and a $50 million reduction in the second quarter reflecting a favorable tax audit settlement and benefits from a government sponsored overseas tax program in Italy. The net tax benefit in 2002 reflects the reversal of the assumed stock sale tax treatment of the 2001 fourth quarter write down to net realizable value of the assets of Arizona Chemical upon the decision to discontinue sale efforts and to hold and operate this business in the future, and a $46 million fourth quarter adjustment of deferred income tax liabilities for the effects of state tax credits and the taxability of the Companys operations in various state tax jurisdictions. Corporate Items and Interest Expense Minority interest expense, net of taxes, decreased to $123 million in 2003, compared with $130 million in 2002 and $147 million in 2001. The decrease in 2003 reflects a $44 million reduction in minority interest related to preferred securities that were replaced by debt obligations in the second half of 2003. Interest expense, net, decreased to $766 million in 2003, compared with $783 million in 2002 and $929 million in 2001. The decline in 2003 compared with both 2002 and 2001 is the result of lower interest rates from the refinancing of high coupon debt and the impact of interest rate swaps, net of the additional $44 million expense for the debt securities discussed above. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, Corporate items totaled $466 million of expense compared with $253 million in 2002 and $369 million in 2001. The increase from 2002 is due to higher pension and supply chain initiative costs, offset in part by gains on energy hedging transactions. In addition, 2002 included income from an insurance company demutualization and foreign exchange gains. Special Items Restructuring and Other Charges International Paper continually evaluates its operations for opportunities for improvement. These evaluations are targeted to (a) focus our portfolio on our core businesses of paper, packaging and forest products, (b) rationalize and realign capacity to operate fewer facilities with the same revenue capability and close high cost facilities, and (c) reduce costs. Annually, strategic operating plans are developed by each of our businesses to demonstrate that they will achieve a return at least equal to their cost of capital over an economic cycle. If it subsequently becomes apparent that a facilitys plan will not be achieved, a decision is then made to (a) invest additional capital to upgrade the facility, (b) shut down the facility and record the corresponding charge, or (c) evaluate the expected recovery of the carrying value of the facility to determine if an impairment of the asset value of the facility has occurred under SFAS No. 144. In recent years, this policy has led to the shutdown of a number of facilities and the recording of significant asset impairment charges and severance costs. As this profit improvement initiative is ongoing, it is possible that additional charges and costs will be incurred in future periods in our core businesses should such triggering events occur. 2003: During 2003, restructuring and other charges before taxes and minority interest of $298 million ($184 million after taxes and minority interest) were recorded. These charges included a $236 million charge before taxes and minority interest ($144 million after taxes and minority interest) for asset shutdowns of excess internal capacity and cost reduction actions, a $63 million charge before taxes 12 ($39 million after taxes) for legal reserves, and a $1 million credit before taxes ($1 million charge after taxes) for early debt retirement costs. In addition, a $40 million credit before taxes and minority interest ($25 million after taxes and minority interest) was recorded for the net reversal of restructuring reserves no longer required. 2002: During 2002, restructuring and other charges before taxes and minority interest of $695 million ($435 million after taxes and minority interest) were recorded. These charges included a $199 million charge before taxes and minority interest ($130 million after taxes and minority interest) for asset shutdowns of excess internal capacity and cost reduction actions, a $450 million pre tax charge ($278 million after taxes) for additional exterior siding legal reserves, and a charge of $46 million before taxes and minority interest ($27 million after taxes and minority interest) for early debt retirement costs. In addition, a $68 million pre tax credit ($43 million after taxes) was recorded in 2002 for the reversal of 2001 and 2000 reserves no longer required. 2001: During 2001, restructuring and other charges before taxes and minority interest of $1.1 billion ($752 million after taxes and minority interest) were recorded. These charges included an $892 million charge before taxes and minority interest ($606 million after taxes and minority interest) for asset shutdowns of excess internal capacity and cost reduction actions, and a $225 million pre tax charge ($146 million after taxes) for additional exterior siding legal reserves. In addition, a $17 million pre tax credit ($11 million after taxes) was recorded in 2001 for the reversal of excess 2000 and 1999 restructuring reserves. A further discussion of restructuring, business improvement and other charges can be found in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in
