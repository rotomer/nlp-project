ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Forestlands The principal raw material used by International Paper is wood in various forms. As of December 31, 2004, the Company or its subsidiaries owned or managed approximately 6.8 million acres of forestlands in the United States, 1.2 million acres in Brazil and had, through licenses and forest management agreements, harvesting rights on government owned forestlands in Russia. An additional 785,000 acres of forestlands in New Zealand were held through Carter Holt Harvey, a consolidated subsidiary of International Paper. During 2004, the Companys U.S. forestlands supplied 14.7 million tons of roundwood to its U.S. facilities, representing 23% of its wood fiber requirements. The balance was acquired from other private industrial and nonindustrial forestland owners, with only an insignificant amount coming from public lands of the United States government. In addition, in 2004, 3.8 million tons of wood were sold to other users. As one of the largest private landowners in the world, International Paper employs professional foresters and wildlife biologists to manage our forestlands with great care 4 in compliance with the rigorous standards of the Sustainable Forestry Initiative program (SFI&reg;). SFI&reg; includes an independent certification system to ensure the sustainable planting, growing and harvesting of trees while protecting wildlife, plants, soil, water and air quality. All of our U.S. forestlands are certified as complying with SFI&reg; standards by an independent third party, and most of our forestlands outside of the United States comply with similar local or regional sustainable forestry programs as well. Mills and Plants A listing of our production facilities, the vast majority of which we own, can be found in Appendix I hereto, which is incorporated herein by reference. The Companys facilities are in good operating condition and are suited for the purposes for which they are presently being used. We continue to study the economics of modernization or adopting other alternatives for higher cost facilities. Capital Investments and Dispositions Given the size, scope and complexity of our business interests, we continuously examine and evaluate a wide variety of business opportunities and planning alternatives, including possible acquisitions and sales or other dispositions of properties. You can find a discussion about the level of planned capital investments for 2005 on page 24, and dispositions and restructuring activities as of December 31, 2004, on pages 12 through 14 of Item 7.

We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. These and other factors that could cause or contribute to actual results differing materially from such forward looking statements are discussed in greater detail in the Companys Securities and Exchange Commission filings. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Forestlands The principal raw material used by International Paper is wood in various forms. As of December 31, 2004, the Company or its subsidiaries owned or managed approximately 6.8 million acres of forestlands in the United States, 1.2 million acres in Brazil and had, through licenses and forest management agreements, harvesting rights on government owned forestlands in Russia. An additional 785,000 acres of forestlands in New Zealand were held through Carter Holt Harvey, a consolidated subsidiary of International Paper. During 2004, the Companys U.S. forestlands supplied 14.7 million tons of roundwood to its U.S. facilities, representing 23% of its wood fiber requirements. The balance was acquired from other private industrial and nonindustrial forestland owners, with only an insignificant amount coming from public lands of the United States government. In addition, in 2004, 3.8 million tons of wood were sold to other users. As one of the largest private landowners in the world, International Paper employs professional foresters and wildlife biologists to manage our forestlands with great care 4 in compliance with the rigorous standards of the Sustainable Forestry Initiative program (SFI&reg;). SFI&reg; includes an independent certification system to ensure the sustainable planting, growing and harvesting of trees while protecting wildlife, plants, soil, water and air quality. All of our U.S. forestlands are certified as complying with SFI&reg; standards by an independent third party, and most of our forestlands outside of the United States comply with similar local or regional sustainable forestry programs as well. Mills and Plants A listing of our production facilities, the vast majority of which we own, can be found in Appendix I hereto, which is incorporated herein by reference. The Companys facilities are in good operating condition and are suited for the purposes for which they are presently being used. We continue to study the economics of modernization or adopting other alternatives for higher cost facilities. Capital Investments and Dispositions Given the size, scope and complexity of our business interests, we continuously examine and evaluate a wide variety of business opportunities and planning alternatives, including possible acquisitions and sales or other dispositions of properties.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table shows the components of net earnings (loss) for each of the last three years: Executive Summary In Millions 2004 2003 2002 International Paper benefited from a strong economy in 2004 as demand for paper and packaging products was improved from 2003. Overall average price realizations were up year over year across all our major product lines except for European paper products where a strong Euro attracted imports. Our total industry segment operating profits were up from 2003 reflecting the higher average prices and improved shipments combined with benefits from cost reduction initiatives and a more favorable product mix. These positive effects were partially offset by higher input costs, including wood, energy and chemical costs. Looking forward to 2005, we expect demand in the first quarter to be somewhat positive, although this is a seasonally slow period for many of our businesses. Overall, demand remains solid in the United States and Europe, with strong order backlogs in our coated papers and bleached board businesses. Containerboard and box orders are also good. Uncoated papers backlogs were below prior year levels, but are improving as the first quarter progresses. Our average price realizations for most paper and packaging products began the year well above 2004 levels reflecting the realization of previously announced price increases. Raw material costs, especially wood, polyethylene and chemical costs, are expected to increase in early 2005, although energy costs should be flat compared with the fourth quarter of 2004. In addition, pension and other benefit related costs, plus supply chain expenses are expected to be higher in 2005. However, interest costs will decline due to debt repayments in 2004 and the 2005 first quarter. Results of Operations Industry segment operating profits are used by International Papers management to measure the earnings performance of its businesses. Management believes that this measure allows a better understanding of trends in costs, operating efficiencies, prices and volumes. Industry segment operating profits are defined as earnings before taxes and minority interest, interest expense, corporate items and corporate special items. Industry segment operating profits are defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as a non GAAP financial measure, and are not GAAP alternatives to net income or any other operating measure prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. International Paper operates in six segments: Printing Papers, Industrial and Consumer Packaging, Distribution, Forest Products, Carter Holt Harvey, and Specialty Businesses and Other. Industry segment operating profits $ 2,087 $ 1,772 $ 1,887 Corporate items (469 ) (466 ) (253 ) Corporate special items* (188 ) (290 ) (586 ) Interest expense, net (743 ) (772 ) (785 ) Minority interest (3 ) (63 ) (75 ) Income tax benefit (provision) (206 ) 113 72 Discontinued operations (513 ) 21 35 Accounting changes and extraordinary items (13 ) (1,175 ) Net earnings (loss) $ (35 ) $ 302 $ (880 ) *Special items include restructuring and other charges, net losses (gains) on sales and impairments of businesses held for sale, insurance recoveries and reversals of reserves no longer required. Industry segment operating profits were $315 million higher in 2004 due principally to improved sales volume ($263 million), higher average prices ($201 million), and the effect of cost reduction initiatives, improved operating performance and a more favorable product mix ($186 million), all partially offset by the impact of higher energy and raw material costs ($192 million), lower earnings from land sales ($95 million), the impact of hurricanes in the South ($18 million), and foreign currency translation rates and other items ($30 million). $1,000 $1,200 $1,400 $1,600 $1,800 $2,000 $2,200 $2,400 Segment Operating Profit (in millions) $1,772 $263 $201 $186 $(192) $(95) $(18) $(30) $2,087 2003 Volume Price Cost/ Operations/ Mix Energy/ Raw Materials Land Sales Hurricanes FX/ Other 2004 The principal changes by segment were as follows: Printing Papers profits were $119 million higher as increased sales volume, improved sales mix and lower operating and overhead costs more than offset higher energy and raw material costs. Industrial and Consumer Packagings profits were up $92 million. Higher average sales prices and volumes, improved product mix, and reduced overhead costs and improved operations more than offset the effect of higher energy and raw material costs. Forest Products profit was $73 million higher. Higher average prices for wood products more than offset the effect of lower harvest volumes and lower earnings from land sales. 9 Corporate items of $469 million net expense in 2004 was slightly higher than the $466 million net expense in 2003, due to higher pension and supply chain initiative costs, increased inventory related costs and lower gains on energy hedging transactions, offset in part by lower administrative overhead and benefit related costs. Corporate special items, including restructuring and other charges, gains/losses on sales and impairments of businesses held for sale, insurance recoveries and reversals of reserves no longer required, declined to $188 million from $290 million in 2003 and from $586 million in 2002. The decline in 2004 reflects lower restructuring charges that relate to excess capacity shutdowns and organizational restructuring programs, and insurance recoveries relating to hardboard siding and roofing matters. Interest expense, net, decreased to $743 million from $772 million in 2003 and $785 million in 2002. The decline in 2004 compared with both 2003 and 2002 reflects the lower average interest rates from the refinancing of high coupon rate debt, and higher interest income at Carter Holt Harvey. The income tax provision of $206 million includes a $41 million tax benefit related to 2004 special items. The $113 million income tax benefit in 2003 included $231 million of benefits for special items occurring in 2003. The $72 million benefit in 2002 also reflected adjustments for special tax items. During 2004, International Paper completed the sale of its Weldwood of Canada Limited business in the fourth quarter and Carter Holt Harvey completed the sale of its Tissue business in the second quarter. As a result of these transactions, the operating results of these businesses and the gain or loss on the sales are reported in discontinued operations for all periods presented. Accounting changes included a charge of $13 million in 2003 for the adoption of new accounting pronouncements, and a $1.2 billion charge in 2002 for the adoption of the new goodwill accounting standard. Liquidity and Capital Resources For the year ended December 31, 2004, International Paper generated $2.4 billion of operating cash flow, up from $1.8 billion in 2003. Capital spending from continuing operations for the year totaled $1.3 billion, or 81% of depreciation and amortization expense. We repaid approximately $900 million of debt during the year, including various higher coupon rate debt, that will result in lower interest charges in future years. Our liquidity position remains strong, supported by approximately $3.2 billion of unused, committed credit facilities that we believe are adequate to meet future short term liquidity requirements. Maintaining an investment grade credit rating for our long term debt continues to be an important element in our overall financial strategy. Our focus in 2005 will be to continue to maximize our financial flexibility and preserve liquidity while further reducing future interest expense through the repayment or refinancing of high coupon rate debt, with a target of reducing consolidated debt to approximately $12 billion by the end of 2006. Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Accounting Estimates Accounting policies that may have a significant effect on our reported results of operations and financial position, and that can require judgments by management in their application, include accounting for contingent liabilities, impairments of long lived assets and goodwill, pensions and postretirement benefit obligations and income taxes. Pension expenses for our U.S. plans increased to $111 million in 2004 from $60 million in 2003 due principally to increased amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses and a reduction in the assumed discount rate. A further increase of approximately $100 million is expected in 2005, also due to an increase in the amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses, a further reduction in the assumed discount rate, and a decrease in the expected return on plan assets to 8.50% from 8.75% in 2004. Our pension funding policy continues to be to fully fund actuarially determined costs, generally equal to the minimum amounts required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). Unless investment performance is negative or changes are made to our funding policy, it is unlikely that any contributions to our U.S. qualified plan will be required before 2007. Recent Accounting Developments Several new accounting standards and interpretations were released that are effective in either 2004 or 2005. The revised standard on share based payment that will be effective in the third quarter of 2005 will require recognition of compensation cost for any outstanding option grants that are unvested at June 30, 2005, as well as reload grants. While the exact impact will depend upon the number of unvested options at that time, this standard could increase compensation expense by approximately $20 million in both 2005 and 2006, with no significant impact in subsequent years. Accounting guidance was also issued addressing accounting and disclosure for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. We have started an evaluation of the effects of this provision, but do not expect to complete this evaluation until the second quarter of 2005. 10 Legal Payments relating to exterior siding and roofing class action settlements continue to be in line with projections made in 2002. Federal and state court antitrust cases relating to alleged price fixing in the sale of high pressure laminates were settled in 2004 for a total of $38.5 million. The Company is defending opt out cases related to a settled class action brought by purchasers of corrugated sheets and containers. Additional information on these matters is included in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Corporate Overview While the operating results for International Papers various business segments are driven by a number of business specific factors, changes in International Papers operating results are closely tied to changes in general economic conditions in the United States, Europe and Asia. Factors that impact the demand for our products include industrial non durable goods production, consumer spending, commercial printing and advertising activity, white collar employment levels, new home construction and repair and remodeling activity, and movements in currency exchange rates. Product prices also tend to follow general economic trends, and are also affected by inventory levels, currency movements and changes in worldwide operating rates. In addition to these revenue related factors, net earnings are impacted by various cost drivers, the more significant of which include changes in raw material costs, principally wood fiber and chemical costs, energy costs, salary and benefits costs, including pensions, and manufacturing conversion costs. The following is a discussion of International Papers results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004, and the major factors affecting these results compared to 2003 and 2002. Results of Operations For the year ended December 31, 2004, International Paper reported net sales of $25.5 billion, compared with $24.0 billion in 2003 and $23.9 billion in 2002. International net sales (including U.S. exports) totaled $7.9 billion, or 31% of total sales in 2004. This compares to international net sales of $7.2 billion in 2003 and $6.4 billion in 2002. Full year 2004 results totaled a net loss of $35 million ($0.07 per share basic and diluted), compared with net income of $302 million ($0.63 per share basic and diluted) in 2003 and a net loss of $880 million ($1.83 per share basic, $1.82 per share diluted) in 2002 and amounts include results of discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of accounting changes. Earnings from continuing operations in 2004 were $478 million compared with $294 million in 2003 and $260 million in 2002. Earnings in 2004 benefited from higher sales volumes, higher average sales prices, cost reduction initiatives, improved mill operations and lower interest expense. These factors more than offset the negative impacts of increased energy and wood fiber costs, lower earnings from land sales, a higher effective tax rate, increased special charges and the impact of the hurricanes in the South. See Industry Segment Results on pages 17 through 21 for a discussion of the impact of these factors by segment. $100 $200 $300 $400 $500 $600 $700 $800 Earnings From Continuing Operations(after taxes, in millions) $294 $194 $148 $154 $(142) $(70) $(35) $(90) $(13) 2003 Volume Price Costs/Operations/Mix Energy/Raw Materials Land Sales Tax Special Items 2004 $0 $21 $17 $478 Hurri canes Interest MinorityInterest/Other 11 The following table presents a reconciliation of International Papers net earnings (loss) to its operating profit: operations charge. In the 2004 second quarter, a $90 million after tax and minority interest discontinued operations gain was recorded from the sale of the Carter Holt Harvey Tissue business. As a result, prior periods operating results have been restated to present the operating results of these businesses as earnings from discontinued operations, including earnings of $108 million in 2004, $21 million in 2003, and $35 million in 2002. Net earnings for 2003 included after tax charges of $3 million and $10 million for the cumulative effect of accounting changes for the adoption of the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, respectively. Results for 2002 included a charge of $1.2 billion after minority interest for the cumulative effect of an accounting change to record the transitional impairment charge for the adoption of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Income Taxes The income tax provision for 2004 was $206 million, or 28% of pretax earnings from continuing operations before minority interest. This included a $41 million tax benefit related to special items. Excluding the impact of special items, the tax provision was $247 million, or 26% of pre tax earnings before minority interest. While the Company reported pre tax income in 2003, a net income tax benefit was recorded reflecting decreases totaling $231 million in the provision for income taxes for special items. These included a $13 million reduction in the fourth quarter ($26 million before minority interest) for a favorable settlement with Australian tax authorities of net operating loss carryforwards, a $60 million reduction in the third quarter reflecting a favorable revision of estimated tax accruals upon filing the 2002 Federal income tax return and increased research and development credits, and a $50 million reduction in the second quarter reflecting a favorable tax audit settlement and benefits from a government sponsored overseas tax program in Italy. Excluding the year to date tax effects of special items, the effective tax rate for 2003 was 20%. The net tax benefit in 2002 reflects the reversal of the assumed stock sale tax treatment of the 2001 fourth quarter write down to net realizable value of the assets of Arizona Chemical upon the decision to discontinue sale efforts and to hold and operate this business in the future, and a $46 million fourth quarter adjustment of deferred income tax liabilities for the effects of state tax credits and the taxability of the Companys operations in various state tax jurisdictions.

The Company completed the sale in the fourth quarter for approximately $1.1 billion. As a result of the sale, a $323 million pre tax loss on the sale was recorded ($711 million after taxes) as a discontinued 12 Corporate Items and Interest Expense Minority interest expense, net of taxes, decreased to $62 million in 2004 compared with $111 million in 2003 and $118 million in 2002. The decreases in 2004 and 2003 reflect a reduction in minority interest related to preferred securities that were replaced by debt obligations in the second half of 2003. This decrease was partially offset in 2004 by higher earnings at Carter Holt Harvey. Interest expense, net, decreased to $743 million compared with $772 million in 2003 and $785 million in 2002. The decline reflects lower interest rates from the refinancing of high coupon debt, the impact of interest rate swaps, and, in 2004, higher interest income from Carter Holt Harvey, net of the additional expense of $36 million for the preferred debt securities discussed above. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, corporate items totaled $469 million compared with $466 million of expense in 2003 and $253 million in 2002. The increased expense in 2004 compared with 2003 is due to higher pension, inventory related and supply chain initiative costs, and lower gains on energy hedging transactions, offset in part by reduced administrative overhead costs. Higher pension, inventory related and supply chain costs were also factors in 2003 as compared with 2002, which also included income from an insurance company demutualization and foreign exchange gains. Our supply chain project, begun in late 2002, is a corporate wide initiative to improve customer service capabilities and implement best practice supply chain business processes for order management, supply and demand planning, product scheduling and tracking, transportation and warehousing, and procurement. Expenses related to this program in 2005, should be approximately $100 million above the 2004 level of $84 million. The associated benefits are reflected in business earnings as the programs are implemented. Special Items Restructuring and Other Charges International Paper continually evaluates its operations for opportunities for improvement. These evaluations are targeted to (a) focus our portfolio on our core businesses of paper, packaging and forest products, (b) rationalize and realign capacity to operate fewer facilities with the same revenue capability and close high cost facilities, and (c) reduce costs. Annually, strategic operating plans are developed by each of our businesses to demonstrate that they will achieve a return at least equal to their cost of capital over an economic cycle. If it subsequently becomes apparent that a facilitys plan will not be achieved, a decision is then made to (a) invest additional capital to upgrade the facility, (b) shut down the facility and record the corresponding charge, or (c) evaluate the expected recovery of the carrying value of the facility to determine if an impairment of the asset value of the facility has occurred under SFAS No. 144. In recent years, this policy has led to the shutdown of a number of facilities and the recording of significant asset impairment charges and severance costs. As this profit improvement initiative is ongoing, it is possible that additional charges and costs will be incurred in future periods should such triggering events occur. 2004: During 2004, restructuring and other charges before taxes and minority interest of $211 million ($124 million after taxes and minority interest) were recorded. These charges included a $74 million charge before taxes and minority interest ($43 million after taxes and minority interest) for organizational restructuring programs, a $92 million charge before taxes ($57 million after taxes) for early debt retirement costs, a $35 million charge before minority interest ($18 million after minority interest) for a goodwill impairment charge, and a $10 million charge before taxes ($6 million after taxes) for a litigation settlement. Also in 2004, a $123 million credit before taxes ($76 million after taxes) was recorded for insurance recoveries related to the hardboard siding and roofing litigation, and a $35 million credit before taxes and minority interest ($22 million after taxes and minority interest) was recorded for the net reversal of restructuring reserves no longer required. 2003: During 2003, restructuring and other charges before taxes and minority interest of $298 million ($184 million after taxes and minority interest) were recorded. These charges included a $236 million charge before taxes and minority interest ($144 million after taxes and minority interest) for asset shutdowns of excess internal capacity and cost reduction actions, a $63 million charge before taxes ($39 million after taxes) for legal reserves, and a $1 million credit before taxes ($1 million charge after taxes) for early debt retirement costs. In addition, a $40 million credit before taxes and minority interest ($25 million after taxes and minority interest) was recorded for the net reversal of restructuring reserves no longer required. 2002: During 2002, restructuring and other charges before taxes and minority interest of $695 million ($435 million after taxes and minority interest) were recorded. These charges included a $199 million charge before taxes and minority interest ($130 million after taxes and minority interest) for asset shutdowns of excess internal capacity and cost reduction actions, a $450 million pre tax charge ($278 million after taxes) for additional exterior siding legal reserves, and a charge of $46 million before taxes and minority interest ($27 million after taxes and minority interest) for early debt 13 retirement costs. In addition, a $68 million pre tax credit ($43 million after taxes) was recorded in 2002 for the reversal of 2001 and 2000 reserves no longer required. A further discussion of restructuring, business improvement and other charges can be found in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in
