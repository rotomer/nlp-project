Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, that are not historical in nature, may constitute forward looking statements. These statements are often identified by the words, will, may, should, continue, anticipate, believe, expect, plan, appear, project, estimate, intend, and words of a similar nature. Such statements reflect the current views of International Paper with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Below, we have listed specific risks and uncertainties that you should carefully read and consider. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K (particularly in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations), or in the Companys other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the following are some important factors that could cause the Companys actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward looking statement. RISKS RELATING TO INDUSTRY CONDITIONS CHANGES IN THE COST OR AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS, ENERGY AND TRANSPORTATION COULD AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY. We rely heavily on certain raw materials (principally wood fiber, caustic soda and polyethylene), energy sources (principally natural gas, coal and fuel oil) and third party companies that transport our goods. Our profitability has been, and will continue to be, affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials, energy sources and transportation sources. THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE EXPERIENCE BOTH ECONOMIC CYCLICALITY AND CHANGES IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES. FLUCTUATIONS IN THE PRICES OF AND THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. Substantially all of our businesses have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, cycles relating to industry capacity and general economic conditions. The length and magnitude of these cycles have varied over time and by product. In addition, changes in consumer preferences may increase or decrease the demand for our fiber based products and non fiber substitutes. Consequently, our operating cash flow is sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our products. COMPETITION IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. We operate in a competitive environment, both in the United States and internationally, in all of our operating segments. Pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors could negatively impact our financial results. RISKS RELATING TO MARKET AND ECONOMIC FACTORS CONTINUED ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS IN GENERAL BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION. General economic conditions may adversely affect industrial non durable goods production, consumer spending, commercial printing and advertising activity, white collar employment levels and consumer confidence, all of which impact demand for our products. In addition, continued volatility in the capital and credit markets, which 6 Table of Contents impacts interest rates, currency exchange rates and the availability of credit could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and our results of operations. CHANGES IN CREDIT RATINGS ISSUED BY NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED STATISTICAL RATING ORGANIZATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COST OF FINANCING AND HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR SECURITIES. Maintaining an investment grade credit rating is an important element of our financial strategy and a downgrade of our Companys ratings below investment grade may limit our access to the capital markets, have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities and increase our cost of borrowing. In light of current economic conditions, the Companys desire to maintain its investment grade rating may cause the Company to take certain actions designed to improve its cash flow, including sale of assets, reduction or suspension of the dividend and further reductions in capital expenditures and working capital. Similarly, we are subject to the risk that one of the banks that has issued irrevocable letters of credit supporting the installment notes issued in connection with sales of our forestlands is downgraded below a required rating. If this were to happen, it may increase the cost to the Company of securing a replacement letter of credit bank or could result in an acceleration of deferred taxes if a replacement bank cannot be obtained. THE IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT US. We have exposure to counterparties with which we execute transactions, including U.S. and foreign commercial banks, insurance companies, investment banks, investment funds and other financial institutions, some of which may be exposed to ratings downgrade, bankruptcy, liquidity, default or similar risks, especially in connection with recent financial market turmoil. A ratings downgrade, bankruptcy, receivership, default or similar event involving a counterparty may adversely affect our access to capital, liquidity position, future business and results of operations. OUR PENSION AND HEALTH CARE COSTS ARE SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS FACTORS WHICH COULD CAUSE THESE COSTS TO CHANGE. We have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all salaried U.S. employees hired prior to July 1, 2004 and substantially all hourly and union employees regardless of hire date. We provide retiree health care benefits to certain of our U.S. salaried and certain hourly employees. Our pension costs are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns as well as changes in general interest rates may result in increased pension costs in future periods. Likewise, changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could also increase pension and health care costs. Significant changes in any of these factors may adversely impact our cash flows, financial conditions and results of operations. OUR PENSION PLANS ARE CURRENTLY UNDERFUNDED, AND OVER TIME WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO MAKE CASH PAYMENTS TO THE PLANS, REDUCING THE CASH AVAILABLE FOR OUR BUSINESS. We record a liability associated with our pension plans equal to the excess of the benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets. The benefit liability recorded under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, at December 31, 2008 was $3.2 billion. Although we expect to have no obligation to fund our plans in 2009, over the next several years we may make contributions to the plans that could be material. The amount of such contributions will be dependent upon a number of factors, principally the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets, changes in interest rates and the impact of possible funding relief legislation currently under consideration in the U.S. Congress. CHANGES IN INTERNATIONAL CONDITIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Our operating results and business prospects could be substantially affected by risks related to the countries outside the United States in which we have manufacturing facilities or sell our products. Specifically, Brazil, Russia, Poland and China, where we have substantial manufacturing facilities, are countries that are exposed to economic and political instability in their respective regions of the world. Downturns in economic activity, adverse tax consequences, fluctuations in the value of local currency versus the U.S. dollar, nationalization or any change in social, political or labor conditions in any of these countries or regions could negatively affect our financial results. THE AMOUNT OF OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. OUR ABILITY TO REFINANCE OR REPAY OUR DEBT IS DEPENDENT UPON OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH FROM OPERATIONS AND CONDITIONS IN THE CREDIT MARKETS AND THE AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT GENERALLY. As of December 31, 2008, we had $1.6 billion of debt that had to be repaid or refinanced before 7 Table of Contents December 31, 2009, including $362 million of notes that matured in January 2009 and were repaid with cash on hand, and a 500 million (approximately $696 million) term loan due August 31, 2009 that we are currently negotiating to refinance. We have approximately $1.3 billion and $600 million in debt that matures in 2010 and 2011, respectively. We may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness. If we use a substantial portion of our cash flow to repay indebtedness, our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and the industries in which we operate may be limited. This may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less debt. Similarly, if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations to repay our debt, or are unable to refinance our debt because credit market conditions remain volatile, this may have an adverse impact on our cost of borrowing, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. RISKS RELATING TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND COMPLIANCE COSTS UNANTICIPATED EXPENDITURES RELATED TO THE COST OF COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS AND REQUIREMENTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Our operations are subject to U.S. and non U.S. laws and regulations relating to the environment, health and safety. There can be no assurance that compliance with existing and new laws and requirements, including with global climate change laws and regulations, will not require significant expenditures, or that existing reserves for specific matters will be adequate to cover future unanticipated costs. RESULTS OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. The costs and other effects of pending litigation against us cannot be determined with certainty. Although we believe that the outcome of any pending or threatened lawsuits or claims, or all of them combined, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements, there can be no assurance that the outcome of any lawsuit or claim will be as expected. RISKS RELATING TO OUR OPERATIONS MATERIAL DISRUPTIONS AT ONE OF OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. We operate our facilities in compliance with applicable rules and regulations and take measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities. A material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand, reduce our sales and or negatively impact our financial results. Any of our manufacturing facilities, or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility, could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events, including: unscheduled maintenance outages; prolonged power failures; an equipment failure; a chemical spill or release; explosion of a boiler; the effect of a drought or reduced rainfall on its water supply; labor difficulties; disruptions in the transportation infrastructure, including roads, bridges, railroad tracks and tunnels; fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes or other catastrophes; terrorism or threats of terrorism; domestic and international laws and regulations applicable to our Company and our business partners, including joint venture partners, around the world; and other operational problems. Any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products and or require us to make unplanned capital expenditures. If one of these machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime, our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer requirements could be impaired, resulting in lower sales and having a negative effect on our financial results. SEVERAL OF OUR OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED BY JOINT VENTURES THAT WE CANNOT OPERATE SOLELY FOR OUR BENEFIT. Several of our operations, particularly in emerging markets, are carried on by joint ventures such as the Ilim Group in Russia. In joint ventures we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may or may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities or resources as we do. In general, joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all co owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. Operating a business as a joint 8 Table of Contents venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as time consuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions. In joint ventures, we are required to pay more attention to our relationship with our co owners as well as with the joint venture, and if a co owner changes, our relationship may be adversely affected. In addition, the benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the co owners, so that we do not receive all the benefits from our successful joint ventures. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES FORESTLANDS As of December 31, 2008, the Company owned or managed approximately 200,000 acres of forestlands in the United States, approximately 250,000 acres in Brazil, and had, through licenses and forest management agreements, harvesting rights on government owned forestlands in Russia. All owned lands are independently third party certified for sustainable forestry (under operating standards of the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) in the United States and ISO 14001 and CERFLOR in Brazil). During 2006, in conjunction with the Companys 2006 Transformation Plan, approximately 5.6 million acres of forestlands in the United States were sold under various agreements, principally in October and November, for proceeds totaling approximately $6.6 billion of cash and notes. A further discussion of these sales transactions can be found on page 23 of Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and on pages 69 and 70 of

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY International Papers operating results in 2008 reflected two distinct economic periods. During the first three quarters, business conditions were soft but steady. Sales volumes for containerboard and boxes were solid, and paper and market pulp volumes, while below prior year levels, were steady. Average price realizations increased for key products, and market downtime was minimal. While key input costs for raw materials and energy and freight costs increased significantly over the nine month period, we were able to offset these effects with selling price increases, solid manufacturing operations and continued cost reduction efforts. Beginning with the end of the third quarter, U.S. economic activity contracted significantly resulting in dramatic declines in demand for uncoated freesheet products, corrugated boxes and market pulp. Global pulp prices began declining significantly, and paper and containerboard pricing leveled out as they reached a 2008 peak. With the significant drop in demand, and International Papers commitment to balance production with customer needs, we took about one million tons of lack of order downtime during the fourth quarter. Fortunately, input costs also peaked and began to decline. Despite these severe, unfavorable fourth quarter business conditions, the Company posted a 13% increase in net sales in 2008 to $24.8 billion, and generated a record $2.7 billion of cash from continuing operations. As we begin 2009, we expect that operating profits for the first quarter will be less than in the fourth quarter of 2008, with the size of the decline dependent upon the amount of downtime taken to match production with customer demand, and upon changes in pricing and input costs. Sales volumes for our paper and packaging businesses are expected to be similar to fourth quarter levels. We expect average sales price realizations for uncoated paper and containerboard to be under some pressure, while U.S. coated paperboard prices are expected to increase. Input costs for wood and energy, and transportation costs, should continue to decline, although energy costs in Europe and Brazil are expected to increase. Planned mill maintenance outages will be higher in the United States, but should remain about flat in Europe and Brazil. Earn ings from our Ilim joint venture are expected to be below fourth quarter totals. Results of Operations Industry segment operating profits are used by International Papers management to measure the earnings performance of its businesses. Management believes that this measure allows a better understanding of trends in costs, operating efficiencies, prices and volumes. Industry segment operating profits are defined as earnings before taxes, equity earnings and minority interest, interest expense, corporate items and corporate special items. Industry segment operating profits are defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as a non GAAP financial measure, and are not GAAP alternatives to net income or any other operating measure prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. International Paper operates in six segments: Printing Papers, Industrial Packaging, Consumer Packaging, Distribution, Forest Products, and Specialty Businesses and Other. The following table shows the components of net earnings (loss) for each of the last three years: In millions 2008 2007 2006 Industry segment operating profits $ 1,393 $ 1,897 $ 1,604 Corporate items, net (103 ) (206 ) (276 ) Corporate special items* (1,949 ) 241 2,373 Interest expense, net (492 ) (297 ) (521 ) Minority interest (5 ) (5 ) (9 ) Income tax provision (162 ) (415 ) (1,889 ) Equity earnings 49 Discontinued operations (13 ) (47 ) (232 ) Net earnings (loss) $ (1,282 ) $ 1,168 $ 1,050 * Corporate special items include gains on 2006 Transformation Plan forestland sales, restructuring and other charges, net losses (gains) on sales and impairments of businesses, goodwill impairment charges, insurance recoveries and reversals of reserves no longer required. Industry segment operating profits of $1.4 billion were $504 million lower in 2008 than in 2007 as the impacts of higher energy and raw material costs ($721 million), higher distribution costs ($135 million), lower sales volumes ($85 million), lower earnings from land and mineral rights sales ($59 million), and other items ($57 million) offset benefits from higher average prices ($570 million), and the net impact of cost reduction initiatives, improved operating performance and a more favorable product mix ($365 million). Additionally, charges totaling 16 Table of Contents $382 million were recorded in 2008 industry segment operating profits for facility closures, impairments and reorganization costs, and charges related to the integration of the Weyerhaeuser Containerboard, Packaging and Recycling (CBPR) business acquired in the 2008 third quarter. The principal changes in 2008 operating profit by segment were as follows: Printing Papers profits of $474 million were $365 million lower as the benefits of higher average sales price realizations, a more favorable mix of products sold and improved manufacturing operating costs were more than offset by higher raw material and energy costs, higher freight costs, lower sales volumes and increased lack of order downtime. Additionally, 2008 results included a $123 million charge for costs associated with the permanent shutdown of the Louisiana mill, a $107 million charge to reduce the carrying value of the assets of the Inverurie, Scotland mill to their estimated fair value, and a charge of $30 million for costs associated with the shutdown of a paper machine at the Franklin mill. Industrial Packagings profits of $390 million were up $16 million as the impacts of higher average sales price realizations, increased sales volumes (including sales from the CBPR acquisition) net of increased lack of order downtime, a more favorable mix of products sold, favorable operating costs, and lower costs associated with the conversion of the paper machine at the Pensacola mill to lightweight linerboard production were offset by higher raw material and freight costs, costs associated with the integration of the CBPR business, and a charge related to the write up of the inventory of CBPR to fair value. Consumer Packagings profits of $17 million were $95 million lower reflecting higher raw material, energy and freight costs, unfavorable mill operating costs, and higher charges associated with the reorganization of the Shorewood business, partially offset by improved average sales price realizations, higher sales volumes, and a more favorable mix of products sold. Distributions profits of $103 million were $5 million lower in 2008 due to the offsetting impacts of lower sales volumes and improved average sales margins and the full year contributions from the August 2007 Central Lewmar acquisition. Forest Products profits of $409 million were down $49 million as lower forestland and real estate sales more than offset $261 million of profits on mineral rights sales. Specialty Businesses and Others profits were $6 million lower reflecting the divestiture of the Arizona Chemical business in the first quarter of 2007. Corporate items, net, of $103 million of expense in 2008 were lower than the $206 million of expense in 2007 due to lower pension expenses. The decrease in 2007 versus $276 million of expense in 2006 reflects lower pension expenses partially offset by higher supply chain initiative costs. Corporate special items, including impairments of goodwill, restructuring and other charges and net losses (gains) on sales and impairments of businesses, were a loss of $1.9 billion in 2008 compared with a gain of $241 million in 2007 and a gain of $2.4 billion in 2006. The loss in 2008 includes $1.8 billion of goodwill impairment charges and $179 million of restructuring and other charges. The large gain in 2006 includes $4.8 billion from the sales of forestlands included in the 2006 Transformation Plan, partially offset by $1.4 billion of net charges related to the divestiture of certain operations and $759 million of goodwill impairment charges. Interest expense, net, was $492 million in 2008 compared with $297 million in 2007 and $521 million in 2006. The increase in 2008 reflects the issuance of approximately $6 billion of debt in connection with the acquisition of the CBPR business, while the decrease in 2007 reflects lower average debt balances and lower interest rates from debt refinancings and repayments. 17 Table of Contents The 2008 income tax provision of $162 million includes a net $11 million benefit related to 2008 special tax adjustment items. The 2007 income tax provision of $415 million includes a $41 million benefit related to 2007 special tax adjustment items. The 2006 income tax provision of $1.9 billion consists of $1.6 billion of deferred taxes (principally reflecting deferred taxes on the 2006 Transformation Plan forestland sales) and a $300 million current tax provision, and includes an $11 million charge related to 2006 special tax adjustment items. Excluding special items, taxes as a percent of pre tax earnings increased to 31.5% in 2008 from 30% in 2007 and 29% in 2006, reflecting a higher proportion of earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions. Discontinued Operations In 2008, $13 million of net adjustments were recorded relating to post closing adjustments and estimates associated with prior sales of discontinued businesses. During 2007, the Company completed the sale of its Wood Products, Beverage Packaging and Kraft Papers operations. In the third quarter of 2006, International Paper completed the sale of its Brazilian Coated Papers business. As a result of these actions, the operating results of these businesses and the associated gains/losses on the sales are reported in discontinued operations for all periods presented. Liquidity and Capital Resources For the year ended December 31, 2008, International Paper generated $2.7 billion of cash flow from continuing operations, compared with $1.9 billion in 2007. Capital spending from continuing operations for 2008 totaled $1.0 billion, or 74% of depreciation and amortization expense. Cash expenditures for acquisitions totaled $6.1 billion, principally for the acquisition of the CBPR business, while issuances of debt totaled $6.0 billion, principally for the CBPR acquisition. Our liquidity position remains strong, supported by approximately $2.5 billion of unused, committed credit facilities that we believe are adequate to meet future liquidity requirements. Maintaining an investment grade credit rating for our long term debt continues to be an important element in our overall financial strategy. Our focus in 2009 will be to continue to maximize our financial flexibility to facilitate access to capital markets on favorable terms. Capital spending for 2009 is targeted at $700 million, or about 43% of depreciation and amortization. Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Accounting Estimates Accounting policies that may have a significant effect on our reported results of operations and financial position, and that can require judgments by management in their application, include accounting for contingent liabilities, impairments of long lived assets and goodwill, pension and postretirement benefit obligations and income taxes.
