We direct research and development activities to short term, long term and technical assistance needs of customers and operating divisions, and to process, equipment and product innovations. Activities include studies on innovation and improvement of pulping, bleaching, chemical recovery, papermaking and coating processes; packaging design and materials development; reduction of environmental discharges; re use of raw materials in manufacturing processes; recycling of consumer and packaging paper products; energy conservation; applications of computer controls to manufacturing operations; innovations and improvement of products; and development of various new products. Our development efforts specifically address product safety as well as the minimization of solid waste. The cost to the Company of its research and development operations was $13 million in 2009, $22 million in 2008 and $24 million in 2007. The decrease in cost in 2009 reflects cost cutting measures. We own numerous patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets relating to our products and to the processes for their production. We also license intellectual property rights to and from others where necessary. Many of the manufacturing processes are among our trade secrets. Some of our products are covered by U.S. and non U.S. patents and are sold under well known trademarks. We derive a competitive advantage by protecting our trade secrets, patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, and by using them as required to support our businesses.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. EMPLOYEES As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately 56,100 employees, 37,500 of whom were located in the United States. Of the U.S. employees, approx imately 24,100 are hourly, with unions representing approximately 14,300 employees. Approximately 10,200 of the union employees are represented by the United Steel Workers (USW). International Paper and the USW entered into the 2007 Mill Agreement in July 2007, which established the framework for bargaining future local labor contracts at 14 of our U.S. pulp, paper and packaging mills. In April 2008, we entered into the 2008 Converting Agreement, which similarly establishes the framework for bargaining future local labor contracts at 32 of our converting facilities. These two agreements cover several specific items, including but not limited to wages, active medical benefits, successorship, employment security and health and safety. If local facility agreements are not successfully negotiated at the time of expiration, then, under the 2007 Mill Agreement and 2008 Converting Agreement, the local facility agreements will automatically renew with the same terms in effect at the time of expiration. Individual facilities continue to have local agreements for other items not covered by these agreements. During 2009, labor agreements for four mills covered by the 2007 Mill Agreement expired. Of those four, local agreements at Pensacola, Florida and Augusta, Georgia were negotiated, and local agreements at Savannah, Georgia and Ticonderoga, New York were renewed with the same terms. In November 2009, International Paper and the USW reached an agreement to integrate into the 2007 Mill Agreement the four mills we acquired from Weyerhaeuser Company in August 2008. The four mills are located in Pine Hill, Alabama, Red River, Louisiana, Valliant, Oklahoma and Port Hueneme, California. The local labor agreement for the mill at Pine Hill, Alabama renewed under the terms of the 2007 Mill Agreement. Additionally during 2009, International Paper announced the shutdown, and bargained the effects of the closing of the Franklin, Virginia, Pineville, Louisiana and Albany, Oregon mills. During 2010, labor agreements that are scheduled to expire at the mills in Riegelwood, North Carolina, Courtland, Alabama, Port Hueneme, California and Red River, Louisiana will automatically renew under the terms of the 2007 Mill Agreement if new agreements are not reached.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, that are not historical in nature, may constitute forward looking statements. These statements are often identified by the words, will, may, should, continue, anticipate, believe, expect, plan, appear, project, estimate, intend, and words of a similar nature. Such statements reflect the current views of International Paper with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Below, we have listed specific risks and uncertainties that you should carefully read and consider. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K (particularly in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations), or in the Companys other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the following are some important factors that could cause the Companys actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward looking statement. RISKS RELATING TO INDUSTRY CONDITIONS CHANGES IN THE COST OR AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS, ENERGY AND TRANSPORTATION COULD AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY. We rely heavily on the use of certain raw materials (principally virgin wood fiber, recycled fiber, caustic soda and starch), energy sources (principally natural gas, coal and fuel oil) and third party companies that transport our goods. The market price of virgin wood fiber varies based upon availability and source. In addition, the increase in demand of products manufactured, in whole or in part, from recycled fiber, on a global basis, may cause an occasional tightening in the supply of recycled fiber. Energy prices, in particular prices for oil and natural gas, have fluctuated dramatically in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future. Our profitability has been, and will continue to be, affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials, energy sources and transportation sources. THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE EXPERIENCE BOTH ECONOMIC CYCLICALITY AND CHANGES IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES. FLUCTUATIONS IN THE PRICES OF, AND THE DEMAND FOR, OUR PRODUCTS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. Substantially all of our businesses have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, cycles relating to industry capacity and general economic conditions. The length and magnitude of these cycles have varied over time and by product. In addition, changes in consumer preferences may increase or decrease the demand for our fiber based products and non fiber substitutes. Consequently, our operating cash flow is sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our products. COMPETITION IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. We operate in a competitive environment, both in the United States and internationally, in all of our operating segments. Pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors could negatively impact our financial results. 6 Table of Contents RISKS RELATING TO MARKET AND ECONOMIC FACTORS CONTINUED ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS IN GENERAL BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION. General economic conditions may adversely affect industrial non durable goods production, consumer spending, commercial printing and advertising activity, white collar employment levels and consumer confidence, all of which impact demand for our products. In addition, a return to volatility in the capital and credit markets, which impacts interest rates, currency exchange rates and the availability of credit, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and our results of operations. CHANGES IN CREDIT RATINGS ISSUED BY NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED STATISTICAL RATING ORGANIZATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COST OF FINANCING AND HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR SECURITIES. Maintaining an investment grade credit rating is an important element of our financial strategy, and a downgrade of our Companys ratings below investment grade may limit our access to the capital markets, have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities, and increase our cost of borrowing and require us to post collateral for derivatives in a net liability position. Similarly, we are subject to the risk that one of the banks that has issued irrevocable letters of credit supporting the installment notes issued in connection with sales of our forestlands is downgraded below a required rating. If this were to happen, it may subject the Company to additional costs of securing a replacement letter of credit bank or could result in an acceleration of deferred taxes if a replacement bank cannot be obtained. THE IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT US. We have exposure to counterparties with which we execute transactions, including U.S. and foreign commercial banks, insurance companies, investment banks, investment funds and other financial institutions, some of which may be exposed to ratings downgrade, bankruptcy, liquidity, default or similar risks, especially in connection with recent financial market turmoil. A ratings downgrade, bankruptcy, receivership, default or similar event involving a counterparty may adversely affect our access to capital, liquidity position, future business and results of operations. OUR PENSION AND HEALTH CARE COSTS ARE SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS FACTORS WHICH COULD CAUSE THESE COSTS TO CHANGE. We have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all U.S. salaried employees hired prior to July 1, 2004 and substantially all hourly and union employees regardless of hire date. We provide retiree health care benefits to certain of our U.S. salaried and certain hourly employees. Our pension costs are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns, changes in general interest rates and changes in the number of retirees may result in increased pension costs in future periods. Likewise, changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could also increase pension and health care costs. Significant changes in any of these factors may adversely impact our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. THE AMOUNT OF OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. As of December 31, 2009, we had $9.0 billion of long term debt, including notes payable and current maturities, and the amount of our debt obligations could adversely affect our business. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations to repay our debt, or are unable to refinance our debt because credit market conditions become volatile, this may have an adverse impact on our cost of borrowing, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. OUR PENSION PLANS ARE CURRENTLY UNDERFUNDED, AND OVER TIME WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO MAKE CASH PAYMENTS TO THE PLANS, REDUCING THE CASH AVAILABLE FOR OUR BUSINESS. We record a liability associated with our pension plans equal to the excess of the benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets. The benefit liability recorded under the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 715, Compensation Retirement Benefits, at December 31, 2009 was $2.8 billion. Although we expect to have no obligation to fund our plans in 2010, we continually reassess the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and could elect to make such a contribution in 2010. Regardless of whether we make a discretionary contribution in 2010, over the next several years we will make contributions to the plans that are likely to be material. The amount of such contributions will depend upon 7 Table of Contents a number of factors, principally the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets, changes in interest rates and the impact of possible funding relief legislation currently under consideration in the U.S. Congress. CHANGES IN INTERNATIONAL CONDITIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Our operating results and business prospects could be substantially affected by risks related to the countries outside the United States in which we have manufacturing facilities or sell our products. Specifically, Brazil, Russia, Poland and China, where we have substantial manufacturing facilities, are countries that are exposed to economic and political instability in their respective regions of the world. Downturns in economic activity, adverse tax consequences, fluctuations in the value of local currency versus the U.S. dollar, nationalization or any change in social, political or labor conditions in any of these countries or regions could negatively affect our financial results. RISKS RELATING TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND COMPLIANCE COSTS UNANTICIPATED EXPENDITURES RELATED TO THE COST OF COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS AND REQUIREMENTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Our operations are subject to U.S. and non U.S. laws and regulations relating to the environment, health and safety. There can be no assurance that compliance with existing and new laws and requirements, including with global climate change laws and regulations, will not require significant expenditures, or that existing reserves for specific matters will be adequate to cover future costs. RESULTS OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. The costs and other effects of pending litigation against us cannot be determined with certainty. Although we believe that the outcome of any pending or threatened lawsuits or claims, or all of them combined, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements, there can be no assurance that the outcome of any lawsuit or claim will be as expected. RISKS RELATING TO OUR OPERATIONS MATERIAL DISRUPTIONS AT ONE OF OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. We operate our facilities in compliance with applicable rules and regulations and take measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities. A material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand, reduce our sales and or negatively impact our financial results. Any of our manufacturing facilities, or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility, could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events, including: unscheduled maintenance outages; prolonged power failures; an equipment failure; a chemical spill or release; explosion of a boiler; the effect of a drought or reduced rainfall on its water supply; labor difficulties; disruptions in the transportation infrastructure, including roads, bridges, railroad tracks and tunnels; fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes or other catastrophes; terrorism or threats of terrorism; domestic and international laws and regulations applicable to our Company and our business partners, including joint venture partners, around the world; and other operational problems. 8 Table of Contents Any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products and or require us to make unplanned capital expenditures. If one of these machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime, our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer requirements could be impaired, resulting in lower sales and having a negative effect on our financial results. SEVERAL OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED BY JOINT VENTURES THAT WE CANNOT OPERATE SOLELY FOR OUR BENEFIT. Several operations, particularly in emerging markets, are carried on by joint ventures such as the Ilim joint venture in Russia. In joint ventures we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may or may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities or resources as we do. In general, joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all co owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. Operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as time consuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions. In joint ventures, we are required to pay more attention to our relationship with our co owners as well as with the joint venture, and if a co owner changes, our relationship may be adversely affected. In addition, the benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the co owners, so that we do not receive all the benefits from our successful joint ventures. For additional information with respect to our Ilim joint venture, see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation Liquidity and Capital Resources Ilim Holding S.A. Shareholders Agreement on page 37. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES FORESTLANDS As of December 31, 2009, the Company owned or managed approximately 200,000 acres of forestlands in the United States, approximately 250,000 acres in Brazil, and had, through licenses and forest management agreements, harvesting rights on government owned forestlands in Russia. All owned lands are independently third party certified for sustainable forestry (under operating standards of the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) in the United States and ISO 14001 and CERFLOR in Brazil). Our remaining forestlands are being marketed to optimize the economic value to our shareholders. Most of these forestlands consist of properties that are likely to be sold to investors and other buyers for various uses or held for real estate development. MILLS AND PLANTS A listing of our production facilities, the vast majority of which we own, can be found in Appendix I hereto, which is incorporated herein by reference. The Companys facilities are in good operating condition and are suited for the purposes for which they are presently being used. We continue to study the economics of modernization or adopting other alternatives for higher cost facilities. CAPITAL INVESTMENTS AND DISPOSITIONS Given the size, scope and complexity of our business interests, we continually examine and evaluate a wide variety of business opportunities and planning alternatives, including possible acquisitions and sales or other dispositions of properties.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY International Paper Company reported net sales of $23.4 billion in 2009, compared with $24.8 billion in 2008 and $21.9 billion in 2007. Net earnings totaled $663 million in 2009, including $1.4 billion of alternative fuel mixture credits and $853 million of charges to restructure ongoing businesses, compared with a loss of $1.3 billion in 2008, which included a $1.8 billion goodwill impairment charge. Net earnings in 2007 totaled $1.2 billion. The Company performed well in 2009 considering the magnitude of the challenges it faced, both domestically and around the world. Despite weak global economic conditions, the Company generated record cash flow from operations, enabling us to reduce long term debt by $3.1 billion while increasing cash balances by approximately $800 million. Also during 2009, the Company incurred 3.6 million tons of downtime, including 1.1 million tons associated with the shutdown of production capacity in our North American mill system to continue to match our production to our customers needs. These actions should result in higher operating rates, lower fixed costs and lower payroll costs in 2010 and beyond. Furthermore, the realization of integration synergies in our U.S. Industrial Packaging business and overhead reduction initiatives across the Company position International Paper to benefit from a lower cost profile in future years. As 2010 begins, we expect that first quarter operations will continue to be challenging. In addition to being a seasonally slow quarter for many of our businesses, poor harvesting weather conditions in the U.S. South and increasing competition for limited supplies of recycled fiber are expected to lead to further increases in fiber costs for our U.S. mills. Planned maintenance outage expenses will also be higher than in the 2009 fourth quarter. However, we have announced product price increases for our major global manufacturing businesses, and while these actions may not have a significant effect on first quarter results, we believe that the benefits beginning in the second quarter will be significant. Additionally, we expect to benefit from the capacity management, cost reduction and integration synergy actions taken during 2009. As a result, the Company remains positive about projected operating results in 2010, with improved earnings versus 2009 expected in all major businesses. We will continue to focus on aggressive cost management and strong cash flow generation as 2010 progresses. Results of Operations Industry segment operating profits are used by International Papers management to measure the earnings performance of its businesses. Management believes that this measure allows a better understanding of trends in costs, operating efficiencies, prices and volumes. Industry segment operating profits are defined as earnings before taxes, equity earnings, noncontrolling interests, interest expense, corporate items and corporate special items. Industry segment operating profits are defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as a non GAAP financial measure, and are not GAAP alternatives to net income or any other operating measure prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. International Paper operates in six segments: Industrial Packaging, Printing Papers, Consumer Packaging, Distribution, Forest Products, and Specialty Businesses and Other. The following table shows the components of net earnings (loss) attributable to International Paper Company for each of the last three years: In millions 2009 2008 2007 Industry segment operating profits $ 2,360 $ 1,393 $ 1,897 Corporate items, net (181 ) (103 ) (206 ) Corporate special items* (334 ) (1,949 ) 241 Interest expense, net (669 ) (492 ) (297 ) Noncontrolling interests 5 (5 ) (5 ) Income tax provision (469 ) (162 ) (415 ) Equity (loss) earnings (49 ) 49 Discontinued operations (13 ) (47 ) Net earnings (loss) attributable to International Paper Company $ 663 $ (1,282 ) $ 1,168 * Corporate special items include restructuring and other charges, goodwill impairment charges, gains on Transformation Plan forestland sales and net losses (gains) on sales and impairments of businesses. Industry segment operating profits of $2.4 billion were $967 million higher in 2009 than in 2008. Operating profits benefited from lower energy and raw material costs ($447 million), lower distribution costs ($142 million), favorable manufacturing operating costs ($481 million), incremental earnings from the CBPR business acquired in the third quarter of 2008 ($202 million), and other items ($35 million), offset by lower average sales price realizations ($444 million), lower sales volumes and increased lack of order downtime ($684 million), unfavorable 16 Table of Contents mix of products sold ($109 million) and lower earnings from land and mineral rights sales ($383 million). However, special items were a gain of $898 million in 2009 compared with a loss of $382 million in 2008. The principal changes in 2009 operating profit by segment were as follows: Industrial Packagings profits of $761 million were $371 million higher as the benefits of increased sales volumes (including sales from the CBPR acquisition), favorable operating costs and lower raw material and freight costs were partially offset by lower average sales price realizations and integration costs associated with the acquisition of the CBPR business. In addition, operating profits in 2009 included a gain of $849 million relating to alternative fuel mixture credits and $740 million of costs associated with the closures of the Albany, Oregon and Pineville, Louisiana mills, a paper machine at the Valliant, Oklahoma mill, and the Etienne mill in France. Printing Papers profits of $1.1 billion increased $617 million. The benefits of favorable mill operating costs, lower raw material and energy costs, lower freight costs and slightly lower facility shutdown costs were more than offset by the effects of lower sales volumes and increased lack of order downtime, lower average sales price realizations, and a less favorable mix of products sold. However, operating profits in 2009 also included a gain of $884 million relating to alternative fuel mixture credits. Consumer Packagings profits of $433 million were up $416 million as the benefits from lower raw material and energy costs, lower freight costs, higher average sales price realizations and lower charges associated with the reorganiza tion of the Shorewood business more than offset lower sales volumes and increased lack of order downtime, unfavorable operating costs, and charges associated with the shutdown of the Franklin, Virginia mill. In addition, operating profits in 2009 included a gain of $330 million relating to alternative fuel mixture credits. Distributions profits of $50 million were down $53 million due to lower sales volumes and average sales margins partially offset by improved operating costs and a favorable inventory valuation adjustment. Forest Products profits of $25 million decreased $384 million reflecting lower forestland and real estate sales in 2009, and $261 million of profits on mineral rights sales realized in 2008. Corporate items, net, of $181 million of expense in 2009 were higher than the $103 million of expense in 2008 due to higher pension expenses. The decrease in 2008 versus $206 million of expense in 2007 reflects lower pension expenses. Corporate special items, including restructuring and other items, impairments of goodwill, and net losses (gains) on sales and impairments of businesses, were a loss of $334 million in 2009 compared with a loss of $1.9 billion in 2008 and a gain of $241 million in 2007. The loss in 2008 includes $1.8 billion of goodwill impairment charges. Interest expense, net, was $669 million in 2009 compared with $492 million in 2008 and $297 million in 2007. The increases in 2009 and 2008 reflect the issuance of approximately $6.0 billion of debt in connection with the acquisition of the CBPR business in 2008 and higher interest rates in 2009 due to refinancing actions taken to extend debt maturities. The 2009 income tax provision of $469 million includes a net $165 million provision related to 2009 special tax adjustment items. The 2008 income tax provision of $162 million includes a net $11 million benefit related to 2008 special tax adjustment items. The 2007 income tax provision of $415 million includes a $41 million benefit related to 2007 special tax adjustment items. Excluding the tax effect of all special items, taxes as a percent of pre tax earnings were 30% in 2009 compared with 31.5% in 2008 and 30% in 2007. The higher income tax rate in 2008 reflects a higher proportion of earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions. 17 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations In 2008, $13 million of net adjustments were recorded relating to post closing adjustments and estimates associated with prior sales of discontinued businesses. During 2007, the Company completed the sale of its Wood Products, Beverage Packaging and Kraft Papers operations. As a result of these actions, the operating results of these businesses and the associated gains/losses on the sales are reported in discontinued operations for all applicable periods presented. Liquidity and Capital Resources For the year ended December 31, 2009, International Paper generated $4.7 billion of cash flow from continuing operations, including $1.7 billion from alternative fuel mixture credits, compared with $2.7 billion in 2008. Capital spending from continuing operations for 2009 totaled $534 million, or 36% of depreciation and amortization expense. Cash expenditures for acquisitions totaled $17 million, while net reductions of debt totaled $3.1 billion. Our liquidity position remains strong, supported by approximately $2.5 billion of committed credit facilities that we believe are adequate to meet future liquidity requirements. Maintaining an investment grade credit rating for our long term debt continues to be an important element in our overall financial strategy. Our focus in 2010 will be to maximize free cash flow, and we will use that cash to invest in high return consumption reduction capital projects and to reduce total debt, including the Companys unfunded pension obligation. Capital spending for 2010 is targeted at $800 million, or about 55% of depreciation and amortization. Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Accounting Estimates Accounting policies that may have a significant effect on our reported results of operations and financial position, and that can require judgments by management in their application, include accounting for contingent liabilities, impairments of long lived assets and goodwill, pension and postretirement benefit obligations and income taxes.
