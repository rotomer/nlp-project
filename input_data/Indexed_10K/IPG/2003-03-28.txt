Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW OF SIGNIFICANT EVENTS The year 2002 was a difficult one for the Company in which operating results were negatively impacted by continued softness in worldwide demand for advertising and marketing communications services. Also, during the year the Company identified charges that were related to prior periods that required restatements of previously filed financial statements. Subsequent to the end of 2002, the Company made certain management changes (including naming a new Chairman and CEO) and entered into new financing arrangements. A discussion of the significant events is as follows: * Economic conditions The year 2002 reflected continued softness in demand for all advertising and marketing communications services. Revenue dropped approximately 9% from 2001 to 2002. The drop in demand was not limited to any one of the Companys service offerings nor to any geographical region; however, there was a more widespread decline in project based business. In addition, the unstable geopolitical environment had an impact on client spending, particularly toward the latter part of the year. * Restatements During 2002 the Company identified charges that related to prior periods and restated its financial statements in previously amended SEC filings. The restatements included $181.3 ($135.9, net of tax) of charges that related largely to McCann Erickson WorldGroup ("McCann") intracompany and other charges. The restatements also included $118.7 ($83.8, net of tax) of long lived asset impairment and other charges that were required to be restated in the third quarter 2002 financial statements. Additionally, $47.0 ($35.3, net of tax) in other adjustments was identified. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion, including the period to which these charges relate. The Company has been advised by the Securities and Exchange Commission staff that it has issued a formal order of investigation in connection with the Companys restatement of earnings for the periods from 1997. The Company is cooperating fully with the SEC. * Management Changes In February 2003, the Board of Directors announced significant changes in the top management of the Company and its largest agency, McCann. The Companys Chairman and CEO, John J. Dooner, Jr. has assumed an active operating role as Chairman and CEO of McCann, replacing James R. Heekin, who has left the Company. David A. Bell, Vice Chairman and former CEO of True North, has assumed the role of Chairman and CEO of the Company. * Financing Activities As a result principally of the restatements discussed above, the Company required and received waivers and amendments related to certain borrowing arrangements. In connection with these amendments and waivers, the Company agreed to revised financial covenant levels and to restrictions on dividends, cash acquisitions, capital expenditures, prepayment of long term debt and additional borrowings by subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2002, the Company was in compliance with the terms of all of its borrowing arrangements. As discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, in March 2003, the Company completed the issuance and sale of $800.0 of aggregate principal amount of 4.5% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023. The Company intends to use the net proceeds of approximately $778 from the sale of the notes to fund a concurrent offer to purchase (for up to $582.5) its outstanding Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due 2021. Any funds raised in the offering but not used in the offer to purchase will be used for the repayment of other indebtedness, general corporate purposes and for working capital requirements. On October 25, 2002, Moodys Investors Services, Inc. downgraded the Companys credit rating to Baa3. On March 7, 2003, Standard and Poors downgraded the Companys credit rating to BB+. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for further discussion. THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) OUTLOOK The Companys results of operations are dependent upon: a) maintaining and growing its revenue, b) the ability to retain and gain new clients, c) the continuous alignment of its costs to its revenue and d) retaining and attracting key personnel. Revenue is also highly dependent on overall economic and political conditions. For a discussion of these and other factors that could affect the Companys results of operations and financial conditions, see "Statement Regarding Forward Looking Disclosure" and "Factors that May Affect the Companys Financial Condition and Results of Operations" above. As discussed above, 2002 was a difficult year for the Company, reflecting a continued softness in worldwide demand for advertising and marketing services. The uncertain economic and geopolitical environment results in a lack of visibility in the demand for advertising and marketing services for 2003. The Company continues to align its costs to its revenue, including a reduction in the Companys headcount to approxima tely 50,800 at December 31, 2002 from 54,100 the year before. Barring a further economic downturn or further adverse effects of the unstable geopolitical environment, the Company expects that 2003 revenue will decline between 1% to 4% from 2002 on an organic basis. On January 15, 2003, the Company announced that it had hired outside advisors to help explore strategic alternatives regarding NFO, its custom marketing research operation, and is currently in discussions concerning a possible sale. In addition, the Company is evaluating exit strategies relative to its motorsports business. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion relates to the results of the Company after giving effect to the adjustments for the restatements described above in "Overview of Significant Events". All amounts discussed below are reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). When comparing performance between years, the Company discusses the impact that foreign currency rate changes, acquisitions/dispositions and organic growth have on reported results. As the Company derives significant revenue from international operations, changes in foreign currency rates between the years may have significant impact on reported results. Reported results are also impacted by the Companys acquisition and disposition activity. Management believes that discussing the impact of currency fluctuations and acquisitions/dispositions provides a better understanding of the reported results. The Company also discusses the impact of the loss of the Chrysler account in the fourth quarter of 2000 (revenue and operating expenses related to which continued through the second quarter of 2001). Chrysler was a major client of True North Communications, Inc. ("True North"), which the Company acquired in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests in June 2001. In addition, as a result of the acquisition of True North, the Company lost accounts of Pepsi owned brands due to client conflicts within the combined company. Management believes that discussing the impact of these significant client losses is relevant when comparing performance between years. The Company reported net income of $99.5 or $0.26 diluted earnings per share, net loss of $534.5 or $1.45 diluted loss per share and net income of $392.8 or $1.06 diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Net income in 2002 includes $127.1 of long lived asset impairment and other charges related to its motorsports business. Net income in 2001 includes $645.6 of restructuring and other merger related costs in connection with the acquisition of True North and subsequent realignment of certain of its businesses and $303.1 of long lived asset impairment and other charges related to goodwill associated with the Companys internet services businesses and several other offices in Europe and Asia Pacific. Net income in 2000 includes restructuring and other merger related costs of $177.7 related to the merger of two of its advertising networks, costs associated with the loss of the Chrysler account, and other transaction costs primarily related to the Companys me rgers with Deutsch and NFO. As discussed in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is comprised of two reportable segments: the Interpublic Sports and Entertainment Group ("SEG"), and IPG excluding SEG. SEG was formed during the second quarter of 2002 through a carve out from the Companys other operating groups and is primarily comprised of the operations of Octagon, which is the Companys sports marketing business and includes the Companys motorsports business, and Jack Morton Worldwide, which is the Companys event planning business. THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) SEG revenue is not material to the Company as a whole. However, in 2002 due to the recording of long lived asset impairment charges, the operating difficulties and resulting higher costs from its motorsports business, SEG incurred a significant operating loss. Based on the fact that the book value of long lived assets relating to OMS and other substantial contractual obligations may not be fully recoverable, the Company no longer expects that margins of SEG will converge with those of the rest of IPG and accordingly has begun to report SEG as a separate reportable segment. Other than the impairment charges which are discussed below, the operating results of SEG are not material to those of the Company, and therefore are not discussed in detail below. The following summarizes certain financial information for purposes of managements discussion and analysis: 2002 2001 2000 IPG (excl. SEG) SEG Total IPG IPG (excl. SEG) SEG Total IPG IPG (excl. SEG) SEG Total IPG Revenue $5,834.9 $ 368.7 $6,203.6 $6,365.7 $ 425.5 $6,791.2 $6,785.1 $397.6 $7,182.7 Salaries and related 3,367.3 181.7 3,549.0 3,608.9 200.3 3,809.2 3,859.4 197.0 4,056.4 Office and general 1,849.0 247.6 2,096.6 1,917.3 186.5 2,103.8 1,863.8 122.8 1,986.6 Amortization of intangibles 10.3 2.7 13.0 161.0 12.1 173.1 135.6 8.8 144.4 Restructuring and other merger related 12.1 12.1 616.1 29.5 645.6 174.7 3.0 177.7 Long lived asset impairment and other charges 127.1 127.1 293.2 9.9 303.1 Operating income (loss) $ 596.2 $(190.4) $ 405.8 $(230.8) $(12.8) $(243.6) $ 751.6 $ 66.0 $817.6 Some of the key factors driving the financial results in 2002 were: * Revenue declines as a result of the continued softness in demand for the Companys services; * Reduction in salaries and related expenses as a result of headcount reductions from the Companys 2001 restructuring initiatives; * Higher bad debt expense and additional professional fees resulting from the restatement and related litigation and the SEC investigation previously described and the higher costs related to the Companys motorsports business within SEG; and * Reduced amortization of intangible assets as a result of adopting the accounting standard related to goodwill amortization. REVENUE The Company is a worldwide global marketing services company, providing clients with communications expertise in four broad areas: a) advertising and media management, b) marketing communications, which includes direct marketing and customer relationship management, public relations, sales promotion, event marketing, on line marketing, corporate and brand identity and healthcare marketing, c) marketing intelligence, which includes marketing research, brand consultancy and database management and d) specialized marketing services, which includes sports and entertainment marketing, corporate meetings and events, retail marketing and other marketing and business services. Worldwide revenue for 2002 was $6,203.6, a decrease of $587.6 or 8.7% from 2001. Domestic revenue, which represented 56% of revenue in 2002, decreased $390.5 or 10.1% from 2001. International revenue, which represented 44% of revenue in 2002, decreased $197.1 or 6.8% from 2001. International revenue would have decreased 7.5% excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency. The decrease in worldwide revenue was primarily the result of the continued softness in the demand for advertising and marketing services by current clients THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) due to the weak economy, the impact of the loss of the Chrysler account in the fourth quarter of 2000 and the merger related loss of accounts of Pepsi owned brands. The components of the total revenue change of (8.7)% were: net acquisitions/divestitures (0.6)%, impact of foreign currency changes 0.3%, impact of the loss of the Chrysler account and loss of accounts of Pepsi owned brands (0.7)% and organic revenue decline (7.7)%. Organic changes in revenue are based on increases or decreases in net new business activity and increases or decreases in activity from existing client accounts. Worldwide revenue for 2001 was $6,791.2, a decrease of $391.5 or 5.5% from 2000. Domestic revenue, which represented 57% of revenue in 2001, decreased $364.5 or 8.6% from 2000. International revenue, which represented 43% of revenue in 2001, decreased $27.0 or 0.9% from 2000. International revenue would have increased 5.1% excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency. The decrease in worldwide revenue was a result of reduced demand for advertising and marketing services due to the weak economy, particularly in the United States, the negative impact of the events of September 11 and the impact of the loss of the Chrysler account in the fourth quarter of 2000. The components of the total revenue change of (5.5)% were: net acquisitions/divestitures 0.9%, impact of foreign currency changes (2.2)%, impact of the loss of the Chrysler account (1.6)%, the estimated impact of the events of September 11 (0.5)% and organic revenue decline (2.1)%. Organic changes in revenue are based on increases or decreases in net new business activity and increases or decreases in activity from existing client accounts. OPERATING EXPENSES Worldwide operating expenses for 2002 decreased $1,237.0, or 17.6% to $5,797.8. Worldwide operating expenses for 2001 increased $669.7 or 10.5% to $7,034.8. Salaries and Related Expenses In 2002, the Companys expenses related to employee compensation and various employee incentive and benefit programs amount to approximately 57% of revenue. The employee incentive programs are based primarily upon operating results. Salaries and related expenses in all periods were also impacted by normal salary progression. Salaries and related expenses were $3,549.0 for 2002 and $3,809.2 in 2001, a decrease of $260.2 or 6.8%. The decrease is a result of lower headcount, which was reduced by 6.1% to 50,800 at December 31, 2002 from 54,100 at December 31, 2001. This was partially offset by a benefit of $50.0 recorded in 2001 resulting from a reduction in severance reserves related to significant headcount reductions. The components of the total change of (6.8)% were: net acquisitions/divestitures (1.0)%, impact of foreign currency changes 0.4%, impact of the loss of the Chrysler account and loss of accounts of Pepsi owned brands (0.5)% and reductions in salaries and related expenses from existing operations (5.7)%. Salaries and related expenses were $3,809.2 in 2001 and $4,056.4 in 2000, a decrease of $247.2 or 6.1%. The decrease was a result of lower headcount, which was reduced by 12.7% to 54,100 at December 31, 2001 from 62,000 at December 31, 2000, a benefit of $50.0 in 2001 resulting from a reduction in severance reserves related to significant headcount reductions, and reduced incentive compensation commensurate with performance. The components of the total change of (6.1)% were: net acquisitions/divestitures 0.8%, impact of foreign currency changes (2.0)%, impact of the loss of the Chrysler account (1.4)% and reductions in salaries and related expenses from existing operations (3.5)%. Office and General Expenses Office and general expenses were $2,096.6 in 2002 and $2,103.8 in 2001, a decrease of $7.2 or 0.3%. The decrease was primarily due to the cost reduction initiatives from the 2001 restructuring plan including reduced travel and entertainment costs and reduced office related and supplies costs, and write off of operating assets of $85.4 in 2001 which were no longer considered realizable. This was offset by an increase in professional fees resulting from the restatements and the related litigation and the SEC investigation previously described, an increase in bad debt expense and higher costs related to the Companys motorsports business within SEG. The components of the total change of (0.3)% were: net acquisitions/divestitures (0.2)%, impact of foreign currency changes 0.5%, impact of the loss of the Chrysler account and loss of accounts of Pepsi owned brands (0.7)% and increases in office and general expenses from existing operations 0.1%. THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Office and general expenses were $2,103.8 in 2001 and $1,986.6 in 2000, an increase of $117.2 or 5.9%. The increase was primarily due to higher office rental costs, supplies costs and travel and entertainment costs. However, during the latter part of the year, the Company benefited from the restructuring plan initiatives, which reflected a reduction of such costs. The components of the total change of 5.9% were: acquisitions net of divestitures 0.4%, impact of foreign currency changes (2.4)%, impact of the loss of the Chrysler account (2.2)% and increases in office and general expenses from existing operations 10.1%. Amortization of Intangible Assets Amortization of intangible assets was $13.0 in 2002, $173.1 in 2001 and $144.4 in 2000. The decrease in 2002 is primarily a result of the adoption of the new standard on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets effective January 1, 2002. See Recent Accounting Standards section for discussion of the cessation of goodwill amortization and the amortization of other intangible assets. Restructuring and Other Merger related Costs 2002 Activities In the third quarter of 2002, the Company recorded an additional $12.1 in charges related to the 2001 restructuring plan. The additional charge was necessitated largely by increases in estimates of lease losses due to lower than anticipated sublease income in key markets, including San Francisco, Chicago, Paris and London. 2001 Activities Following the completion of the True North acquisition in June 2001, the Company initiated a series of operational initiatives focusing on: a) the integration of the True North operations and the identification of synergies and savings, b) the realignment of certain Interpublic businesses and c) productivity initiatives to achieve higher operating margins. In connection with the operational initiatives, the Company executed a wide ranging restructuring plan that included severance, lease terminations and other actions. The total amount of the charges incurred in 2001 in connection with the plan was $645.6 ($446.5, net of tax). A summary of the remaining liability for restructuring and other merger related costs, including the 2002 charges, is as follows: Balance at December 31, 2001 2002 Charge Cash paid in 2002 Long term Liabilities and Non cash Items Liability at December 31, 2002 TOTAL BY TYPE Severance and termination costs $154.0 $ 2.3 $(129.2) $(11.2) $ 15.9 Lease termination and other exit costs 157.1 9.8 (72.3) 94.6 Total $311.1 $12.1 $(201.5) $(11.2) $110.5 The Company has terminated approximately 7,000 employees in connection with the restructuring plan. The majority of the remaining severance liabilities are expected to be paid out through the end of the third quarter of 2003. Amounts totaling $11.2 have been transferred from restructuring liabilities to non current liabilities (in the case of certain long term deferred compensation arrangements) or to additional paid in capital (in the case of vested restricted stock amounts). The Company downsized or vacated approximately 180 locations. The remaining liabilities will be paid out over a period of up to five years. Lease termination and related costs included write offs related to the abandonment of leasehold improvements as part of the office vacancies. Other exit costs relate principally to the impairment loss on sale or closing of certain business units in the US and Europe. In the aggregate, the businesses sold or closed represented an immaterial portion of the revenue and operating profit of the Company. The write off amount was computed based upon the difference between the estimated sales proceeds (if any) and the carrying value of the related assets. The sales and closures had been completed by September 30, 2002. THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) 2000 Activities During 2000, the Company recorded restructuring and other merger related costs of $177.7 ($124.3, net of tax). Of the total pre tax restructuring and other merger related costs, cash charges represented $104.6. The key components of the charge were: a) costs associated with the restructuring of Lowe & Partners Worldwide (formerly Lowe Lintas & Partners Worldwide), b) costs associated with the loss, by True North, of the Chrysler account, c) other costs related to the acquisition of Deutsch and d) costs related principally to the merger with NFO. Lowe & Partners In October 1999, the Company announced the merger of two of its advertising networks. The networks affected, Lowe & Partners Worldwide and Ammirati Puris Lintas, were combined to form a new agency. The merger involved the consolidation of operations in agencies in approximately 24 cities in 22 countries around the world and the severance of approximately 600 employees. As of September 30, 2000, all restructuring activities had been completed. In connection with this restructuring, costs of $84.1 ($51.4, net of tax) were recorded in 1999 and $87.8 ($53.6, net of tax) in 2000. Of the totals, $75.6 related to severance, $50.2 related to lease related costs and the remainder related principally to investment write offs. No adjustment to the Companys statement of operations was required as a result of the completion of the restructuring plan. Loss of Chrysler Account As a result of the loss of the Chrysler account, one of True Norths larger accounts, the Company recorded a charge of $17.5 pre tax ($10.0, net of tax) in the fourth quarter of 2000. The charge covered primarily severance, lease termination and other exit costs associated with the decision to close the Detroit office. In addition, an impairment loss of $5.5 was recorded for intangible assets that were determined to be no longer recoverable. Offsetting these charges was a $5.2 payment from Chrysler to compensate the Company for severance and other exit costs. As of December 31, 2001, all actions had been completed. Acquisition of Deutsch In connection with the acquisition of Deutsch in 2000, the Company recognized a charge related to one time transaction costs of $44.7 ($41.7, net of tax). The principal component of this amount related to the expense associated with various equity participation agreements with certain members of management. These agreements provided for participants to receive a portion of the proceeds in the event of the sale or merger of Deutsch. NFO In addition to the above 2000 activities, additional charges, substantially all of which were cash costs, were recorded during 2000 related principally to the transaction and other merger related costs arising from the acquisition of NFO. Long Lived Asset Impairment and Other Charges 2002 Impairment Octagon Motorsports (OMS), within SEG, owns and leases certain racing circuit facilities that are used for automobile, motorcycle and go cart racing, primarily in the United Kingdom. Beginning in the second quarter of 2002 and continuing in subsequent quarters, certain of the Octagon businesses experienced significant operational difficulties, including significantly lower than anticipated attendance at the marquee British Grand Prix race in July 2002. These events and a change in management at OMS in the third quarter of 2002 led the Company to begin assessing its long term strategy for OMS. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 142, the Company prepared a discounted cash flow analysis which indicated that the book value of OMS significantly exceeded its estimated fair value and that a goodwill impairment had occurred in the third quarter of 2002. In addition, as a result of the goodwill analysis, the Company assessed whether there had been an impairment of the Companys long lived assets in accordance with SFAS 144. The Company concluded that the book value of certain asset groupings at OMS was significantly higher than their expected future cash flows and that an impairment had occurred. Accordingly, the Company has recognized a non cash impairment loss and related charge of $127.1 ($89.7, net of tax) in 2002. The charges included $82.1 of goodwill impairment, $33.0 of fixed assets and capital expenditure write offs, and $12.0 to record the fair value of an associated put option. THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) In addition, OMS is contractually required to upgrade and improve certain of its existing facilities over the next two years. As of December 31, 2002, these capital expenditure commitments amount to approximately $30 and are expected to be impaired as incurred based on current cash flow analyses for the relevant asset groupings. In the fourth quarter of 2002, management determined that its original operating plans were no longer feasible and decided to explore options to exit some or all of these businesses. The remaining book value of long lived assets relating to OMS was approximately $70 at December 31, 2002, and this amount, as well as other substantial contractual obligations, may not be fully recoverable depending upon the exit strategy ultimately followed. 2001 Impairment Following the completion of the True North acquisition and the realignment of certain of the Companys businesses in 2001, the Company evaluated the realizability of various assets. In connection with this review undiscounted cash flow projections were prepared for certain investments, and the Company determined that the goodwill attributable to certain business units was stated at an amount in excess of the future estimated cash flows. As a result, an impairment charge of $303.1 ($263.4, net of tax) was recorded in 2001. Of the total write off, $221.4 was recorded in the second quarter, with the remainder recorded in the third quarter. The largest components of the goodwill impairment and other charges were Capita Technologies, Inc. (approximately $145) and Zentropy Partners (approximately $16), both internet services businesses. The remaining amount primarily related to several other businesses including internet services, healthcare consulting and certain advertising offices in Europe and Asia Pac ific. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) Interest Expense Interest expense decreased by $19.0 to $145.6 in 2002 due to lower debt levels, lower interest rates paid on short term borrowings and the issuance and sale of the Zero Coupon Notes in December 2001. The Company used the net proceeds of $563.2 from the Zero Coupon Notes to repay indebtedness under the Companys credit facilities. Interest expense increased by $38.3 to $164.6 in 2001 due to higher debt levels, which included the issuance and sale of $500.0, 7.25% notes due 2011 in August 2001. The increase was partially offset by lower interest rates paid on short term borrowings. The Companys effective interest rate was benefited by the interest rate swap agreements covering substantially all of the $500.0, 7.875% notes issued in 2000. The interest rate savings as a result of these agreements was approximately $13.9 and $4.5 in 2002 and 2001, respectively. During 2002, the Company terminated all interest rate swap agreements. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below for description of financing activities. Interest Income Interest income was $29.8 in 2002, $41.8 in 2001 and $57.5 in 2000. The decrease in 2002 is primarily due to lower interest rates. The decrease in 2001 is primarily due to lower interest rates and lower average cash balances primarily resulting from the lower earnings levels in 2001. Other Income The following table sets forth the components of other income: 2002 2001 2000 Gains on sales of business $ 7.0 $12.3 $16.5 Gains (losses) on sales of available for sale securities 5.3 (2.5) 28.5 Investment income and miscellaneous 2.8 3.9 (2.4) $15.1 $13.7 $42.6 See Investing Activities in "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below for a discussion of proceeds from sales of businesses. THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) INVESTMENT IMPAIRMENT During 2002, the Company recorded $39.7 of investment impairment primarily related to certain investments of Octagon, the Companys sports marketing business within SEG. The impairment charges adjusted the carrying value of investments to the estimated market value where an other than temporary impairment had occurred. During 2001, the Company recorded total charges related to the impairment of investments of $210.8 ($136.6, net of tax). Of the total amount, $160.1 ($103.7, net of tax) was recorded in the first quarter, and $48.2 ($30.4, net of tax) was recorded in the third quarter. The charge in the first quarter related to the impairment of investments primarily in publicly traded internet related companies, including marchFIRST, Inc. (an internet professional services firm), which had filed for relief under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code in April 2001. The third quarter charge included write offs for investments in non internet companies, certain venture funds and other investments. In addition, the Company recorded a charge of $2.5 to record the fair value of a put option. The impairment charges adjusted the carrying value of investments to the estimated market value where an other than temporary impairment had occurred. OTHER ITEMS Effective Income Tax Rate The Companys effective income tax rate was an expense of 52.9% in 2002, a benefit of 9.8% in 2001 and an expense of 43.0% in 2000. The 2002 effective income tax rate includes the effect of the adoption of SFAS 142 (See Note 1). The 2001 and 2000 effective income tax rates reflect the impact of goodwill amortization. The 2002, 2001 and 2000 effective tax rates were also impacted by restructuring and other merger related costs and long lived asset impairment and other charges that resulted in tax benefits lower than the statutory rate of 35%. The difference between the effective tax rate and the statutory federal rate of 35% is also due to state and local taxes and the effect of non US operations. The increased tax rate in 2002 reflects a higher proportion of earnings derived from the US, where it is taxed at higher rates. The increased tax rate in 2001 reflects a change in the tax status of Deutsch, Inc., which was acquired in November 2000, from "S" Corporation to "C" Corporation status. Minority Interest Income applicable to minority interests was $31.3 in 2002, $30.3 in 2001 and $42.8 in 2000. The decrease in 2001 was primarily due to lower operating results of certain operations in Europe and Asia Pacific. Unconsolidated Affiliates Equity in net income (loss) of unconsolidated affiliates was $5.7 in 2002, $4.0 in 2001 and a loss of $15.6 in 2000. The increase in 2002 was primarily due to increased earnings of unconsolidated affiliates in the US, partially offset by the sale of an unconsolidated affiliate in Europe and the US. The increase in 2001 was due to a charge of $25.7 in 2000 related to the Companys share of the asset impairment and restructuring charges of Modem Media, reduced earnings of unconsolidated affiliates and the consolidation of an advertising office in the Middle East at the end of 2000. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES The Company enters into interest rate swaps, hedges of net investments in foreign operations and forward contracts. Interest Rate Swaps At December 31, 2001, the Company had outstanding interest rate swap agreements covering $400.0 of the $500.0, 7.875% notes due October 2005. The swaps had the same term as the debt and effectively converted the fixed rate on the debt to a variable rate based on 6 month LIBOR. The swaps were accounted for as hedges of the fair value of the related debt and were recorded as an asset or liability as appropriate. As of December 31, 2001, the fair value of the hedges was an asset of approximately $10. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had terminated all of the interest rate swap agreements covering the $500.0, 7.875% notes due October 2005. In connection with the termination of the interest rate swap agreements, the Company received $45.7 in cash which will be recorded as an offset to interest expense over the remaining life of the related debt. THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Hedges of Net Investments The Company has significant foreign operations and conducts business in various foreign currencies. In order to hedge the value of its investment in Europe, the Company had designated approximately 125 million Euro of borrowings under its $375.0 Revolving Credit Facility as a hedge of this net investment. Changes in the spot rate of the debt instruments designated as hedges of the net investment in a foreign subsidiary are reflected in the cumulative translation adjustment component of stockholders equity. The amount deferred in 2001 was approximately $5. The Company has repaid the Euro borrowings that, as of December 31, 2001, had been designated as a hedge of a net investment. On December 12, 2002, the Company designated the Yen borrowings under its $375.0 Revolving Credit Facility in the amount of $36.5 as a hedge of its net investment in Japan. The amount deferred in 2002 was not material. Forward Contracts The Company has entered into foreign currency transactions in which foreign currencies (principally the Euro, Pounds Sterling and the Japanese Yen) are bought or sold forward. The contracts were entered into to meet currency requirements arising from specific transactions. The changes in value of these forward contracts were reflected in the Companys consolidated statement of operations. As of December 31, 2001 the Company had contracts covering approximately $50 of notional amount of currency and the fair value of the forward contracts was a loss of $0.2. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had contracts covering $37.1 of notional amount of currency and the fair value of the forward contracts was a gain of $5.1. Other The Company has two embedded derivative instruments under the terms of the offering of Zero Coupon Notes (for which a tender offer was made in March 2003) as discussed in Note 8. At December 31, 2002, the fair value of the two derivatives was negligible. In connection with the issuance and sale of the 4.5% Convertible Senior Notes in March 2003, two embedded derivatives were created. The fair value of the two derivatives in March 2003 was negligible. As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has entered into various put and call options related to acquisitions. The exercise price of such options is generally based upon the achievement of projected operating performance targets and approximate fair value. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES At December 31, 2002, cash and cash equivalents were $933.0, a decrease of $2.2 from the December 31, 2001 balance of $935.2. The Company collects funds from clients on behalf of media outlets resulting in cash receipts and disbursements at levels substantially exceeding its revenue. Therefore, the working capital amounts reported on its balance sheet and cash flows from operating activities reflect the "pass through" of these items. Cash flow from operations and borrowings under existing credit facilities, and refinancings thereof, have been the primary sources of the Companys working capital, and management believes that they will continue to be so in the future. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $873.8, $141.6 and $602.1 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in 2002 was attributable to an increase in cash provided from working capital primarily as a result of improved receivables management and timing of international media payments at year end, and includes reduced payments of incentives in 2002. The decrease in 2001 was primarily attributable to lower operating profit levels and to severance payments made in connection with the Companys restructuring plan. THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Investing Activities The Company has pursued acquisitions to complement and enhance its service offerings. In addition, the Company has also sought to acquire businesses similar to those already owned to expand its geographic scope to better serve new and existing clients. Acquisitions have historically been funded using stock, cash or a combination of both. During 2002, 2001 and 2000 the Company paid $54.1, $1,729.7 and $1,668.3, respectively, in cash and stock for new acquisitions, including a number of specialized marketing and communications services companies to complement its existing agency systems and to optimally position itself in the ever broadening communications marketplace. This amount includes the value of stock issued for pooled companies and includes cash of $53.0, $84.7 and $577.4 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. During the three year period ended December 31, 2002, the Company paid the following deferred payments on acquisitions that had closed in prior years: 2002 2001 2000 Cash $240.1 $228.9 $158.1 Stock 83.2 48.2 63.2 $323.3 $277.1 $221.3 The Companys capital expenditures in 2002 were $183.2 compared to $268.0 in 2001 and $259.5 in 2000. The primary purposes of these expenditures were to upgrade computer and telecommunications systems and to modernize offices. The Companys planned capital expenditures for 2003 are estimated to be less than the level of spending in 2002. Currently, the Company is restricted in making capital expenditures by new terms of its Revolving Credit Facilities. See "Financing Activities" for further discussion. During 2002, proceeds from the sales of businesses included an unconsolidated affiliate in Europe for proceeds of $12.8, an unconsolidated affiliate in the US for proceeds of $5.2 and a marketing services affiliate for proceeds of $3.8. During 2001, proceeds from the sales of businesses included a marketing services affiliate in Europe for proceeds of approximately $5 and some non core marketing services affiliates in the US for proceeds of $6.9. During 2000, proceeds from the sales of businesses included its interest in a non core minority owned marketing services business for proceeds of approximately $12. Financing Activities Total debt at December 31, 2002 was $2,638.0, a decrease of $271.0 from December 31, 2001. The Companys debt position was positively impacted by international cash and debt pooling arrangements that were put in place to optimize the net debt balances in certain markets. Revolving Credit Agreements On June 27, 2000 and May 16, 2002, the Company entered into two revolving credit facilities, respectively, each provided by a syndicate of banks (the "Revolving Credit Facilities"), which are used to fund the Companys ordinary course business needs. The facility entered into on June 27, 2000 provides for borrowings of up to $375.0 and is for a term of five years, which expires in June of 2005. The facility entered into on May 16, 2002 provides for borrowings of up to $500.0 and is for a term of 364 days, which expires on May 15, 2003. However, the Company has the option to extend the maturity of amounts outstanding on the termination date under the 364 day Revolving Credit Facility for a period of one year. As of December 31, 2002, no amounts were borrowed under the 364 day Revolving Credit Agreements and $50.3 was borrowed under the five year Revolving Credit Facility. As of March 20, 2003, no amounts were borrowed under the 364 day Revolving Credit Facility and approximately $49.8 was borrowed under the five year Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facilities bear interest at variable rates based on either LIBOR or a banks base rate, at the Companys option. The interest rates on base rate loans and LIBOR loans under the Revolving Credit Facilities are THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) affected by the facilities utilization levels and the Companys credit ratings. On October 25, 2002, Moodys Investors Services, Inc. downgraded the Companys credit rating to Baa3. On March 7, 2003, Standard and Poors downgraded the Companys credit rating to BB+. As of March 7, 2003, the combined effect of the downgrades was an increase in the interest spread payable on LIBOR loans under the Revolving Credit Facilities of 25 basis points from the interest rate spread of 1.25% applicable as of December 31, 2002. The Companys Revolving Credit Facilities include financial covenants that set i) maximum levels of debt as a function of EBITDA and ii) minimum levels of EBITDA as a function of interest expense (in each case, as defined in these agreements). As of December 31, 2002, the Company was in compliance with all of the covenants (including the financial covenants, as amended) contained in the Revolving Credit Facilities. During the third quarter of 2002, the Company obtained waivers of certain provisions (excluding financial covenants) contained in the Revolving Credit Facilities, which related to the restatement of the Companys historical consolidated financial statements in the aggregate amount of $181.3. In connection with these waivers, the Company agreed to an increase in interest rates and commitment fees payable to the lenders. The Company also paid fees to the lenders as additional consideration for their granting the waivers. The impact of the fees paid and the increased interest rates is not material to the Companys financial position, cash flows or results of operations. On February 10, 2003, certain defined terms relating to financial covenants contained in the Revolving Credit Facilities were amended effective as of December 31, 2002. The definition of debt for borrowed money in the Revolving Credit Facilities was modified to include the Companys 1.8% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2004 and 1.87% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2006. As a result, the definition of Interest Expense was also amended to include all interest with respect to these Subordinated Notes. The definition of EBITDA in the Revolving Credit Agreements was amended to include up to $500.0 of non cash, non recurring charges taken in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002 and the quarter ended March 31, 2003. The corresponding financial covenant ratio levels in the Revolving Credit Facilities were also amended. The Company also amended certain other provisions of the Revolving Credit Facilities effective as of December 31, 2002. The new terms of the Revolving Credit Facilities restrict the Companys ability to declare or pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock, make cash acquisitions or investments, make capital expenditures and prepay long term debt, as well as the ability of the Companys domestic subsidiaries to incur additional debt. Certain of these limitations are modified upon receipt of aggregate net cash proceeds equal to at least $400.0 from asset sales and capital markets transactions. The level of proceeds from such transactions and the outstanding balance of the Companys Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due 2021 (the "Zero Coupon Notes") will determine the permitted levels of annual acquisition spending and the permitted level of long term debt prepayment. The level of proceeds, the outstanding balance of the Zero Coupon Notes and the Companys future earnings performance will determi ne the permitted levels of share buybacks and dividend payments. On March 13, 2003, the Company sold 4.5% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the "4.5% Notes") in an aggregate principal amount of $800.0. The Company received net cash proceeds from this transaction equal to approximately $778.0. As a result, the Companys permitted level of annual cash acquisition spending has increased to $25.0 and the permitted level of annual share buybacks and dividend payments has increased to $25.0. In addition, on March 10, 2003, the Company commenced a tender offer to purchase for cash any and all of the outstanding Zero Coupon Notes. The tender offer will expire on April 4, 2003, unless extended. If the Zero Coupon Notes are substantially retired pursuant to this tender offer, the Companys permitted level of annual cash acquisition spending would be further increased to $100.0 and the Company would be permitted to prepay long term debt. In addition, if the Zero Coupon Notes are substantially retired pursuant to the tender offer and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization are at least $1,000.0 for four consecutive quarters, the Companys permitted level of annual share buybacks and dividend payments would increase to $100.0. All limitations on dividend payments and share buybacks expire when the Zero Coupon Notes have been substantially retired and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization are at least $1,300.0 for four consecutive quarters. THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) As a result of the issuance of the 4.5% Notes in the first quarter of 2003 and the anticipated settlement of the tender offer for the Zero Coupon Notes in the second quarter of 2003, both the 4.5% Notes and the Zero Coupon Notes will be outstanding at March 31, 2003. Therefore, the Company amended the Revolving Credit Facilities, as of March 13, 2003, to exclude the Zero Coupon Notes in calculating the ratio of debt for borrowed money to consolidated EBITDA for the period ended March 31, 2003. On February 26, 2003, the Company obtained waivers of certain defaults under the Revolving Credit Facilities relating to the restatement of the Companys historical consolidated financial statements in the aggregate amount of $118.7. The waivers covered certain financial reporting requirements related to the Companys consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2002. No financial covenants were breached as a result of this restatement. Other Committed and Uncommitted Facilities In addition to the Revolving Credit Facilities, at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, the Company had $157.8 and $53.3 of committed lines of credit, all of which were provided by overseas banks that participate in the Revolving Credit Facilities. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, $3.1 and $7.2 were outstanding under these lines of credit. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, the Company also had $707.9 and $738.3 of uncommitted lines of credit, 66.8% and 56.2% of which, respectively, were provided by banks that participate in the Revolving Credit Agreements. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, approximately $213.2 and $286.6 were outstanding under these uncommitted lines of credit. The Companys uncommitted borrowings are repayable upon demand. Prudential Agreements On May 26, 1994, April 28, 1995, October 31, 1996, August 18, 1997 and January 21, 1999, the Company entered into five note purchase agreements, respectively, with The Prudential Insurance Company of America (the "Prudential Agreements"). The notes issued pursuant to the Prudential Agreements are repayable on May 2004, April 2005, October 2006, August 2007 and January 2009, respectively. The interest rates on these notes range from 8.05% to 10.01%. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, $148.8 and $155.0 were outstanding under the notes. The Prudential Agreements contain financial covenants that set i) minimum levels for net worth and for cash flow as a function of borrowed funds and ii) maximum levels of borrowed funds as a function of net worth (in each case, as defined in these agreements). The most restrictive of these covenants is that of cash flow to borrowed funds. This ratio is required to exceed an amount that varies from .16 to .25 for each quarter in the applicable consecutive four quarter period. During 2001, as a result of significant restructuring, asset impairment and other charges, the Company required and received amendments related to the financial covenants in the Prudential Agreements. During the third quarter of 2002, due to the impact on the Companys net worth resulting from (a) lower operating profit in the third quarter and (b) restructuring charges and lower operating profit in prior periods resulting from the restatement of the Companys historical consolidated financial statements in the aggregate amount of $181.3, the Company required and received waivers related to its financial covenants in the Prudential Agreements. In connection with the third quarter waivers, the Company agreed to increase the interest rates on the outstanding balances under the Prudential Agreements. The Company also paid a fee to Prudential as additional consideration for the waivers. The impact of the fee and the increased interest rates is not material to the Companys financial position, cash flows or results of operations. On February 10, 2003, the Company amended certain provisions of the Prudential Agreements effective as of December 31, 2002. The new terms of the Prudential Agreements contain the same restrictions on the Companys ability to declare or pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock, make cash acquisitions or investments, make capital expenditures and prepay long term debt, as well as the ability of the Companys domestic subsidiaries to incur additional debt, as the new terms of the Revolving Credit Agreements described above. THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Certain defined terms relating to financial covenants contained in the Prudential Agreements were also amended effective as of December 31, 2002. The definitions of cash flow and consolidated net worth in the Prudential Agreements were amended to include up to $500.0 of non cash, non recurring charges taken in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002 and the quarter ended March 31, 2003. The corresponding financial covenant ratio levels in the Prudential Agreements were also amended. In addition, the Company amended the Prudential Agreements, as of March 13, 2003, to exclude the Zero Coupon Notes in calculating the ratio of total borrowed funds to cash flow for the period ended March 31, 2003. On February 26, 2003, the Company obtained waivers of certain defaults under the Prudential Agreements relating to the restatement of the Companys historical consolidated financial statements in the aggregate amount of $118.7. The waivers covered certain financial reporting requirements related to the Companys consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2002. No financial covenants were breached as a result of this restatement. UBS Facility On February 10, 2003, the Company received from UBS AG a commitment for an interim credit facility providing for $500.0, maturing no later than July 31, 2004 and available to the Company beginning May 15, 2003, subject to certain conditions. This commitment terminated in accordance with its terms when the Company received net cash proceeds in excess of $400.0 from its sale of the 4.5% Notes. The fees associated with this commitment were not material to the Companys financial position, cash flows or results of operations. Other Debt Instruments (i) Convertible Senior Notes 4.5% In March 2003, the Company completed the issuance and sale of $800 aggregate principal amount of the 4.5% Notes. The Company intends to use the net proceeds of this offering to fund its concurrent offer to repurchase the outstanding Zero Coupon Notes. Assuming 100% of the Zero Coupon Notes are tendered, the Company will pay a total of $582.5 to the holders of the Zero Coupon Notes in connection with the offer. Any funds not used to repurchase the Zero Coupon Notes will be used for the repayment of other indebtedness, general corporate purposes and working capital. The 4.5% Notes are unsecured, senior securities that may be converted into common shares if the price of the Companys common stock reaches a specified threshold, at an initial conversion rate of 80.5153 shares per one thousand dollars principal amount, equal to a conversion price of $12.42 per share, subject to adjustment. This threshold will initially be 120% of the conversion price and will decline 1/2% each year until it reaches 110% at ma turity in 2023. The 4.5% Notes may also be converted, regardless of the price of the Companys common stock, if: (i) the credit rating assigned to the 4.5% Notes by any two of Moodys Investors Service, Inc., Standard & Poors Ratings Services and Fitch Ratings are Ba2, BB and BB, respectively, or lower, or the 4.5% Notes are no longer rated by at least two of these ratings services, (ii) the Company calls the 4.5% Notes for redemption, (iii) the Company makes specified distributions to shareholders or (iv) the Company becomes a party to a consolidation, merger or binding share exchange pursuant to which its common stock would be converted into cash or property (other than securities). The Company, at the investors option, may be required to redeem the 4.5% Notes for cash on March 15, 2008. The Company may also be required to redeem the 4.5% Notes at the investors option on March 15, 2013 and March 15, 2018, for cash or common stock or a combination of both, at the Companys election. Additionally, investors may require the Company to redeem the 4.5% Notes in the event of certain change of control events that occur prior to May 15, 2008, for cash or common stock or a combination of both, at the Companys election. The Company at its option may redeem the 4.5% Notes on or after May 15, 2008 for cash. The redemption price in each of these instances will be 100% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) If at any time on or after March 13, 2003 the Company pays cash dividends on its common stock, the Company will pay contingent interest per 4.5% Note in an amount equal to 100% of the per share cash dividend paid on the common stock multiplied by the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of a note. (ii) Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes In December 2001, the Company completed the issuance and sale of approximately $702 of aggregate principal amount of Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes ("Zero Coupon Notes") due 2021. The Company used the net proceeds of $563.5 from this offering to repay indebtedness under the Companys credit facilities. The Zero Coupon Notes are unsecured, zero coupon, senior securities that may be converted into common shares if the price of the Companys common stock reaches a specified threshold, at a conversion rate of 22.8147 shares per one thousand dollars principal amount at maturity, subject to adjustment. This threshold will initially be 120% of the accreted value of a Zero Coupon Note, divided by the conversion rate and will decline 1/2% each year until it reaches 110% at maturity in 2021. A Zero Coupon Notes accreted value is the sum of its issue price plus its accrued original issue discount. The Zero Coupon Notes may also be converted, regardless of the sale price of the Companys common stock, at any time after: (i) the credit rating assigned to the Zero Coupon Notes by any two of Moodys Investors Service, Inc., Standard & Poors Ratings Group and Fitch Ratings are Bal, BB+ and BB+, respectively, or lower, or the Zero Coupon Notes are no longer rated by at least two of these ratings services, (ii) the Company calls the Zero Coupon Notes for redemption, (iii) the Company makes specified distributions to shareholders or (iv) the Company becomes a party to a consolidation, merger or binding share exchange pursuant to which the Companys common stock would be converted into cash or property (other than securities). The Company, at the investors option, may be required to redeem the Zero Coupon Notes for cash on December 14, 2003. The Company may also be required to redeem the Zero Coupon Notes at the investors option, on December 14, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2011 or 2016 for cash or common stock or a combination of both, at the Companys election. Additionally, the Company has the option of redeeming the Zero Coupon Notes after December 14, 2006 for cash. The yield to maturity of the Zero Coupon Notes at the date of issuance was 1%. Unless the Company is required to pay the contingent interest described in the following sentence or the US tax laws change in certain ways, no cash interest will be paid at any time. After December 14, 2006, if the Companys stock price reaches specified thresholds, the Company would be obligated to pay semi annual contingent cash interest which would approximate the dividends paid to common stockholders during the prior six month period (subject to a floor rate). The balance outstanding under the Zero Coupon Notes as of December 31, 2002 was $581.0. This amount is classified as current in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. On March 10, 2003, the Company commenced a tender offer to purchase for cash any and all of the outstanding Zero Coupon Notes, at a price equal to 82.9876% of the principal amount of the notes at maturity. The tender offer will expire on April 4, 2003, unless extended. The price offered is equal to the accreted value of the notes as of April 4, 2003. If all of the Zero Coupon Notes are tendered pursuant to the tender offer, the Company would pay a total of $582.5 to the holders of the Zero Coupon Notes. (iii) Floating Rate Notes On June 28, 2001, the Company issued and sold $100.0 of floating rate notes which bore interest based on three month LIBOR. The notes matured and were repaid on June 28, 2002. (iv) Senior Unsecured Notes 7.25% On August 22, 2001, the Company completed the issuance and sale of $500.0 principal amount of senior unsecured notes due 2011. The notes bear interest at a rate of 7.25% per annum. The Company used the net proceeds of approximately $493 from the sale of the notes to repay outstanding indebtedness under its Revolving Credit Facilities. THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) (v) Senior Unsecured Notes 7.875% On October 20, 2000, the Company completed the issuance and sale of $500.0 principal amount of senior unsecured notes due 2005. The notes bear an interest rate of 7.875% per annum. The Company used the net proceeds of approximately $496 from the sale of the notes to repay outstanding indebtedness under its Revolving Credit Facilities. During 2001, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements to convert the fixed interest rate on the 7.875% notes to a variable rate based on 6 month LIBOR. At December 31, 2001, the Company had outstanding interest rate swap agreements covering $400.0 of the $500.0, 7.875% notes due October 2005, which reduced the effective interest rate on the notes to 6.972%. During 2002, the Company terminated all interest rate swaps agreements, and generated proceeds to the Company of $45.7. The net proceeds are being recorded as an adjustment to the interest rate of the 7.875% notes. The remaining unamortized gain at December 31, 2002 was $33.7. (vi) Convertible Subordinated Notes 1.87% On June 1, 1999, the Company issued $361.0 face amount of Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2006 with a cash coupon rate of 1.87% and a yield to maturity of 4.75%. The 2006 notes were issued at an original price of 83% of the face amount, generating proceeds of approximately $300. The notes are convertible into 6.4 million shares of the Companys common stock at a conversion rate of 17.616 shares per one thousand dollars face amount. Since June 2002, the Company has had the option to redeem the notes for cash. (vii) Convertible Subordinated Notes 1.80% On September 16, 1997, the Company issued $250.0 face amount of Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2004 with a coupon rate of 1.80% and a yield to maturity of 5.25%. The 2004 Notes were issued at an original price of 80% of the face amount, generating proceeds of approximately $200. The notes are convertible into 6.7 million shares of the Companys common stock at a conversion rate of 26.772 shares per one thousand dollars face amount. Since September 2000, the Company has had the option to redeem the notes for cash. Short Term Debt at December 31, 2002 and 2001 The Company and its subsidiaries have short term lines of credit with various banks that permit borrowings at variable interest rates. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, all borrowings under these facilities were by the Companys subsidiaries and totaled $216.3 and $293.8, respectively. Where required, the Company has guaranteed the repayment of borrowings by its subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, 66.8% and 56.2% of these short term facilities were provided by banks that participate in the Companys Revolving Credit Facilities. The weighted average interest rates on outstanding balances under the committed and uncommitted short term facilities at December 31, 2002 and 2001 were approximately 4.83% and 3.64%, respectively. THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) The following table summarizes the Companys short term debt as of December 31, 2002 and 2001. 2002 Total Facility Amount Outstanding at December 31, 2002 Total Available Committed 364 day Revolving Credit Facility $ 500.0 $ $ 500.0 Other Facilities (principally International) 157.8 3.1 154.7 $ 657.8 $ 3.1 $ 654.7 Uncommitted Domestic $ 27.7 $ 7.7 $ 20.0 International 680.2 205.5 474.7 707.9 213.2 494.7 Total $1,365.7 $216.3 $1,149.4 2001 Total Facility Amount Outstanding at December 31, 2001 Total Available Committed 364 day Revolving Credit Facility $ 500.0 $ $ 500.0 Other Facilities (principally International) 53.3 7.2 46.1 $ 553.3 $ 7.2 $ 546.1 Uncommitted Domestic $ 127.5 $ 62.5 $ 65.0 International 610.8 224.1 386.7 738.3 286.6 451.7 Total $1,291.6 $ 293.8 $ 997.8 Other As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, the Companys credit ratings as reported by each of Standard & Poors Ratings Services, Moodys Investors Services, Inc. and Fitch Ratings were BBB , Baa3 and BBB , and BBB+, Baa1, and A . On March 7, 2003, Standard & Poors Ratings Services downgraded the Companys credit rating to BB+ with negative outlook. The Companys remaining two credit ratings are currently BBB with negative outlook, as reported by Fitch Ratings, and Baa3 with stable outlook, as reported by Moodys Investors Services, Inc. During 2001, the Company purchased approximately 2.4 million shares of its common stock, compared to 4.8 million shares in 2000. Since July 2001, the Company has not repurchased its common stock in the open market. The Company has paid cash dividends at a quarterly rate of $0.095 per share since the second quarter of 2000, when it was increased from $0.085 per share. The determination of dividend payments is made by the Companys Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. However, as previously discussed, the Companys ability to declare or pay dividends is currently restricted by new terms of its Revolving Credit Facilities and Prudential Agreements, and the Company has not declared or paid a dividend in the first quarter of 2003. THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Deferred Payments Deferred payments (or "earn outs") generally tie the aggregate price ultimately paid for an acquisition to its performance. As of December 31, 2002, the Companys estimated liability for deferred payments on prior acquisitions is as follows: 2003 2004 2005 2006 and thereafter Total Cash $142.0 $78.8 $49.4 $28.2 $298.4 Stock 41.7 9.2 13.4 9.3 73.6 Total $183.7 $88.0 $62.8 $37.5 $372.0 The amounts above are estimates based on the current projections as to the amount that will be paid and are subject to revisions as the earn out periods progress. In addition to the estimated liability for earn outs, the Company has entered into agreements that may require the Company to purchase additional equity interests in certain companies (put options). In many cases, the Company also has the option to purchase the additional equity interests (call options) in certain circumstances. The total amount of potential payments under put options is $192.5, of which $9.9 is payable in stock. Exercise of the put options would require payments to be made as follows: 2003 $87.6 2004 $20.4 2005 $34.4 2006 and thereafter $50.1 The actual amount to be paid is generally contingent upon the achievement of projected operating performance targets and satisfying other conditions as specified in the relevant agreement. The Company also has call options to acquire additional equity interests in companies in which it already has an ownership interest. The estimated amount that would be paid under such call options is $112.5 and, in the event of exercise, would be paid as follows: 2003 $25.8 2004 $ 5.8 2005 $15.3 2006 and thereafter $65.6 The actual amount to be paid is contingent upon the achievement of projected operating performance targets and satisfying other conditions as specified in the relevant agreements. THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Summary of Significant Contractual Obligations The following summarizes the Companys estimated contractual obligations at December 31, 2002, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flow in future periods. 2003 2004 2005 2006 and thereafter Total Long term debt $604.0 $291.2 $591.9 $ 934.6 $2,421.7 Non cancelable operating lease obligations $281.5 $251.7 $222.7 $1,546.1 $2,302.0 Obligations under executory contract $ 8.7 $ 9.9 $ 11.3 $ 100.1 $ 130.0 Obligations for deferred payments $183.7 $ 88.0 $ 62.8 $ 37.5 $ 372.0 Obligations under put options $87.6 $ 20.4 $ 34.4 $ 50.1 $ 192.5 As discussed in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has a number of retirement plans. The deficit in the funded status of these plans has increased to $182.6 at December 31, 2002. The Company considers that the long term return on its pension assets and the funding available to the Company will be sufficient to finance these obligations. In 2002, the Companys liquidity was negatively impacted by lower profitability and issues resulting from the restatements. The Company believes that cash flow from operations, together with its availability under existing lines of credit and expected refinancings thereof and cash on hand, will be sufficient to fund the Companys working capital needs and other obligations for the next twelve months. In the event additional funds are required, the Company believes it will have sufficient resources, including borrowing capacity and access to capital markets, to meet such requirements. Unanticipated decreases in cash flow from operations as a result of decreased demand for our services and other developments may require the Company to seek other sources of liquidity (including the disposition of certain assets) and modify its operating strategies. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Companys significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. The Company believes the following accounting policies are critical to the accuracy of the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements: * revenue recognition; * allowance for doubtful accounts; * accounting for income taxes; and * valuation of long lived and intangible assets and investments. Revenue Recognition The Company derives revenue from advertising services, including media buying, and from marketing and communication services, including market research, public relations, direct marketing, sales promotion and event marketing activities. The Companys advertising services revenue is derived from commissions that are earned when the media is placed, from fees earned as advertising services are performed and from production services rendered. In addition, incentive amounts may be earned based on qualitative and or quantitative criteria. In the case of commissions, revenue is recognized as the media placements appear. In the case of fee and production arrangements, the revenue is recognized as the services are performed which is generally ratably over the period of the client contract. The Companys marketing service revenues are generally earned on a fee basis, and in certain cases incentive amounts may also be earned. As with fee arrangements in advertising, such revenue is recognized as the work is performed. Incentive amounts for advertising and marketing services are recognized upon satisfaction of the qualitative and or quantitative criteria, as set out in the relevant client contract. THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) In many cases, the amount the Company bills to clients significantly exceeds the amount of revenues that is earned due to the existence of various "pass through" charges such as the cost of media. In compliance with EITF 01 14, "Income Statement Characterization of Reimbursements Received for "Out of Pocket Expenses Incurred", the Company generally records revenue net of "pass through" charges as it is not the primary obligor with respect to the cost of "pass through" charges. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company assesses the required amount of allowance for doubtful accounts based on past experience and reviews of aging and analysis of specific accounts. While the expense for bad debts has historically fluctuated in line with revenue, in 2002 the Company recorded a higher amount of bad debt expense reflective of general economic conditions. Accounting for Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements, the Company is required to estimate income taxes payable in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. This process involves estimating the actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within the Companys consolidated balance sheet. The Company then assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent it is determined that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established. Significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and the amount of valuation allowance that would be required. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates or the Company adjusts these estimates in future periods, the Company may need to establis h an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact the Companys financial position and results of operations. Valuation of Long Lived and Intangible Assets and Investments The Company has a significant amount of long lived assets, including fixed assets, investments, goodwill and other intangibles. The Company periodically evaluates the realizability of all of its long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Future events could cause the Company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the asset values associated with a given operation have become impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could have a material impact on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. OTHER MATTERS Argentina and Brazil As a result of the devaluation of the currencies in Argentina and Brazil, the Companys cumulative translation adjustment balance reflected a reduction in stockholders equity of approximately $23 at December 31, 2002. The Company expects to maintain its strategic investment in Argentina and Brazil for the long term. RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Standards Adopted Effective January 1, 2002 Property and Equipment Property and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable. When such events or circumstances arise, an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows produced by the asset, or the appropriate grouping of assets, is compared to the assets carrying value to determine if an impairment exists pursuant to the requirements of SFAS 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets" ("SFAS 144"). If the asset is determined to be impaired, the impairment loss is measured based on the excess of its carrying value over its fair value. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of its carrying value or net realizable value. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS 144. The adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Intangible Assets Goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Effective January 1, 2002, with the adoption of SFAS 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS 142"), goodwill is no longer amortized. Prior to January 1, 2002, goodwill was amortized on a straight line basis, over periods not exceeding 40 years. Beginning January 1, 2002, goodwill is tested for impairment annually, and will be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level. Reporting units are one level below the business segment level, but can be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics. The vast majority of goodwill relates to and is assigned directly to a specific reporting unit. An impairment loss would generally be recognized when the car rying amount of the reporting units net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. The Company completed its assessment of any potential impairment upon adoption of this standard and upon its annual assessment the Company determined that, other than the impairment charges discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, no impairments existed. Prior to January 1, 2002, goodwill was tested for impairment in a manner consistent with the method used to test property and equipment and intangible assets with a definite life. During the first quarter of 2002, the Company performed the required impairment tests of goodwill and determined that there was no impairment required to be recognized upon adoption. The following analysis shows the impact on the Companys statement of operations of discontinuing goodwill amortization had SFAS 142 been effective for all periods presented: Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Reported net income (loss) $99.5 $(534.5) $392.8 Add back: Goodwill amortization 169.0 140.4 Tax benefit on goodwill amortization (24.3) (17.2) Adjusted net income (loss) $99.5 $(389.8) $516.0 Basic earnings (loss) per share: Reported earnings (loss) $0.26 $(1.45) $1.09 Add back: goodwill amortization, net of tax 0.39 0.34 Adjusted earnings (loss) $0.26 $(1.06) $1.43 Diluted earnings (loss) per share: Reported earnings (loss) $0.26 $(1.45) $1.06 Add back: goodwill amortization, net of tax 0.39 0.33 Adjusted earnings (loss) $0.26 $(1.06) $1.39 Other intangible assets include, principally, customer lists, trade names, customer relationships and other intangible assets acquired from an independent party. Effective January 1, 2002, with the adoption of SFAS 142, intangible assets with an indefinite life, namely certain trade names, are not amortized. Intangible assets with a definite life are amortized on a straight line basis with estimated useful lives generally ranging from 7 to 40 years. Indefinite lived intangible assets will be tested for impairment annually, and will be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. Intangible assets with a definite life are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that a carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows used in determining the fair val ue of the asset. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is calculated by the excess of the assets carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. As of December 31, 2002, the Companys remaining unamortized goodwill balance and intangible assets were $3,377.1 and $81.6, respectively. The Company estimates that, based on its current intangible assets, amortization expense will be approximately $8.0 in each of the next five years. THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) In November 2001, the Emerging Issues Task Force reached a consensus on Issue No. 01 14, Income Statement Characterization of Reimbursements Received for "Out of Pocket" Expenses Incurred ("EITF 01 14"). EITF 01 14 establishes that reimbursements received for certain out of pocket expenses should be reported as revenue and operating expenses in the statement of operations. Historically, the Company classified reimbursed out of pocket expenses as a reduction of operating expenses. The Company has adopted this guidance, retroactively, effective the first quarter of fiscal year 2001. The adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. In December 2002, SFAS 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure", ("SFAS 148"), an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123 was issued. The Company is choosing to continue with its current practice of applying the recognition and measurement principles of APB 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." The Company has adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS 148. Standards to be Adopted In June 2001, SFAS 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations ("SFAS 143") was issued. SFAS 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated retirement costs that result from the acquisition, construction, or development and normal operation of a long lived asset. Upon initial recognition of a liability for an asset retirement obligation, SFAS 143 requires an increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. The asset retirement cost is subsequently allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method over the assets useful life. SFAS 143 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. The adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. In June 2002, SFAS 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities ("SFAS 146") was issued. SFAS 146 changes the measurement and timing of recognition for exit costs, including restructuring charges, and is effective for any such activities initiated after December 31, 2002. It has no effect on charges recorded for exit activities begun prior to this date. In November 2002, FASB Interpretation 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others" was issued. This interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. It also clarifies (for guarantees issued after January 1, 2003) that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligations undertaken in issuing the guarantee. Disclosures concerning guarantees are found in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements. THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to market risk related to interest rates and foreign currencies. Interest Rates At December 31, 2002, a significant portion of the Companys debt obligations were at fixed interest rates. Accordingly, assuming the fixed rate debt is not refinanced, there would be no impact on interest expense or cash flow from either a 10% increase or decrease in market rates of interest. The fair market value of the debt obligations would decrease by $23.3 if market rates were to increase by 10% and would increase by $23.8 if market rates were to decrease by 10%. For that portion of the debt that is either maintained at variable rates, based on amounts and rates outstanding at December 31, 2002, the change in interest expense and cash flow from a 10% change in rates would be approximately $1.1. Foreign Currencies The Company faces two risks related to foreign currency exchange: translation risk and transaction risk. Amounts invested in the Companys foreign operations are translated into US dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the stockholders equity section of the balance sheet. The Companys foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in currencies other than the US dollar. Since the functional currency of the Companys foreign operations is generally the local currency, foreign currency translation of the balance sheet is reflected as a component of stockholders equity and does not impact operating results. Revenues and expenses in foreign currencies translate into varying amounts of US dollars depending upon whether the US dollar weakens or strengthens against other currencies. Therefore, changes in exchange rates may negatively affect the Compa nys consolidated revenues and expenses (as expressed in US dollars) from foreign operations. Currency transaction gains or losses arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in results of operations and were not significant in 2000, 2001 and 2002. The Company has not entered into a material amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
