Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations When comparing performance between years, the Company discusses non GAAP financial measures such as organic revenue growth. The nature of such amounts is described more fully in "Results of Operations" below. OVERVIEW OF SIGNIFICANT EVENTS During 2003, the Company continued to experience difficult economic conditions as evidenced by the fact that, on an organic basis, revenue declined by 3.6%. In response to the declines in revenues, the Company implemented a major restructuring program designed to bring expenses more in line with revenue. This plan, which commenced in the second quarter of 2003, is expected to result in additional charges in 2004. In addition to the restructuring plan, the Company has continued to focus on improving its balance sheet and, during 2003, raised significant amounts of cash from equity issuances, refinancing of debt, and sales of certain non strategic assets. Significant events during 2003 included: * Economic Conditions On an organic basis, revenue declined by 3.6% from 2002 to 2003, reflecting the continued softness in demand for the Companys advertising and marketing communications services. This reduced demand affected all of the Companys service offerings and, in particular, public relations and the Companys project based businesses. The Company has, however, experienced improved revenue performance during the latter part of 2003 coinciding with signs of economic recovery. Specifically, the organic revenue decline for the Company was 3.1% in the third quarter of 2003 and was 1.1% in the fourth quarter of 2003. * Restructuring In 2003, the Company began to implement a major restructuring program in response to declines in revenue. In 2003, restructuring charges of $175.6 were recorded related to severance for approximately 2,900 terminated employees and for costs associated with vacating 55 offices worldwide. In addition, a charge of $16.5 was recorded in office and general expenses related to the amortization of leasehold improvements on properties included in the 2003 restructuring program. Approximately $85 in additional charges is expected to be incurred in the first half of 2004. The Company anticipates that this program will continue through the first half of 2004 and, including amounts classified in office and general expenses, will approximate $275. The amount of salary and occupancy costs eliminated as a result of the restructuring charges recorded in 2003 is estimated to be approximately $175, a portion of which has begun to be realized during 2003. * Divestitures The Company sold certain non strategic assets, including the following: In July 2003, the Company completed the sale of its NFO WorldGroup ("NFO") research unit for $415.6 and approximately 11.7 million shares of Taylor Nelson Sofres PLC ("TNS"). Net of expenses and cash sold the proceeds were approximately $377. A pre tax gain of approximately $99 was recorded. In December 2003, the Company sold the TNS shares for approximately $42. A gain of approximately $13 was recorded. In December 2003, the Company sold approximately 11 million of the shares it owned in Modem Media, Inc. for net proceeds of approximately $57. A pre tax gain of approximately $30 was recorded. THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) In January 2004, the Company sold the four motorsports circuits owned by its Motorsports division for approximately $26 in cash. The Company recorded a long lived asset impairment charge of $38.0 in 2003 to appropriately reflect the assets held for sale at fair market value at December 31, 2003. * Financing Activities During 2003, the Company accomplished the following: In March 2003, the Company completed the issuance and sale of $800 aggregate principal amount of 4.5% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023. In April 2003, the Company used approximately $581 of the net proceeds of this offering to repurchase the Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due 2021 (the "Zero Coupon Notes") tendered in its concurrent tender offer and is using the remaining proceeds for the repayment of other indebtedness, general corporate purposes and working capital. In the third quarter of 2003, the Company repaid $142.5 of principal amount of outstanding borrowings under its various note purchase agreements with the Prudential Insurance Company of America (the "Prudential Agreements") bearing interest rates ranging from 8% to 10%, the highest cost debt in the Companys portfolio. A prepayment penalty of $24.8 was incurred in connection with this retirement. During the third quarter of 2003, the company filed a universal shelf registration in the amount of $1,800, $721.4 of which was used in connection with the concurrent offerings discussed below. On December 16, 2003, the Company issued 25.8 million common shares at a price of $13.50 under its existing shelf registration statement. This offering was closed concurrently with an offering of approximately 7.5 million shares of its Preferred Stock. As a result of the transaction, the Company raised approximately $693. Approximately $246 of the net proceeds from this offering were used to redeem the Companys 1.80% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2004 in January 2004. The remaining proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. Reduced debt levels from approximately $2,600 at December 31, 2002 to approximately $2,500 at December 31, 2003 and increased cash from approximately $900 at December 31, 2002 to approximately $2,000 at December 31, 2003. * Goodwill Impairment During 2003, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $221.0 related to its Octagon WorldWide ("OWW") unit. The impairment charge was caused by OWWs lower than expected performance in 2003 and revised future projections indicating that the factors behind the 2003 performance were likely to persist. * Management Changes In the first quarter of 2003, the Company made significant changes in the top management of the Company and its largest agency, McCann Erickson WorldGroup ("McCann"). The Companys former chairman and CEO, John J. Dooner, Jr. has resumed an active operating role as Chairman and CEO of McCann, replacing James R. Heekin, who has left the Company. David A. Bell, Vice Chairman and former CEO of True North Communications, Inc., assumed the role of Chairman and CEO of the Company. In June 2003, the Company hired Christopher J. Coughlin, as its Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Coughlin assumed the additional responsibilities and title of Chief Financial Officer upon the departure of Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Sean F. Orr, in August of 2003. THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) * Litigation and SEC Investigation As discussed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is involved in legal matters which include certain class action suits brought against the Company as a result of filing restated financial statements in 2002. Subject to federal court approval, a tentative agreement was reached with the parties to the consolidated class action suits in the federal district of New York under which the Company agreed to pay $115, of which $20 will be paid in cash and $95 in common stock. The Company recorded a charge in the third quarter of 2003 primarily representing the current estimate of amounts payable in regard to the settlement. The Company is also under a formal investigation with the SEC related to the above restatements of its earnings. The Company is cooperating fully with the investigation. OUTLOOK The Companys results of operations are dependent upon: a) maintaining and growing its revenue, b) the ability to retain and gain new clients, c) the continuous alignment of its costs to its revenue and d) retaining and attracting key personnel. Revenue is also highly dependent on overall economic and political conditions. For a discussion of these and other factors that could affect the Companys results of operations and financial conditions, see "Statement Regarding Forward Looking Disclosure" and "Business Risk Factors". As discussed above, 2003 was a difficult year for the Company, reflecting continued softness in worldwide demand for advertising and marketing communications services. The decline in organic revenue versus the prior year was a decline of 3.6% for the full year. However, the Company noted a positive trend in its revenues during the latter part of 2003, particularly internationally. There was sequential improvement throughout the year as the organic revenue decline was 3.1% in the third quarter and 1.1% in the fourth quarter of 2003, in each case versus the prior year. While management expects continued progress overall in the Companys organic revenue trends, it does not expect that the progression will be linear, in particular given the cyclical nature of the Companys business. Industry forecasters expect that there will continue to be signs of improving economic activity, on a worldwide basis, in 2004. Specifically, worldwide advertising and marketing services spending is expected to rise by 3 4%. Such a forecast confirms that, while there is no certainty as to what will ultimately occur, economic conditions in 2004 should continue to be better than 2003 for the industry as a whole. The Companys performance in the recent past has lagged, somewhat, that of the industry and may continue to do so. Management has responded to its recent performance issues, however, by implementing a turnaround program. The program was begun in mid 2003 and is targeted to be complete by mid 2006. The first stage of the program has focused on implementing the restructuring initiatives discussed below and improving the Companys capital structure. Going forward the turnaround program will focus on achieving certain defined performance objectives based on the Companys perceived peer competitor performance levels. The objectives include those relating to: * achieving organic revenue growth comparable to the Companys peer competitors, by building on the collaboration and supplemental incentive plan and changing the Companys culture; * improving the Companys operating margin, by reducing staff costs and office and general costs, including further property consolidation; and * continuing to manage the Companys debt to capital ratio, building on actions taken to date, and improving its debt to profitability and its interest coverage ratio. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Company reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). When comparing performance between years, however, the Company also discusses non GAAP financial measures such as the impact that foreign currency rate changes, acquisitions/dispositions and organic growth have on reported results. THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) The Company derives organic revenue by adjusting reported revenue in respect of any given period by: * excluding the impact of foreign currency effects over the course of the period to provide revenues on a constant currency basis; and * excluding the impact on reported revenue resulting from acquisitions and dispositions that were consummated after the first day of the year prior to the given period. Additionally, organic revenue calculations for the year ended, and each quarter of, 2003 have been adjusted to make 2003 organic revenue principally arising from public relations and sporting event arrangements more directly comparable to organic revenue arising from public relations and sporting event arrangements in periods preceding January 1, 2003, and for the impact of the deconsolidation of certain international entities. If these adjustments had been made to revenue for prior periods, there would have been neither a material effect on results in prior periods nor any effect whatsoever on operating or net income. These adjustments principally relate to "grossing up" revenues and expenses by the same amount in connection with the reimbursement of certain out of pocket expenses relating to public relations and sporting event arrangements. Management believes that discussing organic revenue, giving effect to the above factors, provides a better understanding of the Companys revenue performance and trends than reported revenue because it allows for more meaningful comparisons of current period revenue to that of prior periods. Management also believes that organic revenue determined on a generally comparable basis is a common measure of performance in the businesses in which it operates. When the Company discusses amounts on a constant currency basis, the prior period results are adjusted to remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the current period that is being compared to the prior period. The impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on prior period results is removed by converting the prior period results into US dollars at the average exchange rate for the current period. Management believes that discussing results on a constant currency basis allows for a more meaningful comparison of current period results to such prior period results. The Company has also highlighted the impact of the loss of the Chrysler account in the fourth quarter of 2000 (revenue and operating expenses related to which continued through 2001). Chrysler was a major client of True North Communications, Inc. ("True North"), which the Company acquired in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests in June 2001. As a result of the acquisition of True North, the Company lost accounts of Pepsi owned brands due to client conflicts within the combined company. Management believes that adjusting for the impact of these significant client losses is relevant when comparing organic revenue performance between 2002 and 2001. As discussed in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is comprised of two reportable segments: the Interpublic Sports and Entertainment Group ("SEG") and Interpublic excluding SEG. SEG was formed during the second quarter of 2002 through a carve out from the Companys other operating groups and is primarily comprised of the operations of OWW, for the Companys sports marketing business, Motorsports, for the Companys motorsports business, and Jack Morton Worldwide, for specialized marketing services including corporate events, meeting and training/learning. SEG revenue is not material to the Company as a whole. However, due to the recording of long lived asset impairment charges, operating difficulties and resulting higher costs principally from its Motorsports business, SEG has incurred significant operating losses. Based on certain substantial contractual obligations and revised projections for OWW, the Company does not expect that margins of SEG will converge with those of the rest of the Company and, accordingly, reports SEG as a separate reportable segment. Other than the impairment charges which are discussed below and the commitments discussed in "Other Matters", the operating results of SEG are not material to those of the Company, and therefore are not discussed in detail below. THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Discontinued Operations As discussed below and in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on July 10, 2003, the Company completed the sale of its NFO research unit to TNS. The results of NFO are classified as a discontinued operation in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, and, accordingly, the results of operations and cash flows of NFO have been removed from the Companys results of continuing operations and cash flow for all periods presented in this document. Continuing Operations The following table shows the Companys net income (loss) and earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001. 2003 2002 2001 Continuing Operations $(552.9) $68.0 $(550.1) Discontinued Operations 101.2 31.5 15.6 Net Income (Loss) $(451.7) $99.5 $(534.5) Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations $ (1.43) $0.18 $ (1.49) Diluted EPS from Discontinued Operations 0.26 0.08 0.04 Total Diluted EPS $ (1.17) $0.26 $ (1.45) The following summarizes certain financial information by the two reportable segments for purposes of managements discussion and analysis: 2003 2002 2001 IPG (excl.

In connection with the Companys restructuring program, a charge of $16.5 was also recorded in office and general expenses related to the amortization of leasehold improvements; * A long lived asset impairment charge of $221.0 was recorded related to the goodwill of OWW, the Companys sports marketing business; and THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) * A long lived asset impairment charge of $38.0 was recorded related to the Companys motorsports operations. Other Income (Expense) * Investment impairment charges of $84.9 were recorded primarily related to unconsolidated, principally international, affiliates; * Litigation charges of $127.6, anticipated to be funded principally with Company stock, was recorded relating primarily to the shareholder suits; * A debt prepayment penalty of $24.8 was recorded as a result of retiring all of the Companys outstanding borrowings under the Prudential Agreements; and * A pre tax gain on the sale of approximately 11 million shares of Modem Media, Inc. of approximately $30. Income taxes * A total charge of $84.4 was recorded to increase the Companys valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets primarily relating to foreign net operating and US capital loss carryforwards. Discontinued operations * A pre tax gain on the sale of NFO of $99.1 ($89.1 after tax) was recorded to reflect the closing of the sale in the third quarter. REVENUE The Company is a worldwide global marketing services company, providing clients with communications expertise in three broad areas: a) advertising and media management, b) marketing communications, which includes direct marketing and customer relationship management, public relations, sales promotion, event marketing, on line marketing, corporate and brand identity and healthcare marketing and c) specialized marketing services, which includes sports and entertainment marketing and corporate meetings and events. The following analysis provides further detail on revenue: 2003 vs. 2002 Increase/(Decrease) % of % of Reported Excluding Currency Effect 2003 Total 2002 Total Dollars % Dollars % Domestic Revenue $3,284.2 56% $3,313.6 58% $(29.4) (0.9)% $ (29.4) (0.9)% International Revenue 2,579.2 44% 2,423.9 42% 155.3 6.4% (114.0) (4.2)% Worldwide Revenue $5,863.4 100% $5,737.5 100% $125.9 2.2% $(143.4) (2.4)% The components of the total revenue change in 2003 were: $ Change Increase/(Decrease) Foreign currency changes $269.3 4.6 % Net acquisitions/divestitures (13.9 ) (0.2 )% Reclassifications 80.7 1.4 % Organic revenue (210.2 ) (3.6 )% Total revenue increase $125.9 2.2 % THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) The decrease in organic revenue of 3.6% for the year was due to continued softness in the demand for advertising and marketing services by current clients, particularly in international markets and in the Companys public relations services and other project related business. Organic revenue for SEG declined 1.8% for the year in comparison to the prior year. Coincident with the signs of an economic recovery, the Companys revenue trend improved sequentially toward the latter part of 2003. Organic revenue was a decline of 3.1% in the third quarter and 1.1% in the fourth quarter of 2003 in comparison to 2002. During the first part of the year, revenue was impacted by the uncertainty in the geopolitical environment resulting from the uncertainty associated with the war in Iraq, and, to a lesser extent, from the outbreak of the SARS virus. During the latter part of the year, the Company has seen improving revenue trends, particularly internationally, coincident with the signs of an economic recovery. 2002 vs. 2001 Increase/(Decrease) % of % of Reported Excluding Currency Effect 2002 Total 2001 Total Dollars % Dollars % Domestic Revenue $3,313.6 58% $3,708.0 58% $(394.4) (10.6)% $(394.4) (10.6)% International Revenue 2,423.9 42% 2,644.7 42% (220.8) (8.3)% (232.2) (8.7)% Worldwide Revenue $5,737.5 100% $6,352.7 100% $(615.2) (9.7)% $(626.6) (9.8)% The components of the total revenue change in 2002 were: $ Change Increase/(Decrease) Foreign currency changes $ 11.4 0.1 % Net acquisitions/divestitures (53.6 ) (0.5 )% Loss of the Chrysler and Pepsi accounts (52.8 ) (0.8 )% Organic revenue (520.2 ) (8.5 )% Total revenue decrease $(615.2 ) (9.7 )% The decrease in organic revenue was primarily the result of the overall softness in the demand for advertising and marketing services by current clients due to the weak economy, both domestically and internationally. OPERATING EXPENSES Salaries and Related Expenses In 2003, the Companys expenses related to employee compensation and various employee incentive and benefit programs amounted to approximately 59% of revenue. The employee incentive programs are based primarily upon operating results. Salaries and related expenses in all periods were also impacted by salary progression. 2003 vs. 2002 Salaries and related expenses were $3,451.8 for 2003 and $3,350.0 in 2002, an increase of $101.8 or 3.0%. The increase reflects the effect of higher foreign exchange rates, primarily the Euro and Pound, versus the US Dollar. Offsetting this increase is a decrease in salaries as a result of lower headcount. Total headcount dropped by 7.5% to 43,400 at December 31, 2003 from 46,900 at December 31, 2002. The reduction accelerated towards the end of the year as the Company implemented its new restructuring program. The components of the total change in 2003 were: $ Change Increase/(Decrease) Foreign currency changes $154.9 4.5 % Net acquisitions/divestitures (2.3 ) % Reclassifications (9.7 ) (0.3 )% Reductions in salaries and related expense from existing operations (41.1 ) (1.2 )% Total change $101.8 3.0 % THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) 2002 vs. 2001 Salaries and related expenses were $3,350.0 for 2002 and $3,620.9 in 2001, a decrease of $270.9 or 7.5%. The decrease is a result of lower headcount, which was reduced by 6.9% to 46,900 at December 31, 2002 from 50,400 at December 31, 2001. This was partially offset by a benefit of $50.0 recorded in 2001 resulting from a reduction in severance reserves related to significant headcount reductions. The components of the total change were: $ Change Increase/(Decrease) Foreign currency changes $ 11.6 0.3 % Net acquisitions/divestitures (44.7 ) (1.0 )% Loss of the Chrysler and Pepsi accounts (20.1 ) (0.6 )% Reductions in salaries and related expenses from existing operations (217.7 ) (6.2 )% Total change $(270.9 ) (7.5 )% Office and General Expenses 2003 vs. 2002 Office and general expenses were $1,885.6 in 2003 and $1,880.4 in 2002, an increase of $5.2 or 0.3%. The increase reflects the effect of higher foreign exchange rates, primarily the Euro and Pound, versus the US Dollar, and the reclassification related to grossing up expenses as previously discussed. The reduction in office and general expenses from existing operations was due to a decrease in occupancy and overhead costs as a result of the 2003 restructuring program and a decrease in bad debt expense from improved collection activity, primarily toward the latter part of the year. Offsetting these reductions are higher professional fees resulting from the securities litigation and SEC investigation, higher audit costs and costs associated with preparation for compliance with the Sarbanes Oxley Act. The components of the total change in 2003 were: $ Change Increase/(Decrease) Foreign currency changes $102.9 5.2 % Net acquisitions/divestitures (15.2 ) (0.7 )% Reclassifications 90.9 5.1 % Reduction in office and general expenses from existing operations (173.4 ) (9.3 )% Total change $ 5.2 0.3 % 2002 vs. 2001 Office and general expenses were $1,880.4 in 2002 and $1,896.1 in 2001, a decrease of $15.7 or 0.8%. The net decrease in operating expenses of $15.7 was due to various factors including the cost reduction initiatives from the 2001 restructuring plan that accounted for year on year reductions in occupancy costs of approximately $32. These reductions represent savings in 2002, the year in which substantially all of the savings from the 2001 restructuring program began to be realized. Travel and entertainment costs and office related and supplies costs also decreased. These decreases were offset by an increase in professional fees resulting from the restatements and the related securities litigation and the SEC investigation previously described, an increase in bad debt expense and higher costs related to the Companys motorsports business within SEG. THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) The components of the total change in 2002 were: $ Change Increase/(Decrease) Foreign currency changes $ (3.6 ) (0.2 )% Net acquisitions/divestitures (3.5 ) (0.1 )% Loss of the Chrysler and Pepsi accounts (14.2 ) (0.8 )% Increases in office and general expenses from existing operations 5.6 0.3 % Total change $(15.7 ) (0.8 )% Amortization of Intangible Assets Amortization of intangible assets was $11.3 in 2003, $8.9 in 2002 and $164.6 in 2001. The decrease from 2001 is primarily a result of the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ("SFAS 142"). Restructuring and Other Merger related Costs During 2003, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $175.6 in connection with the 2003 and 2001 restructuring programs as discussed below. The Company expects that the restructuring charges recorded to date will result in cash payments of $39.3 to be paid in 2004, $15.5 in 2005 and $6.1 in 2006 and thereafter. Approximately $85 in additional restructuring charges is expected to be incurred in the first half of 2004. The total amount of pre tax charges the Company expects to incur, through the first half of 2004, including amounts classified in office and general expenses, will approximate $275. The amount of salary and occupancy costs eliminated as a result of the restructuring charges recorded in 2003 is estimated to be approximately $175, a portion of which has begun to be realized during 2003 (as discussed in "Operating Expenses" above). 2003 Program During the second quarter of 2003, the Company announced that it would undertake restructuring initiatives in response to softness in demand for advertising and marketing services. The restructuring initiatives include severance and lease terminations. During 2003, the Company recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $175.6, of which $163.2 related to the 2003 program. The pre tax restructuring charge for the 2003 program was composed of severance costs of $126.2 and lease terminations costs of $37.0. Included in the $37.0 of lease termination costs was $4.8 related to the write off of leasehold improvements on vacated properties. The charges related to leases terminated as part of the 2003 program are recorded at net present value and are net of estimated sublease income amounts. The discount relating to lease terminations will be amortized over future periods. In addition, a charge of $16.5 has been incurred in 2003 related to acceleration of amortization of leasehold improvements on premises included in the 2003 program. The charge related to such amortization is included in office and general expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations. A summary of the liability for restructuring charges related to the 2003 restructuring plan is as follows: 2003 Charges Non cash Charges 2003 Cash Payments Foreign Currency Adjustment Liability at December 31, 2003 TOTAL BY TYPE Severance and termination costs $126.2 $1.4 $88.3 $1.2 $37.7 Lease terminations and other exit costs 37.0 4.8 8.5 0.4 24.1 Total $163.2 $6.2 $96.8 $1.6 $61.8 The severance and termination costs recorded to date relate to a reduction in workforce of approximately 2,900 employees worldwide. The employee groups affected include all levels and functions across the Company: executive, regional and account management and administrative, creative and media production personnel. Approximately 30% of the charge relates to severance in the US, 15% to severance in the UK, 10% to severance in France with the remainder largely relating to the rest of Europe, Asia and Latin America. THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Lease termination costs, net of estimated sublease income, relate to the offices that have been or will be vacated as part of the restructuring. Fifty five locations have already been vacated and an additional 25 are to be vacated, with substantially all actions to be completed by June 30, 2004; however, given the remaining lease terms involved, the cash portion of the charge will be paid out over a period of several years. The majority of the offices to be vacated are located in the US, with approximately one third in overseas markets, principally in Europe. 2001 Program Following the completion of the True North acquisition in June 2001, the Company executed a wide ranging restructuring plan that included severance, lease terminations and other actions. The total amount of the charges incurred in 2001 in connection with the plan was $634.5. In the third quarter of 2002, the Company recorded an additional $12.1 in charges related to the 2001 restructuring plan. The additional charge was necessitated largely by increases in estimates of lease losses due to lower than anticipated sublease income in key markets, including San Francisco, Chicago, Paris and London. During 2003, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $175.6, of which $12.4 related to additional losses on properties vacated as part of the 2001 program. A summary of the remaining liability for restructuring and other merger related costs related to the 2001 restructuring plan is as follows: Liability at December 31, 2002 2003 Charge 2003 Cash Payments Liability at December 31, 2003 TOTAL BY TYPE Severance and termination costs $ 15.9 $ $10.9 $ 5.0 Lease terminations and other exit costs 94.6 12.4 33.1 73.9 Total $110.5 $12.4 $44.0 $78.9 The Company terminated approximately 7,000 employees in connection with the 2001 restructuring program. The Company downsized or vacated approximately 180 locations. Given the remaining lease terms involved, the remaining liabilities will be paid out over a period of several years. Lease termination and related costs included write offs related to the abandonment of leasehold improvements as part of the office vacancies. Other exit costs related principally to the impairment loss on sale or closing of certain business units in the US and Europe. In the aggregate, the businesses sold or closed represented an immaterial portion of the revenue and operating profit of the Company. The write off amount was computed based upon the difference between the estimated sales proceeds (if any) and the carrying value of the related assets. The sales and closures had been completed by September 30, 2002. Long Lived Asset Impairment and Other Charges The following table summarizes the long lived asset impairment and other charges for 2003, 2002, and 2001: 2003 2002 2001 Goodwill impairment $221.0 $ 82.1 $303.1 Fixed asset impairment 49.7 24.7 Current capital expenditure impairment 16.2 8.3 Record fair value of put option 12.0 Total $286.9 $127.1 $303.1 2003 Impairments During 2003, the Company recorded total charges of $286.9 related to the impairment of long lived assets. This amount includes $221.0 related to goodwill at OWW and $63.8 related to the Companys Motorsports businesses. THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) OWW During the third quarter of 2003, the Company performed its annual impairment review for goodwill and other intangible assets and recorded a non cash charge of $221.0. The charge was required to reduce the carrying value of goodwill at the Companys OWW reporting unit. OWW is separate from Motorsports and offers a variety of sports marketing services including athlete representation, TV rights distribution and other marketing and consulting services. The OWW charges reflect the reporting units lower than expected performance in 2003 and revised future projections indicating that the factors behind the poor 2003 performance are likely to persist. Specifically, during 2003 it became apparent that there was significant pricing pressure in both overseas and domestic TV rights distribution. Further, declining athlete pay scales are expected to result in significantly lower fees from athlete representation, and proceeds from events (including ticket revenue and sponsorship) to which the Company is committed will be lower than amounts that had been anticipated when the event rights were acquired. Various factors, including the operating loss incurred at OWW in 2003, have indicated that lower revised growth projections are required, reflecting lower projected gross margins than OWW has earned historically. Motorsports The Companys Motorsports unit owned and leased certain racing circuit facilities that were used for automobile, motorcycle and go cart racing, primarily in the UK. On January 12, 2004, the Company completed the sale of a business comprising the four motorsports circuits (including Brands Hatch, Oulton Park, Cadwell Park and Snetterton) (the "four owned circuits"), owned by its Brands Hatch subsidiaries, to MotorSport Vision Limited. The consideration for the sale was approximately 15 million Pounds, (approximately $26) before expenses. An additional contingent amount of up to 2 million Pounds, (approximately $4) may be paid to the Company depending upon the future financial results of the operations being sold. The Company and its Brands Hatch subsidiaries retain their interests and contractual commitments relating to the Silverstone circuit. The Company recognized an impairment loss related to the four owned circuits of $38.0 in the fourth quarter of 2003 and has classified the relevant assets and liabilities as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2003. See Note 16 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the Companys remaining contingent obligations related to motorsports. In addition to the Brands Hatch impairment charge, $25.8 in charges was incurred related to the impairment of other assets, including $16.2 of current capital expenditure outlays that the Company is contractually required to spend to upgrade and maintain certain of its remaining Motorsports racing facilities, as well as an impairment of assets at other Motorsports entities. At December 31, 2003, there were additional capital expenditures commitments of approximately $25, which are expected to be impaired as incurred based on the cash flow analysis for the relevant asset groupings. 2002 Impairments Beginning in the second quarter of 2002 and continuing in subsequent quarters, certain of the Motorsports businesses experienced significant operational difficulties, including significantly lower than anticipated attendance at the marquee British Grand Prix race in July 2002. These events and a change in management at Motorsports in the third quarter of 2002 led the Company to begin assessing its long term strategy for Motorsports. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 142, the Company prepared a discounted cash flow analysis which indicated that the book value of Motorsports significantly exceeded its estimated fair value and that a goodwill impairment had occurred. In addition, as a result of the goodwill analysis, the Company assessed whether there had been an impairment of the Companys long lived assets in accordance with SFAS 144. The Company concluded that the book value of certain asset groupings at Motorsports was significantly higher than their expected future cash flows and that an impairment had occurred. Accordingly, the Company recognized a non cash impairment loss and related charge of $127.1 in 2002. The charges included $82.1 of goodwill impairment, $33.0 of fixed assets and capital expenditure write offs, and $12.0 to record the fair value of an associated put option. THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) 2001 Impairments Following the completion of the True North acquisition in 2001 and the realignment of certain of the Companys businesses, the Company evaluated the realizability of various assets. In connection with this review undiscounted cash flow projections were prepared for certain investments, and the Company determined that the goodwill attributable to certain business units was stated at an amount in excess of the future estimated cash flows. As a result, an impairment charge of $303.1 was recorded in 2001. Of the total write off, $221.4 was recorded in the second quarter, with the remainder recorded in the third quarter. The largest components of the goodwill impairment and other charges were Capita Technologies, Inc. (approximately $145) and Zentropy Partners (approximately $16), both internet services businesses. The remaining amount primarily related to several other businesses, including internet services, healthcare consulting and certain advertising offices in Europe and Asia Pacific. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) Interest Expense Interest expense increased by $27.2 to $172.8 in 2003 primarily as a result of the issuance of $800 4.5% Notes on March 13, 2003. These proceeds were invested until early April, at which time the proceeds were used for the settlement of the tender offer for the Zero Coupon Notes. Interest expense decreased by $19.0 to $145.6 in 2002 due to lower debt levels, lower interest rates paid on short term borrowings and the issuance and sale of the Zero Coupon Notes in December 2001. The Company used the net proceeds of $563.2 from the Zero Coupon Notes to repay indebtedness under the Companys credit facilities. Debt Prepayment Penalty During the third quarter of 2003, the Company repaid all of its outstanding borrowings under the Prudential Agreements. This transaction required repaying $142.5 principal amount of its outstanding debt. In connection with this transaction, a prepayment penalty of $24.8 was recorded. Interest Income Interest income was $38.9 in 2003, $29.8 in 2002 and $41.8 in 2001. The increase in 2003 is primarily due to higher cash balances resulting from the issuance of the 4.5% Notes in March, the proceeds from the sale of NFO in July and the proceeds from the equity offerings in December 2003. The decrease in 2002 is primarily due to lower interest rates. Other Income The following table sets forth the components of other income: 2003 2002 2001 Gains (losses) on sales of businesses $ 0.2 $(0.2) $12.3 Gain on sale of TNS shares 13.3 Gain on sale of Modem Media shares 30.4 Gains (losses) on sales of other available for sale securities 4.1 5.3 (2.5) Miscellaneous investment income 2.0 2.8 3.9 $50.0 $ 7.9 $13.7 See Investing Activities in "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below for a discussion of proceeds from sales of businesses. Investment Impairments During 2003, the Company recorded $84.9 in investment impairment charges related to 21 investments. The charge related principally to investments in the Middle East, Latin America, and Japan with additional amounts in Canada, Europe, and the United States. The majority of the charge related to impairments arising from deteriorating economic conditions in the countries in which the entity operates. During 2002, the Company recorded $39.7 of investment impairment primarily related to certain investments of OWW, the Companys sports marketing business. THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) During 2001, the Company recorded total investment impairment charges of $210.8. The charge included $160.1 related to the impairment of investments primarily in publicly traded internet related companies, including marchFIRST, Inc. (an internet professional services firm), which had filed for relief under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code in April 2001. The remaining charge included write offs for investments in non internet companies, certain venture funds and other investments. In addition, the Company recorded a charge of $2.5 to record the fair value of a put option. The impairment charges adjusted the carrying value of investments to the estimated market value where an other than temporary impairment had occurred. Litigation Charges During 2003, the Company recorded litigation charges of $127.6 for various legal matters, of which $115 relates to a tentative settlement of the shareholder suits discussed in Note 16. The settlement is subject to the execution of a definitive settlement agreement and to approval from the federal district court judge. Under the terms of the proposed settlement, the Company will pay $115, of which $20 will be paid in cash and $95 will be paid in shares of the Companys common stock at an estimated value of $14.50 per share (which translates into 6,551,725 shares). In the event that the price of the Companys common stock falls below $8.70 per share before final approval of the settlement, the Company will either, at its sole discretion, issue additional shares of common stock or pay cash so that the consideration for the stock portion of the settlement will have a total value of $57. The ultimate amount of the litigation charge related to the settlement will depend upon the Companys stock price at the ti me a settlement is concluded. The Company believes that, if the settlement is concluded as expected, the amounts accrued would be adequate to cover all pending shareholder suits. OTHER ITEMS Effective Income Tax Rate The Companys effective income tax rate was an expense of 94.4% in 2003, an expense of 55.8% in 2002 and a benefit of 11.3% in 2001. The Companys effective income tax rate for 2003, 2002 and 2001 was negatively impacted by the restructuring charges, non deductible long lived asset impairment charges and non deductible investment impairment charges relating to unconsolidated affiliates. In addition, the tax rate in 2003 was negatively impacted by the establishment of valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets as well as losses incurred in non US jurisdictions with tax benefits at rates lower than the US statutory rates. The difference between the effective tax rate and the statutory federal rate of 35% is also due to state and local taxes and the effect of non US operations. All of these factors contributed to the Companys recording of a tax provision of $254.0 on a pre tax loss of $269.0 for 2003. The increased tax rate in 2002 reflects a higher proportion of earnings derived from the US where it is taxed at higher rates, as well as losses incurred in non US jurisdictions with tax benefits at rates lower than the US statutory rates. The difference between the 2002 and 2001 effective tax rates is primarily attributable to the elimination of certain non deductible accounting charges resulting from our adoption of SFAS 142 (see Note 1). The 2001 effective income tax rate reflects the impact of goodwill amortization. Valuation Allowance As required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes ("SFAS 109"), the Company is required to evaluate on a quarterly basis the realizability of its deferred tax assets. SFAS 109 requires a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. In circumstances where there is sufficient negative evidence, establishment of a valuation allowance must be considered. The Company believes that cumulative losses in the most recent three year period represent sufficient negative evidence under the provisions of SFAS 109 and, as a result, the Company determined that certain of its deferred tax assets required the establishment of a valuation allowance. The deferred tax assets for which an allowance was established relate primarily to foreign net operating and US capital loss carryforwards. During 2003, a valuation allowance of $53.9 was established in continuing operations on existing defe rred tax assets. In addition, $26.8 of valuation allowances were established in continuing operations for current year losses incurred in jurisdictions where a benefit is not currently expected, and $3.7 of valuation allowances were established in continuing operations for certain US capital and other loss carryforwards. The total valuation allowance as of December 31, 2003 was $171.0. THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) The realization of the remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on forecasted future taxable income. Any reduction in estimated forecasted future taxable income, including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets on which a valuation allowance has not previously been established. The valuation allowance that has been established will be maintained until there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized. An ongoing pattern of profitability will generally be considered as sufficient positive evidence. Our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of offsetting decreases in our valuation allowance. The establishment or reversal of valuation allowances could have a significant negative or positive impact on future earnings. Minority Interest Income applicable to minority interests was virtually unchanged at $30.9 in 2003, $30.5 in 2002 and $29.4 in 2001. Unconsolidated Affiliates Equity in net income (loss) of unconsolidated affiliates was income of $1.0 in 2003, income of $5.0 in 2002 and a loss of $0.4 in 2001. The decrease in 2003 was primarily due to reduced earnings in unconsolidated affiliates in Europe and Brazil. The increase in 2002 was primarily due to increased earnings of unconsolidated affiliates in the US, partially offset by the sale of unconsolidated affiliates in Europe and the US. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES The Company enters into interest rate swaps, hedges of net investments in foreign operations and forward contracts. Interest Rate Swaps As of December 31, 2003, the Company had no outstanding interest rate swap agreements. During 2002, the Company had outstanding interest rate swap agreements covering $400.0 of the $500.0, 7.875% notes due October 2005. The swaps had the same term as the debt and effectively converted the fixed rate on the debt to a variable rate based on 6 month LIBOR. The swaps were accounted for as hedges of the fair value of the related debt and were recorded as an asset or liability as appropriate. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had terminated all of the interest rate swap agreements covering the $500.0, 7.875% notes due October 2005. In connection with the termination of the interest rate swap agreements transaction, the Company received $45.7 in cash which will be recorded as an offset to interest expense over the remaining life of the related debt. Hedges of Net Investments As of December 31, 2003, the Company had no loans designated as hedges of net investments. The Company has significant foreign operations and conducts business in various foreign currencies. In order to hedge the value of its investments in Japan, the Company had designated the Yen borrowings under its $375.0 Revolving Credit Facility (in the amount of $36.5) as a hedge of its net investment. The amount deferred in 2002 was not material. On August 15, 2003, the Company repaid $36.5 Yen borrowing under its $375.0 Revolving Credit Facility that had been designated as a hedge of a net investment. Forward Contracts The Company has entered into foreign currency transactions in which foreign currencies (principally the Euro, Pounds and the Yen) are bought or sold forward. The contracts were entered into to meet currency requirements arising from specific transactions. The changes in value of these forward contracts were reflected in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Operations. As of December 31, 2002 the Company had contracts covering approximately $37 of notional amount of currency and the fair value of the forward contracts was a gain of $5.1. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had contracts covering $2.4 of notional amount of currency and the fair value of the forward contracts was negligible. THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Other The Company has two embedded derivative instruments under the terms of the offering of Zero Coupon Notes as discussed in Note 8. At December 31, 2002, the fair value of the two derivatives was negligible. As of April 2003, substantially all of the Zero Coupon Notes were redeemed. In connection with the issuance and sale of the 4.5% Convertible Senior Notes in March 2003, two embedded derivatives were created. The fair value of the two derivatives on December 31, 2003 was negligible. As discussed in "Payments for Prior Acquisitions" below, the Company has entered into various put and call options related to acquisitions. The exercise price of such options is generally based upon the achievement of projected operating performance targets and approximate fair value. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES At December 31, 2003, cash and cash equivalents were $2,005.7, an increase of $1,072.7 from December 31, 2002. Total debt at December 31, 2003 was $2,474.3, a decrease of $163.7 from December 31, 2002. The Company collects funds from clients on behalf of media outlets resulting in cash receipts and disbursements at levels substantially exceeding its revenue. Therefore, the working capital amounts reported on its balance sheet and cash flows from operating activities reflect the "pass through" of these items. The Companys cash and debt positions were positively impacted by its 2003 debt and equity offerings, as discussed below, the sale of NFO, and cash flow from operations. During the third quarter of 2003, the Company filed a universal shelf registration in the amount of $1,800, $721.4 of which was used in concurrent common stock and mandatorily convertible preferred stock offerings in 2003. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $502.0, $855.9 and $128.1 in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2003 was primarily attributable to the lower earnings level in 2003 resulting from continued softness in client demand for advertising and marketing services and the Companys restructuring program. The Company expects to continue to generate cash from operations in 2004. Offsetting the additional cash expected to be provided in 2004 are cash uses related to the Companys restructuring program, funding of pension liabilities and amounts required to exit the Companys remaining motorsports commitments. The increase in cash provided in 2002 was the result of improved working capital management, particularly with regard to receivables, and the timing of international media payments at year end, and includes reduced payments of incentives in 2002. Investing Activities Historically the Company has pursued acquisitions to complement and enhance its service offerings. In addition, the Company has also sought to acquire businesses similar to those already owned to expand its geographic scope to better serve new and existing clients. Acquisitions have historically been funded using stock, cash or a combination of both. Currently, the Company has certain restrictions by the terms of its Revolving Credit Facilities from making acquisitions or investments that are funded with cash. The Companys permitted level of annual expenditures for new acquisitions funded with cash is $100 in the aggregate. See "Financing Activities" for further discussion. During 2003, 2002, and 2001, the Company paid $224.6, $276.8 and $308.8, respectively, in cash for new acquisitions and earn out payments for previous acquisitions. The reduction in payments in 2002 and 2003 reflects the Companys reduced level of acquisition activity. In 2003, the Company sold certain non core assets. The Company completed the sale of NFO for $415.6 in cash ($376.7 net of cash sold and expenses) and approximately 11.7 million of shares of TNS stock which were sold in December for net proceeds of approximately $42; sold approximately 11 million of the shares it owned as an equity investment in Modem Media, Inc. for net proceeds of approximately $57 million; and, in January 2004, sold four of the motorsport circuits for approximately $26 in cash. THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) The Companys capital expenditures were $159.6, $171.4, and $257.5 during 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. The primary purposes of these expenditures were to upgrade computer and telecommunications systems and to modernize offices. Currently, the Company is restricted in making capital expenditures by the terms of its Revolving Credit Facilities. The Companys permitted level of annual capital expenditures is $175.0. See "Financing Activities" for further discussion. In 2004, the Company expects to continue to make certain selective new acquisitions, payments for earn outs due from previous acquisitions, and other capital expenditures. Given the restrictions on these expenditures, discussed above, the Company does not expect these payments to exceed approximately $400 spent in 2003. Financing Activities Total cash on hand at December 31, 2003 was $2,005.7, an increase of $1,072.7 from December 31, 2002. Total debt at December 31, 2003 was $2,474.3, a decrease of $163.7 from December 31, 2002. The Companys cash and debt positions were positively impacted by its 2003 debt and equity offerings, as discussed below, the sale of NFO, cash flow from operations and international cash and debt pooling arrangements that were put in place to optimize the net debt balances in certain markets. Revolving Credit Agreements On June 27, 2000, the Company entered into a revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks providing for a term of five years and for borrowings of up to $375.0 (the "Five Year Revolving Credit Facility"). On May 16, 2002, the Company entered into a revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks providing for a term of 364 days and for borrowings of up to $500.0 (the "Old 364 Day Revolving Credit Facility"). The Company replaced the Old 364 Day Revolving Credit Facility with a new 364 day revolving credit facility, which it entered into with a syndicate of banks on May 15, 2003 (the "New 364 Day Revolving Credit Facility" and, together with the Five Year Revolving Credit Facility, both as amended from time to time, the "Revolving Credit Facilities"). The New 364 Day Revolving Credit Facility provides for borrowings of up to $500.0, $200.0 of which are available to the Company for the issuance of letters of credit. The New 364 Day Revolving Credit Facility expires on May 13, 2004. However, the Comp any has the option to extend the maturity of amounts outstanding on the termination date under the New 364 Day Revolving Credit Facility for a period of one year, if EBITDA, as defined in the agreements, for the four fiscal quarters most recently ended was at least $831.0 (for purposes of this EBITDA calculation, only $125.0 of non recurring restructuring charges may be added back to EBITDA). The Revolving Credit Facilities are used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2003, $160.1 was utilized under the New 364 Day Revolving Credit Facility for the issuance of letters of credit, $0.0 was borrowed under the New 364 Day Revolving Credit Facility and $0.0 was borrowed under the Five Year Revolving Credit Facility. As of March 12, 2004, $136.0 was obligated under the New 364 Day Revolving Credit Facility for the issuance of letters of credit, $0.0 was borrowed under the New 364 Day Revolving Credit Facility and $0.0 of the $375.0 available was borrowed under the Five Year Revolving Credit Facility . The Revolving Credit Facilities bear interest at variable rates based on either LIBOR or a banks base rate, at the Companys option. The interest rates on base rate loans and LIBOR loans under the Revolving Credit Facilities are affected by the facilities utilization levels and the Companys credit ratings. In connection with the New 364 Day Revolving Credit Facility, the Company agreed to new pricing under the Revolving Credit Facilities that increased the interest spread payable on loans under the Revolving Credit Facilities by 25 basis points. Based on the Companys current credit ratings, interest rates on loans under the New 364 Day Revolving Credit Facility are currently calculated by adding 175 basis points to LIBOR or 25 basis points to the applicable bank base rate, and interest rates on loans under the Five Year Revolving Credit Facility are currently calculated by adding 170 basis points to LIBOR or 25 basis points to the applicable bank base rate. The Companys Revolving Credit Facilities include financial covenants that set (i) maximum levels of debt for borrowed money as a function of EBITDA, (ii) minimum levels of EBITDA as a function of interest expense and (iii) minimum levels of EBITDA (in each case, as defined in those agreements). As of December 31, 2003, the Company was, and expects to continue to be, in compliance with all of the covenants (including the financial covenants, as amended) contained in the Revolving Credit Facilities. THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) On February 10, 2003, certain defined terms relating to financial covenants contained in the Five Year Revolving Credit Facility and the Old 364 Day Revolving Credit Facility were amended effective as of December 31, 2002 to include in the definition of debt for borrowed money the Companys 1.8% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2004 and 1.87% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2006. In addition, the definition of Interest Expense was also amended to include all interest with respect to these Subordinated Notes. In connection with entering into the New 364 Day Revolving Credit Facility, the definition of EBITDA in the Revolving Credit Facilities was amended to include (i) up to $161.4 of non cash, non recurring charges taken in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002; (ii) up to $200.0 of non recurring restructuring charges (up to $175.0 of which may be cash charges) taken in the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2003, June 30, 2003 and September 30, 2003; (iii) up to $70.0 of non cash, non recurring charges taken with respect to the impairment of the remaining book value of the Companys Motorsports business; and (iv) all impairment charges taken with respect to capital expenditures made on or after January 1, 2003 with respect to the Companys Motorsports business, and to exclude the gain realized by the Company upon the sale of NFO. The corresponding financial covenant ratio levels in the Revolving Credit Facilities were also amended. As of September 29, 2003, these additions to the definition of EBITDA were replaced with the following items: (i) up to $161.4 of non cash, non recurring charges taken in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002; (ii) up to $275.0 of non recurring restructuring charges (up to $240.0 of which may be cash charges) taken in the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2003 and each of the fiscal periods ending June 30, 2003, September 30, 2003, December 31, 2003 and March 31, 2004; (iii) up to $70.0 of non cash, non recurring charges taken with respect to the impairment of the remaining book value of the Companys Motorsports business; (iv) all impairment charges taken with respect to capital expenditures made on or after January 1, 2003 with respect to the Companys Motorsports business; (v) up to $300.0 of non cash, non recurring goodwill or investment impairment charges taken in the fiscal periods ending September 30, 2003, December 31, 2003, March 31, 2004, June 30, 2004 and September 30, 2004; (vi) up to $135.0 in pa yments made by the Company (up to $40.0 of which may be in cash) with respect to the fiscal periods ending September 30, 2003, December 31, 2003 and March 31, 2004, relating to the settlement of certain litigation matters; (vii) $24.8 in respect of the early repayment by the Company of all amounts outstanding under the Prudential Agreements with respect to the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2003; and (viii) non cash charges related to the adoption by the Company of the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148. The definition of EBITDA was also separately amended to give the Company flexibility to settle its commitments under certain leasing and Motorsports event contractual arrangements. The Company paid a fee of 10 basis points of the total commitments under each of the Revolving Credit Facilities in consideration for these amendments to the de finition of EBITDA. In determining the Companys compliance with the financial covenants as of December 31, 2003, the following charges were added back to the definition of EBITDA: (i) $176.2 of restructuring charges ($153.5 of which were cash charges), (ii) $47.4 of non cash charges with respect to the impairment of the remaining book value of the Companys Motorsports business, (iii) $16.2 of impairment charges taken with respect to capital expenditures of the Companys Motorsports businesses, (iv) $293.9 of goodwill or investment impairment charges and (v) $115.0 of charges (primarily non cash) relating to certain litigation matters. Since these charges and payments were added back to the definition of EBITDA, they do not affect the ability of the Company to comply with its financial covenants. Any charges incurred by the Company as a result of its restructuring program after March 31, 2004 will not be added back to EBITDA in determining whether the Company is in compliance with its financial covenants. The terms of the Revolving Credit Facilities restrict the Companys ability to declare or pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock, make cash acquisitions or investments and make capital expenditures, as well as the ability of the Companys domestic subsidiaries to incur additional debt in excess of $65.0. Certain of these limitations were modified upon the Companys issuance on March 13, 2003 of 4.5% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the "4.5% Notes") in an aggregate principal amount of $800.0, from which the Company received net cash proceeds equal to approximately $778. In addition, pursuant to a tender offer that expired on April 4, 2003, the Company purchased $700.5 in aggregate principal amount at maturity of its Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due 2021 (the "Zero Coupon Notes"). As a result of these transactions, the Companys permitted level of annual new cash acquisition THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) spending has increased to $100.0 and the permitted level of annual share buybacks and dividend payments not related solely to preferred stock has increased to $25.0. All limitations on dividend payments and share buybacks expire when EBITDA (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facilities) is at least $1,300.0 for four consecutive quarters. The Companys permitted level of annual capital expenditures is $175.0. On November 18, 2003, the Revolving Credit Facilities were further amended to permit the Company to pay up to $45.0 in annual cash dividends with respect to preferred stock that is convertible into common stock of the Company within 48 months following its issuance. This $45.0 allowance is in addition to the Companys current $25.0 permitted level of annual share buybacks and general dividend payments discussed above. As a result of the issuance of the 4.5% Notes in the first quarter of 2003 and the settlement of the tender offer for the Zero Coupon Notes in the second quarter of 2003, both the 4.5% Notes and the Zero Coupon Notes were outstanding at March 31, 2003. Therefore, the Company amended the Five Year Revolving Credit Facility and the Old 364 Day Revolving Credit Facility, as of March 13, 2003, to exclude the Zero Coupon Notes in calculating the ratio of debt for borrowed money to consolidated EBITDA for the period ended March 31, 2003 (this exclusion is also contained in the New 364 Day Revolving Credit Facility). On February 26, 2003, the Company obtained waivers of certain defaults under the Five Year Revolving Credit Facility and the Old 364 Day Revolving Credit Facility relating to the restatement of the Companys historical Consolidated Financial Statements in the aggregate amount of $118.7. The waivers covered certain financial reporting requirements related to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2002. No financial covenants were breached as a result of this restatement. The Company does not anticipate that any waivers will be needed under the Revolving Credit Facilities prior to, or in connection with, the refinancing of the New 364 Day Revolving Credit Facility. Other Committed and Uncommitted Facilities In addition to the Revolving Credit Facilities, at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, the Company had $0.8 and $157.8 of committed lines of credit, all of which were provided by overseas banks that participate in the Revolving Credit Facilities. The decrease in the committed lines of credit was partially offset by the increase in the uncommitted lines of credit. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, $0.0 and $3.1 were outstanding under these lines of credit. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, the Company also had $744.8 and $707.9 of uncommitted lines of credit, 68.0% and 66.8% of which were provided by banks that participate in the Revolving Credit Agreements. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, $38.1 and $213.2 were outstanding under these uncommitted lines of credit. The Companys uncommitted borrowings are repayable upon demand. Prudential Agreements On May 26, 1994, April 28, 1995, October 31, 1996, August 19, 1997 and January 21, 1999, the Company entered into five note purchase agreements, respectively, with The Prudential Insurance Company of America. The notes issued pursuant to the Prudential Agreements were repayable on May 2004, April 2005, October 2006, August 2007 and January 2009, respectively, and had interest rates of 10.01%, 9.95%, 9.41%, 9.09% and 8.05%, respectively. Due to the high interest rates on the notes issued under the Prudential Agreements and the restrictive financial covenants contained in these agreements, the Company repaid the total principal amount and interest outstanding under the Prudential Agreements on August 8, 2003, including a prepayment penalty that resulted in a net charge of $24.8. UBS Facility On February 10, 2003, the Company received from UBS AG a commitment for an interim credit facility providing for $500.0 maturing no later than July 31, 2004 and available to the Company beginning May 15, 2003, subject to certain conditions. This commitment terminated in accordance with its terms when the Company received net cash proceeds in excess of $400.0 from its sale of the 4.5% Notes. The fees associated with the commitment were not material to the Companys financial position, cash flows or results of operation. THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Other Debt Instruments (i) Convertible Senior Notes 4.5% In March 2003 the Company completed the issuance and sale of $800.0 aggregate principal amount of the 4.5% Notes. In April 2003, the Company used approximately $581 of the net proceeds of this offering to repurchase the Zero Coupon Notes tendered in its concurrent tender offer and is using the remaining proceeds for the repayment of other indebtedness, general corporate purposes and working capital. The 4.5% Notes are unsecured, senior securities that may be converted into common shares if the price of the Companys common stock reaches a specified threshold, at an initial conversion rate of 80.5153 shares per one thousand dollars principal amount, equal to a conversion price of $12.42 per share, subject to adjustment. This threshold will initially be 120% of the conversion price and will decline 1/2% each year until it reaches 110% at maturity in 2023. The 4.5% Notes may also be converted, regardless of the price of the Companys common stock, if: (i) the credit ratings assigned to the 4.5% Notes by any two of Moodys Investors Service, Inc., Standard & Poors Ratings Services and Fitch Ratings are lower than Ba2, BB and BB, respectively, or the 4.5% Notes are no longer rated by at least two of these ratings services, (ii) the Company calls the 4.5% Notes for redemption, (iii) the Company makes specified distributions to shareholders or (iv) the Company becomes a party to a consolidation, merger or binding share exchange pursuant to which its common stock would be converted into cash or property (other than securities). The Company, at the investors option, may be required to redeem the 4.5% Notes for cash on March 15, 2008. The Company may also be required to redeem the 4.5% Notes at the investors option on March 15, 2013 and March 15, 2018, for cash or common stock or a combination of both, at the Companys election. Additionally, investors may require the Company to redeem the 4.5% Notes in the event of certain change of control events that occur prior to May 15, 2008, for cash or common stock or a combination of both, at the Companys election. The Company at its option may redeem the 4.5% Notes on or after May 15, 2008 for cash. The redemption price in each of these instances will be 100% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. If at any time on or after March 13, 2003 the Company pays cash dividends on its common stock, the Company will pay contingent interest per 4.5% Note in an amount equal to 100% of the per share cash dividend paid on the common stock multip lied by the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of a 4.5% Note. (ii) Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes In December 2001, the Company completed the issuance and sale of approximately $702 of aggregate principal amount of Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due 2021. In April 2003, the Company used approximately $581 of the proceeds received from the issuance and sale of the 4.5% Notes to repurchase $700.5 in aggregate principal amount at maturity of its Zero Coupon Notes. As of December 31, 2003, no Zero Coupon Notes remained outstanding. (iii) Senior Unsecured Notes 7.25% On August 22, 2001, the Company completed the issuance and sale of $500.0 principal amount of senior unsecured notes due 2011. The notes bear interest at a rate of 7.25% per annum. The Company used the net proceeds of approximately $493 from the sale of the notes to repay outstanding indebtedness under its Revolving Credit Facilities. (iv) Senior Unsecured Notes 7.875% On October 20, 2000, the Company completed the issuance and sale of $500.0 principal amount of senior unsecured notes due 2005. The notes bear an interest rate of 7.875% per annum. The Company used the net proceeds of approximately $496 from the sale of the notes to repay outstanding indebtedness under its revolving credit facilities. THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) (v) Convertible Subordinated Notes 1.87% On June 1, 1999, the Company issued $361.0 face amount of Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2006 with a cash coupon rate of 1.87% and a yield to maturity of 4.75%. The 2006 notes were issued at an original price of 83% of the face amount, generating proceeds of approximately $300. The notes are convertible into 6.4 million shares of the Companys common stock at a conversion rate of 17.616 shares per one thousand dollars face amount. Since June 2002, the Company has had the option to redeem the notes for cash. (vi) Convertible Subordinated Notes 1.80% On September 16, 1997, the Company issued $250.0 face amount of Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2004 ("2004 Notes") with a coupon rate of 1.80% and a yield to maturity of 5.25%. The 2004 Notes were issued at an original price of 80% of the face amount, generating proceeds of approximately $200, and were convertible into 6.7 million shares of the Companys common stock at a conversion rate of 26.772 shares per one thousand dollars face amount. On January 20, 2004, the Company exercised its right to redeem all of the 2004 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of approximately $250 at an aggregate price of approximately $246 (96.6813% of the principal amount of the notes plus original issue discount accrued to the redemption date, or $978.10 per $1,000 principal amount of the notes, plus accrued interest to the redemption date). None of the 2004 Notes remain outstanding as of March 12, 2004. Short Term Debt at December 31, 2003 and 2002 The Company and its subsidiaries have short term lines of credit with various banks that permit borrowings at variable interest rates. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, all borrowings under these facilities were by the Companys subsidiaries and totaled $38.1 and $216.3, respectively. Where required, the Company has guaranteed the repayment of borrowings by its subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, 68% and 66.8% of these short term facilities were provided by banks that participate in the Companys Revolving Credit Facilities. The weighted average interest rates on outstanding balances under the committed and uncommitted short term facilities at December 31, 2003 and 2002 were approximately 5% in each year. The following table summarizes the Companys short term debt as of December 31, 2003 and 2002. 2003 Total Facility Amount Outstanding at December 31, 2003 Total Available Committed 364 Day Revolving Credit Facility $ 500.0 $ $ 339.9* Other Facilities (principally International) 0.8 0.8 $ 500.8 $ $ 340.7 Uncommitted Domestic $ $ $ International 744.8 38.1 706.7 $ 744.8 $ 38.1 $ 706.7 Total $1,245.6 $ 38.1 $1,047.4 *Amount available is reduced by $160.1 of Letters of Credit issued under the Revolving Credit Facility. THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) 2002 Total Facility Amount Outstanding at December 31, 2002 Total Available Committed 364 day Revolving Credit Facility $ 500.0 $ $ 500.0 Other Facilities (principally International) 157.8 3.1 154.7 $ 657.8 $ 3.1 $ 654.7 Uncommitted Domestic $ 27.7 $ 7.7 $ 20.0 International 680.2 205.5 474.7 $ 707.9 $213.2 $ 494.7 Total $1,365.7 $216.3 $1,149.4 Other In 2003, the Company filed a universal shelf registration statement providing for the potential issuance and sale of securities in an aggregate amount of up to $1,800.0. On December 16, 2003, in a concurrent offering, the Company issued 25.8 million shares of common stock and issued 7.5 million shares of 3 year Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (the "Preferred Stock") under this shelf registration. The total net proceeds received from these offerings was approximately $693. The Preferred Stock carries a dividend yield of 5.375%. On maturity, each share of the Preferred Stock will convert, subject to adjustment, to between 3.0358 and 3.7037 shares of common stock, depending on the then current market price of the Companys common stock, representing a conversion premium of approximately 22% over the common stock offering price of $13.50 per share. Under certain circumstances, the Preferred Stock may be converted prior to maturity at the option of the holders or the Company. In January 2004, the Company used approximately $246 of the net proceeds from the offerings to redeem the 1.80% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2004. The remaining proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes and to further strengthen the Companys balance sheet and financial condition. The Company will pay annual dividends on each share of Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock in the amount of $2.6875. Dividends will be cumulative from the date of issuance and will be payable on each payment date to the extent that dividends are not restricted under the credit facilities and assets are legally available to pay dividends. The first dividend payment was declared on February 24, 2004 and will be made on March 15, 2004 (see below). On March 7, 2003, Standard & Poors Ratings Services downgraded the Companys senior unsecured credit rating to BB+ with negative outlook from BBB . On May 14, 2003, Fitch Ratings downgraded the Companys senior unsecured credit rating to BB+ with negative outlook from BBB . On May 9, 2003, Moodys Investor Services, Inc. ("Moodys") placed the Companys senior unsecured and subordinated credit ratings on review for possible downgrade from Baa3 and Ba1, respectively. As of March 12, 2004, the Companys credit ratings continued to be on review for a possible downgrade. Since July 2001, the Company has not repurchased its common stock in the open market. In October 2003, the Company received a federal tax refund of approximately $90 as a result of its carryback of its 2002 loss for US federal income tax purposes and certain capital losses, to earlier periods. Through December 2002, the Company had paid cash dividends quarterly with the most recent quarterly dividend paid in December 2002 at a rate of $0.095 per share. On a quarterly basis, the Companys Board of Directors makes determinations regarding the payment of dividends. As previously discussed, the Companys ability to declare or pay dividends is currently restricted by the terms of its Revolving Credit Facilities. The Company did not declare or pay any dividends in 2003. However, in February 2004, the Company declared a cash dividend of $0.642 per share on the Preferred Stock, which is expressly permitted by the Revolving Credit Facilities. The dividend is payable in cash on March 15, 2004 to any stockholder of record at the close of business on March 1, 2004. This will result in total dividend payments of approximately $5. THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Liquidity Outlook The Company believes that cash on hand and cash flow from operations, together with existing lines of credit, will be sufficient to fund the Companys working capital needs and other obligations through the next twelve months. In making this determination, the Company has taken into account uses of cash, including: its significant contractual obligations (see table below); expected cash payments for restructuring; possible payments in connection with a transaction to exit remaining contractual obligations related to UK Motorsports; and funding of certain underfunded retirement arrangements. Further, the Company has assumed that capital expenditures in 2004 will not exceed $175.0, that no dividends (other than dividends on its Preferred Stock) will be paid and that there will be no significant amount of payments related to new acquisitions or purchases of treasury stock. The Companys Revolving Credit Facilities are an essential part of its liquidity profile. The New 364 day Revolving Credit Facility expires on May 13, 2004. If the lenders fail to extend their commitments by the renewal date, there could be an adverse affect on the Companys liquidity. Further, if the Company were to lose all or a substantial portion of its uncommitted lines of credit, it would be forced to seek other sources of liquidity. In the event that additional funds are required or in the event that the Revolving Credit Facilities or uncommitted lines of credit are not extended, the Company believes it will have sufficient resources through cash on hand and its ability to access other debt markets, and through its ability to access the equity markets to meet such requirements. However, there can be no assurance that such additional funding will be available to the Company on terms it considers favorable, if at all. In addition, unanticipated decreases in operating results and the concomitant decrease in cash flows from operations as a result of decreased demand for the Companys services or from other developments might require the Company to seek modification of its current debt agreements and to seek other sources of liquidity (including the disposition of certain assets) and to modify its operating strategies. A downgrade in ratings by any of the ratings agencies may trigger a right on the part of the holders of the 4.5% Notes to convert the 4.5% Notes into shares of the Companys common stock. In addition, such an event might adversely affect the Companys ability to access capital, would result in an increase in the interest rates payable under the Revolving Credit Facilities and would likely result in an increase in the interest rate payable under any future indebtedness. The Company believes that it will be able to meet each of the financial covenants in its Revolving Credit Facilities during 2004. Summary of Significant Contractual Obligations The following summarizes the Companys estimated contractual obligations at December 31, 2003, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flow in future periods. 2004 2005 2006 2007 and thereafter Total Long term debt $244.5 $523.8 $338.5 $1,329.4 $2,436.2 Non cancelable operating lease obligations $317.0 $279.9 $244.3 $1,466.4 $2,307.6 Obligations under executory contract $ 10.0 $ 11.3 $ 12.8 $ 251.1 $ 285.2 Obligations for deferred payments, put options and other payments $154.2 $ 64.0 $ 17.4 $ 16.6 $ 252.2 THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) As discussed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has a number of retirement plans. The deficit in the funded status of these plans has increased to $198.2 at December 31, 2003. As discussed in Note 11, the Company funded its retirement arrangements with contributions of $30.0 in February 2004. The Company considers that the long term return on its pension trust assets and the funding available to the Company will be sufficient to finance these obligations. Payments for Prior Acquisitions Deferred Payments During the three year period ended December 31, 2003, the Company made the following payments on acquisitions that had closed in prior years: 2003 2002 2001 Cash $141.1 $192.3 $188.5 Stock 49.8 72.9 23.4 Total $190.9 $265.2 $211.9 Deferred payments (or "earn outs") generally tie the aggregate price ultimately paid for an acquisition to its performance and are recorded as an increase to goodwill and other intangibles. The amount of payment is contingent upon the achievement of projected operating performance targets. The table above excludes NFO, which is classified as a discontinued operation. NFO had deferred payments of $0.1 in 2002 and $4.0 in 2001. As of December 31, 2003, the Companys estimated liability for deferred payments is as follows: 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 and thereafter Total Cash $113.7 $36.0 $15.3 $3.9 $ $168.9 Stock 14.1 18.3 0.8 3.9 37.1 Total $127.8 $54.3 $16.1 $7.8 $ $206.0 The amounts above are contingent upon the achievement of projected operating performance targets. The amounts are estimates based on the current projections as to the amount that will be paid and are subject to revisions as the earn out periods progress. Purchase of Additional Interests During the three years ended December 31, 2003, the Company made the following payments to purchase additional equity interests in certain consolidated subsidiaries: 2003 2002 2001 Cash $52.3 $33.2 $35.8 Stock 6.3 10.3 19.4 Total $58.6 $43.5 $55.2 Put Options The Company has entered into agreements that may require the Company to purchase additional equity interests in certain consolidated subsidiaries (put options). The estimated amount that would be paid under put options, in the event of exercise at the earliest exercise date, is as follows: 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 and thereafter Total Cash $31.7 $24.8 $2.1 $1.4 $11.3 $71.3 Stock 1.2 1.6 0.1 2.9 Total $32.9 $26.4 $2.2 $1.4 $11.3 $74.2 THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) The actual amount to be paid is generally contingent upon the achievement of projected operating performance targets and satisfying other conditions as specified in the relevant agreement. Call Options The Company also has call options to acquire additional equity interests in certain consolidated subsidiaries. The estimated amount that would be paid under such call options, in the event of exercise, is as follows: 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 and thereafter Total Cash $5.7 $6.3 $6.6 $1.2 $14.8 $34.6 Stock 0.3 1.0 1.3 Total $6.0 $6.3 $7.6 $1.2 $14.8 $35.9 The actual amount to be paid is contingent upon the Companys decision to exercise its option and the upon the achievement of projected operating performance targets and satisfying other conditions as specified in the relevant agreement. Other Payments During three years ended December 31, 2003, the Company made the following payments principally related to loan notes and guaranteed deferred payments that had been previously recognized on the balance sheet: 2003 2002 2001 Cash $27.8 $14.5 $2.8 Stock 0.1 3.2 Total $27.9 $14.5 $6.0 As of December 31, 2003, the Companys estimated liability for other payments are cash amounts of $8.8 and $3.2 in 2004 and 2005, respectively, and stock amounts of $0.5 in 2004. Unconsolidated Affiliates The Company has entered into put and call option agreements with respect to certain companies currently accounted for as unconsolidated affiliates. The estimated amount that would be paid primarily under put options, in the event of exercise at the earliest exercise date, is as follows: 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 and thereafter Total Cash $5.1 $7.8 $14.5 $14.3 $1.5 $43.2 Stock 0.5 0.8 0.4 0.7 0.9 3.3 Total $5.6 $8.6 $14.9 $15.0 $2.4 $46.5 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Companys significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Of these policies, the Company believes the following accounting policies are critical because they are both important to the presentation of the Companys financial condition and results and they require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to estimate the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other factors that it considers reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) The Company believes the following accounting policies are critical to the accuracy of the more significant judgements and estimates used in the preparation of its Consolidated Financial Statements: * revenue recognition; * allowance for doubtful accounts; * accounting for income taxes; * valuation of long lived and intangible assets and investments; and * accounting for business combinations. Revenue Recognition The Company derives revenue from advertising services, including media buying, and from marketing and communication services, including market research, public relations, direct marketing, sales promotion and event marketing activities. The Companys advertising services revenue is derived from commissions that are earned when the media is placed, from fees earned as advertising services are performed and from production services rendered. In addition, incentive amounts may be earned based on qualitative and or quantitative criteria. In the case of commissions, revenue is recognized as the media placements appear. In the case of fee and production arrangements, the revenue is recognized as the services are performed which is generally ratably over the period of the client contract. The Companys marketing service revenues are generally earned on a fee basis, and in certain cases incentive amounts may also be earned. As with fee arrangements in advertising, such revenue is recognized as the work is performed. Incentive amounts for advertising and marketing services are recognized upon satisfaction of the qualitative and or quantitative criteria, as set out in the relevant client contract. In many cases, the amount the Company bills to clients significantly exceeds the amount of revenues that is earned due to the existence of various "pass through" charges such as the cost of media. In compliance with Emerging Issues Task Force pronouncement ("EITF") 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent and EITF 01 14, Income Statement Characterization of Reimbursements Received for "Out of Pocket Expenses Incurred", the Company generally records revenue net of "pass through" charges as it is not the primary obligor with respect to the cost of "pass through" charges and generally acts as an agent on behalf of its clients with respect to such costs. Expenditures billable to clients include costs incurred primarily in connection with production work by the Company on behalf of clients that have not yet been billed to clients. Commissions and fees on such production work are recorded as revenue when earned. As of December 31, 2003, the amount of expenditures billable to clients was $280.6. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company assesses the required amount of allowance for doubtful accounts based on past experience and reviews of aging and analysis of specific accounts. The aging of accounts receivable, reviews of client credit reports, industry trends and economic indicators, as well as analysis of recent payment history for selected customers, enables the Company to estimate the expected bad debt experience related to receivables at each period end. The estimate is based largely on a formula driven calculation but is supplemented with economic indicators and specific knowledge of potential write offs in client accounts. In 2003, the Company recorded a lower amount of bad debt expense than in the prior year reflecting improved experience with collections and as compared to the prior year in which there were larger specific write offs. Accounting for Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing its Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is required to estimate income taxes payable in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. This process involves estimating the actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet. THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) SFAS 109 requires a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. In circumstances where there is sufficient negative evidence, establishment of a valuation allowance must be considered. The Company believes that cumulative losses in the most recent three year period represent sufficient negative evidence to consider a valuation allowance under the provisions of SFAS 109. As a result, the Company determined that certain of its deferred tax assets required the establishment of a valuation allowance. The deferred tax assets for which an allowance was established relate primarily to foreign net operating and US capital loss carryforwards. During 2003, a valuation allowance of $53.9 was established in continuing operations on existing deferred tax assets. In addition, $26.8 of valuation allowances were established in continuing operations for current year losses incurred in jurisdictions where a benefit is not current ly expected, and $3.7 of valuation allowances were established in continuing operations for certain US capital and other loss carryforwards. The realization of the remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on forecasted future taxable income. Any reduction in estimated forecasted future taxable income, including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets on which a valuation allowance has not previously been established. The valuation allowance that has been established will be maintained until there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized. An ongoing pattern of profitability will generally be considered as sufficient positive evidence. Our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of offsetting decreases in our valuation allowance. The establishment and reversal of valuation allowances could have a significant negative or positive impact on our future earnings. Valuation of Long Lived and Intangible Assets and Investments The Company has a significant amount of long lived assets, including fixed assets, investments, goodwill and other intangibles. The Company periodically evaluates the realizability of all of its long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable. Goodwill In the third quarter of each year (as of September 30) the Company formally evaluates the realizability of its goodwill and other intangibles, using discounted cash flow projections. The Company has used the September 30 date since the adoption of SFAS 142. Such projections require the use of estimates and assumptions as to matters such as future revenue growth, product margins, capital expenditures, assumed tax rates and discount rates. Such projections are prepared for each reporting unit as defined in SFAS 142. Management believes that the estimates and assumptions made are reasonable. To the extent that the Company has incorrectly estimated the revenue growth and or product margin assumptions in the calculations, the goodwill related to certain reporting units may be determined to be unrealizable and an impairment charge may have to be recorded. The Company believes that the accounting estimates relating to potential goodwill and other intangible impairments are a "critical accounting estimate" because (i) they are susceptible to change from period to period and (ii) they require the Company to make assumptions about future forecast growth rates. In 2003 and 2002, as a result of the impairment analyses conducted above, total charges related to goodwill impairment of $221.0 and $82.1, respectively, were recorded in the income statement. This was due to the fact that expectations for future earnings from the OWW and Motorsports reporting units would not be sufficient to recover any of the goodwill of the reporting unit. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Investments The Company regularly reviews its cost and equity investments, where market value has declined below cost, to determine whether there has been an "other than temporary" decline in market value. For investments accounted for using the cost or equity method of accounting, management evaluates information (e.g., budgets, business plans, financial statements, etc.) in addition to quoted market price, if any, in determining whether an other than temporary decline in value exists. Factors indicative of an other than temporary decline include recurring operating losses, credit defaults and subsequent rounds of financings at an amount below the cost basis of the investment. This list is not all inclusive and management weighs all known quantitative and qualitative factors in determining if an other than temporary decline in value of an investment has occurred. THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) The Company recorded non cash impairment charges of $84.9, $39.7 and $210.8 in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Company considers that future impairment charges may be necessary based on the factors above, but anticipates that these would not be as significant as in prior years. Fixed Assets For fixed assets, accounting standards require that if the sum of the future cash flows expected to result from a Companys asset grouping, undiscounted and without interest charges, is less than the reported value of the asset, an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements. The amount of the impairment recognized is calculated by subtracting the imputed fair value, as calculated above, from the reported value of the asset. As discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, there were significant long lived assets held at Motorsports. The remaining assets as of December 31, 2003 were sold in a transaction that occurred in January 2004. An impairment charge of $38.0 was recorded in 2003 to reduce the Company value of these assets to their realizable value. Future events could cause the Company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the asset values associated with a given operation have become impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could have a material impact on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. Accounting for Business Combinations The Company accounts for its business acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting. The total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying net assets, based on their respective estimated fair market values. Goodwill is recorded as the difference between the cost of acquiring an entity and the estimated fair market values assigned to its tangible and identifiable intangible net assets at the date of acquisition. Determining the fair market value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires managements judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including, among others, assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives, and market multiples, among other items. The Company has significant future deferred payments ("earn outs") that generally tie the aggregate price ultimately paid for an acquisition to its performance over a period of time. Such payments are recorded within the financial statements once the payment of such earn outs is probable and estimable, and when any contractual contingencies have been met. The Company has policies and procedures in place to determine if such payments relate to the acquisition, and should be allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired, or should be expensed as compensation payments. These policies include reviewing the acquisition agreements and employment terms of former owners of the acquired businesses. The total amount that is anticipated to be settled, in cash and stock, is estimated to be $206.0, of which $127.8 relates to payments due in 2004. The actual amounts to be paid are contingent upon the achievement of projected operating performance targets (generally over a three or four year period) and satisfying other conditions as specified in the relevant agreements. Other Matters SEC Investigation The Company was informed in January 2003 by the Securities and Exchange Commission staff that the SEC has issued a formal order of investigation related to the Companys restatements of earnings for periods dating back to 1997. The matters had previously been the subject of an informal inquiry. The Company is cooperating fully with the investigation. Other Contingencies The Company continues to have commitments under certain leasing and motorsports event contractual arrangements at the Silverstone circuit. As of December 31, 2003, the Company is committed to remaining payments under these arrangements of approximately $460. This amount relates to undiscounted payments through 2015 principally under an executory contract and an operating lease and assumes payments over the maximum remaining term of the relevant agreements. This estimated amount has not been reduced by any future revenues to be generated from the arrangements. The Company is continuing to explore various options with respect to these commitments, at least one of which may involve a cash disbursement in the order of $200. The Company has obtained amendments of THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) certain definitions contained in its Revolving Credit Agreements (as discussed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) to reduce the impact of such cash disbursement and the resulting accounting charge on its financial covenant calculations. RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In December 2003, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 132, Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits ("SFAS 132"), was revised ("SFAS 132 R"). This Statement revises employers disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans but does not alter any recognition or measurement issues promulgated under other standards. This statement retains the disclosure requirements contained in SFAS 132, which it replaces, and requires additional disclosures concerning the assets, obligations, cash flows, and net periodic benefit costs of both defined benefit pension plans and defined benefit postretirement plans. SFAS 132 R requires information to be provided separately for pension plans and for other postretirement benefit plans. With the exception of certain requirements related to foreign plans and ten year expected payout provisions, disclosures not required for 2003, the Company adopted SFAS 132 R in 2003 (see Note 11 to the Consolida ted Financial Statements). In June 2001, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations ("SFAS 143"), was issued. SFAS 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated retirement costs that result from the acquisition, construction, or development and normal operation of a long lived asset. Upon initial recognition of a liability for an asset retirement obligation, SFAS 143 requires an increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset. The asset retirement cost is subsequently allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method over the assets useful life. The adoption of this statement in 2003 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. In June 2002, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities ("SFAS 146"), was issued. SFAS 146 changes the measurement and timing of recognition for exit costs, including restructuring charges, and is effective for any such activities initiated after December 31, 2003. It has no effect on charges recorded for exit activities begun prior to this date. The adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company. In December 2002, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure ("SFAS 148"), an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123 ("SFAS 123") was issued. The Company is choosing to continue with its current practice of applying the recognition and measurement principles of APB 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. The Company has adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS 148. In April 2003, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ("SFAS 149"), was issued. SFAS 149 amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities under FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ("SFAS 133"). This statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003. The adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2003, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity ("SFAS 150"), was issued. SFAS 150 establishes standards for classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability (or an asset in certain cases). The provisions of SFAS 150 are effective for instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003 and pre existing instruments as of July 1, 2003. On October 29, 2003, the FASB voted to indefinitely defer the effective date of SFAS 150 for mandatorily redeemable instruments as they relate to minority interests in consolidated finite lived entities through the issuance of FASB Staff Position 150 3. The standard was adopted effective the third quarter of 2003, as modified by FSP 150 3, and did not have a material impact on its Consolidat ed Results of Operations or Financial Position. THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) In November 2002, FASB Interpretation 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, was issued. This interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. It also clarifies (for guarantees issued after January 1, 2003) that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligations undertaken in issuing the guarantee. Disclosures concerning guarantees are found in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51 ("FIN 46"), which addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities ("VIEs") either: (1) that do not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, or (2) in which the equity investors lack an essential characteristic of a controlling financial interest. In December 2003, the FASB completed deliberations of proposed modifications to FIN 46 ("Revised Interpretations") (FIN 46 R) resulting in multiple effective dates based on the nature as well as the creation date of the VIE. VIEs created after January 31, 2003, but prior to January 1, 2004, may be accounted for either based on the original interpretation or the Revised Interpretations. However, the Revised Interpretations must be applied no later than the Companys quarter ended March 31, 2004. VI Es created after January 1, 2004 must be accounted for under the Revised Interpretations. Special Purpose Entities ("SPEs") created prior to February 1, 2003 may be accounted for under the original or revised interpretations provisions no later than the Companys quarter ended March 31, 2004. Non SPEs created prior to February 1, 2003, should be accounted for under the revised interpretations provisions no later than the Companys second quarter of fiscal 2004. The Company has not entered into any material arrangements with VIEs created after January 31, 2003 and has determined that the adoption of FIN 46 R will not have a material impact on its results of operations and financial condition. In January 2004, FASB Staff Position ("FSP") No. 106 1, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 ("FSP 106 1"), was issued which permits a sponsor of a postretirement health care plan that provides a prescription drug benefit to make a one time election to defer accounting for the effects of the new legislation. The Company has elected to defer the accounting until further guidance is issued by the FASB. The measurements of the Companys postretirement accumulated benefit plan obligation and net periodic benefit cost disclosed in Note 11 do not reflect the effects of the new legislation. The guidance, when issued, could require the Company to change previously reported information. THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (Dollars in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to market risk related to interest rates and foreign currencies. Interest Rates At December 31, 2003, a significant portion of the Companys debt obligations were at fixed interest rates. Accordingly, assuming the fixed rate debt is not refinanced, there would be no impact on interest expense or cash flow from either a 10% increase or decrease in market rates of interest. The fair market value of the debt obligations would decrease by $18.9 if market rates were to increase by 10% and would increase by $19.2 if market rates were to decrease by 10%. For that portion of the debt that is maintained at variable rates, based on amounts and rates outstanding at December 31, 2003, the change in interest expense and cash flow from a 10% change in rates would be negligible. Foreign Currencies The Company faces two risks related to foreign currency exchange: translation risk and transaction risk. Amounts invested in the Companys foreign operations are translated into US Dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the stockholders equity section of the balance sheet. The Companys foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in currencies other than the US Dollar. Since the functional currency of the Companys foreign operations is generally the local currency, foreign currency translation of the balance sheet is reflected as a component of stockholders equity and does not impact operating results. Revenues and expenses in foreign currencies translate into varying amounts of US Dollars depending upon whether the US Dollar weakens or strengthens against other currencies. Therefore, changes in exchange rates may negatively affect the Compa nys consolidated revenues and expenses (as expressed in US Dollars) from foreign operations. Currency transaction gains or losses arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in results of operations and were not significant in 2001, 2002 and 2003. The Company has not entered into a material amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
