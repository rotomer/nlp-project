OVERVIEW Our Business We are one of the worlds largest advertising and marketing services companies, comprised of hundreds of communication agencies around the world that deliver custom marketing solutions on behalf of our clients. Our agencies cover the spectrum of marketing disciplines and specialties, from traditional services such as consumer advertising and direct marketing, to services such as experiential marketing and branded entertainment. With offices in approximately 130 countries and approximately 43,700 employees, our agencies work with our clients to create global and local marketing campaigns that cross borders and media. These marketing programs seek to build brands, influence consumer behavior and sell products. We have organized our agencies into five global operating divisions and a group of leading stand alone agencies. Four of these divisions, McCann WorldGroup (McCann), The FCB Group (FCB), The Lowe Group (Lowe) and Draft Worldwide (Draft), provide a distinct, comprehensive array of global communications and marketing services. The fifth global operating division, The Constituent Management 17 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Group (CMG), including Weber Shandwick, FutureBrand, DeVries, Golin Harris, Jack Morton and Octagon Worldwide (Octagon), provides clients with diversified services, including public relations, meeting and event production, sports and entertainment marketing, corporate and brand identity and strategic marketing consulting. Our leading stand alone agencies provide clients with a full range of advertising and marketing services. These agencies partner with our global operating groups as needed, and include Deutsch, Campbell Ewald, Hill Holliday and The Martin Agency. We believe this organizational structure allows us to provide comprehensive solutions for clients, enables stronger financial and operational growth opportunities and allows us to improve operating efficiencies within our organization. We practice a decentralized management style, providing agency management with a great deal of operational autonomy, while holding them broadly responsible for their agencies financial and operational performance. For financial reporting purposes, we have three reportable segments. The largest segment, Integrated Agency Networks (IAN), is comprised of McCann, FCB, Lowe, Draft and our leading stand alone agencies. CMG comprises our second reportable segment. Our third reportable segment was comprised of our Motorsports operations, which were sold during 2004. IAN also includes our media agencies, Initiative Media and Magna Global which are part of our leading stand alone agencies, and Universal McCann which is part of McCann. Our media offering creates integrated communications solutions, with services that cover the full spectrum of communication needs, including channel strategy, planning and buying, consulting, production, and post campaign analysis. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Business Drivers We generate revenue from fees and commissions. Our primary sources of revenue are the planning and execution of advertising programs in various media and the planning and execution of other marketing and communications programs. The fee and commission amounts vary depending on the level of client spending or the time we incur performing the specific services required by a client plus the gross up of other costs. Historically, revenues for creation, planning and placement of advertising were derived predominantly from commissions. These services are now being provided on a negotiated fee basis and to a lesser extent on a commission basis. Fees are usually calculated to reflect hourly rates plus proportional overhead and a mark up. Many clients are now including an incentive compensation component in their total compensation package. This provides added revenue based on achieving mutually agreed upon metrics within specified time periods. Commissions are earned based on services provided, and are usually based as a percentage or fee over the total cost and expense to complete the assignment. They can also be derived when clients pay us the gross rate billed by media and we pay for media at a lower net rate. The difference is the commission that is earned by us, which is either retained in total or shared with the client depending on the nature of the services agreement. We pay the media charges with respect to contracts for advertising time or space that we place on behalf of our clients. To reduce our risk from a clients non payment, we generally pay media charges only after we have received funds from our clients. Generally, we act as the clients agent rather than the primary obligor. In some instances we agree with the media provider that we will only be liable to pay the media after the client has paid us for the media charges. We also generate revenue in negotiated fees from our public relations, sales promotion, event marketing, and sports and entertainment marketing and corporate and brand identity services. 18 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Our revenue is dependent upon the advertising, marketing and corporate communications requirements of our clients and tends to be higher in the second half of the calendar year as a result of the holiday season and lower in the first half as a result of the post holiday slow down of client activity. Our agencies generally have written contracts with their clients which dictate proportional performance, monthly basis or completed contract revenue recognition. Fee revenue recognized on a completed contract basis also contributes to the higher seasonal revenues experienced in the fourth quarter due to the majority of our contracts ending at December 31. As is customary in the industry, these contracts provide for termination by either party on relatively short notice, usually 90 days. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on the revenue recognition accounting policies. Our revenue is driven by our ability to maintain and grow existing business as well as generate new business. Our business is directly affected by economic conditions in the industries and regions we serve and by the marketing and advertising requirements and practices of our clients and potential clients. When economic conditions decline, companies generally decrease advertising and marketing budgets, and it becomes more difficult to achieve profitability. Our business is highly competitive, which tends to mitigate our pricing power and that of our competition. We believe that expanding the range of services we provide to our key clients is critical to our continued growth. We are focused on strengthening our collaboration across agencies, which we believe will increase our ability to better service existing clients and win new clients. 2004 Performance The primary focus of our business analysis is on operating performance specifically, changes in revenues and operating expenses. We analyze the increase or decrease in revenue by reviewing the components of the change, including: the impact of foreign currency rate changes, the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, and the balance, which we refer to as organic revenue change. As economic conditions and demand for our services can vary between geographic regions, we also analyze revenues by domestic and international sources. Our operating expenses are in two primary categories: salaries and related expenses, and office and general expenses. As with revenue, we review the following components: impact of foreign currency rate changes, impact of acquisitions and divestitures, and the organic component of the change. Salaries and related expenses tend to fluctuate with changes in revenues and are measured as a percentage of revenues. Office and general expenses, which have both a fixed and variable component, tend not to vary as much with revenue. As a part of our restatement process we issued accounting guidance to our agencies to strengthen adherence to Staff Accounting Bulletin 104, Revenue Recognition. Our policies are further explained in our revenue recognition policy discussion in both managements discussion and analysis and the footnotes. This accounting guidance governs the timing of when revenue is recognized. Accordingly, if work is being performed in a given quarter but there is insufficient evidence on an arrangement, the related revenue would be deferred to a future quarter when the evidence is obtained. However, our costs of services, on the other hand, are primarily expensed as incurred, except that incremental direct costs may be deferred under a significant long term contract until complete. With revenue being deferred until completion of the contract and costs primarily expensed as incurred, this will have a negative impact on our operating margin until the revenue can be recognized and in the period of revenue recognition. While this will not affect cash flow, it will affect organic revenue growth and margins and this effect is likely to be greater in comparing quarters than in comparing full years. 19 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) In addition, the Company also issued guidelines to our agencies units to strengthen adherence to EITF 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent. This accounting guidance governs when revenues should be recorded net of external media or production cost and when it should be recorded gross. The guidance is very contract specific and can vary period to period and agency by agency. While this accounting will not affect cash flow and profitability, it could affect changes in revenue growth. Our financial performance over the past several years has lagged behind that of our industry peers, due to lower revenue growth, as well as impairment and restructuring charges. We are working to improve our margins by restoring consistent revenue growth and controlling expenses. Our success in doing so in 2004 was significantly limited by the cost of business priorities that we consider urgent, such as improving our internal control over financial reporting, consolidating financial back office activities by creating a shared service center, upgrading our information technology systems infrastructure, professional fees, and exiting the Motorsports business. With the exception of salary related expenses which have increased due to our additional headcount, we believe that most other costs associated with these priorities are transitional in nature, but do not expect a decrease in total office and general expense over the short term due to the significant professional fees required as a result of our internal control weaknesses. The cost of remedying our internal control weaknesses will be significant in 2005 and 2006. We have indicated that accelerating organic revenue growth and improving operating margin are key corporate metrics. The following are the performance priorities and basis of analysis of our financial and operating performance: We seek to accelerate organic revenue growth by strengthening collaboration among our agencies and increasing the number of marketing services used by each client. We have established a supplemental incentive plan, expanded internal tools and resources, and heightened internal communications aimed at encouraging collaboration. We analyze our performance by calculating the percentage increase in revenue related to organic growth between comparable periods. We seek to improve operating margin by increasing revenue and by controlling salaries and related expenses, as well as office and general expenses. We analyze our performance by comparing revenue to prior periods and measuring salaries and related expenses, as well as office and general expenses, as a percentage of revenue. We define operating margin as operating income divided by reported revenue. For the Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 Organic revenue growth percentage (vs. prior year) 1.2 % (3.0 )% Operating margin percentage (1.5 )% (0.5 )% Salaries and related expenses as a percentage of revenue 58.5 % 56.8 % Office and general expenses as a percentage revenue 35.2 % 36.1 % Organic revenue growth improved in 2004, but we have not yet reached our goal of matching peer group organic growth. Domestic organic revenue growth was 2.5%, while international revenue decreased by 0.4% on an organic basis. Operating margin during 2004 was impacted by cost increases and a number of charges. During 2004, we recorded asset impairments of $322.2, restructuring charges of $62.2 and contract termination charges related to the Motorsports business of $113.6, which together comprised a $31.1 increase in such charges as compared to 2003. Operating margin in 2003 was impacted by approximately $294.0 of asset 20 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) impairment charges and $172.9 of restructuring charges. Additionally, in 2004, we recorded cost increases for salaries and related expenses of $232.9 and professional fees of $87.6. Significant 2004 Activity and Subsequent Events Income Statement Long lived asset impairment charges of $322.2 were recorded, including $311.9 of goodwill impairments primarily at CMG, Lowe and Draft as a result of our annual impairment review. These were due to a decline in revenue, coupled with a drop in industry valuation metrics. Refer to Note 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Motorsports contract termination charges of $113.6 were recorded related to agreements with the British Racing Drivers Club and the Formula One Administration Limited, which released us from certain guarantees and lease obligations. We have exited this business and do not anticipate any additional material charges. Refer to Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Restructuring charges of $62.2 were recorded related to severance and termination costs and lease termination and other exit costs under the 2003 and 2001 restructuring programs, net of $32.0 of reserve reversals due to changes in our original estimates. These charges were primarily the result of vacating properties and employment terminations executed during 2004. Reserve reversals recorded during 2004 were the result of changes in managements estimates impacted by events and circumstances which arose during the period. Refer to Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Investment impairment charges of $63.4 were recorded primarily related to an investment in an unconsolidated German advertising agency as a result of a decrease in projected operating results. Refer to Note 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Shareholder litigation settlement resulted in a reduction of expenses of $32.5, related to proceeds received of $20.0 from insurance policies (which a receivable had not previously accounted for) and the reversal of $12.5 in settlement reserves due to the decrease in share price between the tentative settlement date and the final settlement date as the share settlement was a fixed number. Refer to Note 19 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Prepayment penalty charges of $9.8 were recorded on the early retirement of $250.0 of the 7.875% Senior Unsecured Notes due in 2005. Refer to Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. A total charge of $236.0 was recorded to increase our valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets primarily relating to foreign net operating loss carry forwards. Refer to Note 10 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Total salaries and related expenses and professional fees increased by approximately $232.9 and $87.6. These related primarily to increased headcount, the audit of our restated financial statements and the requirements of the Sarbanes Oxley Act and are discussed in Consolidated Results of Operations 2004 Compared to 2003. Financing Activities We replaced our previous 364 day and five year revolving credit facilities totaling $875.0, with 364 Day and Three Year Revolving Credit Facilities, maturing May 2007, totaling $700.0. 21 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) We completed the issuance and sale of $250.0 aggregate principal amount of 5.40% Senior Unsecured Notes maturing 2009 and $350.0 aggregate principal amount of 6.25% Senior Unsecured Notes maturing 2014. Proceeds from the two debt issuances were used to pay down $250.0 of the 7.875% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2005 and redeem the $361.0 aggregate principal amount of 1.87% Convertible Subordinated Notes in December 2004. All of the 1.80% Convertible Subordinate Notes were redeemed for approximately $246.0 in January 2004 using net proceeds from offerings of $246.0 of convertible preferred stock and common stock in late 2003. Subsequent to 2004 We entered into waivers and amendments to our 364 Day and Three year Revolving Credit Facilities, to waive any breach or default related to not complying in a timely manner with our reporting requirements. In addition, financial covenants with respect to our interest coverage ratio, debt to EBITDA ratio and minimum EBITDA for certain fiscal quarters were amended. In March 2005, we completed a consent solicitation to amend the indentures governing five series of our outstanding public debt to provide that our failure to timely file our SEC reports would not constitute a default under the indentures until September 30, 2005. In July 2005, we completed the issuance and sale of $250.0 Floating Rate Notes maturing 2008. We used the proceeds to redeem the 7.875% Senior Unsecured Notes maturing October 2005 with an aggregate principal amount of $250.0. Our Three Year Revolving Credit Facility was amended and restated as of September 27, 2005. The effectiveness of the amended Three Year Revolving Credit Facility is subject to certain conditions. The amendment revises certain of the negative and financial covenants under our existing Three Year Revolving Credit Facility. The 364 day Revolving Credit Facility will expire on September 30, 2005. Management Changes In February 2004, Stephen Gatfield was hired as our Executive Vice President, Global Operations and Innovation. In May 2004, Nick Cyprus was hired as our Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. In June 2004, Robert Thompson was named our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. He resigned in July 2005. In July 2004, Michael Roth was hired as our Executive Chairman. In November 2004, Tony Wright was hired as Chief Executive Officer of Lowe Worldwide and Ed Powers was named Chief Operating Officer of Lowe Worldwide. Subsequent to 2004 In January 2005, Michael Roth was named our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Concurrently, David Bell, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer since 2003 was named Co Chairman. 22 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) In May 2005, Steve Centrillo was hired as our Executive Vice President and Chief Growth Officer. In May 2005, Mark Rosenthal was hired as our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Media Operations. In June 2005, Steve Blamer, who had been hired as Chief Executive Officer of Foote, Cone and Belding Worldwide in December 2004, assumed his responsibility following the expiration of a prior non compete agreement. In July 2005, Frank Mergenthaler was hired as our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Results of Operations 2004 Compared to 2003 REVENUE The components of the 2004 change were as follows: Total Domestic International $ % Change $ % Change % of Total $ % Change % of Total 2003 (Restated) $ 6,161.7 $ 3,459.3 56.1 % $ 2,702.4 43.9 % Foreign currency changes 237.7 3.9 % 237.7 8.8 % Net acquisitions/divestitures (88.0 ) (1.4 )% (35.4 ) (1.0 )% (52.6 ) (1.9 )% Organic 75.6 1.2 % 85.3 2.5 % (9.7 ) (0.4 )% Total change 225.3 3.7 % 49.9 1.4 % 175.4 6.5 % 2004 $ 6,387.0 $ 3,509.2 54.9 % $ 2,877.8 45.1 % For the year ended December 31, 2004, consolidated revenues increased $225.3, or 3.7%, as compared to 2003, which was attributable to foreign currency exchange rate changes of $237.7 and organic revenue growth of $75.6, partially offset by the effect of net acquisitions and divestitures of $88.0. The increase due to foreign currency changes was attributable to the strengthening of the Euro and Pound Sterling in relation to the US Dollar. The net effect of acquisitions and divestitures resulted largely from the sale of the Motorsports business during 2004. During 2004, organic revenue change of 75.6, or 1.2%, was driven by an increase at IAN, partially offset by decrease at CMG. The increase at IAN was a result of client wins, additional business from existing clients, and overall growth in domestic markets. The decrease at CMG was as a result of weakness in demand for branding and sports marketing services, partially offset by growth in the public relations business. 23 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC.

During 2004, salaries and related expenses increased to 58.5% of revenues, compared to 56.8% in 2003. In 2004, salaries and related expenses increased $144.0, excluding the increase related to foreign currency exchange rate changes of $129.4 and a decrease related to net acquisitions and divestitures of $40.5. Salaries and related expenses were impacted by changes in foreign currency rates, attributable to the strengthening of the Euro and Pound Sterling in relation to the US Dollar. The increase due to foreign currency rate changes was partially offset by the impact of net acquisitions and divestitures activity, which resulted largely from the sale of the Motorsports business during 2004. The increase in salaries and related expenses, excluding the impact of foreign currency and net acquisitions and divestitures, was primarily the result of increases in employee headcount at certain locations and increased utilization of temporary and freelance staffing and higher performance incentive expense at a number of agencies that experienced an increase in operating results. Furthermore, during the year, we hired additional personnel within our operating units and in the corporate group to support our back office processes, including accounting and shared services initiatives, as well as our ongoing efforts in achieving Sarbanes Oxley compliance. We reduced staff at certain operations after client accounts were 24 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) lost. Cost savings associated with headcount reductions were partially offset by increased severance costs associate with the headcount reductions. Office and General Expenses The components of the 2004 change were as follows: Total % of $ % Change Revenue 2003 (Restated) $ 2,225.7 36.1 % Foreign currency changes 102.9 4.6 % Net acquisitions/divestitures (63.9 ) (2.9 )% Organic (14.9 ) (0.7 )% Total change 24.1 1.1 % 2004 $ 2,249.8 35.2 % Office and general expenses primarily consists of rent, office and equipment, depreciation, professional fees, other overhead expenses and certain out of pocket expenses related to our revenue. During 2004, office and general expenses decreased to 35.2% of revenues, compared to 36.1% in 2003. In 2004, office and general expenses decreased $14.9, excluding the increase related to foreign currency exchange rate changes of $102.9 and a decrease related to net acquisitions and divestitures of $63.9. Office and general expenses were impacted by changes in foreign currency rates, attributable to the strengthening of the Euro and Pound Sterling in relation to the US Dollar. The increase due to foreign currency rate changes was offset by the impact of net acquisitions and divestitures activity, which resulted largely from the sale of the Motorsports business in 2004. The decrease in office and general expenses, excluding the impact of foreign currency and net acquisition and divestitures activity, was primarily the result of lower occupancy and overhead costs, and a decrease related to charges recorded by CMG in 2003 to secure certain sports television rights. These decreases, however, were partially offset by increases driven by a rise in professional fees as part of our ongoing efforts in achieving Sarbanes Oxley compliance, and the development of information technology systems and processes related to our shared services initiatives. 25 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Restructuring Charges During 2004 and 2003, we recorded net expense related to lease termination and other exit costs and severance and termination costs for the 2003 and 2001 restructuring programs of $62.2 and $172.9, respectively, which included the impact of adjustments resulting from changes in managements estimates as described below. A summary of the net (income) and expense by segment is as follows: Lease Termination and Other Exit Costs Severance and Termination Costs 2003 2001 2003 2001 Program Program Total Program Program Total Total 2004 Net (Income) Expense IAN $ 40.3 $ (7.3 ) $ 33.0 $ 14.1 $ (4.3 ) $ 9.8 $ 42.8 CMG 8.1 4.0 12.1 5.1 (0.7 ) 4.4 16.5 Corporate 3.7 (1.0 ) 2.7 0.3 (0.1 ) 0.2 2.9 Total $ 52.1 $ (4.3 ) $ 47.8 $ 19.5 $ (5.1 ) $ 14.4 $ 62.2 2003 Net (Income) Expense (Restated) IAN $ 23.1 $ 8.8 $ 31.9 $ 106.6 $ (0.1 ) $ 106.5 $ 138.4 CMG 12.7 6.1 18.8 15.7 15.7 34.5 Motorsports 0.4 0.4 0.4 Corporate (2.2 ) (1.3 ) (3.5 ) 3.1 3.1 (0.4 ) Total $ 33.6 $ 13.6 $ 47.2 $ 125.8 $ (0.1 ) $ 125.7 $ 172.9 Lease termination and other exit costs 2003 Program Net expense related to lease termination and other exit costs recorded for 2004 were $52.1, comprised of charges of $67.8, partially offset by adjustments to management estimates of $15.7. For 2003, net expense was $33.6, comprised of charges of $41.6 offset by similar adjustments of $8.0. These charges related to vacating 43 and 55 offices in 2004 and 2003, respectively, located primarily in the US and Europe. Charges were recorded at net present value and were net of estimated sublease rental income. The discount related to lease terminations is being amortized over the expected remaining term of the related lease. In addition to amounts recorded as restructuring charges, we recorded charges of $11.1 and $16.5 during 2004 and 2003, respectively, related to the accelerated amortization of leasehold improvements on properties included in the 2003 program. These charges were included in office and general expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 2001 Program Net (income) and expense related to lease termination and other exit costs of ($4.3) and $13.6, recorded for 2004 and 2003, respectively, resulted exclusively from the impact of adjustments to management estimates. The 2001 program resulted in approximately 180 offices being vacated worldwide. 26 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Adjustments to Estimates Lease termination and other exit costs for the 2003 and 2001 restructuring programs included the net impact of adjustments for changes in management estimates to decrease the restructuring reserves by $20.0 in 2004 and increase the reserve by $5.6 in 2003. Adjustments to management estimates of net lease obligations included both increases and decreases to the restructuring reserve balance as a result of several factors. The significant factors were our negotiation of terms upon the exit of leased properties, changes in sublease rental income and utilization of previously vacated properties by certain of our agencies due to improved economic conditions in certain markets, all of which occurred during the period recorded. Severance and termination costs 2003 Program Net expense related to severance and termination costs of $19.5 recorded for 2004 were comprised of charges of $26.4, partially offset by adjustments to management estimates of $6.9. For 2003, net expenses of $125.8 was comprised of charges of $133.7 offset by adjustments of $7.9. These charges related to a worldwide workforce reduction of approximately 400 employees in 2004 and 2,900 in 2003. The restructuring program affected employee groups across all levels and functions, including executive, regional and account management and administrative, creative and media production personnel. The majority of the severance charges related to the US and Europe, with the remainder in Asia and Latin America. 2001 Program Net income related to severance and termination costs of $5.1 and $0.1 recorded for 2004 and 2003, respectively, resulted exclusively from the impact of adjustments to management estimates. The 2001 program related to a worldwide reduction of approximately 7,000 employees. Adjustments to Estimates Severance and termination costs associated with the 2003 and 2001 restructuring programs included the net impact of adjustments for changes in management estimates to decrease the restructuring reserves by $12.0 in 2004 and $8.0 in 2003. Adjustments to management estimates of severance and termination obligations included both increases and decreases to the restructuring reserve balance as a result of several factors. The significant factors were the decrease in the number of terminated employees, change in amounts paid to terminated employees and change in estimates of taxes and restricted stock payments related to terminated employees, all of which occurred in the period recorded. For additional information, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Long Lived Asset Impairment and Other Charges Long lived assets include land, buildings, equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets. Buildings, equipment and other intangible assets with finite lives are depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over their respective estimated useful lives. At least annually, we review all long lived assets for impairment. When necessary, we record an impairment charge for the amount that the carrying value exceeds the fair value. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for fair value determination and impairment testing methodologies. 27 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) The following table summarizes long lived asset impairment and other charges: For the Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 (Restated) Motor Motor IAN CMG sports Total IAN CMG sports Total Goodwill impairment $ 220.2 $ 91.7 $ $ 311.9 $ 0.4 $ 218.0 $ $ 218.4 Fixed asset impairment 2.0 0.4 3.0 5.4 2.3 63.8 66.1 Other 4.9 4.9 9.1 0.4 9.5 Total $ 227.1 $ 92.1 $ 3.0 $ 322.2 $ 11.8 $ 218.4 $ 63.8 $ 294.0 The long lived asset impairment charges recorded in 2004 and 2003 are due to the following: 2004 Impairments IAN During the third quarter of 2004, we recorded goodwill impairment charges of approximately $220.2 at The Partnership reporting unit, which was comprised of, Lowe Worldwide, Draft Worldwide, Mullen, Dailey & Associates and BGW. Our long term projections showed previously unanticipated declines in discounted future operating cash flows due to recent client losses, reduced client spending, and declining industry valuation metrics. These discounted future operating cash flow projections caused the estimated fair value of The Partnership to be less than the book value. The Partnership was subsequently disbanded in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the remaining goodwill was allocated based on the relative fair value of the agencies at the time of disbandment. We considered the possibility of impairment at Lowe and Draft, the two largest agencies previously within The Partnership. However, at this point we have determined that there is no discernible trigger event for an additional impairment. We will continue to monitor the results and, should operating performance worsen, particularly at Lowe we may conclude that a trigger event has occurred and impairment may then be required. CMG As a result of the annual impairment review, a goodwill impairment charge of $91.7 was recorded at our CMG reporting unit, which is comprised of Weber Shandwick, Golin Harris, DeVries Public Relations and FutureBrand. The fair value of CMG was adversely affected by declining industry market valuation metrics, specifically, a decrease in the EBITDA multiples used in the underlying valuation calculations. The impact of the lower EBITDA multiples caused the calculated fair value of CMG goodwill to be less than the related book value. 2003 Impairments CMG We recorded an impairment charge of $218.0 to reduce the carrying value of goodwill at Octagon. The Octagon impairment charge reflects the reduction of the units fair value due principally to poor financial performance in 2003 and lower than expected future financial performance. Specifically, there was significant pricing pressure in both overseas and domestic TV rights distribution, declining fees from athlete representation, and lower than anticipated proceeds from committed future events, including ticket revenue and sponsorship. Motorsports We recorded fixed asset impairment charges of $63.8, consisting of $38.0 in connection with the sale of a business comprised of the four owned auto racing circuits and $9.6 related to the sales of other Motorsports entities and a fixed asset impairment of $16.2 for outlays that Motorsports was contractually required to spend to improve the racing facilities. 28 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC.

Motorsports Contract Termination Costs As discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, during the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded a pretax charge of $113.6 related to a series of agreements with the British Racing Drivers Club and Formula One Administration Limited which release us from certain guarantees and lease obligations in the United Kingdom. We have exited this business and do not anticipate any additional material charges. EXPENSE AND OTHER INCOME For the Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 $ Change % Change (Restated) Interest expense $ (172.0 ) $ (207.0 ) $ 35.0 (16.9 )% Debt prepayment penalty (9.8 ) (24.8 ) 15.0 (60.5 )% Interest income 50.7 39.3 11.4 29.0 % Investment impairments (63.4 ) (71.5 ) 8.1 (11.3 )% Litigation charges 32.5 (127.6 ) 160.1 (125.5 )% Other income (expense) (10.7 ) 50.3 (61.0 ) (121.3 )% Total $ (172.7 ) $ (341.3 ) $ 168.6 (49.4 )% Interest Expense The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the redemption of our $250.0 1.80% Convertible Subordinate Notes in January 2004 and the early redemption of our borrowings under the Prudential Agreements during the third quarter of 2003. Debt Prepayment Penalty During the fourth quarter of 2004, a prepayment penalty of $9.8 was recorded related to the early retirement of $250.0 of the 7.875% Senior Unsecured Notes due in 2005. During the third quarter of 2003, we repaid our borrowings under the Prudential Agreements, repaying $142.5 principal amount and incurring a prepayment penalty of $24.8. Interest Income The increase in interest income in 2004 was primarily due to an increase in our average balance of short term investments held during the year, as well as an increase in interest rates when compared to 2003. Investment Impairments During 2004, we recorded investment impairment charges of $63.4. The principal component of the charge was $50.9 related to the impairment of an unconsolidated investment in a German advertising agency, Springer & Jacoby, as a result of a decrease in projected operating results. Additionally, we recorded impairment charges of $4.7 related to unconsolidated affiliates primarily in Israel, Brazil, Japan and India, and $7.8 related to several other available for sale investments. 29 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) During 2003, we recorded $71.5 of investment impairment charges related to 20 investments. The charge related principally to investments in Fortune Promo 7 of $9.5 in the Middle East, Koch Tavares of $7.7 in Latin America, Daiko of $10.0 in Japan, Roche Macaulay Partners of $7.9 in Canada, Springer & Jacoby of $6.5 in Germany and Global Hue of $6.9 in the US. The majority of the impairment charges resulted from deteriorating economic conditions in the countries in which the agencies operate, due to the loss of one or several key clients. Litigation Charges During 2004, with the settlement approved we received $20.0 from insurance proceeds which we recorded as a reduction in litigation charges because we had not previously established a receivable. We also recorded a reduction of 12.5 relating to a decrease in the share price between the tentative settlement date and the final settlement date. During 2003, we recorded litigation charges of $127.6 for various legal matters, of which $115.0 related to a then tentative settlement of the class action shareholder suits discussed in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Under the terms of the settlement, we were required to pay $20.0 in cash and issue 6.6 shares of our common stock. The ultimate amount of the litigation charge related to the settlement was to be dependent upon our stock price at the time of the final settlement (as the number of shares was fixed in the agreement), which took place in December 2004. Other Income (Expense) In 2004, the $10.7 other expense included $18.2 of net losses on the sale of 19 agencies. The losses related primarily to the sale of Transworld Marketing, a US based promotions agency, which resulted in a loss of $8.6, and a $6.2 loss for the final liquidation of the Motorsports investment. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Motorsports disposition. These net losses were offset by gains of sale of Modem Media shares and other available for sale securities and miscellaneous investment income of $0.8 and $6.7, respectively. In 2003, other income of $50.3 included approximately 11.0 shares of Modem Media sold for net proceeds of approximately $57.0, resulting in a pre tax gain of $30.3. We also sold all of the approximately 11.7 shares of Taylor Nelson Sofres plc (TNS) we had acquired through the sale of NFO WorldGroup Inc. (NFO), for approximately $42.0 of net proceeds. A pre tax gain of $13.3 was recorded. OTHER ITEMS Income Taxes For the Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 (Restated) Provision for income taxes $ 262.2 $ 242.7 Effective tax rate 98.2 % 65.1 % Our effective tax rate was negatively impacted in both 2004 and 2003 by the establishment of valuation allowances, as described below, restructuring charges, and non deductible long lived asset impairment charges. In 2004, our effective tax rate was also impacted by pretax charges and related tax benefits resulting from the Motorsports contract termination costs. The difference between the effective tax 30 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) rate and the statutory federal rate of 35% is also due to state and local taxes and the effect of non US operations. Valuation Allowance Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, we are required, on a quarterly basis, to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets. SFAS No. 109 requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. In circumstances where there is sufficient negative evidence, establishment of valuation allowance must be considered. We believe that cumulative losses in the most recent three year period represent sufficient negative evidence under the provisions of SFAS No. 109 and, as a result, we determined that certain of our deferred tax assets required the establishment of a valuation allowance. The deferred tax assets for which an allowance was established relate primarily to foreign net operating and US capital loss carryforwards. During 2004, the valuation allowance of $236.0 was established in continuing operations on existing deferred tax assets and current year losses with no benefit. The total valuation allowance as of December 31, 2004 was $488.6. Our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of offsetting decreases in our valuation allowance. The establishment or reversal of valuation allowances could have a significant negative or positive impact on future earnings. During 2003, the valuation allowance of $111.4 was established in continuing operations on existing deferred tax assets and losses in 2003 with no benefit. In addition, $3.7 of valuation allowances were established for certain US capital and other loss carryforwards. The total valuation allowance as of December 31, 2003 was $252.6. For additional information, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Minority Interest and Unconsolidated Affiliates For the Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 (Restated) Income applicable to minority interests, net of tax $ (21.5 ) $ (27.0 ) Equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates, net of tax $ 5.8 $ 2.4 The decrease in income applicable to minority interests was primarily due to lower earnings of majority owned international businesses, primarily in Europe, and the sale of majority owned businesses in Latin America. The increase in equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates was primarily due to the impact of prior year losses at Modem Media, which was sold in 2003, and the impact of higher 2003 losses at an unconsolidated investment in Brazil and a US based sports and entertainment event business. 31 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC.

These changes were partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $288.1, which includes Motorsports contract termination costs of $113.6. Income from Discontinued Operations Recorded within income from discontinued operations is the impact of our sale of NFO, our research unit, to TNS in 2003. NFO is classified in discontinued operations and the results of operations and cash flows of NFO have been removed from our results of continuing operations and cash flows for all periods. During 2003, we completed the sale of NFO for $415.6 in cash ($376.7, net of cash sold and expenses) and approximately 11.7 shares of TNS stock. We sold the TNS stock in December 2003 for net proceeds of approximately $42.0. As a result of the sale of NFO, we recognized a pre tax gain of $99.1 ($89.1, net of tax) in the third quarter of 2003 after certain post closing adjustments. The TNS shares sold resulted in a pre tax gain of $13.3. In July 2004, we received an additional $10.0 ($6.5, net of tax) from TNS as a final payment. For additional information, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Segment Results of Operations 2004 Compared to 2003 As discussed in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have three reporting segments: our operating divisions, IAN, CMG and Motorsports. We also report results for the corporate group. The profitability measure employed by our chief operating decision makers for allocating resources to operating divisions and assessing operating division performance is operating profit. For this purpose, amounts reported as segment operating profit exclude the impact of restructuring and impairment charges, as we do not consider these charges when assessing operating division performance or when allocating resources. Segment profit excludes interest income and expense, debt repayment penalties, investment impairments, litigation charges and other non operating income. The Motorsports business was sold during 2004. Other than long lived asset impairment and contract termination costs, the operating results of Motorsports are 32 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) For the year ended December 31, 2004, IAN experienced net increases in revenue as compared to 2003 by $258.7, or 5.0%, which was comprised of organic revenue growth of $104.6 and an increase in foreign currency exchange rate changes of $194.1, partially offset by a decrease attributable to net acquisitions and divestitures of $40.0. The increase due to foreign currency was primarily attributable to the strengthening of the Euro and Pound Sterling in relation to the US Dollar. This increase was partially offset by the net effect of divestitures and acquisitions, primarily related to the sale of some small businesses at McCann, Lowe, and Draft, and increased equity ownership in two small businesses at Lowe. The organic revenue increase was primarily driven by increases at McCann, Draft, FCB, and Deutsch, partially offset by decreases at Lowe. McCann experienced an organic revenue increase as a result of new client wins and increased business from existing clients, primarily in our US and European agencies. Draft experienced an organic revenue increase mainly in the US due to client wins and increased business by existing clients, partially offset by poor economic conditions in Europe and the closing of its field marketing business in 2003. FCB experienced an organic revenue increase due to increased spending by existing clients and client wins, partially offset by a decrease in revenues as a result of clients lost during the year, mainly in the US and Germany. Deutsch experienced organic revenue growth stemming from new client wins and increased business from existing clients. Lowe experienced an organic revenue decline, primarily the result of client losses and reduced business from major multinational clients. SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME For the Years Ended December 31, 2003 2004 (Restated) $ Change % Change Segment operating income $ 577.2 $ 551.9 $ 25.3 4.6 % Operating margin 10.7 % 10.7 % For the year ended December 31, 2004, IAN operating income increased by $25.3, or 4.6%, which was a result of an increase in revenue of $258.7, offset by an increase in salaries and related expenses of $202.8 and increased office and general expenses of $30.6. Segment operating income growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency and net effects of acquisitions and divestitures, was primarily driven by increases at McCann, and to a lesser extent, Deutsch and FCB, partially offset by a decrease at Lowe. McCann experienced an organic revenue increase with essentially flat operating expenses. Operating expenses at McCann reflect higher compensation costs to support new client business and an increase in contractual compensation payments made to individuals for the achievement of specific operational targets as part of certain prior year acquisition agreements. These increases were offset by lower depreciation expense incurred as a result of limited capital purchases, as well as a decrease in bad debt expense due to improved collection of accounts receivable. Deutsch and FCB experienced increases as a result of organic revenue increases, partially offset by an increase in operating expense related to increased employee incentives and additional salaries and freelance costs to support the increase in business activity. The decrease in operating income at Lowe was the result of a significant organic revenue decrease partially offset by moderate decreases in operating expenses. The decrease in operating expenses at Lowe was the result of lower headcount and reduced office space requirements. 34 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC.

The increase due to foreign currency exchange rate was primarily attributable to the strengthening of the Euro and Pound Sterling in relation to the US Dollar. Net effects of acquisitions and divestitures primarily related to the disposition of three small businesses in 2004 and two small businesses in 2003. The organic revenue decline was primarily driven by a decrease in the branding and sports marketing businesses, offset slightly by growth in our public relations business. SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME For the Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 $ Change % Change (Restated) Segment operating income $ 83.7 $ 55.7 $ 28.0 50.3 % Operating margin 8.9 % 5.9 % For the year ended December 31, 2004, CMG operating income increased by $28.0, or 50.3%, which was the result of a $46.6 decrease in office and general expenses, offset by a $6.6 decrease in revenue and $12.0 increase in salary and related expenses. Segment operating income growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency and net effects of acquisition and divestitures, was primarily driven by an increase at sports marketing business, partially offset by an increase in CMG corporate office expense. While there was organic revenue decrease sports marketing business operating expenses decreased at a higher rate than organic revenue decrease due to a decrease related to charges recorded by CMG in 2003 to secure certain sports television rights. Increased corporate office expenses was driven by higher expenses recorded for performance incentive awards as a result of improved revenue performance and additional accruals for post employment and other benefits for management personnel. 35 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) CORPORATE AND OTHER Amounts in corporate and other include corporate office expenses and shared service center expenses, as well as certain other centrally managed expenses which are not allocated to operating divisions. The following significant expenses are included in corporate and other: For the Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 $ Change % Change (Restated) Salaries and related expenses $ 151.2 $ 129.0 $ 22.2 17.2 % Professional fees 143.4 49.8 93.6 188.0 % Rent and depreciation 38.0 30.5 7.5 24.6 % Corporate Insurance 29.7 26.5 3.2 12.1 % Bank fees 2.8 1.6 1.2 75.0 % Other 11.4 9.3 2.1 22.6 % Expenses allocated to operating divisions (133.3 ) (118.1 ) (15.2 ) (12.9 )% Total corporate and other $ 243.2 $ 128.6 $ 114.6 89.1 % Salaries, benefits and related expenses include salaries, pension, the cost of medical, dental and other insurance coverage and other compensation related expenses for corporate office employees. Professional fees include costs related to the preparation for Sarbanes Oxley Act compliance, the financial statement audit, legal counsel, information technology and other consulting fees. Rent and depreciation includes rental expense and depreciation of leasehold improvements for properties occupied by corporate office employees. Bank fees relates to our debt and credit facilities. The amounts of expenses allocated to operating segments are calculated monthly based on a formula that uses the weighted average net revenues of the operating unit. The majority of the corporate costs including most of the costs associated with internal control remediation and compliance are not allocated back to operating segments. The increase in corporate and other expense of $114.6 or 89.1% is primarily related to the increase in professional fees and salaries and related expenses. The increase in professional fees primarily resulted from costs associated with complying with the requirements of the Sarbanes Oxley Act. We also incurred increased expenses for the development of systems and processes related to our shared services initiatives. The increase in payroll related expenses is due mainly to an increase in the use of temporary employees in order to enhance monitoring controls at the corporate office as well as to support our significant ongoing efforts to achieve Sarbanes Oxley compliance. Increased headcount and expanded office space at the corporate office also contributed to this increase. Also, certain contractual bonuses for management increased as compared to prior year. 36 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC.

The increase due to foreign currency changes was primarily attributable to the strengthening of the Euro and Pound Sterling in relation to the US Dollar. The net effect of acquisitions and divestitures resulted largely from the sale of a part of the Motorsports business during 2003. During 2003, organic revenue decline of $179.3, or 3.0%, was driven by decreases at IAN and CMG. The decrease at IAN was a result of client losses as well as decreased business from existing multi national clients. The decrease at CMG was a result of revenue declines in our public relations business, driven by general economic factors in the US, partially offset by increases in our events and sports marketing businesses.

During 2003, salaries and related expenses increased to 56.8% of revenues, compared to 56.1% in 2002. In 2003, salaries and related expenses decreased $50.5, excluding the increase related to foreign currency exchange rate changes of $156.7 and a decrease related to net acquisitions and divestitures of $2.3. Salaries and related expenses were impacted by changes in foreign currency rates, attributable to the strengthening of the Euro and Pound Sterling in relation to the US Dollar. The decrease in salaries and related expenses, excluding the impact of foreign currency and net acquisitions and divestitures, was primarily the result of reduced payroll costs across our company due to a decrease in headcount and restructuring actions. This was partially offset by increased performance incentive awards, employee benefits and related tax expenses relating to some agencies. Office and General Expenses The components of the 2003 change were as follows: Total % of $ % Change Revenue 2002 (Restated) $ 2,248.7 37.1 % Foreign currency changes 121.1 5.4 % Net acquisitions/divestitures (13.4 ) (0.6 )% Organic (130.7 ) (5.8 )% Total change (23.0 ) (1.0 )% 2003 (Restated) $ 2,225.7 36.1 % Office and general expenses primarily consists of rent, office and equipment, depreciation, professional fees, other overhead expenses and certain out of pocket expenses related to our revenue. During 2003, office and general expenses decreased to 36.1% of revenues compared to 37.1% in 2002. In 2003, office and general expenses decreased $130.7, excluding the increase related to foreign currency exchange rate changes of $121.1 and a decrease related to net acquisitions and divestitures of $13.4. Office and general expenses was impacted by changes in foreign currency rates, attributable to the strengthening of the Euro and Pound Sterling in relation to the US Dollar. 38 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) The decrease in office and general expenses, excluding the impact of foreign currency and net acquisition and divestitures activity, was due mainly to the result of our efforts to control office and general expenses. Additionally, lower occupancy and overhead costs were recorded in 2003 due to our restructuring program. These decreases were partially offset by charges recorded by CMG in 2003 to secure certain sports television rights. We also experienced a significant increase in professional fees for work performed relating to securities litigation, the SEC investigation, higher audit costs and costs associated with preparing for compliance with the Sarbanes Oxley Act, as well as the development of systems for our shared services initiatives. Restructuring Charges During 2003 and 2002, we recorded net expense related to lease termination and other exit costs and severance and termination costs for the 2003 and 2001 restructuring programs of $172.9 and $7.9, respectively, which included the impact of adjustments resulting from changes in managements estimates as described below. A summary of the net (income) and expense by segment is as follows: Lease Termination and Other Exit Costs Severance and Termination Costs 2003 2001 2003 2001 Program Program Total Program Program Total Total 2003 Net (Income) Expense (Restated) IAN $ 23.1 $ 8.8 $ 31.9 $ 106.6 $ (0.1 ) $ 106.5 $ 138.4 CMG 12.7 6.1 18.8 15.7 15.7 34.5 Motorsports 0.4 0.4 0.4 Corporate (2.2 ) (1.3 ) (3.5 ) 3.1 3.1 (0.4 ) Total $ 33.6 $ 13.6 $ 47.2 $ 125.8 $ (0.1 ) $ 125.7 $ 172.9 2002 Net Expense (Restated) IAN $ $ 5.2 $ 5.2 $ $ 7.9 $ 7.9 $ 13.1 CMG 5.7 5.7 (1.2 ) (1.2 ) 4.5 Corporate (4.3 ) (4.3 ) (5.4 ) (5.4 ) (9.7 ) Total $ $ 6.6 $ 6.6 $ $ 1.3 $ 1.3 $ 7.9 Lease termination and other exit costs 2003 Program Net expense related to lease termination and other exit costs recorded for 2003 was $33.6, comprised of charges of $41.6, partially offset by adjustments to management estimates of $8.0. These charges related to vacating 55 offices in 2003, located primarily in the US and Europe. Charges were recorded at net present value and were net of estimated sublease rental income. The discount related to lease terminations is being amortized over the expected remaining term of the related lease. In addition to amounts recorded as restructuring charges, we recorded charges of $16.5 during 2003 related to the accelerated amortization of leasehold improvements on properties included in the 2003 program. These charges were included in office and general expenses within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 39 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) 2001 Program Net expense related to lease termination and other exit costs of $13.6 and $6.6, recorded for 2003 and 2002 respectively, resulted exclusively from the impact of adjustments to management estimates. The 2001 program resulted in approximately 180 offices being vacated worldwide. Adjustments to Estimates Lease termination and other exit costs for the 2003 and 2001 restructuring programs included the net impact of adjustments for changes in management estimates to increase the restructuring reserves by $5.6 and $6.6 in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Adjustments to management estimates of net lease obligations included both increases and decreases to the restructuring reserve balance as a result of several factors. The significant factors were our negotiation of terms upon the exit of leased properties, changes in sublease rental income and utilization of previously vacated properties by certain of our agencies due to improved economic conditions in certain markets, all of which occurred during the period recorded. Severance and termination costs 2003 Program Net expense related to severance and termination costs of $125.8 recorded for 2003 was comprised of charges of $133.7, partially offset by adjustments to management estimates of $7.9. These charges related to a worldwide workforce reduction of approximately 2,900 employees in 2003. The restructuring program affected employee groups across all levels and functions, including executive, regional and account management, and administrative, creative and media production personnel. The majority of the severance charges related to the U.S. and Europe, with the remainder in Asia and Latin America. 2001 Program Net (income) and expense related to severance and termination costs of ($0.1) and $1.3, recorded for 2003 and 2002, respectively, resulted exclusively from the impact of adjustments to management estimates. The 2001 program related to a worldwide reduction of approximately 7,000 employees. Adjustments to Estimates Severance and termination costs associated with the 2003 and 2001 restructuring programs included the net impact of adjustments for changes in management estimates to decrease the restructuring reserve by $8.0 in 2003 and increase the restructuring reserve by $1.3 in 2002. Adjustments to management estimates of severance and termination obligations included both increases and decreases to the restructuring reserve balance as a result of several factors. The significant factors were the decrease in the number of terminated employees, change in amounts paid to terminated employees and change in estimates of taxes and restricted stock payments related to terminated employees, all of which occurred during the period recorded.

AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Long Lived Asset Impairment and Other Charges The following table summarizes the long lived asset impairment and other charges for 2003 and 2002: For the Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 IAN CMG Motorsports Total IAN Motorsports Total (Restated) (Restated) Goodwill impairment $ 0.4 $ 218.0 $ $ 218.4 $ 2.9 $ 82.1 $ 85.0 Fixed asset impairment 2.3 63.8 66.1 33.0 33.0 Other 9.1 0.4 9.5 12.0 12.0 Total $ 11.8 $ 218.4 $ 63.8 $ 294.0 $ 2.9 $ 127.1 $ 130.0 2003 Impairments CMG We recorded an impairment charge of $218.0 to reduce the carrying value of goodwill at Octagon. The Octagon impairment charge reflects the reduction of the units fair value due principally to poor financial performance in 2003 and lower than expected future financial performance. Specifically, there was significant pricing pressure in both overseas and domestic TV rights distribution, declining fees from athlete representation, and lower than anticipated proceeds from committed future events, including ticket revenue and sponsorship. Motorsports We recorded fixed asset impairment charges of $63.8, consisting of $38.0 in connection with the sale of a business comprised of the four owned auto racing circuits, $9.6 related to the sale of other Motorsports entities, and a fixed asset impairment of $16.2 for outlays that Motorsports was contractually required to spend to improve the racing facilities. 2002 Impairments Motorsports Beginning in the second quarter of 2002 and continuing in subsequent quarters, certain Motorsports businesses experienced significant operational difficulties. Some of the impairment indicators included significantly lower than anticipated attendance at the marquee British Grand Prix race in July 2002 and a change in management at Motorsports in the third quarter of 2002. We performed an impairment test and concluded that certain asset groupings of Motorsports had a book value that exceeded their fair market value. As a result, we recognized an impairment loss of $127.1, which is composed of $82.1 of goodwill impairment, $33.0 of fixed asset impairment and $12.0 of other impairment.

These proceeds were invested in April 2003, at which time the proceeds were used for the settlement of the tender offer for the Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes. Debt Prepayment Penalty During the third quarter of 2003, we repaid our borrowings under the Prudential Agreements, repaying $142.5 principal amount and incurring a prepayment penalty of $24.8. Interest Income In 2003, interest income increased by $8.7 to $39.3 primarily due to higher cash balances resulting from the issuance of the 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes in March 2003, the proceeds from the sale of NFO in July 2003, and the proceeds from the equity offerings in December 2003. Investment Impairments During 2003, we recorded $71.5 of investment impairment charges related to 20 investments. The charge related principally to investments in Fortune Promo 7 of $9.5 in the Middle East, Koch Tavares of $7.7 in Latin America, Daiko of $10.0 in Japan, Roche Macaulay Partners of $7.9 in Canada, Springer & Jacoby of $6.5 in Germany and GlobalHue of $6.9 in the US. The majority of the impairment charges resulted from deteriorating economic conditions in the countries in which the agencies operate, due to the loss of one or several key clients. During 2002, we recorded $40.3 of investment impairment charges primarily related to Octagon investments. The largest component of the write off was a $28.4 charge, related to an investment in a German soccer team/franchise, based on current and projected operating results. Litigation Charges During 2003, we recorded litigation charges of $127.6 for various legal matters, of which $115.0 related to a tentative settlement of the class action shareholder suits discussed in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Under the terms of the settlement, we were required to pay $20.0 in 42 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) cash and issue 6.6 shares of our common stock. The ultimate amount of the litigation charge related to the settlement was to be dependent upon our stock price at the time of the final settlement, which took place in December 2004. Other Income In 2003, other income of $50.3 included approximately 11.0 shares of Modem Media sold for net proceeds of approximately $57.0 in December, resulting in a pre tax gain of $30.3. Also in December, we sold all of the approximately 11.7 shares of TNS we had acquired through the sale of NFO, for approximately $42.0 of net proceeds. A pre tax gain of $13.3 was recorded. OTHER ITEMS Income Taxes For the Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 (Restated) (Restated) Provision for income taxes $ 242.7 $ 106.4 Effective tax rate 65.1% 91.9% Our effective income tax rate was negatively impacted for 2003 and 2002 by the establishment of valuation allowances, as described below, restructuring charges, and non deductible long lived asset impairment charges. The difference between the effective tax rate and the statutory federal rate of 35% is also due to state and local taxes and the effect of non US operations. Valuation Allowance During 2003, a valuation allowance of $111.4 was established in continuing operations on existing deferred tax assets and losses with no benefits. The total valuation allowance as of December 31, 2003 was $252.6. Minority Interest and Unconsolidated Affiliates For the Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 (Restated) (Restated) Income applicable to minority interests $ (27.0 ) $ (30.0 ) Equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates, net of tax $ 2.4 $ 5.9 The income applicable to minority interests was virtually unchanged. The decrease in equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates, was primarily due to a decrease in earnings in unconsolidated affiliates in Europe and Brazil. 43 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC.

This significant increase in our net loss was due to higher operating expenses of $409.9, and higher expense and other income of $181.2. Significant increases in our operating expenses were due to restructuring charges and long lived asset impairment and other charges, which increased $165.0 and $164.0, respectively, from the prior year. Litigation charges of $127.6 contributed to the increase in expense and other income. Income from Discontinued Operations As discussed in Consolidated Results of Operations 2004 Compared to 2003 and in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have recorded the impact of our sale of NFO in income from discontinued operations. We completed the sale of NFO in 2003. NFO is classified as discontinued operations and the results of operations and cash flows of NFO have been removed from our results of continuing operations and cash flows for all periods. Segment Results of Operations 2003 Compared to 2002 As discussed in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have three reporting segments: our operating divisions, IAN, CMG and Motorsports. We also report results for the corporate group. Other than long lived asset impairment and contract termination costs, the operating results of Motorsports are not material to consolidated results, and therefore are not discussed in detail below. The following table summarizes revenue and operating income by segment: For the Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 $ Change % Change (Restated) (Restated) Revenue: IAN $ 5,140.5 $ 4,994.7 $ 145.8 2.9 % CMG 942.4 970.8 (28.4 ) (2.9 )% Motorsports 78.8 93.6 (14.8 ) (15.8 )% Consolidated revenue $ 6,161.7 $ 6,059.1 $ 102.6 1.7 % 44 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC.

The increase due to foreign currency rate changes was primarily attributable to the strengthening of the Euro and Pound Sterling in relation to the US Dollar. The slight increase resulting from net acquisitions and divestitures primarily related to a small acquisition at McCann. 45 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) The organic revenue decrease was primarily driven by the results of Lowe. Lowe reported an organic revenue decrease as compared to 2002, due to the loss of local clients in certain international markets, as well as a decline in business from existing multinational clients in certain European markets. SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME For the Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 $ Change % Change (Restated) (Restated) Segment operating income $ 551.9 $ 550.7 $ 1.2 0.2 % Operating margin 10.7 % 11.1 % For the year ended December 31, 2003, IAN operating income increased by $1.2, or 0.2%, which was due to an increase in revenue of $145.8, offset by increased salaries and related expenses of $142.7 and an increase of $1.8 in office and general expense. Segment operating income increase, excluding the impact of foreign currency and net effects of acquisitions and divestitures, was primarily driven by increases at McCann and Initiative Media and decreases at FCB and Campbell Ewald. At FCB, the organic revenue increase was offset by significantly higher operating expenses. Increased operating expenses at FCB primarily resulted from a rise in performance incentive awards, and higher rent expense associated with excess space. At Campbell Ewald, operating expenses rose more than the organic revenue increase. Campbell Ewald experienced higher expenses in salaries and related benefits for increased headcount to support organic revenue growth. McCann experienced relatively flat revenues with a decline in operating expenses. Operating expenses declined primarily due to lower compensation from a reduced headcount and lower bad debts. Initiative Media experienced an organic revenue increase, while operating expenses remained relatively flat. CONSTITUENT MANAGEMENT GROUP (CMG) REVENUE The components of the 2003 change were as follows: Total Domestic International $% Change $ % Change % of Total $ % Change % of Total 2002 (Restated) $ 970.8 $ 620.1 63.9 % $ 350.7 36.1 % Foreign currency changes 38.6 4.0 % 38.6 11.0 % Net acquisitions/ divestitures (1.8 ) (0.2 )% (0.2 ) 0.0 % (1.6 ) (0.5 )% Organic (65.2 ) (6.7 )% (26.7 ) (4.3 )% (38.5 ) (11.0 )% Total change (28.4 ) (2.9 )% (26.9 ) (4.3 )% (1.5 ) (0.4 )% 2003 (Restated) $ 942.4 $ 593.2 62.9 % $ 349.2 37.1 % For the year ended December 31, 2003, CMG experienced a net decrease in revenues as compared to 2002 of $28.4, or 2.9%, which was comprised of an organic revenue decrease of $65.2 and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures of $1.8, offset by an increase due to foreign currency exchange rate changes of $38.6. The effect of currency exchange rate was primarily attributable to the strengthening of the Euro and Pound Sterling in relation to the US Dollar. 46 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Organic revenue decline resulted from reduced demand for our services within our public relations business in the US and international markets as well as decreased demand for other project related business, offset partially by modest gains in our events and sports marketing business. Segment Operating Income For the Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 $ Change % Change (Restated) (Restated) Segment operating income $ 55.7 $ 47.5 $ 8.2 17.2% Operating margin 5.9 % 4.9 % For the year ended December 31, 2003, CMG operating income increased by $8.2, or 17.2%, which was the result of a $31.0 decrease in salary and related expenses and a $5.6 decrease in office and general expenses, offset by a $28.4 decrease in revenue. Segment operating income growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency and net effects of the acquisitions and divestitures, was primarily driven by increases in the branding and public relations businesses, offset by decreased operating income in sports marketing. Both brand and public relations businesses experienced organic revenue declines as well as significantly decreased operating expenses. The decreased operating expenses in branding were primarily driven by a decrease in bad debt expense as a result of improved collection activity, decreased payroll related expenses due to lower headcount as a result of restructuring actions taken in the public relations and branding business, as well as a decrease in expenses recorded for performance incentive awards. Operating income declined at Octagon despite organic revenue growth as a result of significant increases in operating expenses. Operating expenses in sports marketing rose as a result of certain sports television rights. CORPORATE AND OTHER Amounts in corporate and other include corporate office expenses and shared service center expenses, as well as certain other centrally managed expenses which are not allocated to each operating division. The following significant expenses are included in corporate and other: For the Years Ended December 31, $ 2003 2002 Change % Change (Restated) (Restated) Salaries, benefits and related expenses $ 129.0 $ 131.1 $ (2.1 ) 1.6 % Professional fees 49.8 28.5 21.3 74.7 % Rent and depreciation 30.5 26.5 4.0 15.1 % Corporate insurance 26.5 12.5 14.0 112.0 % Bank fees 1.6 3.7 (2.1 ) (56.8 )% Other 9.3 17.7 (8.4 ) (47.5 )% Expenses allocated to segments (118.1 ) (117.7 ) (0.4 ) 0.3 % Total corporate and other $ 128.6 $ 102.3 $ 26.3 25.7 % 47 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Salaries and related expenses include salaries, insurance, pension and bonus expense for Corporate Office employees. Professional fees include costs related to the preparation for Sarbanes Oxley Act compliance, financial statement audit, legal, information technology and other consulting fees. Rent and depreciation includes rental expense and depreciation of leasehold improvements for properties occupied by corporate office employees. Bank fees relate to debt and credit facilities managed by the Corporate Office. The amount of expense allocated to operating segments is calculated monthly based on a formula that uses the weighted average revenues of the operating unit. The majority of the corporate costs including most of the costs associated with internal control remediation and compliance are not allocated back to operating segment. The increase in corporate and other expense of $26.4 or 25.8% is primarily related to an increase in professional fees increased as a result of higher legal fees incurred from securities litigation and SEC investigation, higher audit costs and costs associated with preparing for compliance with the Sarbanes Oxley Act. In addition, salaries, benefits, and related expenses increased as a result of accruals for performance incentive awards. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOW OVERVIEW Operating cash flow Our cash provided by operating activities was $455.5, compared to $499.7 in 2003 and $878.9 in 2002. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2004 was primarily attributable to the decrease in year over year changes in receivables and liabilities. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2003 was primarily attributable to the lower earnings levels in 2003 resulting from continued softness in client demand for advertising and marketing services and our restructuring program. We conduct media buying on behalf of clients, which affects our working capital and operating cash flow. In most of our businesses, we collect funds from our clients which we use, on their behalf, to pay production costs and media costs. The amounts involved substantially exceed our revenues, and the current assets and current liabilities on our balance sheet reflect these pass through arrangements. Our assets include both cash received and accounts receivable from customers for these pass through arrangements, while our liabilities include amounts owed on behalf of customers to media and production suppliers. Generally, we pay production and media charges only after we have received funds from our clients, and our risk from client nonpayment has historically not been significant. Funding requirements Our most significant funding requirements include: non cancelable operating lease obligations, capital expenditures, payments in respect of past acquisitions, interest payments, preferred stock dividends and taxes. We have not paid dividends on our common stock since 2002. We have no scheduled maturities of long term debt until 2008, as a result of transactions undertaken in 2005. Our outstanding debt and preferred stock are described below under Long Term Debt and Convertible Preferred Stock. In January 2004, we redeemed $250.0 of debt. In November 2004, we refinanced $250.0 of debt through November 2009 and $350.0 of debt through November 2014, and in July 2005 we refinanced $250.0 of debt due to mature in 2005 through July 2008. These transactions are described below under Redemption and Repurchase of Long Term Debt. Our capital expenditures are primarily to upgrade computer and telecommunications systems and to modernize offices. Our principal bank credit facility as amended limits the amounts we can spend on 48 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) capital expenditures in any calendar year to $210.0. Our capital expenditures were $194.0 in 2004, $159.6 in 2003 and $171.4 in 2002. We acquired a large number of agencies through 2001, but in recent years the number and value of acquisitions have been significantly less. Cash paid for new acquisitions was approximately $14.6 in 2004, $4.0 in 2003 and $48.2 in 2002. However, under the terms of certain of our past acquisitions, we have long term obligations to pay additional consideration or to purchase additional equity interests in certain consolidated or unconsolidated subsidiaries if specified conditions are met. Some of the consideration under these arrangements is in shares of our common stock, but most is in cash. We made cash payments for past acquisitions of $161.7 in 2004, $221.2 in 2003 and $240.0 in 2002. Our projected obligations for 2005 and beyond are set forth below under Contractual Obligations. Certain media companies in various international locations require advertising agencies to post a letter of credit to support commitments to purchase media placements. Primarily, we obtain these letters of credit from our principal bank syndicate under the credit facilities described under Credit Arrangements below. The outstanding amount of letters of credit was $165.4 and $160.1 as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These letters of credit have not been drawn upon in recent years. Sources of funds At December 31, 2004 our total of cash and cash equivalents plus short term marketable securities was $1,970.4. The total was $2,067.0 at December 31, 2003, which included proceeds from securities sold in December 2003 that we used in January 2004 to retire $250.0 of outstanding debt. We have financed ourselves through access to the capital markets by issuing debt securities, convertible preferred stock and common stock. Our outstanding debt securities and convertible preferred stock are described under Long Term Debt, Convertible Senior Notes and Convertible Preferred Stock below. As a result of the disclaimer of opinion by PwC on Managements Assessment on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, the SEC considers our SEC filings not to be current for purposes of certain of the SECs rules. As a result, we are unable to use short form registration (registration that allows us to incorporate by reference our Form 10 K, Form 10 Q and other SEC reports into our registration statements) or, for most purposes, shelf registration, until twelve complete months have passed after we file an annual report containing an audit report on internal control over financial reporting that does not disclaim an opinion. In July 2005, we issued $250.0 of Floating Rate Notes due 2008 in a private placement to refinance maturing debt, as described below. We have committed and uncommitted credit lines and the terms of our revolving credit facilities are described below. We have not drawn on our committed facilities during 2004 or 2003, although we use them to issue letters of credit, as described above. Our outstanding borrowings under uncommitted credit facilities were $67.8 and $69.8 as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We use uncommitted credit lines for working capital needs at some of our operations outside the United States. If we lose access to these credit lines, we may be required to provide funding directly to some overseas operations. We maintain our committed credit facilities primarily as stand by short term liquidity. 49 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Liquidity outlook We expect our operating cash flow and cash on hand to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating requirements for the next twelve months. We have no significant scheduled amounts of long term debt due until 2008. We continue to have a level of cash and cash equivalents that we consider to be conservative. We consider this approach to be important as we address the consequences of the restatement, including increased cash requirements resulting, among other things, from higher professional fees and from the liabilities we have recognized in the restatement. Accordingly we may seek to raise additional financing, if market conditions applicable to our Company permit us to do so on favorable terms, in order to enhance our financial flexibility. There can be no assurance that such financing will be completed on terms that are favorable to us, if at all. Substantially all of our operating cash flow is generated by subsidiaries. Our liquid assets are held primarily at the holding company level, but also at our larger subsidiaries. The legal or contractual restrictions on our ability to transfer funds within the group, whether in the form of dividends, loans or advances, do not significantly reduce our financial flexibility. FINANCING Long Term Debt A summary of our long term debt is as follows: December 31, 2004 2003 1.80% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2004 (less unamortized discount of $5.9) $ $ 244.1 1.87% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2006 (less unamortized discount of $23.5) 337.5 7.875% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2005 255.0 522.1 7.25% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2011 500.0 500.0 5.40% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2009 (less unamortized discount of $0.3) 249.7 6.25% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2014 (less unamortized discount of $1.0) 347.3 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 800.0 800.0 Other notes payable and capitalized leases at interest rates from 4.5% to 22.23% 42.1 42.1 Total long term debt 2,194.1 2,445.8 Less: current portion 258.1 247.1 Long term debt, excluding current portion $ 1,936.0 $ 2,198.7 Exposure to interest rate movements is reduced by interest rate swap agreements. As a result of these agreements, the effective interest rate for the 6.25% Senior Unsecured Notes differs from its stated rate. 50 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Annual repayments of long term debt as of December 31, 2004 are scheduled as follows: 2005 $ 258.1 2006 3.9 2007 2.1 2008 1.6 2009 250.5 Thereafter 1,677.9 Total long term debt $ 2,194.1 Redemption and Repurchase of Long Term Debt In January 2004, we redeemed the 1.80% Convertible Subordinated Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $250.0 at maturity at an aggregate price of approximately $246.0, which included the principal amount of the Notes plus original issue discount and accrued interest to the redemption date. To redeem these Convertible Subordinated Notes, we used approximately $246.0 of the net proceeds from the 2003 Common and Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock offerings as discussed below. In November 2004, we tendered for $250.0 of the $500.0 outstanding face value 7.875% Senior Unsecured Notes at an aggregate price of approximately $263.1, which included the principal amount of the Notes plus accrued interest to the tender date. A prepayment premium of $9.8 was recorded on the early retirement of $250.0 of these Notes. In December 2004, we redeemed our outstanding 1.87% Convertible Subordinated Notes with an aggregate principal amount of approximately $361.0 at maturity at an aggregate price of approximately $346.8, which included the principal amount of the Notes plus accrued interest to the redemption date. To tender for the 7.875% Senior Unsecured Notes and redeem the 1.87% Convertible Subordinated Notes, we used approximately $250.0 and $350.0, respectively, of the net proceeds from the sale and issuance in November 2004 of the 5.40% Senior Unsecured Notes due November 2009 and 6.25% Senior Unsecured Notes due November 2014. In August 2005, we redeemed the remainder of the outstanding 7.875% Senior Unsecured Notes with an aggregate principal amount of approximately $250.0 at maturity at an aggregate price of approximately $258.6, which included the principal amount of the Notes plus accrued interest to the redemption date. To redeem these Notes we used the proceeds from the sale and issuance in July 2005 of $250.0 Floating Rate Notes due in July 2008. Consent Solicitation In March 2005, we completed a consent solicitation to amend the indentures governing five series of our outstanding public debt to provide, among other things, that our failure to file with the trustee our SEC reports, including our 2004 Annual Report on Form 10 K and Quarterly Reports for the first and second quarter of 2005 on Form 10 Q, would not constitute a default under the indentures until September 30, 2005. The indenture governing our 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes was also amended to provide for: (1) an extension from March 15, 2005 to September 15, 2009 of the date on or after which we may redeem the 4.50% Notes and (2) an additional make whole adjustment to the conversion rate in the event of a change of control meeting specified conditions. Convertible Senior Notes The 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes (4.50% Notes) are convertible to common stock at a conversion price of $12.42 per share, subject to adjustment in specified circumstances. They are convertible at any time if the average price of our common stock for 20 trading days immediately 51 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) preceding the conversion date is greater than or equal to a specified percentage, beginning at 120% in 2003 and declining 0.5% each year until it reaches 110% at maturity, of the conversion price. They are also convertible, regardless of the price of our common stock, if: (i) we call the 4.50% Notes for redemption; (ii) we make specified distributions to shareholders; (iii) we become a party to a consolidation, merger or binding share exchange pursuant to which our common stock would be converted into cash or property (other than securities) or (iv) the credit ratings assigned to the 4.50% Notes by any two of Moodys Investors Service, Standard & Poors and Fitch Ratings are lower than Ba2, BB and BB, respectively, or the 4.50% Notes are no longer rated by at least two of these ratings services. Because of our current credit ratings, the 4.50% Notes are currently convertible into approximately 64.4 shares of our common stock. We, at the investors option, may be required to redeem the 4.50% Notes for cash on March 15, 2008 and may also be required to redeem the 4.50% Notes at the investors option on March 15, 2013 and March 15, 2018, for cash or common stock or a combination of both, at our election. Additionally, investors may require us to redeem the 4.50% Notes in the event of certain change of control events that occur prior to March 15, 2008, for cash or common stock or a combination of both, at our election. If at any time on or after March 13, 2003 we pay cash dividends on our common stock, we will pay contingent interest in an amount equal to 100% of the per share cash dividend paid on the common stock multiplied by the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the 4.50% Notes. At our option, we may redeem the 4.50% Notes on or after September 15, 2009 for cash. The redemption price in each of these instances will be 100% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The 4.50% Notes also provide for an additional make whole adjustment to the conversion rate in the event of a change of control meeting specified conditions. Credit Arrangements We have committed and uncommitted lines of credit with various banks that permit borrowings at variable interest rates. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, there were no borrowings under our committed facilities, however, there were borrowings under the uncommitted facilities made by several of our international subsidiaries totaling $67.8 and $69.8, respectively. We have guaranteed the repayment of some of these borrowings by our subsidiaries. The weighted average interest rate on outstanding balances under the uncommitted short term facilities at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was approximately 5% in each year. A summary of our credit facilities is as follows: December 31, 2004 2003 Total Amount Total Total Amount Total Facility Outstanding Available Facility Outstanding Available Committed 364 Day Revolving Credit Facility $ 250.0 $ $ 250.0 $ 500.0 $ $ 339.9 ** Three Year Revolving Credit Facility 450.0 284.6 * Five Year Revolving Credit Facility 375.0 375.0 Other Facilities 0.8 0.8 0.8 0.8 $ 700.8 $ $ 535.4 $ 875.8 $ $ 715.7 Uncommitted International $ 738.1 $ 67.8 $ 670.3 $ 744.8 $ 69.8 $ 675.0 * Amount available is reduced by $165.4 of letters of credit issued under the Three Year Revolving Credit Facility at December 31, 2004. 52 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) ** Amount available is reduced by $160.1 of letters of credit issued under the 364 Day Revolving Credit Facility at December 31, 2003. Our primary bank credit agreements are two credit facilities, a 364 day revolving credit facility (364 Day Revolving Credit Facility) and a three year revolving credit facility (Three Year Revolving Credit Facility and, together with the 364 Day Revolving Credit Facility, the Revolving Credit Facilities). The 364 Day Revolving Credit Facility provides for borrowings of up to $250.0 and expires on September 30, 2005. The Three Year Revolving Credit Facility expires on May 9, 2007 and provides for borrowings of up to $450.0, of which $200.0 is available for the issuance of letters of credit. Our Three Year Revolving Credit Facility was amended and restated as of September 27, 2005. The effectiveness of the amended Three Year Revolving Credit Facility is subject to certain conditions as described below. The terms of the amended Three Year Revolving Credit Facility do not permit us: (i) to make cash acquisitions in excess of $50.0 until October 2006, or thereafter in excess of $50.0 until expiration of the agreement in May 2007, subject to increases equal to the net cash proceeds received in the applicable period from any disposition of assets; (ii) to make capital expenditures in excess of $210.0 annually; (iii) to repurchase or to declare or to pay dividends on our capital stock (except for any convertible preferred stock, convertible trust preferred instrument or similar security, which includes our outstanding 5.40% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred), except that we may repurchase our capital stock in connection with the exercise of options by our employees or with proceeds contemporaneously received from an issue of new shares of our capital stock; and (iv) to incur new debt at our subsidiaries, other than unsecured debt incurred in the ordinary course of business, which may not exceed $10.0 in the aggregate with respect to our US subsidiaries. The amended Three Year Revolving Credit Facility also sets forth revised financial covenants. These require that, as of the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2005 and each fiscal quarter thereafter, we maintain (i) an interest coverage ratio of not less than that set forth opposite the corresponding quarter in the table below: Fiscal Quarter Ending Ratio September 30, 2005 2.15 to 1 December 31, 2005 1.75 to 1 March 31, 2006 1.85 to 1 June 30, 2006 1.45 to 1 September 30, 2006 1.75 to 1 December 31, 2006 2.15 to 1 March 31, 2007 2.50 to 1 53 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) (ii) a debt to EBITDA ratio of not greater than that set forth opposite the corresponding quarter in the table below: Fiscal Quarter Ending Ratio September 30, 2005 5.20 to 1 December 31, 2005 6.30 to 1 March 31, 2006 5.65 to 1 June 30, 2006 6.65 to 1 September 30, 2006 5.15 to 1 December 31, 2006 4.15 to 1 March 31, 2007 3.90 to 1 and (iii) minimum levels of EBITDA for the four fiscal quarters then ended of not less than that set forth opposite the corresponding quarter in the table below: Four Fiscal Quarters Ending Amount September 30, 2005 $ 435.0 December 31, 2005 $ 360.0 March 31, 2006 $ 400.0 June 30, 2006 $ 340.0 September 30, 2006 $ 440.0 December 31, 2006 $ 545.0 March 31, 2007 $ 585.0 The terms used in these ratios, including EBITDA, interest coverage and debt, are subject to specific definitions set forth in the agreement. Under the definition set forth in the Three Year Revolving Credit Facility, EBITDA is determined by adding to net income or loss the following items: interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation expense, amortization expense, and certain specified cash payments and non cash charges subject to limitations on time and amount set forth in the agreement. We expect to be in compliance with all covenants under our Three Year Revolving Credit Facility, as amended and restated, for the next twelve months. Before agreeing to the amendments, the lenders reviewed preliminary drafts of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report and in our quarterly reports on Form 10 Q for the first two quarters of 2005. One condition to effectiveness of the amendments is that we have not received, on or before October 4, 2005 notice from the lenders that have a majority in amount of the revolving credit commitments that the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report and our quarterly reports, and the financial data contained in the notes thereto, are not substantially similar to the preliminary consolidated financial statements we provided to them. If we receive such a notice, the amended agreement will not become effective. In that event, we will continue to be subject to the financial covenants that were previously applicable under the Three Year Revolving Credit Facility, as amended in June 2005 with respect to periods through the second quarter of 2005. We were in compliance with those covenants through June 30, 2005, but there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance when we report financial information through the third quarter of 2005. 54 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Credit Agency Ratings Our current long term debt credit ratings as of September 29, 2005 are Baa3 with negative outlook, BB with negative outlook and B+ with negative outlook, as reported by Moodys Investors Service, Standard & Poors and Fitch Ratings, respectively. Although a ratings downgrade by any of the ratings agencies will not trigger an acceleration of any of our indebtedness, a downgrade may adversely affect our ability to access capital and would likely result in more stringent covenants and higher interest rates under the terms of any new indebtedness. Our credit ratings at year end 2004 and 2003 were as follows: December 31, 2004 2003 Senior Senior Unsecured Subordinated* Outlook Unsecured Subordinated Outlook Moodys Baa3 Stable Baa3 Ba1 Credit watch Negative Standard & Poors BB+ Credit watch Negative BB+ BB Stable Fitch BB+ Stable BB+ BB Stable * As of December 31, 2004, we had no Subordinated debt outstanding. Convertible Preferred Stock In December 2003 we issued 7.5 shares of Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (Preferred Stock). The Preferred Stock carries a dividend yield of 5.375%. On the automatic conversion date in December 2006, each share of the Preferred Stock will convert, subject to adjustment, to between 3.0358 and 3.7037 shares of common stock, depending on the then current market price of our common stock. Under certain circumstances, the Preferred Stock may be converted prior to maturity at our option or at the option of the holders. Payment of Dividends We have not paid any dividends on our common stock since December of 2002. As previously discussed, our ability to declare or pay dividends on common stock is currently restricted by the terms of our Revolving Credit Facilities. We pay annual dividends on each share of Preferred Stock in the amount of $2.6875. Dividends are cumulative from the date of issuance and are payable on each payment date to the extent that dividends are not restricted under the Revolving Credit Facilities and assets are legally available to pay dividends. In addition to the stated annual dividend, if at any time on or before December 16, 2006, we pay a cash dividend on our common stock, the holders of Preferred Stock participate in such distributions via adjustments to the conversion ratio, thereby increasing the number of common shares into which the Preferred Stock will ultimately convert. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following summarizes our estimated contractual obligations at December 31, 2004, and the effect on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods: 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Total Long term debt $ 258.1 $ 3.9 $ 2.1 $ 1.6 $ 250.5 $ 1,677.9 $ 2,194.1 Interest payments $ 133.0 $ 125.5 $ 125.5 $ 121.0 $ 107.7 $ 667.9 $ 1,280.6 Non cancelable operating lease obligations $ 269.9 $ 243.5 $ 212.9 $ 186.5 $ 155.5 $ 828.4 $ 1,896.7 55 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) As a result of the restatement review (discussed more fully in Note 2), the Company has recorded additional liabilities with regard to Vendor Discounts or Credits, Internal Investigations and International Compensation Agreements which amount to $242.3, $114.8 (including $37.5 of additional vendor discounts or credits) and $40.3, respectively, as of December 31, 2004. The Company believes that these amounts represent our best estimates of our ultimate liabilities in each of these cases based on facts and documents reviewed and are sufficient to cover any obligations that we may have to our clients, vendors, and various governmental organizations in the jurisdictions involved. The Company estimates it will pay approximately $250 related to these liabilities over the next 24 months. We have contingent obligations under guarantees of certain obligations of our subsidiaries (parent company guarantees) relating principally to lines of credit, guarantees of certain media payables and operating leases of certain subsidiaries. The amount of such parent company guarantees was approximately $601.8 and $658.0 at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In the event of non payment by the subsidiary of the obligations covered by the guarantees, we would be obliged to pay the amounts. As of December 31, 2004, there are no assets pledged as security for amounts owed or guaranteed. We have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans in the contractual obligations table. Our funding policy regarding our funded pension plan is to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements plus such additional amounts from time to time as are determined to be appropriate to improve the plans funded status. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets, level of market interest rates and levels of voluntary contributions to the plans. Declines in long term interest rates have had a negative impact on the funded status of the plans. During 2004, we made voluntary cash contributions of $32.1 to our domestic pension plans only. We can contribute cash to these plans at our discretion; however we do not expect to make any contributions to our postretirement benefits plans or domestic pension plans during 2005. We expect to contribute $24.3 to our international plans in 2005. We have structured certain acquisitions with additional contingent purchase price obligations in order to reduce the potential risk associated with negative future performance of the acquired entity. In addition, we have entered into agreements that may require us to purchase additional equity interests in certain consolidated and unconsolidated subsidiaries. The amounts relating to these transactions are based on estimates of the future financial performance of the acquired entity, the timing of the exercise of these rights, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other factors. In accordance with GAAP, we have not recorded a liability for these items on the balance sheet since the definitive amounts payable are not determinable or distributable. When the contingent acquisition obligations have been met and the consideration is distributable, we will record the fair value of this consideration as an additional cost of the acquired entity. The following table details the estimated liability and the estimated amount that would be paid under such options, in the event of exercise at the earliest exercise date. All payments are contingent upon achieving projected operating performance targets and satisfying other conditions specified in the related agreements and are subject to revisions as the earn out periods progress. 56 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) The following contingent acquisition obligations are net of compensation expense, except as noted below, as defined by the terms and conditions of the respective acquisition agreements and employment terms of the former owners of the acquired businesses. This future expense will not be allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired. As of December 31, 2004, our estimated contingent acquisition obligations are as follows: 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Total Deferred Acquisition Payments Cash $ 48.0 $ 5.7 $ 2.1 $ 0.9 $ 4.3 $ $ 61.0 Stock 12.4 5.4 17.8 Put Options with Consolidated Affiliates* Cash 30.2 1.8 9.5 3.4 3.0 7.3 55.2 Stock 0.1 0.1 0.2 Put Options with Unconsolidated Affiliates* Cash 5.4 3.4 3.9 3.0 2.2 1.4 19.3 Stock 0.8 0.9 0.9 0.3 2.9 Call Options with Consolidated Affiliates* Cash 4.2 1.1 4.8 10.1 Stock 0.5 0.5 Subtotal Cash $ 87.8 $ 12.0 $ 15.5 $ 7.3 $ 9.5 $ 13.5 $ 145.6 Subtotal Stock $ 13.3 $ 6.9 $ $ 0.9 $ $ 0.3 $ 21.4 Total Contingent Acquisition Payments $ 101.1 $ 18.9 $ 15.5 $ 8.2 $ 9.5 $ 13.8 $ 167.0 In accounting for acquisitions, we recognize deferred payments and purchases of additional interests after the effective date of purchase that are contingent upon the future employment of owners as compensation expense in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. As of December 31, 2004, our estimated contingent acquisition payments with associated compensation expense impacts are as follows: Compensation Expense Related Payments Cash $ 34.1 $ 4.9 $ 2.1 $ 1.4 $ $ 1.3 $ 43.8 Stock $ 1.8 $ 0.2 $ $ $ $ $ 2.0 Subtotal $ 35.9 $ 5.1 $ 2.1 $ 1.4 $ $ 1.3 $ 45.8 Total Payments $ 137.0 $ 24.0 $ 17.6 $ 9.6 $ 9.5 $ 15.1 $ 212.8 * We have entered into certain acquisitions that contain both put and call options with similar terms and conditions. In such instances, we have included the related estimated contingent acquisition obligations with Put Options. The 2005 obligations relate primarily to acquisitions that were completed prior to December 31, 2001. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES We periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements and forward contracts to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations and to mitigate foreign exchange volatility. During the fourth quarter of 2004, we executed three interest rate swaps which synthetically converted our $350.0, 6.25% Senior Unsecured Notes due November 2014, of fixed rate debt to floating rates. Fair value adjustments decreased the carrying amount of our debt outstanding at December 31, 2004 by approximately $1.7. In January 2005, 57 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) we executed an interest rate swap which synthetically converted an additional $150.0 of the $500.0, 7.25% Senior Unsecured Notes due August 2011, of fixed rate debt to floating rates. We entered into the swaps to hedge a portion of our floating interest rate exposure on our cash investments. In May of 2005, we terminated all of our long term interest rate swap agreements covering the $350.0, 6.25% Senior Unsecured Notes and $150.0 of the $500.0, 7.25% Senior Unsecured Notes. In connection with the interest rate swap termination, our net cash receipts were approximately $1.1, which will be recorded as an offset to interest expense over the remaining life of the related debt. We have entered into foreign currency transactions in which various foreign currencies are bought or sold forward. These contracts were entered into to meet currency requirements arising from specific transactions. The changes in value of these forward contracts were reflected in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, we had contracts covering approximately $1.8 and $2.4, respectively, of notional amount of currency and the fair value of the forward contracts was negligible. The terms of the 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes include two embedded derivative instruments. The fair value of the two derivatives on December 31, 2004 was immaterial. INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING We have identified numerous material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, as set forth in greater detail in Item 8, Managements Assessment on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting and Item 9A, Controls and Procedures, of this report. Each of our material weaknesses results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. As a result, we have assessed that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2004. Management will, however, be unable to determine whether the elements of internal control over financial reporting related directly to preparing the financial statements for external purposes, as well as the preparation and calculation of the provision for income taxes, were operating effectively as of December 31, 2004 because internal controls in place at year end have been extensively modified prior to the Companys evaluation of these controls which can no longer be observed or assessed. The report of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC), our independent registered public accounting firm, on our internal control over financial reporting disclaims an opinion on managements assessment and on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Until we file an annual report containing an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting that does not disclaim an opinion on our assessment or on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we are subject to certain limitations under the US federal securities laws as further described in Item 1, Business Risk Factors. We are in the process of developing and implementing remedial measures to address the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. However, because of our decentralized structure and our many disparate accounting systems of varying quality and sophistication, we have extensive work remaining to remedy these material weaknesses. While we have made considerable progress, we have yet to complete the formal work plan for remedying the identified material weaknesses. At present, there can be no assurance as to when the remediation plan will be completed or when it will be implemented. Until our remedial efforts are completed, we will continue to incur the expenses and management burdens associated with the manual procedures and additional resources required to prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements. There will also continue to be a substantial risk that we will be unable to make future SEC filings on time. These developments, and the effect on our actual or perceived liquidity and credit standing, could have material adverse effects on our financial condition and further adverse affects 58 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) on our business or our liquidity that we cannot predict. We discuss these risks under Risk Factors in Item 1 of this Annual Report. RESTATEMENT In connection with our work to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, we identified errors in our accounting and previously reported financial results. In March 2005, we announced that we would delay filing our Annual Report on Form 10 K, and began a comprehensive review of previously reported financial information. The scope of our review included the analysis of accounting for acquisitions, revenue and leases, internal investigations into potential employee misconduct, as well as other miscellaneous areas impacted by the identified material weaknesses. The review, conducted under the direction of our senior management with the oversight of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, included our operating agencies and consisted of an extensive examination of financial information and significant transactions. Our procedures were substantially manual and involved hundreds of our employees and external consultants and took over six months to complete. These procedures included examining the accounting for more than 400 acquisitions, leases at approximately 370 entities, approximately 10,000 account reconciliations and account analyses and over 300,000 intercompany transactions, as well as a comprehensive review of over 20,000 client contracts with respect to timing of revenue recognition, vendor related discounts or credits and income statement classification. In addition, we are in various stages of completing approximately 50 internal investigations addressing employee misconduct predominantly outside the US. In order to complete this work, we have hired or replaced hundreds of temporary and permanent accountants. Management believes the scope and process of its internal review of previously reported financial information was sufficient to identify issues of a material nature that could affect our Consolidated Financial Statements and all dates and periods presented herein have been restated to fairly present the results of our operations. The errors in our previously reported financial information, and the failure to prevent them or detect them in our financial reporting process, were largely attributable to weak internal controls, our decentralized operational structure, general lack of compliance with our policies and procedures, numerous disparate operating information technology systems, inadequate oversight by management at various levels within our organization, and an inadequate staff of competent accounting personnel with an appropriate level of knowledge of GAAP. We concluded that our control environment has not progressed sufficiently to serve as an effective foundation for all other components of internal control. As a result of our review, we determined that a restatement of previously reported financial information was required. Our previously reported financial information should no longer be relied upon. Accordingly, we have restated our previously reported financial information for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, 2001, and 2000 and our previously reported financial information for the first, second and third quarters of 2004 and 2003 (the restatement). The restatement also affects periods prior to 2000, which is reflected as an adjustment to opening retained earnings as of January 1, 2000. The restatement covers a number of separate matters, each of which is described below and in further detail in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 2, Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements. The law firm of Dewey Ballantine LLP was retained to advise the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors regarding the discharge of its obligations. The scope of the Dewey Ballantine LLP work included oversight of the internal investigations into potential employee misconduct being conducted by our internal audit group and the overall restatement process conducted by management. Dewey Ballantine LLP 59 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) retained a forensic accounting firm to assist with its work involving the internal investigations and review of the overall restatement process. For the quarterly impact of the restatement issue and the restated financial results for the first, second and third quarters of 2004, see Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 20, Results by Quarter. The following tables summarize the impact of all of these adjustments on previously reported revenue; net income (loss) from continuing operations and earnings per share; and assets, liabilities, and stockholders equity. The overall impact on stockholders equity of the restatement adjustments as of September 30, 2004, the date for which we last published financial statements, is approximately $550 million or 27.5% of the previously reported September 30, 2004 equity balance.

The expenses include the purchase of various forms of media, including television, radio, and print advertising space, or production costs, such as the creation of advertising campaigns, commercials, and print advertisements. Revenues in the advertising and communicative services business are frequently recorded net of third party costs as the business is primarily an agent for its clients. Since these costs are billed to clients, there are times when vendor discounts, credits, or price differences can affect the net revenue recorded by the agency. These third party discounts, rebates, or price differences are frequently referred to as credits. Our contracts are typically fixed fee arrangements or cost based arrangements. In fixed fee arrangements, the amount we charge our clients is comprised of a fee for our services. The fee we earn, however, is not affected by the level of expenses incurred. Therefore, any rebates or credits received in servicing these accounts do not create a liability to the client. In cost based arrangements, we earn a percentage commission or flat fee based on or incremental to the expenses incurred. In these cases, rebates or credits received may accrue to the benefit of our clients and create a liability payable to the client. The implication and interpretation of cost language included in our contracts can vary across international and domestic markets in which we operate and can affect whether or not we have a liability to the client. Without adequate contract review procedures the operating practice and the accounting in some of our agencies, predominantly outside the United States, relied on local customs and practices. As a result, in some instances, our accounting for the vendor discount was inconsistent with the underlying contractual requirements, which necessitated accounting adjustments. To correct for improperly recorded revenue, we have established a liability to refund these credits, discounts and rebates to our customers in accordance with our contractual obligations. As part of the restatement, we have performed an extensive review of our client contracts and local law to determine the impact of improperly recognizing these media and vendor credits as additional revenue instead of recognizing a liability to our clients. We have determined our exposure to each type of these credits by agency, reviewed our legal obligations considering our client contracts and local law, and 63 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) established a liability as necessary. Where it was impractical to review client contracts we have estimated our exposure. If our estimate is incorrect we may need to materially adjust our liability. In order to remediate this issue, we are in the process of issuing a formal policy to require proper transparency in our contracts, and proper handling and accounting for these types of vendor discounts or credits received in the normal course of business. The impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements of this element of the restatement is presented in the following table. The restatement also affects periods prior to 2000; we have recorded an adjustment of $12.7 to retained earnings at January 1, 2000 related to vendor discounts or credits. Revenue Recognition Related to Vendor Discounts or Credits Impact of Restatement Increase (Decrease) for the Years Ended and as of December 31, 2003 2002 2001 2000 Consolidated Statement of Operations: Revenue (50.6 ) (40.2 ) (42.8 ) (25.9 ) Operating Income (Loss) (53.3 ) (41.4 ) (48.8 ) (26.7 ) Provision for Income Taxes (7.9 ) (8.5 ) (13.0 ) (7.1 ) Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations (45.4 ) (32.9 ) (35.7 ) (19.6 ) Consolidated Balance Sheet: Total Assets 9.6 7.0 8.7 7.0 Total Liabilities 67.7 45.0 43.4 25.6 Revenue Recognition related to Customer Contracts: We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, there is fixed and determinable pricing, and upon completion of the earnings process in accordance with the terms of the arrangement with our clients, which is generally as services are performed and or when the media placements or production are completed. For project based arrangements, revenue is recognized based upon the agreement that we have in place with our customers. Our fees are generally recognized as earned, based on the proportional performance method of revenue recognition in situations where our fee is reconcilable to the actual hours incurred to service the client, as detailed in a contractual staffing plan, or where the fee is earned on a per hour basis, with the amount of revenue recognized in both situations limited to the amount realizable per the terms of the client contract. Where it is determined that the contractual staffing plan is incomplete or there is no staffing plan, we defer the recognition of revenue until the period in which all work is completed. For retainer based arrangements, fees are recognized on a straight line or monthly basis when service is provided, essentially on a pro rata basis, and the terms of the contract support that accounting. We require explicit language in the contract evidencing that our obligation to the client for services rendered is satisfied on a monthly basis. We evaluate the termination provisions of the contract for a determination of amounts realizable at an interim date. Where it is determined that the terms of the contract do not clearly support monthly recognition of revenue, we defer the recognition of revenue until the period in which all work is completed. In certain transactions with our customers the persuasive evidence of the customer arrangement was not always adequate to support revenue recognition, or the timing of revenue recognition did not appropriately follow the specific contract terms. As part of our review, we reviewed significant client contracts to ensure that revenue was recognized in accordance with the terms of the contract and or with our policies as outlined above. 64 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) We have established the following terms as the specific criteria to be followed consistently across our global operating divisions. For adequate persuasive evidence of arrangements, we required signed contractual agreements or in lieu of a signed contract, other evidence or documentation from our customers was required in the period in which revenue was recognized. This evidence was required to define our compensation, to give a clear indication of how revenue was to be earned, and to describe how our obligation to the client was to be satisfied. In the absence of persuasive evidence of an arrangement or detailed invoices indicating the level of services performed were not available, we deferred the recognition of revenue for the entire contract, until we could assure that all internal work was completed. Where it was determined that persuasive evidence was lacking or insufficient, we deferred the recognition of revenue until that period in which persuasive evidence was obtained, cash was received accompanied by a detailed customer invoice, or all work was completed. In connection with the restatement, we have established a formal policy with specific guidelines and tools as to how revenue should be recorded under the following bases: proportional performance, monthly, completed contract, or in accordance with other quantitative or qualitative goals as specified by the contract. We also plan to create a central tracking system that will detail all arrangements with clients which will assist in ensuring that all criteria for proper revenue recognition are met and properly classified. The impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements of this element of the restatement is presented in the following table. The restatement also affects periods prior to 2000; we have recorded an adjustment of $47.7 to retained earnings at January 1, 2000 related to customer contracts. Revenue Recognition Related to Customer Contracts Impact of Restatement Increase (Decrease) for the Years Ended and as of December 31, 2003 2002 2001 2000 Consolidated Statement of Operations: Revenue (18.7 ) (8.6 ) (3.6 ) (6.8 ) Operating Income (Loss) (17.2 ) (6.7 ) (3.6 ) (6.8 ) Provision for Income Taxes (1.4 ) (2.1 ) (1.3 ) (2.5 ) Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations (15.8 ) (4.5 ) (2.4 ) (4.3 ) Consolidated Balance Sheet: Total Assets (3.9 ) 4.9 1.9 3.4 Total Liabilities 21.6 14.8 3.7 7.6 Accounting for Reimbursement of Out of Pocket Expenses: We incur incidental out of pocket expenses in the course of providing services to our clients, for which we are reimbursed by our clients. These relate to travel, meals, and other incidental expenses. Under EITF 01 14, Income Statement Characterization of Reimbursements Received for Out of Pocket Expenses Incurred, the reimbursements should be recorded as revenue and operating expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Prior to 2004, we incorrectly recorded some of these reimbursements of out of pocket expenses as a reduction of operating expenses. The effect was to report both revenue and expense net of these out of pocket expenses and reimbursements. In 2004, we established a formal policy detailing the proper classification of these expense reimbursements. We reviewed significant activity for all financial periods prior to 2004 to identify instances in which this error was made. In the restatement, we have reported client reimbursements of out of pocket expenses as revenue in all periods. Compared to our previously published Consolidated Financial Statements, the 65 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) effect of the restatement is to increase revenue and expense amounts, with no effect on operating income, and to reduce operating margin in percentage terms. Gross versus Net Revenue Presentation: We incur and pay certain expenses on behalf of our clients typically relating to the cost of media purchases or production work. We invoice our clients for these expenses in addition to our fees for services provided. EITF 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, sets forth criteria for the judgment whether revenue should be recognized based on the gross amount billed to the customer or net of amounts paid to suppliers. Because we are broadly considered an advertising agency based on our primary lines of business and only in certain situations would we record revenue other than on a net basis. Accordingly, we generally record revenue net of pass through charges as we believe the relative strength of the key indicators, taken as a whole, suggest we generally act as an agent on behalf of our clients in our primary lines of business. We reviewed our lines of business and evaluated our status as a principal or agent, and we reviewed significant transactions to ensure the proper accounting for revenue. We assessed whether the agency or the third party supplier is the primary obligor for services provided to the client. We evaluated the terms of our client agreements as part of this assessment. In addition we gave appropriate consideration to other key indicators, such as latitude in establishing price and discretion in supplier selection, and less consideration to others, such as credit risk. We determined that for certain of our businesses, primarily sales promotion, event, sports and entertainment marketing and corporate and brand identity services, the relative strength of the indicators suggests we act as a principal. Accordingly, under EITF 99 19, we accounted for revenue on a net basis in error. In the restatement, for those businesses we have recorded the gross amount billed to the client as revenue consistently on a historical basis. Compared to our previously published Consolidated Financial Statements, the effect of the restatement is to increase revenue and expense by equal amounts, with no effect on operating income or balance sheet accounts, and to reduce operating margin in percentage terms. We have defined specific criteria which our personnel can use to evaluate whether we are acting as a principal or an agent in their arrangements with clients. The impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements for the Accounting for Out of Pocket Expenses and Gross versus Net Revenue Presentation is presented in the following table: Revenue Presentation Impact of Restatement Increase (Decrease) for the Years Ended and as of December 31, 2003 2002 2001 2000 Consolidated Statement of Operations: Revenue 355.6 358.5 340.2 264.3 Operating Income (Loss) Provision for Income Taxes Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations Accounting for Acquisitions Future Obligations related to Prior Acquisitions: The terms of our acquisitions generally provide for initial payment on the date of sale and contingent amounts over succeeding years, calculated based on the growth and financial performance of the business or the retention of key personnel. As a result, we maintain contingent obligations related to acquisitions 66 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) made in prior years, such as deferred payments and put options. Deferred payments, or earn outs, generally tie the aggregate price ultimately paid for an acquisition to the business performance and are included in the terms of the original purchase to minimize our risk associated with potential future negative changes in the performance of the acquired entity during the post acquisition transition period. Earn outs are typically contingent upon the achievement of projected operating performance targets, as specified in the purchase contract. For those acquisitions where we purchase partial ownership interest in a business, there are often matching put and call options issued. These put and call options are not fixed, rather they are based on a formula that approximates fair value. Put options require us to purchase additional equity interests in the future. Put option amounts to be paid are typically accounted for when the put option is exercised, except in instances where put option payments are specifically contingent upon the future employment of key personnel, in which case compensation expense is accrued prior to when the related put option is exercised. Call options entitle us to acquire additional equity interests in the future. Call option amounts to be paid are contingent upon our decision to exercise our option. Therefore, purchases of additional interests related to call options are accounted for when the related call option is exercised. In accounting for acquisitions, we recognize deferred payments and purchases of additional interests after the effective date of purchase, as an increase to goodwill and other intangibles, or as compensation expense, depending on the terms of the purchase contract. EITF 95 8, Accounting for Contingent Consideration Paid to the Shareholders of an Acquired Enterprise in a Purchase Business Combination, provides criteria for this determination. In some instances, earn out or put option payments were not properly accounted for as compensation expense. The effect of this error was to understate compensation expense and, in most instances, to overstate goodwill. We reviewed our acquisitions through 2004, including all contingent future obligations as of December 31, 2004, and we have recorded adjustments to compensation expense and goodwill in periods where contingent acquisition obligations were recorded inappropriately. We will require that future acquisition related transactions be approved by our operating management as well as members of our Controllers, Corporate Development and Tax groups prior to execution of the related agreement. Our central repository of related information has been reviewed for completeness and accuracy and updated to ensure that it contains critical files and data. We plan to update our policies concerning the proper accounting for future obligations related to our acquisitions. The restatement also affects periods prior to 2000; we have recorded an adjustment of $5.2 to retained earnings at January 1, 2000. 67 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) The impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements of this element of the restatement is presented in the following table: Future Obligations Related to Prior Acquisitions Impact of Restatement Increase (Decrease) for the Years Ended and as of December 31, 2003 2002 2001 2000 Consolidated Statement of Operations: Revenue Operating Income (Loss) (23.6 ) (13.8 ) (14.0 ) (10.1 ) Provision for Income Taxes Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations (24.2 ) (13.8 ) (14.0 ) (10.1 ) Consolidated Balance Sheet: Total Assets 2.8 (4.5 ) (0.1 ) (0.0 ) Total Liabilities 27.0 8.9 13.7 9.8 Pre Acquisition Earnings: It was not uncommon during the period 1996 through 2002 for us to account for the revenues and expenses of certain entities acquired from a point in time that was earlier than the date of closing. In those cases we incorrectly recorded the acquired business revenues and expenses in our Consolidated Financial Statements for that year as of January 1, although the acquisition closed subsequent to that date, typically in the latter half of the year. This incorrect recognition of revenue and expenses prior to the closing date was recorded either as an adjustment in the month of purchase, or by adjusting prior months accounting results. As a result of these misstatements of revenues and expenses, we recorded additional goodwill on our balance sheet to offset the increase to income. In doing so, we recorded amortization expense on an inflated goodwill balance until the adoption of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, at January 1, 2002, when we ceased amortizing goodwill. As part of the restatement, we reviewed financial books and records associated with the accounting at the time of acquisition and utilized quantitative analytics to understand revenue and expenses recorded related to the acquisition. As a result of our review we identified 142 acquisitions where we had inappropriately recognized earnings prior to our effective legal ownership of the acquired entities. We have calculated the impact of this incorrect practice through the review of purchase contracts for the substantial majority of acquisitions made since 1996. For those entities identified as having recorded pre acquisition earnings, we identified the actual closing date of each acquisition and used this as the cutoff date to determine the amount of pre acquisition earnings improperly recorded. For those entities identified with pre acquisition earnings recognition, we also adjusted the goodwill balance for the error. Since the goodwill balance was misstated we also recalculated the appropriate amortization of goodwill from the date of acquisition. We have also created a central repository for acquisition data. Accounting for all future acquisitions must be reviewed and evaluated with the appropriate management oversight prior to the acquisition being finalized and must include members of our Controllers, Treasury, Corporate Development and Tax groups to prevent this type of inappropriate accounting in future periods. We have recorded adjustments as part of the restatement to reduce our consolidated revenues, expenses and goodwill balances in the years where pre acquisition earnings were recorded inappropriately. We have also made adjustments to amortization expense that was recorded on our misstated goodwill balance. 68 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC.

The restatement also affects periods prior to 2000; we have recorded an adjustment of $31.8 to retained earnings at January 1, 2000 related to pre acquisition earnings recognition.

Our corporate risk management group investigates these matters, frequently with the assistance of outside forensic accountants and legal counsel. It prepares a written report documenting the investigation, its findings, and recommended actions. The report is then presented to corporate management and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors for review. If we conclude that there has been misconduct, we take appropriate personnel action, which may include termination, and if recommended by counsel, we notify the appropriate governmental and regulatory authorities of violations of law, and take legal action if appropriate to recover our losses. The restatement includes the correction of certain unintentional errors in our accounting that were discovered as a result of these investigations and primarily relate to agencies outside the United States. However, certain of these investigations revealed instances of deliberate falsification of accounting records, evasion of taxes in jurisdictions outside the United States, inappropriate charges to clients, diversion of corporate assets, non compliance with local laws and regulations, and other improprieties. These errors were not prevented or detected earlier because of material weaknesses in our control environment and decentralized operating structure. In a number of these cases, the activities appear to have had the purpose of improving the reported financial performance of the operating unit involved. In a number of cases, we believe the purpose included reducing the personal tax burdens of the individuals involved. In an effort to improve the Companys internal control over financial reporting relating to employee misconduct, the Company has developed an extensive remediation plan. This plan includes specific responses to the findings of each of the internal investigations referred to below, as well as an enhanced, Company wide compliance program. The remediation plan has been developed by management in consultation with outside advisors and has been approved by the Audit Committee. 69 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) The table below sets forth the impact of this element of the restatement on our Consolidated Financial Statements for the years 2000 through 2003. The restatement also reflects periods prior to 2000; we have recorded an adjustment of $1.1 in our retained earnings at January 1, 2000. Internal Investigations Impact of Restatement Increase (Decrease) for the Years Ended and as of December 31, 2003 2002 2001 2000 Consolidated Statement of Operations: Revenue (7.2 ) (6.1 ) (2.9 ) (4.6 ) Operating Income (Loss) (17.3 ) (12.7 ) (10.3 ) (4.0 ) Provision for Income Taxes 1.2 1.9 0.7 (0.3 ) Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations (18.6 ) (14.4 ) (10.9 ) (3.7 ) Consolidated Balance Sheet: Total Assets 12.6 (2.1 ) (1.9 ) 0.5 Total Liabilities 33.8 13.7 8.6 4.3 We believe that the liabilities we have recognized relating to the investigations are our best estimate of our ultimate liability based on the facts and documents reviewed to date. While the vast majority of the investigations have yielded adjustments to our prior period financial statements reflected in the restatement, several of them are still continuing, and others may arise in the future. Management has recorded its best estimate of probable exposure based on the facts that it had at the time. We cannot predict what any ongoing investigation may uncover and what, if any, remedial actions may have to be taken. It is possible that we will be required to pay material fines, penalties, interest or other amounts associated with these investigations. Below is a summary of the cases that we have investigated that have resulted in a restatement of our prior period financial results greater than $5.0. These instances represent approximately 80% of the aggregate cumulative adjustments recorded as a result of our internal investigations. We have recorded adjustments with a cumulative impact on income for the years 2000 through 2004 of $31.8 including taxes, penalties and interest of $10.0 relating to errors we identified at our McCann agency in Turkey. These errors are attributable primarily to the retention of vendor discounts that should have been remitted to clients, the improper valuation of a previously acquired business and over billing clients for payments to vendors. Our information to date indicates that these activities involved misconduct by local senior management. When the investigation is concluded, we will determine the appropriate personnel actions, which could include terminations of local senior management. We have recorded adjustments with a cumulative impact on income for the years 2000 through 2004 of $14.5 relating to errors identified at our FCB agency in Turkey. These errors were attributable primarily to inappropriate charges to customers and evasion of local taxes. Our information to date indicates that these activities involved misconduct by local senior management. When the investigation is concluded, we will determine the appropriate personnel actions, which could include terminations of local senior management. We have recorded adjustments with a cumulative impact on income for the years 2000 through 2004 of $10.8 relating to errors we identified at Media First in New York City. These errors are attributable primarily to inadequate recordkeeping but also included payment of certain employee salaries through accounts payable and without appropriate tax withholdings. The errors resulted in 70 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) increased earn out payments. Some management personnel at the agency involved in this activity have been terminated. We have recorded adjustments with a cumulative impact on income for the years 2000 to 2004 of $10.5 relating to errors we identified at our FCB agency in Spain. These errors are attributable to the use of companies that were formed to account for the production and media volume discounts received from production suppliers on a separate set of books and records. As a result, discounts and rebates to which clients may have been entitled under local law were concealed to prevent detection in the event of a client audit. In addition, compensation was paid to an agency executives personal service company out of these companies without proper withholding for income taxes. At the same location, we have also recorded adjustments with a cumulative impact of $4.2. These errors are attributable to the inappropriate recognition of certain discounts and benefits that should have been remitted to clients. We plan to divest our interest in FCB Spain and sign an affiliation agreement with the management there with an appropriate control structure to assure future business is properly conducted. We have recorded adjustments with a cumulative impact on income for the years 2000 through 2004 of $12.7 relating to errors we identified at our McCann agency in Greece. These errors are attributable primarily to retention of vendor discounts in excess of the level permitted under Greek law and the purchase of prepaid media on a speculative basis without the appropriate client commitment. In addition, we identified inappropriate related party transactions and evidence of improper gifts. The senior officer and other management personnel at the agency have been terminated and parts of the agencys business have been divested. We have recorded adjustments with a cumulative impact on income for the years 2000 through 2004 of approximately $7.2 relating to errors we identified at our McCann agency in the Netherlands. These errors are attributable to the recognition as revenue of certain discounts and benefits that should have been returned to clients or vendors. We have terminated and or replaced local financial and operating management. We have recorded adjustments with a cumulative impact on income for the years 2000 through 2004 of $8.6 relating to errors identified at five McCann agencies in Azerbaijan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Bulgaria and Kazakhstan. These errors were attributable to failure to record and pay compensation related taxes, value added taxes and corporate income taxes, and to inadequate record keeping. Management in these jurisdictions paid certain employees as contractors, often in cash, without accounting for the payments. In three of these countries, income and expenses were recorded by a service company located outside these jurisdictions to avoid corporate tax or value added tax. We have sold or are in the process of selling all of these entities. In the case of the Ukraine, we plan on signing an affiliation agreement with the management there with appropriate controls in place to assure our business is properly conducted. In addition, the other investigations that had an impact of less than $5.0 each have resulted in adjustments with a cumulative impact on income for the years 2000 through 2004 of $11.9. The errors were similar in nature to those described above. We have terminated, or are in the process of terminating, the employees involved in these occurrences. 71 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Review of International Compensation Arrangements Over the past 18 months, we have undertaken an extensive review of employment compensation practices across our organization. While most practices were found to be acceptable, we have identified some practices in certain jurisdictions that required additional review. The key areas are as follows: Personal Service Companies. The advertising industry and many other service industries frequently make use of freelancers, who are typically treated as independent contractors and not subjected to the regulations that apply to an employee employer relationship. In certain instances, particularly in Europe and Latin America, it is common for individuals to establish a personal service company (PSC), in which case the hiring company will normally contract directly with the PSC for the services of the individual. In every jurisdiction that was reviewed, PSC arrangements are legal and often customary and socially acceptable. However, in certain circumstances, if the individual does not meet the established criteria, the PSC structure is not a permissible vehicle and could result in an avoidance of personal income tax and social tax by the individual and, in the case of the company, an avoidance of social tax. We reviewed every situation where one of our agencies had indicated that it contracted with a PSC and determined that in a number of instances, the use of a PSC was not supportable. Payment of Personal Expenses Outside the Normal Payroll Mechanism. We have also identified in certain countries, including some in which such a practice was customary and socially acceptable, instances where expenses that can be considered personal in nature were reimbursed to an individual employee outside the payroll mechanism. The practice resulted in the payment not being reported through the normal payroll system and no appropriate tax withholdings being made. We have identified those instances where we believe such practice should have been reported through the payroll system. Split Salary Payments. We identified certain instances where an individual employee received compensation from a jurisdiction outside the jurisdiction in which he was primarily employed (home country). In such instances, the paying company normally would not report or withhold local income tax on such salary payments, relying on the employee to report and remit the appropriate taxes to the country of employment. We have identified those instances where either the paying entity or the local employing entity had an affirmative obligation to report and withhold personal income and social taxes. Equity Grants and Retirement Payments. In a number of instances we identified stock option and restricted stock or retirement annuities granted to employees outside the US and upon exercise or vesting, neither the US company nor the local company reported the compensation arising therefrom or withheld applicable local tax. Instead the agency notified each employee of the employees obligation to report and withhold in the respective local country of residence or employment. We have identified certain jurisdictions where we or the local employing agency should have withheld on or reported the compensation to the local authorities. Independent Contractor/ Employees. A common issue in our industry is the retention of services by individuals in the capacity of an independent contractor instead of as an employee. There are specific criteria in every jurisdiction in which we do business which establish whether an individual is to be characterized as an employee or as an independent contractor. In a number of instances we have identified individuals who were classified as independent contractors but should have been considered employees. As it relates to the 5 issues, Personal Service Companies, payment of personal expenses outside the normal payroll mechanism, split salary payments, equity grants and retirement payments, and independent contractors/ employees, we have recorded adjustments with a cumulative impact on net income for the years 2000 through 2003 of $26.8, of which $9.9 related to PSCs. 72 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) The table below sets forth the impact of this element of the restatement on our Consolidated Financial Statements for the years 2000 through 2003. International Compensation Arrangements Impact of Restatement Increase (Decrease) for the Years Ended and as of December 31, 2003 2002 2001 2000 Consolidated Statement of Operations: Revenue Operating Income (Loss) (9.6 ) (9.4 ) (5.2 ) (5.0 ) Provision for Income Taxes (0.7 ) (0.9 ) (0.8 ) (0.4 ) Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations (8.8 ) (8.5 ) (4.4 ) (4.6 ) Consolidated Balance Sheet: Total Assets 0.7 0.9 0.8 0.4 Total Liabilities 9.6 9.4 5.2 5.0 Accounting for Lease Related Expenses Substantially all of our office space is leased from third parties. Certain of our lease contracts contain rent holidays, various escalation clauses, or landlord/tenant incentives. While it is our policy to record leases properly, in some instances we did not account for these lease provisions in accordance with GAAP, specifically, SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases, FASB Technical Bulletin (FTB) 85 3, Accounting for Operating Leases with Scheduled Rent Increases, FTB 88 1, Issues Related to Accounting for Leases, and SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. In particular: we recorded rent expense for operating leases on a cash basis, without consideration for rent holidays; we did not appropriately record or amortize landlord/tenant incentives, and in some cases, netted reimbursements with leasehold improvement assets; we did not properly record or amortize leasehold improvements over the appropriate periods, and in some cases, inappropriately amortized leasehold improvement over terms that included assumptions of lease renewals; we did not completely or accurately record asset retirement obligations related to leasehold improvement assets; and for lease properties that were part of either our 2001 or 2003 restructuring programs, these errors also impacted amounts previously recorded for restructuring. We have reviewed our significant lease arrangements in place as of December 31, 2004. We reviewed rental costs, including costs related to fixed rent escalation clauses and rent holidays, and correctly recorded them on a straight line basis over the lease term. We ensured that landlord/tenant incentives are recorded as leasehold improvement assets and amortized over the shorter of the economic useful life or the lease term. We ensured that funds received are recorded as deferred rent and amortized as reductions to rent expense over the lease term. For leasehold improvements, we recorded adjustments to amortize the related assets over the shorter of the economic useful life or the lease term, and ensured that the lease renewal is reasonably assured as that term is contemplated by SFAS No. 13 when the amortization period includes a renewal period. We ensured that asset retirement obligations are recorded completely and accurately in the period in which they are incurred and a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made, and that the amortization of the asset and accretion of the discounted liability is recognized ratably over the useful life of the leasehold improvement asset. For leased properties that were part of either our 2001 or 2003 restructuring programs, we ensured that prior period rent costs have been recorded on a straight line basis prior to time of restructuring and that deferred rent credit balances have been appropriately taken into consideration in the calculation of the related restructuring reserve at time of restructuring. 73 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) We have revised and expanded guidelines to assist personnel in analyzing and recording lease related expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operation. The impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements of this element of the restatement is presented in the following table. The restatement also affects periods prior to 2000; we have recorded an adjustment of $13.3 to retained earnings at January 1, 2000 related to lease expenses. Accounting for Leases Impact of Restatement Increase (Decrease) for the Years Ended and as of December 31, 2003 2002 2001 2000 Consolidated Statement of Operations: Revenue Operating Income (Loss) (0.6 ) 0.2 (4.0 ) (10.9 ) Provision for Income Taxes 1.6 0.2 (1.4 ) (4.0 ) Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations (2.5 ) (0.3 ) (2.9 ) (7.0 ) Consolidated Balance Sheet: Total Assets 0.5 (7.8 ) 8.3 10.0 Total Liabilities 5.9 (5.9 ) 10.1 16.3 Other Adjustments We have identified other adjustments to our Consolidated Financial Statements which do not conform to GAAP. We had previously not performed account reconciliations timely. As a result of the restatement we reconciled significant balance sheet and income statement accounts and determined that some accounts required adjustment. In our examination of accounts, we have identified a number of matters that require correction, the most significant of which are discussed below. Tax Provision: Based on our review of a global licensing structure in the Octagon Group that had been put in place prior to our acquisition of that group in 1998, it was determined that the licensing structure had resulted in incorrectly allocating reported income for statutory and income tax purposes for all years since acquisition. Based on established transfer pricing principles it is our view that the income in question should have been allocated to and reported partially within the U.K. and partially within the U.S., resulting in additional income taxes. The corrected amount of tax for years 1998 through 2003 has been recorded, including interest and penalties, and will be remitted to the respective governments. We have disclosed this change to the tax authorities in the U.S. and in the U.K. Deconsolidation of Entities: We noted several instances where an entity was fully consolidated in error. In these cases, the entity was erroneously consolidated in financial results for certain years for which we did not have effective control of the entity, and accordingly in the restatement, we recorded an adjustment to deconsolidate these entities for those years. Pension Expense Associated with Foreign Plans: Adjustments were recorded to properly state the pension expense associated with foreign plans for all years presented. Such adjustments resulted in increased pension expense for previously unidentified plans. Goodwill and Investment Impairments: Adjustments were necessary to reclass goodwill and investment impairments in the appropriate periods where the triggering event was identified to have occurred. Certain impairments had been recorded in subsequent periods and were accounted for in the appropriate periods. Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments: Adjustments were made to properly state the foreign currency translation adjustment and the foreign currency gains or losses accounts for all periods. Certain 74 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) amounts that had previously been recorded in the wrong periods have now been adjusted and accounted for in the appropriate periods. Classification Revisions: Adjustments were made to reclassify certain balance sheet, income and expense account balances for consistent application of GAAP and our policies and procedures. Such reclassification adjustments included the presentation of bank overdrafts as a liability rather than a credit balance in an asset account, intercompany accounts that had been incorrectly recorded as accounts receivable, accounts payable or other non intercompany accounts, reclassifications of long term and short term assets and liabilities and other miscellaneous income and expense account reclassifications. Certain adjustments had been recorded in subsequent periods and were accounted for in the appropriate periods. Auction rate securities have been reclassified from cash equivalents to short term marketable securities for each of the periods presented in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet based upon our evaluation of the maturity dates associated with the underlying bonds. Auction rate securities are variable rate bonds tied to short term interest rates with maturities on the face of the securities in excess of 90 days. Auction rate securities have interest rate resets, at predetermined short term intervals, usually between 7 and 35 days. They trade at par and are callable at par on any interest payment date at the option of the issuer. Interest paid during a given period is based upon the interest rate determined during the prior auction. Although these securities are issued and rated as long term bonds, they are priced and traded as short term instruments because of the significant degree of market liquidity provided through the interest rate resets. We had previously classified these instruments as cash equivalents if the period between interest rate resets was 90 days or less. Other Adjustments: We also have corrected certain known errors that were previously not recorded because in each such case we believed at the time that the amount of any such error was not material to our consolidated financial statements. Principally, these types of adjustments consist of numerous minor items. We wrote off unsubstantiated balances related to unbillable third party charges, the reversal of over accrued job costs, and fixed asset write offs for items that should not have been capitalized, could not be accounted for or were not in use. As part of our remediation of our material control weaknesses, we are in the process of hiring additional personnel with knowledge of GAAP to assist in timely reconciliations of our accounts, to ensure substantiation of amounts recorded, recognition of appropriate cut off, and management oversight of key accounts. The impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements of this element of the restatement is presented in the following table. The restatement also affects periods prior to 2000; we have recorded an adjustment of $25.9 to retained earnings at January 1, 2000 related to these miscellaneous other adjustments.

AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosed in the accompanying notes. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following critical accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity. We consider these accounting estimates to be critical because changes in the assumptions or estimates have the potential to materially impact our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our judgments, assumptions and estimates based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Management discussed with our Audit Committee the development, selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates and the application of these policies and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Revenue Recognition Our primary sources of revenue are from the planning and execution of advertising programs in various media and the planning and execution of other marketing and communications programs. The revenue for these services is recognized when all of the following criteria are satisfied: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) the price is fixed or determinable; (iii) collectibility is reasonably assured; and (iv) services have been performed. Depending on the terms of the client contract, fees for services performed can be recognized three ways: proportional performance, straight line or monthly basis or completed contract. Fees are generally recognized as earned based on the proportional performance method of revenue recognition in situations where our fee is reconcilable to the actual hours incurred to service the client as detailed in a contractual staffing plan or where the fee is earned on a per hour basis with the amount of revenue recognized in both situations limited to the amount realizable per the terms of the client contract. We believe an input based measure (the hour) is appropriate in situations where the client arrangement essentially functions as a time and out of pocket expense contract and the client receives the benefit of the services provided throughout the contract term. Fees are recognized on a straight line or monthly basis when service is provided essentially on a pro rata basis and the terms of the contract support monthly basis accounting. Certain fees (such as for major marketing events) are deferred until contract completion as the final act is so significant in relation to the service transaction taken as a whole. Fees are also recognized on a completed contract basis when the terms of the contract do not otherwise qualify for proportional performance, monthly basis recognition or the client agreement calls for the delivery of discrete projects. Incremental direct costs incurred related to contracts where revenue is accounted for on a completed contract basis are expensed as incurred. Commissions are generally earned on the date of the broadcast or publication. Contractual arrangements with clients may also include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of the revenue to our performance relative to both qualitative and quantitative goals. Performance incentives are recognized as revenue for quantitative targets when the target has been achieved and for qualitative targets when confirmation of the incentive is received. Therefore, depending on the respective client contract, revenue can contain various arrangements involving fees for services performed, commissions, performance incentive provisions or a mixture of the three. We receive credits, discounts, and other rebates from our vendors and media outlets for transactions entered into on behalf of our clients, which are passed through to our clients in accordance with 84 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) contractual provisions. If a pass through is not required, then these credits are a reduction of vendor cost, and are recorded as additions to revenue. In connection with the restatement, where it was impractical to review client contracts, we have estimated our exposure using statistical methods. If our estimate is insufficient, we may be required to recognize additional liabilities. Substantially all of our revenue is recorded as the net amount of our gross billings less pass through expenses charged to a client. In most cases, the amount that is billed to clients significantly exceeds the amount of revenue that is earned and reflected in our financial statements, because of various pass through expenses such as production and media costs. In compliance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, we assess whether the agency or the third party supplier is the primary obligor. We evaluate the terms of our client agreements as part of this assessment. In addition, we give appropriate consideration to other key indicators such as latitude in establishing price, discretion in supplier selection and credit risk to the vendor. Because we broadly operate as an advertising agency based on our primary lines of business and given the industry practice to generally record revenue on a net versus gross basis, we believe that there must be strong evidence in place to overcome the presumption of net revenue accounting. Accordingly, we generally record revenue net of pass through charges as we believe the key indicators of the business suggest we generally act as an agent on behalf of our clients in our primary lines of business. In those businesses (primarily sales promotion, event, sports and entertainment marketing and corporate and brand identity services) where the key indicators suggest we act as a principal, we record the gross amount billed to the client as revenue. In accordance with EITF 01 14, Income Statement Characterization of Reimbursements Received for Out of Pocket Expenses Incurred, we record the reimbursements received for incidental expenses as revenue. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on the aging of accounts receivable, reviews of client credit reports, industry trends and economic indicators, as well as analysis of recent payment history for specific customers. The estimate is based largely on a formula driven calculation but is supplemented with economic indicators and knowledge of potential write offs of specific client accounts. Though we consider the balance to be adequate, changes in general domestic and international economic conditions in specific markets could have a material impact on the required reserve balance. A 10% increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts would result in a $13.6 increase in bad debt expense for 2004. Income Taxes The provision for income taxes includes federal, state, local and foreign taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. The realization of our deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future earnings. Any reduction in estimated forecasted results may require that we record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets. Once a valuation allowance has been established, it will be maintained until there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized. An 85 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) ongoing pattern of sustained profitability will generally be considered as sufficient positive evidence. If the allowance is reversed in a future period, our income tax provision will be reduced to the extent of the reversal. Accordingly, the establishment and reversal of valuation allowances has had and could have a significant negative or positive impact on our future earnings. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that, if changed, would result in either an increase or decrease in the provision for income taxes in the period of change. It is our intention to reinvest undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and thereby postpone their remittance. While the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Jobs Act) creates a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate undistributed international earnings by providing an 85% dividends received deduction, we have reviewed the provisions and determined not to take advantage of this provision to repatriate undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. However, we will continue to monitor our circumstances and if there is a change which makes the use of this provision advantageous, we will be able to adopt it prior to December 31, 2005. Land, Buildings and Equipment Certain events or changes in circumstances could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the asset values associated with a given operation have become impaired. If the total of the expected future undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset, we recognize an impairment loss in the financial statements. The impairment loss is calculated by subtracting the imputed fair value from the carrying value of the asset. At least annually, we review all fixed assets for impairment. Any resulting impairment loss could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. The assignment of useful lives to buildings and equipment involves significant judgments and the use of estimates. We depreciate fixed assets using the straight line method over the assets assigned useful life. A one year decrease in the useful lives of these assets would result in a $18.4 increase in annual depreciation expense. Investments We regularly review our cost and equity investments to determine whether a significant event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have an adverse effect on the fair value of each investment. In the event a decline in fair value of an investment occurs, we must determine if the decline in market value has been other than temporary. We consider our investments strategic and long term in nature, so we must determine if the fair value decline is recoverable within a reasonable period. For investments accounted for using the cost basis or equity basis, we evaluate fair value based on specific information (valuation methodologies, estimates of appraisals, financial statements, etc.) in addition to quoted market price, if applicable. Other factors indicative of an other than temporary decline include recurring operating losses, credit defaults and subsequent rounds of financing with pricing that is below the cost basis of the investment. This list is not all inclusive; we consider all known quantitative and qualitative factors in determining if an other than temporary decline in value of an investment has occurred. Our assessments of fair value represent our best estimates at the time of impairment review. If different fair values were estimated, this could have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. We recorded an investment impairment of $63.4 for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily related to a decrease in projected operating results of an unconsolidated investment. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 86 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We account for our business combinations using the purchase accounting method. The total costs of the acquisitions are allocated to the underlying net assets, based on their respective estimated fair market values. Considering the characteristics of advertising, specialized marketing and communication services companies, our acquisitions usually do not have significant amounts of tangible and other intangible net assets. As a result, a substantial portion of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill. Determining the fair market value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires managements judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates, including but not limited to, future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives, and market multiples. We have three types of intangible assets: (1) goodwill; (2) other intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization; and (3) other intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization. We perform a review annually of all intangible assets as of September 30th or whenever events or significant changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Events or circumstances that might require the need for more frequent tests include, but are not limited to, the loss of a number of significant clients, the identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit, negative financial performance, the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit, or a significant adverse change in business climate or regulations. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at a reporting unit level and test for impairment at least annually. Reporting units are either the entities at the operating segment level or one level below the operating segment level. We identified 13 reporting units for the 2004 impairment testing. All goodwill relates to, and is assigned directly to, specific reporting units. The first step of the impairment test is a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. Goodwill allocated to a reporting unit whose fair value is equal to or greater than its carrying value is not impaired and no further testing is required. If the fair value of a reporting units goodwill is less than its carrying value, a second impairment step will be performed to determine if impairment exists. The second step of the goodwill impairment test is a comparison of the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill to its carrying value. Goodwill of a reporting unit is impaired when its carrying value exceeds its implied fair value. Impaired goodwill is written down to its implied fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified. The fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using our projections of discounted future operating cash flows (without interest) of the unit. Such projections require the use of significant estimates and assumptions as to matters such as future revenue growth, profit margins, capital expenditures, assumed tax rates and discount rates. We believe that the estimates and assumptions made are reasonable but are susceptible to change from period to period. Additionally, our strategic decisions or changes in market valuation multiples could lead to further impairment charges. Actual results of operations, cash flows and other factors used in a discounted cash flow valuation will likely differ from the estimates used and it is possible that differences and changes could be material. Other intangible assets include customer lists, trade names and customer relationships. Intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization are tested for impairment in the same manner as goodwill as described above. Intangible assets with definitive lives subject to amortization are amortized on a straight line basis with estimated useful lives generally ranging from 1 to 15 years and are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that a carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the total of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset, a loss is recognized for the difference between fair value and the carrying value of the asset in the period the impairment is identified. 87 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Our annual impairment review as of September 30, 2004 resulted in impairment charges of $311.9 that were recorded at three reporting units. See Notes 7 and 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. The excess of the low range of the fair value over the carrying value for each of the non impaired reporting units ranged from approximately $6.4 to approximately $1,501.9. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 10% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value for each of the non impaired reporting units ranging from approximately $3.4 to approximately $871.9. Acquisitions The majority of our acquisitions include an initial payment at the time of closing and provide for additional contingent purchase price payments over a specified time. The initial purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values with any excess being recorded as goodwill. These contingent payments (earn outs) are calculated based on estimates of the future financial performance of the acquired entity, the timing of the exercise of these rights, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other factors. Earn out payments are either recorded as an increase to goodwill and other intangibles or expensed as compensation based on the acquisition agreement and the terms of employment for the former owners of the acquired businesses. Earn out payments are recorded within the financial statements once the contingent acquisition obligations have been met and the consideration is distributable. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this report and Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding future contingent acquisition obligations. Restructuring Reserves When appropriate, we establish restructuring reserves for severance and termination costs and lease termination and other exit costs related to our restructuring programs. We have established reserves for restructuring programs initiated in 2001 and 2003. The reserves reflect our best estimates for the costs of the plans. However, actual results may differ from the estimated amounts based on, but not limited to, changes in demand for advertising services and unexpected usage of leased properties. Comparison of actual results to estimates may materially impact the amount of the restructuring charges. In 2004, we recorded adjustments to the restructuring reserves of $22.6 and $9.4 for changes in management estimates related to the 2003 and 2001 programs, respectively. We will continue to monitor our restructuring reserves and may adjust the current balances based on future events. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Pension and Postretirement Benefits We use numerous actuarial assumptions and methods in the determination of our pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations. The discount rate is the major assumption, which impacts our benefit cost and recorded obligations for pension and postretirement plans. Discount rates used for our benefit plans attempt to match the duration of the underlying liability with highly rated securities that could be used to effectively settle the obligation. For 2004, a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would have increased our net benefit cost by approximately $1.8. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 88 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) OTHER MATTERS SEC Investigation In January 2003, the SEC issued a formal order of investigation related to our restatements of earnings for periods dating back to 1997. On April 20, 2005, we received a subpoena from the SEC under authority of the order of investigation requiring production of additional documents relating to the potential restatement we announced in March 2005. The SEC is investigating the restatement detailed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We are cooperating fully with the investigation. RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Please refer to Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete description of recent accounting pronouncements that have affected us or may affect us. 89 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks related to interest rates and foreign currency rates. From time to time, we use derivatives, pursuant to established guidelines and policies, to manage some portion of these risks. Derivative instruments utilized in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools, involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest Rates Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations. At December 31, 2004, a significant portion (81.1%) of our debt obligations bore interest at fixed interest rates. Accordingly, assuming the fixed rate debt is not refinanced, there would be no impact on interest expense or cash flow from either a 10% increase or decrease in market rates of interest. The fair market value of the debt obligations would decrease by approximately $16.3 if market rates were to increase by 10% and would increase by approximately $19.5 if market rates were to decrease by 10%. For that portion of the debt that bore interest at variable rates, based on outstanding amounts and rates at December 31, 2004, interest expense and cash out flow would increase or decrease by approximately $1.8 if market rates were to increase or decrease by 10%, respectively. From time to time we have used interest rate swaps to manage the mix of our fixed and floating rate debt obligations. In May 2005, we terminated all our existing long term interest rate swap agreements, and currently have none outstanding. Foreign Currencies We face translation and transaction risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Amounts invested in our foreign operations are translated into US Dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the stockholders equity section of our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in currencies other than the US Dollar, mitigating transaction risk. Since the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally the local currency, foreign currency translation of the balance sheet is reflected as a component of stockholders equity and does not impact operating results. Revenues and expenses in foreign currencies translate into varying amounts of US Dollars depending upon whether the US Dollar weakens or strengthens against other currencies. Therefore, changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses (as expressed in US Dollars) from foreign operations. Currency transaction gains or losses arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in results of operations and were not significant in the year ended December 31, 2004. We have not entered into a material amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 90 Table of Contents
