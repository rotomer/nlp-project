OVERVIEW Our Business We are one of the worlds largest advertising and marketing services companies, comprised of hundreds of communication agencies around the world that deliver custom marketing solutions on behalf of our clients. Our agencies cover the spectrum of marketing disciplines and specialties, from traditional services such as consumer advertising and direct marketing, to newer disciplines such as experiential marketing and branded entertainment. With offices in over 100 countries and approximately 43,000 employees, our agencies work with our clients to create global and local marketing campaigns that cross borders and media. These marketing programs seek to build brands, influence consumer behavior and sell products. 17 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Interpublic maintains separate agency brands to manage the broadest range of clients, even ones that operate in similar business areas. Having distinct agencies allows us to avoid potential conflicts of interest among our clients in the same industry. To help manage these companies effectively, however, we have organized our agencies into five global operating divisions. Four of these divisions, McCann WorldGroup (McCann), The FCB Group (FCB), Lowe Worldwide (Lowe) and Draft Worldwide (Draft), provide a distinct, comprehensive array of global communications and marketing services. The fifth global operating division, The Constituency Management Group (CMG), which includes Weber Shandwick, MWW Group, FutureBrand, DeVries, Golin Harris, Jack Morton and Octagon Worldwide (Octagon), provides clients with diversified services, including public relations, meeting and event production, sports and entertainment marketing, corporate and brand identity and strategic marketing consulting. A group of leading stand alone agencies provide clients with a full range of advertising and marketing services. These agencies partner with our global operating groups as needed, and include Campbell Ewald, Hill Holiday, Deutsch and Mullen. We believe this organizational structure allows us to provide comprehensive solutions for clients, enables stronger financial and operational growth opportunities and allows us to improve operating efficiencies within our organization. We practice a decentralized management style, providing agency management with a great deal of operational autonomy, while holding them broadly responsible for their agencies financial and operational performance. As of December 31, 2005, for financial reporting purposes we have three reportable segments. The largest segment, Integrated Agency Networks (IAN), is comprised of McCann, FCB, Lowe, Draft, our media agencies, and our leading stand alone agencies. CMG comprises our second reportable segment. Our third reportable segment is comprised of our Motorsports operations (Motorsports), which were sold during 2004 and had immaterial residual operating results in 2005. Business Drivers Our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of advertising programs in various media and the planning and execution of other marketing and communications programs. Most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and accordingly, the terms of client engagements and the basis on which we earn commissions and fees vary significantly. Our client contracts are also becoming increasingly complex arrangements that frequently include provisions for incentive compensation and govern vendor rebates and credits. Revenues for creation, planning and placement of advertising are primarily determined on a negotiated fee basis and, to a lesser extent, on a commission basis. Fees are usually calculated to reflect hourly rates plus proportional overhead and a mark up. Many clients include an incentive compensation component in their total compensation package. This provides added revenue based on achieving mutually agreed upon qualitative and or quantitative metrics within specified time periods. Commissions are earned based on services provided, and are usually derived from a percentage or fee over the total cost to complete the assignment. Commissions can also be derived when clients pay us the gross rate billed by media and we pay for media at a lower net rate; the difference is the commission that we earn, which is either retained in total or shared with the client depending on the nature of the services agreement. We pay media charges with respect to contracts for advertising time or space that we place on behalf of our clients. To reduce our risk from a clients non payment, we typically pay media charges only after we receive funds from our clients. Generally, we act as the clients agent rather than the primary obligor. In some instances we agree with the media provider that we will only be liable to pay the media after the client has paid us for the media charges. 18 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) We also generate revenue in negotiated fees from our public relations, sales promotion, event marketing, sports and entertainment marketing and corporate and brand identity services. Our revenue is directly dependent upon the advertising, marketing and corporate communications requirements of our clients and tends to be higher in the second half of the calendar year as a result of the holiday season and lower in the first half as a result of the post holiday slow down in client activity. Depending on the terms of the client contract, fees for services performed can be primarily recognized three ways: proportional performance, straight line (or monthly basis) or completed contract. Fee revenue recognized on a completed contract basis also contributes to the higher seasonal revenues experienced in the fourth quarter due to the majority of our contracts ending at December 31. As is customary in the industry, these contracts provide for termination by either party on relatively short notice, usually 90 days. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our revenue recognition accounting policies. Our revenue is driven by our ability to maintain and grow existing business, as well as generate new business. Our business is directly affected by economic conditions in the industries and regions we serve and by the marketing and advertising requirements and practices of our clients and potential clients. When economic conditions decline, companies generally decrease advertising and marketing budgets, and it becomes more difficult to achieve profitability. Our business is highly competitive, which tends to mitigate our pricing power and that of our competition. We believe that expanding the range of services we provide to our key clients is critical to our continued growth. We are focused on strengthening our collaboration across agencies, which we believe will increase our ability to better service existing clients and win new clients. 2005 Performance The primary focus of our business analysis is on operating performance, specifically, changes in revenues and operating expenses. We analyze the increase or decrease in revenue by reviewing the components of the change, including: the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes, the impact of net acquisitions and divestitures, and the balance, which we refer to as organic revenue change. As economic conditions and demand for our services can vary between geographic regions, we also analyze revenues by domestic and international sources. Our operating expenses are in two primary categories: salaries and related expenses, and office and general expenses. As with revenue, we analyze the increase or decrease in operating expenses by reviewing the following components of the change: the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes, the impact of net acquisitions and divestitures, and the organic component of the change. Salaries and related expenses tend to fluctuate with changes in revenues and are measured as a percentage of revenues. Office and general expenses, which have both a fixed and variable component, tend not to vary as much with revenue. Our financial performance over the past several years has lagged behind that of our industry peers, due to lower revenue growth, as well as impairment, restructuring and other charges. 2005 performance was impacted by higher salaries and related and office and general expenses and lower revenues as discussed in more detail below. However, both impairment and restructuring charges have decreased and we are no longer burdened with Motorsports related costs. 19 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Strategic Initiatives Organic revenue growth and improving operating margin are our key corporate metrics. Our performance priorities are to: Achieve organic revenue growth by strengthening collaboration among our agencies, increasing the number of marketing services provided to existing clients and winning new clients. We have established a supplemental incentive plan, expanded internal tools and resources, and heightened internal communications aimed at encouraging collaboration. We have also focused our efforts on attracting and retaining the highest quality industry talent and further improving client retention. We analyze our performance by calculating the percentage increase in revenue related to organic growth between comparable periods. Improve operating margin by increasing revenue and by controlling salaries and related expenses, as well as office and general expenses. In addition, we are working to improve our back office efficiency through our shared services initiatives as well as improve our real estate utilization. We analyze our performance by comparing revenue to prior periods and measuring salaries and related expenses, as well as office and general expenses, as a percentage of revenue. We define operating margin as operating income divided by reported revenue. Our revenue is directly dependent upon the advertising, marketing and corporate communications requirements of our clients. Historically, we typically experience increased revenue and profitability in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year as a result of increased holiday related client spending activity. The increase in fourth quarter revenue and profitability is also attributable to higher seasonal revenues due to the timing of revenue recognition for contracts that are accounted for on the completed contract method. For the three years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, our fourth quarter revenue as a percentage of the respective full year revenue was approximately 30% for all years. Organic Changes Organic Changes for the Three for the Years Ended Months Ended December 31, December 31, Increase (Decrease) 2005 2004 2005 2004 Revenue $ (45.7 ) $ 75.6 $ (34.1 ) $ 44.5 Salaries and related expenses $ 293.4 $ 142.6 $ 116.7 $ 73.6 Office and general expenses $ 112.4 $ (13.9 ) $ 26.3 $ 47.1 The organic decrease in revenue for the year ended and three months ended December 31, 2005 was $45.7 and $34.1, respectively when compared to the comparative period in 2004. Operating margin declined for the year ended and three months ended December 31, 2005 due to a significant organic increase in salaries and related expenses for the year ended and three months ended December 31, 2005 of $293.4 and $116.7, respectively when compared to the prior year, and an organic increase in office and general expenses for year ended and three months ended December 31, 2005 of $112.4 and $26.3, respectively when compared to the prior year. See below for discussion of the drivers of these changes. Included in our results of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2005 were certain out of period adjustments that resulted in decreased revenue and operating income of $17.3 and $21.6, respectively. When compared to the slight organic decrease in revenue and significant organic increase in salaries and related expenses and office and general expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2005, these out of period adjustments were immaterial to our quarterly results of operations. These adjustments were immaterial to the annual period ended December 31, 2005 and to any other prior annual period. 20 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) For the Years For the Three Ended Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2005 2004 2005 2004 Organic revenue change percentage (vs. prior year) (0.7 )% 1.2 % (1.7 )% 2.4 % Operating margin percentage (1.7 )% (1.5 )% 3.0 % 15.9 % Salaries and related expenses as a percentage of revenue 63.7 % 58.4 % 58.4 % 52.0 % Office and general expenses as a percentage of revenue 36.5 % 35.2 % 33.6 % 32.1 % Organic revenue growth. In 2005, we experienced a small organic revenue decrease, compared to small organic revenue growth in 2004. The decrease resulted from client losses and a reduction in revenue from existing clients at IAN, offset partially by an increase at CMG due to client wins and additional business from existing clients in the U.S. and Europe. As a result, there were domestic and international organic revenue decreases of 0.5% and 0.9%, respectively. We experienced a small organic revenue decrease for the three months ended December 31, 2005 when compared to the comparative periods in 2004. Operating margin. Our operating margin was negative in 2005 and 2004. The decline in 2005 resulted from organic revenue decreases and increases in salaries and related as well as office and general expenses. Salaries and related expenses increased, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of revenues, due to increased severance expense as international headcount reductions occurred across several agencies. In addition, the increase was attributable to hiring additional creative talent to enable future revenue growth and additional staff to address weaknesses in our accounting and control environment and to develop shared services, which almost offset the number of employees severed. Office and general expenses increased, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of revenues, primarily due to higher professional fees associated with the Prior Restatement and our ongoing efforts in internal control compliance. Salary expense attributable to the additional headcount and the costs of remedying our internal control weaknesses will continue to be significant in 2006. These negative impacts to operating margin were partially offset by a decrease in the amount of charges related to impairment, restructuring and contract termination costs. If not for the reduction in these charges, our operating margin would have deteriorated significantly from 2004 to 2005 as described above. During 2005, we recorded asset impairments of $98.6, restructuring reversals of $7.3 and had no contract termination charges related to the Motorsports business, which is a $406.7 decrease when compared to these charges in 2004. Operating margin in 2004 was impacted by approximately $322.2 of asset impairment charges, $62.2 of restructuring charges and $113.6 of contract termination costs related to the Motorsports business. For the three months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, our operating margin decreased significantly, to 3.0% from 15.9%. The decline in 2005 resulted from significant increases in salaries and related expenses and impairment charges, as well an increase in office and general expenses and an organic revenue decrease. Salaries and related expenses significantly increased, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of revenues, primarily due to an increase in severance expense as international headcount reductions occurred across several agencies as a result of client losses. In addition, the increase was attributable to hiring additional creative talent to enable future revenue growth and staff to address weaknesses in our accounting and control environment. During the three months ended December 31, 2005, impairment charges of $92.1 were recorded primarily related to our Lowe reporting unit following a major client loss and recent management defections. Office and general expenses increased, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of revenues, primarily due to higher production and media expenses 21 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) due to an increase in arrangements where we act as principal, which requires us to record expenses on a gross basis, as well as higher professional fees. Significant 2005 Activity and Subsequent Events Income Statement Total salaries and related expenses increased by approximately $266.1 to $3,999.1 for 2005. This increase includes higher severance expense, which increased by approximately $87.9 to $162.5. Severance activity in 2005 covered approximately 3,000 employees, of which approximately 2,500 had left the Company by year end. Our severance actions were concentrated in our international businesses and included several agencies, mostly within IAN. The increase of salaries and related expenses was also attributable to hiring in several areas of our business, including creative talent to enable future revenue growth, and finance and information technology staff to address weaknesses in our accounting and control environment, as well as to develop shared services, which approximately offset the number of employees addressed by severance during the year. A net charge of $69.9 was recorded to increase our valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets primarily relating to foreign net operating loss carry forwards, in relation to which we do not have the historical earning trends or tax planning strategies necessary to recognize the benefits of operating losses. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Total professional fees increased $94.8 to $332.8 for 2005. These increases related primarily to our ongoing efforts in internal control compliance, the Prior Restatement process and the preliminary application development and maintenance of information technology systems and processes related to our shared services initiatives. Professional fees are included in office and general expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Long lived asset impairment charges of $98.6 were recorded, including $91.0 of goodwill impairments at Lowe following a major client loss and recent management defections and $5.8 at an agency within our sports and entertainment marketing business. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Operating Cash Flow Our operating activities utilized cash of approximately $20.2, compared to cash provided by operating activities of $464.8 in 2004. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2005 was primarily attributable to significant increases in our operating costs. Additional cash was used during 2005 for severance costs primarily related to international headcount reductions, salary costs primarily attributable to our hiring additional creative talent to enable future revenue growth and additional staff to address weaknesses in our accounting and control environment, and professional fees primarily related to our Prior Restatement and our ongoing efforts in internal control compliance. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2005 was also attributable to year over year changes in working capital accounts. Financing Activities Throughout 2005, we entered into waivers and amendments to our 364 Day and Three Year Revolving Credit Facilities related to our reporting requirements, financial covenants and the Prior Restatement. 22 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) In July 2005, we completed the issuance and sale of our $250.0 Floating Rate Notes due 2008 and used the proceeds to redeem all $250.0 of our 7.875% Senior Unsecured Notes maturing October 2005. In September 2005 our $250.0 364 Day Revolving Credit Facility expired. In October 2005, we added a new bank to the syndicate of our Three Year Revolving Credit Facility, increasing the size of the facility by $50.0 to $500.0. In October 2005, we issued 0.525 shares of our 5.25% Series B Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock at gross proceeds of $525.0, with net proceeds totaling approximately $507.3 after deducting discounts to the initial purchasers and the estimated expenses of the offering. Subsequent to 2005 On March 21, 2006, we entered into an amendment to our Three Year Revolving Credit Facility, effective as of December 31, 2005. The amendment changed the financial covenants with respect to periods ended December 31, 2005, March 31, 2006 and June 30, 2006, added a new minimum cash balance covenant and amended the provisions governing letters of credit to permit the issuance of letters of credit with expiration dates beyond the termination date of the facility, subject to certain conditions. We also obtained a waiver from the lenders under the Three Year Revolving Credit Facility in March, 2006, to waive any default arising from the restatement of our financials presented in this report. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Results of Operations 2005 Compared to 2004 REVENUE The components of the 2005 change were as follows: Total Domestic International $ % Change $ % Change % of Total $ % Change % of Total 2004 $ 6,387.0 $ 3,509.2 54.9 % $ 2,877.8 45.1 % Foreign currency changes 40.4 0.6 % 0.0 % 40.4 1.4 % Net acquisitions/divestitures (107.4 ) (1.7 )% (28.9 ) (0.8 )% (78.5 ) (2.7 )% Organic (45.7 ) (0.7 )% (19.2 ) (0.5 )% (26.5 ) (0.9 )% Total change (112.7 ) (1.8 )% (48.1 ) (1.4 )% (64.6 ) (2.2 )% 2005 $ 6,274.3 $ 3,461.1 55.2 % $ 2,813.2 44.8 % For the year ended December 31, 2005, consolidated revenues decreased $112.7, or 1.8%, as compared to 2004, which was attributable to the effect of net acquisitions and divestitures of $107.4 and an organic revenue decrease of $45.7, partially offset by favorable foreign currency exchange rate changes of $40.4. The increase due to foreign currency changes was primarily attributable to the strengthening of the Brazilian Real and the Canadian Dollar in relation to the U.S. Dollar, which primarily affected our IAN segment. The net effect of acquisitions and divestitures is comprised of $46.0 at IAN, largely from dispositions at McCann during 2005, $12.1 at CMG and $49.3 from the sale of the Motorsports business during 2004. 23 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) During 2005, the organic revenue decrease of $45.7, or 0.7%, was driven by a decrease at IAN, partially offset by an increase at CMG. The decrease at IAN was a result of client losses and a reduction in revenue from existing clients primarily in our European offices. The increase at CMG was primarily driven by growth in public relations and sports marketing business both domestically and internationally as a result of increased revenue from existing clients and new client wins. For 2006, we expect the organic change in revenue to be flat or to decline due to the continuing impact of client losses that we experienced during 2005. Our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104, Revenue Recognition. This accounting guidance governs the timing of when revenue is recognized. Accordingly, if work is being performed in a given quarter but there is insufficient evidence of an arrangement, the related revenue is deferred to a future quarter when the evidence is obtained. However, our costs of services are primarily expensed as incurred, except that incremental direct costs may be deferred under a significant long term contract until complete. With revenue being deferred until completion of the contract and costs primarily expensed as incurred, this will have a negative impact on our operating margin until the revenue can be recognized and in the period of revenue recognition. While this will not affect cash flow and did not have a significant impact on revenue recognition in 2005 as compared to 2004, it may affect organic revenue growth and margins in future periods. This effect is likely to be greater in comparing quarters than in comparing full years. In addition, we fulfill the role of an agent in most of our customer contracts however, in certain arrangements we act as principal. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 99 19, when we act as principal, we recognize gross revenue and expenses inclusive of external media or production costs; when we act as an agent, we recognize revenue net of such costs. The mix of where we act as agent and where we act as principal is contract dependent and varies from agency to agency, and from period to period. Accordingly, while our cash flows and profitability are not impacted, and while this effect did not have a significant impact on revenue in 2005 compared to 2004, it may affect organic revenue growth patterns in future periods. OPERATING EXPENSES For the Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 % of % of $ Revenue $ Revenue $ Change % Change Salaries and related expenses $ 3,999.1 63.7 % $ 3,733.0 58.4 % $ 266.1 7.1 % Office and general expenses 2,288.1 36.5 % 2,250.4 35.2 % 37.7 1.7 % Restructuring charges (7.3 ) 62.2 (69.5 ) (111.7 )% Long lived asset impairment and other charges 98.6 322.2 (223.6 ) (69.4 )% Motorsports contract termination costs 113.6 (113.6 ) (100.0 )% Total operating expenses $ 6,378.5 $ 6,481.4 $ (102.9 ) (1.6 )% 24 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC.

During 2005, salaries and related expenses increased to 63.7% of revenues, compared to 58.4% in 2004. In 2005, salaries and related expenses increased $293.4, excluding the increase related to foreign currency exchange rate changes of $19.3 and a decrease related to net acquisitions and divestitures of $46.6. Salaries and related expenses were impacted by changes in foreign currency rates, primarily attributable to the strengthening of the Brazilian Real and the Canadian Dollar in relation to the U.S. Dollar. The increase due to foreign currency rate changes was partially offset by the impact of net acquisitions and divestitures activity, which resulted largely from dispositions at McCann during 2005 and the sale of the Motorsports business during 2004. The increase in salaries and related expenses, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of revenue, excluding the impact of foreign currency and net acquisitions and divestitures, was primarily the result of higher severance expense, largely recorded in the fourth quarter for international headcount reductions within IAN as a result of client losses. In addition, the increase was attributable to our hiring additional creative talent to enable future revenue growth and additional staff to address weaknesses in our accounting and control environment and develop shared services at certain locations, which almost offset the number of employees severed. The increase in salaries and related expense as a percentage of revenue was also due, in part, to the fact that revenue decreased at the same time that salaries and related expenses increased for the reasons explained above. Office and General Expenses The components of the 2005 change were as follows: Total % of $ % Change Revenue 2004 $ 2,250.4 35.2 % Foreign currency changes 13.9 0.6 % Net acquisitions/divestitures (88.6 ) (3.9 )% Organic 112.4 5.0 % Total change 37.7 1.7 % 2005 $ 2,288.1 36.5 % 25 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Office and general expenses primarily consists of rent, office and equipment, depreciation, professional fees, other overhead expenses and certain out of pocket expenses related to our revenue. During 2005, office and general expenses increased to 36.5% of revenues, compared to 35.2% in 2004, largely due to the decrease in revenue year on year. In 2005, office and general expenses increased $112.4, excluding the increase related to foreign currency exchange rate changes of $13.9 and a decrease related to net acquisitions and divestitures of $88.6. Office and general expenses were impacted by changes in foreign currency rates, primarily attributable to the strengthening of the Brazilian Real and Canadian Dollar in relation to the U.S. Dollar. The increase due to foreign currency rate changes was offset by the impact of net acquisitions and divestitures activity, which resulted largely from dispositions at McCann during 2005 and the sale of the Motorsports business and McCanns Transworld Marketing during 2004. The increase in office and general expenses, excluding the impact of foreign currency and net acquisition and divestitures activity, was primarily the result of higher professional fees at both IAN and our Corporate group driven by our ongoing efforts in internal control compliance, the Prior Restatement process and the preliminary application development and maintenance of information technology systems and processes related to our shared services initiatives. Except for the costs associated with the Prior Restatement process, these costs will continue to significantly impact financial results in 2006. Restructuring (Reversals) Charges During 2005 and 2004, we recorded net (reversals) and charges related to lease termination and other exit costs and severance and termination costs for the 2003 and 2001 restructuring programs of ($7.3) and $62.2, respectively. Included in the net (reversals) and charges were adjustments resulting from changes in managements estimates for the 2003 and 2001 restructuring programs which decreased the restructuring reserves by $9.3 and $32.0 in 2005 and 2004, respectively. 2005 net reversals primarily consisted of changes to managements estimates for the 2003 and 2001 restructuring programs primarily relating to our lease termination costs. 2004 net charges primarily related to the vacating of 43 offices and workforce reduction of approximately 400 employees related to the 2003 restructuring program and adjustments to managements estimates for the 2001 restructuring program. A summary of the net (reversals) and charges by segment is as follows: Lease Termination and Other Exit Costs Severance and Termination Costs 2003 2001 2003 2001 Program Program Total Program Program Total Total 2005 Net (Reversals) Charges IAN $ (6.3 ) $ (0.3 ) $ (6.6 ) $ (0.4 ) $ $ (0.4 ) $ (7.0 ) CMG 1.1 0.2 1.3 (0.7 ) (0.7 ) 0.6 Corporate (0.2 ) (0.4 ) (0.6 ) (0.3 ) (0.3 ) (0.9 ) Total $ (5.4 ) $ (0.5 ) $ (5.9 ) $ (1.4 ) $ $ (1.4 ) $ (7.3 ) 2004 Net (Reversals) Charges IAN $ 40.3 $ (7.3 ) $ 33.0 $ 14.1 $ (4.3 ) $ 9.8 $ 42.8 CMG 8.1 4.0 12.1 5.1 (0.7 ) 4.4 16.5 Corporate 3.7 (1.0 ) 2.7 0.3 (0.1 ) 0.2 2.9 Total $ 52.1 $ (4.3 ) $ 47.8 $ 19.5 $ (5.1 ) $ 14.4 $ 62.2 26 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) In addition to amounts recorded as restructuring charges, we recorded charges of $11.1 during 2004 related to the accelerated amortization of leasehold improvements on properties included in the 2003 program. These charges were included in office and general expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For additional information, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Long Lived Asset Impairment and Other Charges Long lived assets include land, buildings, equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets. Buildings, equipment and other intangible assets with finite lives are depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over their respective estimated useful lives. When necessary, we record an impairment charge for the amount that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the implied fair value. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for fair value determination and impairment testing methodologies. The following table summarizes long lived asset impairment and other charges: For the Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 Motor Motor IAN CMG sports Total IAN CMG sports Total Goodwill impairment $ 97.0 $ $ $ 97.0 $ 220.2 $ 91.7 $ $ 311.9 Fixed asset impairment 0.5 0.5 2.0 0.4 3.0 5.4 Other 1.0 0.1 1.1 4.9 4.9 Total $ 98.5 $ 0.1 $ $ 98.6 $ 227.1 $ 92.1 $ 3.0 $ 322.2 The long lived asset impairment charges recorded in 2005 and 2004 are due to the following: 2005 Impairments IAN During the fourth quarter of 2005, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $91.0 at our Lowe reporting unit. A triggering event occurred subsequent to our 2005 annual impairment test that led us to believe that Lowes goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets may no longer be recoverable. As a result, we were required to assess whether our goodwill balance at Lowe was impaired. Specifically, in the fourth quarter, a major client was lost by Lowes London agency and the possibility of losing other clients is now considered a higher risk due to recent management defections and changes in the competitive landscape. This caused projected revenue growth to decline. As a result of these changes our long term projections showed declines in discounted future operating cash flows. These revised cash flows caused the implied fair value of Lowes goodwill to be less than the book value. During the third quarter of 2005 as restated, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $5.8 at a reporting unit within our sports and entertainment marketing business. The long term projections showed previously unanticipated declines in discounted future operating cash flows and, as a result, these discounted future operating cash flows caused the implied fair value of goodwill to be less than the related book value. 2004 Impairments IAN During the third quarter of 2004, we recorded goodwill impairment charges of $220.2 at The Partnership reporting unit, which was comprised of Lowe Worldwide, Draft Worldwide, Mullen, Dailey & Associates and Berenter Greenhouse & Webster (BGW). Our long term projections showed previously unanticipated declines in discounted future operating cash flows due to recent client losses, reduced client spending, and declining industry valuation metrics. These discounted future operating cash flow projections 27 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) caused the estimated fair value of The Partnership to be less than the book value. The Partnership was subsequently disbanded in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the remaining goodwill was allocated based on the relative fair value of the agencies at the time of disbandment. CMG As a result of the annual impairment review, a goodwill impairment charge of $91.7 was recorded at our CMG reporting unit, which was comprised of Weber Shandwick, GolinHarris, DeVries, MWW Group and FutureBrand. The fair value of CMG was adversely affected by declining industry market valuation metrics, specifically, a decrease in the EBITDA multiples used in the underlying valuation calculations. The impact of the lower EBITDA multiples caused the calculated fair value of CMG goodwill to be less than the related book value. For additional information, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Motorsports Contract Termination Costs As discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, during 2004, we recorded a pretax charge of $113.6 related to a series of agreements with the British Racing Drivers Club and Formula One Administration Limited which released us from certain guarantees and lease obligations in the United Kingdom. We have exited this business and do not anticipate any additional material charges. EXPENSE AND OTHER INCOME For the Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 $ Change % Change Interest expense $ (181.9 ) $ (172.0 ) $ (9.9 ) 5.8 % Debt prepayment penalty (1.4 ) (9.8 ) 8.4 (85.7 )% Interest income 80.0 50.8 29.2 57.5 % Investment impairments (12.2 ) (63.4 ) 51.2 (80.8 )% Litigation reversals (charges) 32.5 (32.5 ) (100.0 )% Other income (expense) 33.1 (10.7 ) 43.8 (409.3 )% Total $ (82.4 ) $ (172.6 ) $ 90.2 (52.3 )% Interest Expense The increase in interest expense of $9.9 during 2005 was primarily due to waiver and consent fees incurred for the amendment of our existing debt agreements in 2005 and higher average interest rates on newly issued debt when compared to extinguished debt. Our interest income and interest expense reflect daily balances which may vary from period end balances. They also reflect the gross amounts of debt and cash under certain of our cash pooling arrangements that are reflected on a net basis on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Debt Prepayment Penalty During the third quarter of 2005, a prepayment penalty of $1.4 was recorded related to the early redemption of the remaining $250.0 of the 7.875% Senior Unsecured Notes due in 2005. During the fourth quarter of 2004, a prepayment penalty of $9.8 was recorded related to the early redemption of $250.0 of our 7.875% Senior Unsecured Notes due in 2005, which represented one half of the then $500.0 outstanding. 28 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Interest Income The increase in interest income of $29.2 during 2005 was primarily due to an increase in average interest rates as well an increase in cash and cash equivalents primarily resulting from our Series B Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock offering. Our interest income and interest expense reflect daily balances which may vary from period end balances. They also reflect the gross amounts of debt and cash under certain of our cash pooling arrangements that are reflected on a net basis on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Investment Impairments During 2005, we recorded investment impairment charges of $12.2, primarily related to a $7.1 charge for our remaining unconsolidated investment in Koch Tavares in Latin America to adjust the carrying amount of the investment to fair value as a result of our intent to sell and a $3.7 charge related to a decline in value of certain available for sale investments that were determined to be other than temporary. During 2004, we recorded investment impairment charges of $63.4, primarily related to a $50.9 charge for an unconsolidated investment in German advertising agency Springer & Jacoby as a result of a decrease in projected operating results. Additionally, we recorded impairment charges of $4.7 related to unconsolidated affiliates primarily in Israel, Brazil, Japan and India, and $7.8 related to several other available for sale investments. Litigation Charges During 2004, with court approval of the settlement of the class action shareholder suits discussed in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we received $20.0 from insurance proceeds which we recorded as a reduction in litigation charges because we had not previously established a receivable. We also recorded a reduction of $12.5 relating to a decrease in the share price between the tentative settlement date and the final settlement date. Other Income (Expense) In 2005, other income (expense) included net gains from the sales of businesses of $10.1, net gains on sales of available for sale securities and miscellaneous investment income of $20.3 and $2.6 related to credits adjustments. The principal components of net gains from the sales of businesses relate to the sale of Target Research, a McCann agency, during the fourth quarter of 2005, which resulted in a gain of $18.6, offset partially by a sale of a significant component of FCB Spain during the fourth quarter of 2005 which resulted in a loss of approximately $13.0. The principal components of net gains on sales of available for sale securities and miscellaneous investment income relate to the sale of our remaining ownership interest in Delaney Lund Knox Warren & Partners, an agency within FCB, for a gain of approximately $8.3, and net gains on sales of available for sale securities of $7.9, of which approximately $3.8 relates to appreciation of Rabbi Trust investments restricted for the purpose of paying our deferred compensation and deferred benefit arrangement liabilities. In 2005, we also recorded $2.6 for the settlement of our contractual liabilities for vendor credits and discounts. This amount represents a negotiated client settlement below the amount originally recorded. It is recorded as Other Income because we do not view negotiating a favorable outcome as a revenue generating activity. In 2004, other income (expense) included $18.2 of net losses on the sale of 19 agencies. The losses related primarily to the sale of McCanns Transworld Marketing, a U.S. based promotions agency, which 29 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) resulted in a loss of $8.6, and a $6.2 loss for the final liquidation of the Motorsports investment. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Motorsports disposition. OTHER ITEMS Income Taxes For the Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 $ Change % Change Provision for income taxes $ 81.9 $ 262.2 $ (180.3 ) (68.8 )% Effective tax rate 43.9 % 98.2 % Our effective tax rate was negatively impacted in both 2005 and 2004 by the establishment of valuation allowances, as described below, and non deductible long lived asset impairment charges. In 2004, our effective tax rate was also impacted by pretax charges and related tax benefits resulting from the Motorsports contract termination costs. The difference between the effective tax rate and the statutory federal rate of 35% is also due to state and local taxes and the effect of non U.S. operations. Valuation Allowance Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, we are required, on a quarterly basis, to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets. SFAS No. 109 requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. In circumstances where there is sufficient negative evidence, establishment of valuation allowance must be considered. We believe that cumulative losses in the most recent three year period represent sufficient negative evidence under the provisions of SFAS No. 109 and, as a result, we determined that certain of our deferred tax assets required the establishment of a valuation allowance. The deferred tax assets for which an allowance was established relate primarily to foreign net operating and U.S. capital loss carryforwards, and foreign tax credits. During 2005, a net valuation allowance of $69.9 was established in continuing operations on existing deferred tax assets and current year losses with no benefit. The total valuation allowance as of December 31, 2005 was $501.0. Our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowance. The establishment or reversal of valuation allowances could have a significant negative or positive impact on future earnings. During 2004, a valuation allowance of $236.0 was established in continuing operations on existing deferred tax assets and 2004 losses with no benefit. The total valuation allowance as of December 31, 2004 was $488.6. Our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowance. The establishment or reversal of valuation allowances could have a significant negative or positive impact on future earnings. In connection with the U.S. deferred tax assets, management believes that it is more likely than not that a substantial amount of the deferred tax assets will be realized; a valuation allowance has been established for the remainder. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future U.S. taxable income are lower than anticipated. For additional information, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 30 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC.

The increase in equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates of $7.5 was primarily due to the impact of prior year losses at an African unconsolidated affiliate within McCann, which was fully consolidated due to the purchase of an additional interest in 2005, and the impact of positive results at unconsolidated investments at FCB and McCann.

Income from Discontinued operations (net of tax) In conjunction with the disposition of our NFO operations in the fourth quarter of 2003, we established reserves for certain income tax contingencies with respect to the determination of our investment in NFO for income tax purposes. During the fourth quarter of 2005, these reserves of $9.0 were reversed as the related income tax contingencies are no longer considered probable. 31 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC.

We recorded certain out of period adjustments in the three months ended December 31, 2005. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Excluding out of period adjustments of $17.3 recorded in the three months ended December 31, 2005, the consolidated revenue decrease would have been $52.7. During 2005, the organic decrease in revenue excluding the impact to out of period adjustments was primarily driven by a decrease at IAN, partially offset by an increase at CMG. The decrease at IAN was primarily a result of a reduction in revenue from existing clients primarily due to client losses at our international agencies. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we recorded approximately $10.0 for certain client negotiations at IAN. The increase at CMG was primarily driven by worldwide growth in sports marketing business and events marketing business as a result of increased revenue from existing clients and new client wins.

During the three months ended December 31, 2005, salaries and related expenses increased to 58.4% of revenue, compared to 52.0% in the prior year. During the three months ended December 31, 2005, salaries and related expenses increased by approximately $85.6 including the impact of out of period adjustments, to $1,107.5 when compared to the comparative 32 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) period in 2004. Excluding the impact of out of period adjustments of $3.2, the increase of $82.4 was primarily attributable to an increase in severance expense of $59.7 to $97.2. In addition, the increase was attributable to our hiring additional creative talent to enable future revenue growth and staff to address weaknesses in our accounting and control environment. The components of the change were as follows: Total % of Three Months Ended $ % Change Revenue December 31, 2004 $ 1,021.9 52.0 % Foreign currency changes (10.3 ) (1.0 )% Net acquisitions/divestitures (20.8 ) (2.0 )% Organic 116.7 11.4 % Total change 85.6 8.4 % December 31, 2005 $ 1,107.5 58.4 % For the three months ended December 31, 2005, salaries and related expenses increased $116.7, excluding the decrease related to net acquisitions and divestitures of $20.8 and a decrease related to foreign currency exchange rate changes of $10.3. The increase in salaries and related expenses, excluding the impact of out of period adjustments and foreign currency and net acquisition and divestiture activity, was primarily the result of higher severance expense for international headcount reductions within IAN as a result of client losses. In addition, the increase was attributable to our hiring additional creative talent to enable future revenue growth and staff to address weaknesses in our accounting and control environment. Office and General Expenses Office and general expenses primarily consist of rent, office and equipment, depreciation, professional fees, other overhead expenses and certain out of pocket expenses related to our revenue. During the three months ended December 31, 2005, office and general expenses increased to 33.6% of revenue, compared to 32.1% in the prior year. During the three months ended December 31, 2005, office and general expenses increased by approximately $6.8 including the impact of out of period adjustments, to $637.1 when compared to the comparative period in 2004. Excluding the impact of out of period adjustments of $6.1, the increase of $0.7 was primarily attributable to higher production and media expenses due to an increase in arrangements entered into where we act as a principal, which requires us to record expenses on a gross basis. The increase was partially offset by acquisitions and divestitures. The components of the change were as follows: Total % of Three Months Ended $ % Change Revenue December 31, 2004 $ 630.3 32.1% Foreign currency changes (6.3 ) (1.0 )% Net acquisitions/divestitures (13.2 ) (2.1 )% Organic 26.3 4.2 % Total change 6.8 1.1 % December 31, 2005 $ 637.1 33.6% 33 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) For the three months ended December 31, 2005, office and general expenses increased $26.3, excluding a decrease related to net acquisitions and divestitures of $13.2 and a decrease related to foreign currency exchange rate changes of $6.3. The increase in office and general expenses, excluding the impact of out of period adjustments and foreign currency and net acquisition and divestitures activity, was primarily the result of higher production and media expenses at IAN due to an increase in arrangements entered into where we act as a principal, which requires us to record expenses on a gross basis and higher professional fees at both IAN and CMG. The higher professional fees were driven by our ongoing efforts in internal control compliance, the Prior Restatement process and the preliminary application development and maintenance of information technology systems and processes related to our shared services initiatives. Restructuring Charges (Reversals) During the three months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we recorded net charges and (reversals) related to lease termination and other exit costs and severance and termination costs for the 2003 and 2001 restructuring programs of $1.4 and ($4.4), respectively. 2005 net charges and 2004 net reversals primarily consisted of changes to managements estimates for the 2003 and 2001 restructuring programs primarily relating to our lease termination costs. Long Lived Asset Impairment and Other Charges During the three months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we recorded charges of $92.1 and $5.8, respectively. 2005 charges primarily related to a goodwill impairment charge of $91.0 at our Lowe reporting unit. EXPENSE AND OTHER INCOME Interest Expense & Interest Income During the three months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we recorded interest expense of $46.1 and $44.3, respectively. During the three months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we recorded interest income of $26.8 and $19.5, respectively. The increase in interest income of $7.3 primarily relates to an increase in average interest rates and higher cash balances when compared to the prior year. Investment Impairments During the three months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we recorded investment impairments of $7.1 and $26.4, respectively. For the three months ended December 31, 2005, we recorded a $7.1 charge for our remaining unconsolidated investment in Koch Tavares in Latin America. For the three months ended December 31, 2004, the primary component of the balance related to a $19.9 charge for our unconsolidated investment in German advertising agency Springer & Jacoby. Other Income (Expense) During the three months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we recorded other income (expense) amounts of $13.4 and $(13.5), respectively. The primary components of our income amount for the three months ended December 31, 2005 are a gain on the sale of Target Research, a McCann agency, of $18.6, offset by the sale of a significant component of FCB Spain, which resulted in a loss of approximately $13.0. The remainder of the amount relates to miscellaneous income and expense amounts. The primary components of our expense amount for the three months ended December 31, 2004 are an $8.6 loss on the 34 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) sale of McCanns Transworld Marketing, a U.S. based promotions agency, as well as a $6.2 loss for the final liquidation of the Motorsports investment. OTHER ITEMS Income Taxes For the three months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we recorded an income tax provision of $77.4 and $130.6, respectively. Excluding out of period adjustments of $19.5, the income tax provision would have been $96.9 for the three months ended December 31, 2005. We recorded income tax provisions of $81.9 and $262.2 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, although we had a pretax loss in each period. The difference between the effective tax rate and statutory rate of 35% is due to state and local taxes and the effect of non US operations. Several discrete items also impacted the effective tax rate in 2005. The most significant item negatively impacting the effective tax rate was the establishment of approximately $69.9 of valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets, as well as on losses incurred in non U.S. jurisdictions which receive no benefit. Other discrete items impacting the effective tax rates for 2005 and 2004 were restructuring charges, long lived asset and investment impairment charges. Minority Interest and Unconsolidated Affiliates During the three months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we recorded $7.2 and $10.3 of income applicable to minority interests, respectively. This decrease was primarily due to lower earnings of majority owned international businesses. During the three months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we recorded $8.1 and $1.1 of equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates, respectively. The increase is primarily due to the impact of prior year losses at an African unconsolidated affiliate within McCann, which was fully consolidated in the second quarter of 2005, as well as positive results at unconsolidated investments at FCB and Lowe. NET INCOME (LOSS) Loss from Continuing Operations For the three months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we recorded a loss from continuing operations of $31.9 and income from continuing operations of $130.3, respectively. The decrease in income from continuing operations of $162.1 largely resulted from a decrease in revenue of $70.0, and an increase in operating expenses of $184.5, which was driven by goodwill impairment charges of $92.1 and increased severance and temporary staffing changes of $59.7 and $20.3, respectively. This change was offset by a decrease in taxes of $53.2 and an increase in total expenses and other income of $28.9, which was driven by decreased litigation charges and gains from the sales of businesses. Excluding out of period adjustments of $2.7, the loss from continuing operations would have been $34.6 for the three months ended December 31, 2005. Income from Discontinued Operations (net of tax) In conjunction with the disposition of our NFO operations in the fourth quarter of 2003, we established reserves for certain income tax contingencies with respect to the determination of our investment in NFO for income tax purposes. During the fourth quarter of 2005, these reserves of $9.0 were reversed as the related income tax contingencies are no longer considered probable. 35 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) For the three months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, there was no impact of discontinued operations on our consolidated financial statements. Segment Results of Operations 2005 Compared to 2004 As discussed in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have three reportable segments as of December 31, 2005: our operating divisions IAN, CMG and Motorsports. Our Motorsports operations were sold during 2004 and had immaterial residual operating results in 2005. We also report results for the Corporate group. The profitability measure employed by our chief operating decision makers for allocating resources to operating divisions and assessing operating division performance is segment operating income (loss), which is calculated by subtracting segment salaries and related expenses and office and general expenses from segment revenue. Amounts reported as segment operating income (loss) exclude the impact of restructuring and impairment charges, as we do not typically consider these charges when assessing operating division performance. The impact of restructuring and impairment charges to each reporting segment are reported separately in Notes 6 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, respectively. Segment income (loss) excludes interest income and expense, debt prepayment penalties, investment impairments, litigation charges and other non operating income. Other than the recording of long lived asset impairment and contract termination costs during 2004, the operating results of Motorsports during 2005 and 2004 were not material to consolidated results, and therefore are not discussed in detail below.

The decrease due to the net effect of divestitures and acquisitions, primarily related to the sale of small businesses at McCann and Draft. This decrease was partially offset by foreign currency exchange rate changes primarily attributable to the strengthening of the Brazilian Real and the Canadian Dollar in relation to the U.S. Dollar, which mainly affected the results of McCann and FCB. The organic revenue decrease was primarily driven by decreases at Deutsch and Lowe, partially offset by an increase at Draft. Deutsch experienced a decline in revenues primarily due to lost clients and a reduction in revenue from existing clients in the U.S., partially offset by new business wins. Lowes decline in revenue was primarily driven by lost clients and a reduction in revenue from existing clients in their European offices, as well as a reduction in client spending in the U.S. Draft experienced growth mainly in the U.S. due to client wins and additional revenue from existing clients. Although McCann and FCB are a significant part of the business, they did not contribute significantly to the organic change in revenue year on year. 37 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME For the Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 $ Change % Change Segment operating income $ 249.7 $ 577.1 $ (327.4 ) (56.7 )% Operating margin 4.7 % 10.7 % For the year ended December 31, 2005, IAN operating income decreased by $327.4, or 56.7%, which was a result of a decrease in revenue of $71.4, an increase in salaries and related expenses of $202.3 and increased office and general expenses of $53.7. The decrease in IANs operating income, excluding the impact of foreign currency and net effects of acquisitions and divestitures, was primarily driven by decreased operating income at McCann and FCB, increased losses at Lowe and decreased operating income at Deutsch. The operating income decrease at McCann was primarily caused by increased severance, temporary staffing costs, salary and related benefits and professional fees. Higher severance expense was the result of international headcount reductions. Temporary staffing and salary and related benefits were impacted by additional staffing necessary to address weaknesses in our accounting and control environment. Professional fees increased as a result of costs associated with the Prior Restatement process and internal control compliance. Operating income decreases at FCB were due to higher salaries and freelance costs as additional staff were hired to service new clients and additional business from existing clients, whose revenue will impact 2006 more than 2005, as well as increased severance costs reflecting headcount reductions at our international agencies. Operating income was further impacted by increases in professional fees to assist in the restatement process and internal control compliance. Declines at Lowe were primarily due to organic revenue decreases as compared to the prior year. Deutsch experienced decreases as a result of organic revenue decreases as compared to the prior year, partially offset by lower salaries, related benefits and freelance costs due to lost clients and reduced incentive compensation expense as a result of a reduction in operating performance.

Net effects of acquisitions and divestitures primarily related to the disposition of two businesses in 2005 and three businesses in 2004. 38 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) The organic revenue increase was primarily driven by growth in public relations and sports marketing business both domestically and internationally as a result of increased revenue from existing clients and new client wins. Domestically, the increase in the sports marketing business was offset by a decline in the events marketing business. Although the events marketing business declined domestically it had an overall positive impact to our organic revenue increase due to international client wins. SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME For the Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 $ Change % Change Segment operating income $ 53.0 $ 83.7 $ (30.7 ) (36.7 )% Operating margin 5.6 % 8.9 % For the year ended December 31, 2005, CMG operating income decreased by $30.7, or 36.7%, which was the result of a $23.3 increase in salary and related expenses and a $15.8 increase in office and general expenses, offset by a $8.4 increase in revenue. The decrease in operating income, excluding the impact of foreign currency and net effects of acquisition and divestitures, was primarily driven by increases in salary expense across all businesses due to increased headcount to further address weaknesses in our accounting and control environment. In addition, the decrease in operating income was attributable to increases in salary expenses in public relations to support ongoing revenue growth. CORPORATE AND OTHER Certain corporate and other charges are reported as a separate line within total segment operating income and include corporate office expenses and shared service center expenses, as well as certain other centrally managed expenses that are not fully allocated to operating divisions. The following significant expenses are included in corporate and other: For the Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 $ Change % Change Salaries, benefits and related expenses $ 201.3 $ 151.2 $ 50.1 33.1 % Professional fees 199.3 145.3 54.0 37.2 % Rent and depreciation 50.3 38.0 12.3 32.4 % Corporate Insurance 26.0 29.7 (3.7 ) (12.5 )% Bank fees 2.2 2.8 (0.6 ) (21.4 )% Other (1.5 ) 9.6 (11.1 ) (115.6 )% Expenses allocated to operating divisions (161.3 ) (133.4 ) (27.9 ) 20.9 % Total corporate and other $ 316.3 $ 243.2 $ 73.1 30.1 % Salaries, benefits and related expenses include salaries, pension, bonus and medical and dental insurance expenses for corporate office employees, as well as the cost of temporary employees at the corporate office. Professional fees include costs related to the internal control compliance, cost of Prior Restatement efforts, financial statement audits, legal, information technology and other consulting fees, which are engaged and managed through the corporate office. Professional fees also include the cost of 39 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) temporary financial professionals associated with work on our Prior Restatement activities. Rent and depreciation includes rental expense and depreciation of leasehold improvements for properties occupied by corporate office employees. Corporate insurance expense includes the cost for fire, liability and automobile premiums. Bank fees relate to cash management activity administered by the corporate office. The amounts allocated to operating divisions are calculated monthly based on a formula that uses the revenues of the operating unit. Amounts allocated also include specific charges for information technology related projects which are allocated based on utilization. The increase in corporate and other expense of $73.1 or 30.1% is primarily related to the increase in salaries and related expenses and professional fees. The increase in salary expenses was the result of additional staffing to address weaknesses in our accounting and control environment, and develop shared services. The increase in professional fees are the result of costs associated with internal control compliance, costs associated with the Prior Restatement process, and related audit costs. Amounts allocated to operating divisions primarily increased due to the implementation of new information technology related projects and the consolidation of information technology support staff, the costs of which are now being allocated back to operating divisions.

Excluding out of period adjustments of $17.8 recorded in the three months ended December 31, 2005, the net revenue decrease would have been $67.4. The organic decrease in revenue excluding the impact of out of period adjustments was primarily driven by decreases at McCann, Lowe and Deutsch. McCann experienced a decline in revenues primarily due to a reduction in revenue from existing international clients, particularly in Europe and Asia Pacific. This reduction was partially offset by new client wins, particularly in Europe. Lowes decline in revenue was primarily driven by a change in the structure of certain client contracts which resulted in a deferral of revenue and a reduction in revenue from existing international clients, particularly in Europe. Deutsch experienced a decline in revenues primarily due to lost clients and a reduction in revenue from existing clients in the U.S. partially offset by new client wins. 41 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC.

Excluding out of period adjustments of $22.1, the total operating income decrease would have been $115.9. The decrease in IANs operating income, excluding the impact of out of period adjustments and foreign currency and net effects of acquisitions and divestitures, was primarily driven by decreased operating income at McCann and Lowe. The operating income decrease at McCann was primarily due to increased severance, production and media expenses, occupancy costs and temporary staffing costs. Higher severance expense was the result of domestic and international headcount reductions. The increase in production and media expenses was due to an increase in arrangements entered into where we act as a principal, which requires us to record expenses on a gross basis. The increase in occupancy costs was primarily due to the termination of several operating leases. Temporary staffing was impacted by additional staffing necessary to address weaknesses in our accounting and control environment. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we recorded approximately $10.0 for certain client negotiations. The operating income decrease at Lowe was primarily due to the organic decrease in revenue as compared to the prior year.

Excluding out of period adjustments of $0.5, the net revenue increase would have been $19.1. The organic revenue increase excluding the impact of out of period adjustments was primarily driven by worldwide growth in sports marketing business, events marketing business and public relations business as a result of increased revenue from existing clients and new client wins. 42 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC.

Excluding out of period adjustments of $3.5, the total operating income increase would have been $4.5. The increase in CMGs operating income, excluding the impact of out of period adjustments and foreign currency and net effects of acquisitions and divestitures, was due to an organic revenue increase primarily driven by worldwide growth in sports marketing business as a result of increased revenue from existing clients and new client wins. This increase was partially offset by an increase in professional fees as a result of costs associated with the Prior Restatement process and internal control compliance and an increase in salary expenses across all businesses due to increased headcount to further address weaknesses in our accounting and control environment.

The amounts allocated to operating divisions are calculated monthly based on a formula that uses the revenues of the operating unit. Amounts allocated also include specific charges for information technology related projects which are allocated based on utilization. The increase in corporate and other expense of $27.1 or 36.9% for the three months ended December 31, 2005 is primarily related to the increase in salaries and related expenses, partially offset by a decrease in professional fees. The increase in salary expenses was the result of additional staffing to address weaknesses in our accounting and control environment, and develop shared services. The decrease in professional fees is the result of a reduction in temporary employees as compared to prior year in conjunction with the additional staffing. Consolidated Results of Operations 2004 Compared to 2003 REVENUE The components of the 2004 change were as follows: Total Domestic International $ % Change $ % Change % of Total $ % Change % of Total 2003 $ 6,161.7 $ 3,459.3 56.1 % $ 2,702.4 43.9 % Foreign currency changes 237.7 3.9 % 0.0 % 237.7 8.8 % Net acquisitions/divestitures (88.0 ) (1.4 )% (35.4 ) (1.0 )% (52.6 ) (1.9 )% Organic 75.6 1.2 % 85.3 2.5 % (9.7 ) (0.4 )% Total change 225.3 3.7 % 49.9 1.4 % 175.4 6.5 % 2004 $ 6,387.0 $ 3,509.2 54.9 % $ 2,877.8 45.1 % For the year ended December 31, 2004, consolidated revenues increased $225.3, or 3.7%, as compared to 2003, which was attributable to foreign currency exchange rate changes of $237.7 and organic revenue growth of $75.6, partially offset by the effect of net acquisitions and divestitures of $88.0. The increase due to foreign currency changes was attributable to the strengthening of the Euro and Pound Sterling in relation to the U.S. Dollar. The net effect of acquisitions and divestitures resulted largely from the sale of the Motorsports business during 2004. During 2004, organic revenue change of $75.6, or 1.2%, was driven by an increase at IAN, partially offset by decrease at CMG. The increase at IAN was a result of client wins, additional business from existing clients, and overall growth in domestic markets. The decrease at CMG was as a result of weakness in demand for branding and sports marketing services, partially offset by growth in the public relations business. For the three months ended December 31, 2004, consolidated revenues increased $109.0, or 5.9%, as compared to the comparable period in 2003, which was attributable to an increase related to foreign currency exchange rate changes of $87.4 and an organic increase in revenue of $44.5, partially offset by a decrease in net acquisitions and divestitures of $22.9. 44 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC.

During 2004, salaries and related expenses increased to 58.4% of revenues, compared to 56.8% in 2003. In 2004, salaries and related expenses increased $142.6, excluding the increase related to foreign currency exchange rate changes of $129.5 and a decrease related to net acquisitions and divestitures of $40.5. Salaries and related expenses were impacted by changes in foreign currency rates, attributable to the strengthening of the Euro and Pound Sterling in relation to the U.S. Dollar. The increase due to foreign currency rate changes was partially offset by the impact of net acquisitions and divestitures activity, which resulted largely from the sale of the Motorsports business during 2004. The increase in salaries and related expenses, excluding the impact of foreign currency and net acquisitions and divestitures, was primarily the result of increases in employee headcount at certain locations and increased utilization of temporary and freelance staffing and higher performance incentive expense at a number of agencies that experienced an increase in operating results. Furthermore, during the year, we hired additional personnel within our operating units and in the corporate group to support our back office processes, including accounting and shared services initiatives, as well as our ongoing efforts in achieving Sarbanes Oxley compliance. We reduced staff at certain operations after client accounts were lost. Cost savings associated with headcount reductions were partially offset by increased severance costs associate with the headcount reductions. 45 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) For the three months ended December 31, 2004, salaries and related expenses increased $73.6, excluding the increase related to foreign currency exchange rate changes of $38.8 and a decrease related to net acquisitions and divestitures of $8.8 as compared to 2003. Office and General Expenses The components of the 2004 change were as follows: Total % of $ % Change Revenue 2003 $ 2,225.3 36.1 % Foreign currency changes 102.8 4.6 % Net acquisitions/divestitures (63.8 ) (2.9 )% Organic (13.9 ) (0.6 )% Total change 25.1 1.1 % 2004 $ 2,250.4 35.2 % Office and general expenses primarily consist of rent, office and equipment, depreciation, professional fees, other overhead expenses and certain out of pocket expenses related to our revenue. During 2004, office and general expenses decreased to 35.2% of revenues, compared to 36.1% in 2003. In 2004, office and general expenses decreased $13.9, excluding the increase related to foreign currency exchange rate changes of $102.8 and a decrease related to net acquisitions and divestitures of $63.8. Office and general expenses were impacted by changes in foreign currency rates, attributable to the strengthening of the Euro and Pound Sterling in relation to the U.S. Dollar. The increase due to foreign currency rate changes was offset by the impact of net acquisitions and divestitures activity, which resulted largely from the sale of the Motorsports business in 2004. The decrease in office and general expenses, excluding the impact of foreign currency and net acquisition and divestitures activity, was primarily the result of lower occupancy and overhead costs, and a decrease related to charges recorded by CMG in 2003 to secure certain sports television rights. These decreases, however, were partially offset by increases driven by a rise in professional fees as part of our ongoing efforts in achieving Sarbanes Oxley compliance, and the preliminary application development and maintenance of information technology systems and processes related to our shared services initiatives. For the three months ended December 31, 2004, office and general expenses increased $47.1, excluding an increase related to foreign currency exchange rate changes of $27.2 and a decrease related to net acquisitions and divestitures of $20.0 when compared to 2003. Restructuring (Reversals) Charges During 2004 and 2003, we recorded net (reversals) and charges related to lease termination and other exit costs and severance and termination costs for the 2003 and 2001 restructuring programs of $62.2 and $172.9, respectively. Included in the net (reversals) and charges were adjustments resulting from changes in managements estimates for the 2003 and 2001 restructuring programs which decreased the restructuring reserves by $32.0 and $2.4 in 2004 and 2003, respectively. 2004 net charges primarily related to the vacating of 43 offices and workforce reduction of approximately 400 employees related to the 2003 restructuring program and adjustments to managements estimates for the 2001 restructuring program. 2003 net charges primarily related to the vacating of 55 offices and workforce reduction of approximately 46 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) 2,900 employees related to the 2003 restructuring program and adjustments to managements estimates for the 2001 restructuring program. A summary of the net (reversals) and charges by segment is as follows: Lease Termination and Other Exit Costs Severance and Termination Costs 2003 2001 2003 2001 Program Program Total Program Program Total Total 2004 Net (Reversals) Charges IAN $ 40.3 $ (7.3 ) $ 33.0 $ 14.1 $ (4.3 ) $ 9.8 $ 42.8 CMG 8.1 4.0 12.1 5.1 (0.7 ) 4.4 16.5 Corporate 3.7 (1.0 ) 2.7 0.3 (0.1 ) 0.2 2.9 Total $ 52.1 $ (4.3 ) $ 47.8 $ 19.5 $ (5.1 ) $ 14.4 $ 62.2 2003 Net (Reversals) Charges IAN $ 23.1 $ 8.8 $ 31.9 $ 106.6 $ (0.1 ) $ 106.5 $ 138.4 CMG 12.7 6.1 18.8 15.7 15.7 34.5 Motorsports 0.4 0.4 0.4 Corporate (2.2 ) (1.3 ) (3.5 ) 3.1 3.1 (0.4 ) Total $ 33.6 $ 13.6 $ 47.2 $ 125.8 $ (0.1 ) $ 125.7 $ 172.9 In addition to amounts recorded as restructuring charges, we recorded charges of $11.1 and $16.5 during 2004 and 2003, respectively, related to the accelerated amortization of leasehold improvements on properties included in the 2003 program. These charges were included in office and general expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For additional information, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During the three months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, we recorded net (reversals) and charges related to lease termination and other exit costs and severance and termination costs for the 2003 and 2001 restructuring programs of $(4.4) and $30.2, respectively. 2004 net reversals primarily consisted of changes to managements estimates for the 2003 and 2001 restructuring programs primarily relating to our lease termination costs. 2003 net charges related primarily to the vacating of offices and workforce reduction related to the 2003 restructuring program and adjustments to managements estimates for the 2001 restructuring program. Long Lived Asset Impairment and Other Charges The following table summarizes the long lived asset impairment and other charges for 2004 and 2003: For the Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 IAN CMG Motor sports Total IAN CMG Motor sports Total Goodwill impairment $ 220.2 $ 91.7 $ $ 311.9 $ 0.4 $ 218.0 $ $ 218.4 Fixed asset impairment 2.0 0.4 3.0 5.4 2.3 63.8 66.1 Other 4.9 4.9 9.1 0.4 9.5 Total $ 227.1 $ 92.1 $ 3.0 $ 322.2 $ 11.8 $ 218.4 $ 63.8 $ 294.0 47 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) 2004 Impairments IAN During the third quarter of 2004, we recorded goodwill impairment charges of approximately $220.2 at The Partnership reporting unit, which was comprised of Lowe Worldwide, Draft Worldwide, Mullen, Dailey & Associates and BGW. Our long term projections showed previously unanticipated declines in discounted future operating cash flows due to recent client losses, reduced client spending, and declining industry valuation metrics. These discounted future operating cash flow projections caused the estimated fair value of The Partnership to be less than their book values. The Partnership was subsequently disbanded in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the remaining goodwill was allocated based on the relative fair value of the agencies at the time of disbandment. CMG As a result of the annual impairment review, a goodwill impairment charge of $91.7 was recorded at our CMG reporting unit, which was comprised of Weber Shandwick, GolinHarris, DeVries, MWW Group and FutureBrand. The fair value of CMG was adversely affected by declining industry market valuation metrics, specifically, a decrease in the EBITDA multiples used in the underlying valuation calculations. The impact of the lower EBITDA multiples caused the calculated fair value of CMG goodwill to be less than the related book value. 2003 Impairments CMG We recorded an impairment charge of $218.0 to reduce the carrying value of goodwill at Octagon. The Octagon impairment charge reflects the reduction of the units fair value due principally to poor financial performance in 2003 and lower than expected future financial performance. Specifically, there was significant pricing pressure in both overseas and domestic TV rights distribution, declining fees from athlete representation, and lower than anticipated proceeds from committed future events, including ticket revenue and sponsorship. Motorsports We recorded fixed asset impairment charges of $63.8, consisting of $38.0 in connection with the sale of a business comprised of the four owned auto racing circuits, $9.6 related to the sales of other Motorsports entities and a fixed asset impairment of $16.2 for outlays that Motorsports was contractually required to spend to improve the racing facilities. During the three months ended December 31, 2003, we recorded charges of $44.9. This primarily related to a Motorsports fixed asset impairment charge of $38.0 in conjunction with the sale of a business comprised of Motorsports four owned auto racing circuits. For additional information, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Motorsports Contract Termination Costs As discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, during the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded a pretax charge of $113.6 related to a series of agreements with the British Racing Drivers Club and Formula One Administration Limited which released us from certain guarantees and lease obligations in the United Kingdom. We have exited this business and do not anticipate any additional material charges. 48 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC.

During the three months ended December 31, 2003, we recorded interest expense of $51.6. Debt Prepayment Penalty During the fourth quarter of 2004, a prepayment penalty of $9.8 was recorded related to the early redemption of $250.0 of our 7.875% Senior Unsecured Notes due in 2005, which represented one half of the $500.0 outstanding. During the third quarter of 2003, we repaid our borrowings under the Prudential Agreements, repaying $142.5 principal amount and incurring a prepayment penalty of $24.8. Interest Income The increase in interest income in 2004 was primarily due to an increase in our average balance of short term investments held during the year, as well as an increase in interest rates when compared to 2003. During the three months ended December 31, 2003, we recorded interest income of $11.5. Investment Impairments During 2004, we recorded investment impairment charges of $63.4, primarily related to a $50.9 charge for our unconsolidated investment in German advertising agency Springer & Jacoby as a result of a decrease in projected operating results. Additionally, we recorded impairment charges of $4.7 related to unconsolidated affiliates primarily in Israel, Brazil, Japan and India, and $7.8 related to several other available for sale investments. During 2003, we recorded $71.5 of investment impairment charges related to 20 investments. The charge related principally to investments in Fortune Promo 7 of $9.5 in the Middle East, Koch Tavares of $7.7 in Latin America, Daiko of $10.0 in Japan, Roche Macaulay Partners of $7.9 in Canada, Springer & Jacoby of $6.5 in Germany and GlobalHue of $6.9 in the U.S. The majority of the impairment charges resulted from deteriorating economic conditions in the countries in which the agencies operate or the loss of one or several key clients. During the three months ended December 31, 2004, investment impairments decreased $15.6 as compared to the comparable period in the prior year. 49 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Litigation Charges During 2004, with the court approval of the settlement of the class action shareholder suits discussed in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we received $20.0 from insurance proceeds which we recorded as a reduction in litigation charges because we had not previously established a receivable. We also recorded a reduction of $12.5 relating to a decrease in the share price between the tentative settlement date and the final settlement date. During 2003, we recorded litigation charges of $127.6 for various legal matters, of which $115.0 related to a then tentative settlement of the class action shareholder suits discussed above. Under the terms of the settlement, we were required to pay $20.0 in cash and issue 6.6 shares of our common stock. The ultimate amount of the litigation charge related to the settlement was dependent upon our stock price at the time of the final settlement (as the number of shares was fixed in the agreement), which took place in December 2004. Other Income (Expense) In 2004, other income (expense) included $18.2 of net losses on the sale of 19 agencies. The losses related primarily to the sale of Transworld Marketing, a U.S. based promotions agency, which resulted in a loss of $8.6, and a $6.2 loss for the final liquidation of the Motorsports investment. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Motorsports disposition. In December 2003, we sold approximately 11.0 shares of Modem Media for net proceeds of approximately $57.0 in December, resulting in a pre tax gain of $30.3. Also in December, we sold all of the approximately 11.7 shares of TNS we had acquired through the sale of NFO, for approximately $42.0 of net proceeds. A pre tax gain of $13.3 was recorded. During the three months ended December 31, 2004, other income (expense) decreased by $8.7, primarily due to the losses described above for the sale of Transworld Marketing and the Motorsports liquidation. OTHER ITEMS Income Taxes For the Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 $ Change % Change Provision for income taxes $ 262.2 $ 242.7 $ 19.5 8.0 % Effective tax rate 98.2 % 65.1 % Our effective tax rate was negatively impacted in both 2004 and 2003 by the establishment of valuation allowances, as described below, restructuring charges, and non deductible long lived asset impairment charges. In 2004, our effective tax rate was also impacted by pretax charges and related tax benefits resulting from the Motorsports contract termination costs. The difference between the effective tax rate and the statutory federal rate of 35% is also due to state and local taxes and the effect of non U.S. operations. For the three months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, we recorded an income tax provision of $130.6 and $247.6, respectively. 50 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Valuation Allowance During 2004, the valuation allowance of $236.0 was established in continuing operations on existing deferred tax assets and current year losses with no benefit. The total valuation allowance as of December 31, 2004 was $488.6. Our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of offsetting decreases in our valuation allowance. The establishment or reversal of valuation allowances could have a significant negative or positive impact on future earnings. During 2003, the valuation allowance of $111.4 was established in continuing operations on existing deferred tax assets and losses in 2003 with no benefit. In addition, $3.7 of valuation allowances were established for certain U.S. capital and other loss carryforwards. The total valuation allowance as of December 31, 2003 was $252.6. For additional information, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Minority Interest and Unconsolidated Affiliates For the Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 $ Change % Change Income applicable to minority interests $ (21.5 ) $ (27.0 ) $ 5.5 (20.4 )% Equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates, net of tax $ 5.8 $ 2.4 $ 3.4 141.7 % The decrease in income applicable to minority interests was primarily due to lower earnings of majority owned international businesses, primarily in Europe, and the sale of majority owned businesses in Latin America. The increase in equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates was primarily due to the impact of prior year losses at Modem Media, which was sold in 2003, and the impact of higher 2003 losses at an unconsolidated investment in Brazil and a U.S. based sports and entertainment event business. During the three months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, we recorded $10.3 and $13.6 of income applicable to minority interests, respectively. During the three months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, we recorded $1.1 and $3.8 of equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates, respectively.

AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Loss from Continuing Operations In 2004, our loss from continuing operations decreased by $95.2 or 14.9% as a result of an increase in revenue of $225.3 and a decrease in expense and other income primarily driven by higher litigation costs in 2003, as a result of the shareholder suit settlement. These changes were partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $287.8, which includes Motorsports contract termination costs of $113.6. For the three months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, we recorded income from continuing operations of $130.3 and a loss from continuing operations of $3.6, respectively. Income from Discontinued Operations Recorded within income from discontinued operations is the impact of our sale of NFO, our research unit, to TNS in 2003. NFO is classified in discontinued operations and the results of operations and cash flows of NFO have been removed from our results of continuing operations and cash flows for all periods. During 2003, we completed the sale of NFO for $415.6 in cash ($376.7, net of cash sold and expenses) and approximately 11.7 shares of TNS stock. We sold the TNS stock in December 2003 for net proceeds of approximately $42.0. As a result of the sale of NFO, we recognized a pre tax gain of $99.1 ($89.1, net of tax) in the third quarter of 2003 after certain post closing adjustments. The TNS shares sold resulted in a pre tax gain of $13.3. In July 2004, we received an additional $10.0 ($6.5, net of tax) from TNS as a final payment. For additional information, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Segment Results of Operations 2004 Compared to 2003 The following table summarizes revenue and operating income (loss) by segment in 2004 and 2003. As previously discussed, in 2004 and 2003 we had a third reportable segment, comprised of our Motorsports operations, which were sold during 2004. Other than long lived asset impairment and contract termination costs, the operating results of Motorsports are not material to our consolidated results, and are therefore not discussed below: For the Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 $ Change % Change Revenue: IAN $ 5,399.2 $ 5,140.5 $ 258.7 5.0 % CMG 935.8 942.4 (6.6 ) (0.7 )% Motorsports 52.0 78.8 (26.8 ) (34.0 )% Consolidated revenue $ 6,387.0 $ 6,161.7 $ 225.3 3.7 % Segment operating income (loss): IAN $ 577.1 $ 551.6 $ 25.5 4.6 % CMG 83.7 55.7 28.0 50.3 % Motorsports (14.0 ) (43.5 ) 29.5 (67.8 )% Corporate and other (243.2 ) (128.8 ) (114.4 ) 88.8 % 52 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC.

The increase due to foreign currency was primarily attributable to the strengthening of the Euro and Pound Sterling in relation to the U.S. Dollar. This increase was partially offset by the net effect of divestitures and acquisitions, primarily related to the sale of some small businesses at McCann, Lowe, and Draft, and increased equity ownership in two businesses at Lowe. The organic revenue increase was primarily driven by increases at McCann, Draft, FCB, and Deutsch, partially offset by decreases at Lowe. McCann experienced an organic revenue increase as a result of new client wins and increased business from existing clients, primarily in our U.S. and European agencies. Draft experienced an organic revenue increase mainly in the U.S. due to client wins and increased business by existing clients, partially offset by poor economic conditions in Europe and the closing of its field marketing business in 2003. FCB experienced an organic revenue increase due to increased spending by existing clients and client wins, partially offset by a decrease in revenues as a result of clients lost during the year, mainly in the U.S. and Germany. Deutsch experienced organic revenue growth stemming from 53 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) new client wins and increased business from existing clients. Lowe experienced an organic revenue decline, primarily the result of client losses and reduced business from major multinational clients. For the three months ended December 31, 2004 IAN experienced a net increase in revenue as compared to 2003 of $119.7, or 7.6%, which was comprised of an increase in foreign currency exchange rate changes of $76.0 and an organic increase in revenue of $53.2, partially offset by a decrease attributable to net acquisitions and divestitures of $9.5. SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME For the Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 $ Change % Change Segment operating income $ 577.1 $ 551.6 $ 25.5 4.6 % Operating margin 10.7 % 10.7 % For the year ended December 31, 2004, IAN operating income increased by $25.5, or 4.6%, which was a result of an increase in revenue of $258.7, offset by an increase in salaries and related expenses of $201.4 and increased office and general expenses of $31.8. Segment operating income growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency and net effects of acquisitions and divestitures, was primarily driven by increases at McCann, and to a lesser extent, Deutsch and FCB, partially offset by a decrease at Lowe. McCann experienced an organic revenue increase with essentially flat operating expenses. Operating expenses at McCann reflect higher compensation costs to support new client business and an increase in contractual compensation payments made to individuals for the achievement of specific operational targets as part of certain prior year acquisition agreements. These increases were offset by lower depreciation expense incurred as a result of limited capital purchases, as well as a decrease in bad debt expense due to improved collection of accounts receivable. Deutsch and FCB experienced increases as a result of organic revenue increases, partially offset by an increase in operating expense related to increased employee incentives and additional salaries and freelance costs to support the increase in business activity. The decrease in operating income at Lowe was the result of a significant organic revenue decrease partially offset by moderate decreases in operating expenses. The decrease in operating expenses at Lowe was the result of lower headcount and reduced office space requirements. For the three months ended December 31, 2004, IAN operating income decreased by $27.4, or 7.1%, which was the result of an increase in salaries and related expenses of $130.6 and increased office and general expenses of $16.5, offset by an increase in revenue of $119.7. 54 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC.

The increase due to foreign currency exchange rate was primarily attributable to the strengthening of the Euro and Pound Sterling in relation to the U.S. Dollar. Net effects of acquisitions and divestitures primarily related to the disposition of three businesses in 2004 and two businesses in 2003. The organic revenue decline was primarily driven by a decrease in the branding and sports marketing businesses, offset slightly by growth in our public relations business. For the three months ended December 31, 2004, CMG experienced a net decrease in revenue as compared to 2004 of $6.5, or 2.4%, which was comprised of an organic revenue decrease of $11.0 and decreases attributable to net acquisitions and divestitures of $5.7, offset by an increase in foreign currency exchange rate changes of $10.2.

Segment operating income growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency and net effects of acquisition and divestitures, was primarily driven by an increase at sports marketing business, partially offset by an increase in CMG corporate office expense. While there was an organic revenue decrease sports marketing business operating expenses decreased at a higher rate than the organic revenue decrease, due to a decrease related to charges recorded by CMG in 2003 to secure certain sports television rights. Increased corporate office expenses was driven by higher expenses recorded for performance incentive awards as a result of improved revenue performance and additional accruals for post employment and other benefits for management personnel. 55 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC.

Corporate insurance expense includes the cost for fire, liability and automobile premiums. Bank fees relates to our debt and credit facilities. The amounts of expenses allocated to operating segments are calculated monthly based on a formula that uses the revenues of the operating unit. The increase in corporate and other expense of $114.4 or 88.8% is primarily related to the increase in professional fees and salaries and related expenses. The increase in professional fees primarily resulted from costs associated with complying with the requirements of the Sarbanes Oxley Act. We also incurred increased expenses for the preliminary application development and maintenance of systems and processes related to our shared services initiatives. The increase in payroll related expenses is due mainly to an increase in the use of temporary employees in order to enhance monitoring controls at the corporate office as well as to support our significant ongoing efforts to achieve Sarbanes Oxley compliance. Increased headcount and expanded office space at the corporate office also contributed to this increase. Also, certain contractual bonuses for management increased as compared to prior year. The increase in corporate and other expense of $7.0 or 10.5% for the three months ended December 31, 2004 is primarily related to the increase in professional fees offset by the decrease in salaries and related expenses. The increase in professional fees are the result of costs associated with internal control compliance, costs associated with the Prior Restatement process, and related audit costs. Amounts allocated to operating divisions primarily increased due to the implementation of new information 56 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) December 31, 2005 technology related projects and the consolidation of information technology support staff, the costs of which are now being allocated back to operating divisions. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOW OVERVIEW Operating cash flow Our operating activities utilized cash of approximately $20.2, compared to cash provided by operating activities of $464.8 in 2004 and $502.6 in 2003. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2005 was primarily attributable to significant increases in our operating costs as well as a decline in revenues. Additional cash was used during 2005 for severance costs primarily related to international headcount reductions, salary costs primarily attributable to our hiring additional creative talent to enable future revenue growth and additional staff to address weaknesses in our accounting and control environment, and professional fees primarily related to the Prior Restatement and our ongoing efforts in internal control compliance. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2005 was also attributable in part to year over year changes in accounts payable and other changes in working capital accounts. We conduct media buying on behalf of clients, which affects our working capital and operating cash flow. In most of our businesses, we collect funds from our clients which we use, on their behalf, to pay production costs and media costs. The amounts involved substantially exceed our revenues, and the current assets and current liabilities on our balance sheet reflect these pass through arrangements. Our assets include both cash received and accounts receivable from customers for these pass through arrangements, while our liabilities include amounts owed on behalf of customers to media and production suppliers. Generally, we pay production and media charges after we have received funds from our clients, and our risk from client nonpayment has historically not been significant. We manage substantially all our domestic cash and liquidity centrally through the corporate treasury department. Each day, domestic agencies with excess funds invest these funds with corporate treasury and domestic agencies that require funding will borrow funds from corporate treasury. The corporate treasury department aggregates the net domestic cash position on a daily basis. The net position is either invested or borrowed. Given the amount of cash on hand, we have not had short term domestic borrowings over the past two years. The amount of our cash held by the banks under our International pooling arrangements is subject to a full right of offset against the amounts advanced to us, and the cash and advances are recorded net on our balance sheet. The gross amounts vary depending on how much funding is provided to agencies through the pooling arrangements. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, cash of $842.6 and $939.9, respectively, was netted against an equal amount of advances under pooling arrangements. We typically pay interest on our larger arrangements based on the gross amounts of the advances and receive interest income on the gross amount of cash deposited, albeit at a lower rate. Funding requirements Our most significant funding requirements include: non cancelable operating lease obligations, capital expenditures, payments related to vendor discounts and credits, payments related to past acquisitions, interest payments, preferred stock dividends and taxes. 57 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Our non cancelable lease commitments primarily relate to office premises and equipment. These commitments are partially offset by sublease rental income we receive under non cancelable subleases. Our projected obligations for 2005 and beyond are set forth below under Contractual Obligations. Our capital expenditures are primarily to upgrade computer and telecommunications systems and to modernize offices. Our principal bank credit facility currently limits spending on capital expenditures in any calendar year to $210.0. Our capital expenditures were $140.7 in 2005, $194.0 in 2004 and $159.6 in 2003. We acquired a large number of agencies through 2001, but in recent years the number and value of acquisitions have been significantly less. There were no acquisitions in 2005 and cash paid for acquisitions was approximately $14.6 in 2004 and $4.0 in 2003. Under the contractual terms of certain of our past acquisitions we have long term obligations to pay additional consideration or to purchase additional equity interests in certain consolidated or unconsolidated subsidiaries if specified conditions, mostly operating performance, are met. Some of the consideration under these arrangements is in shares of our common stock, but most is in cash. We made cash payments for past acquisitions of $97.0 in 2005, $161.7 in 2004 and $221.2 in 2003. Our projected obligations for 2006 and beyond are set forth below under Contractual Obligations. We are required to post letters of credit primarily to support commitments to purchase media placements, predominantly in locations outside the U.S., or to satisfy other obligations. We generally obtain these letters of credit from our principal bank syndicate under the Three Year Revolving Credit Facility described under Credit Arrangements below. The outstanding amount of letters of credit was $162.4 and $165.4 as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These letters of credit have not been drawn upon in recent years. Sources of funds At December 31, 2005 our total of cash and cash equivalents plus short term marketable securities was $2,191.5 compared to $1,970.4 at December 31, 2004. We have obtained financing through the capital markets by issuing debt securities, convertible preferred stock and common stock. Our outstanding debt securities and convertible preferred stock are described under Long Term Debt, 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes (4.50% Notes) and Convertible Preferred Stock below. In July 2005, we issued $250.0 of Floating Rate Notes due 2008 in a private placement to refinance maturing debt, as described below. In October 2005, we issued 0.525 shares of Series B Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock at gross proceeds of $525.0 with the proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes as described below under Convertible Preferred Stock. We have committed and uncommitted credit facilities, the terms of which are described below. We maintain our committed credit facility primarily as stand by short term liquidity and for the issuance of letters of credit. We have not drawn on our committed facility over the past two years, although letters of credit have been and continue to be issued under this facility, as described above. Our outstanding borrowings under uncommitted credit facilities were $53.7 and $67.8 as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We use uncommitted credit lines for working capital needs at some of our operations outside the United States. If we lose access to these credit lines, we may be required to provide funding directly to some overseas operations. 58 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Liquidity outlook We expect our operating cash flow and cash on hand to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating requirements at a minimum for the next twelve months. We have no significant scheduled amounts of long term debt due until 2008 when $250.0 of our Floating Rate Senior Unsecured Notes are due. In addition, holders of our $800.0 4.50% Notes may require us to repurchase the 4.50% Notes for cash at par in March 2008. We continue to have a level of cash and cash equivalents that we consider to be conservative, particularly after receiving net proceeds of approximately $507.3 from our offering of Series B Preferred Stock in October 2005. We consider this approach to be important in view of the cash requirements resulting, among other things, from the higher professional fees, from our liabilities to our customers for vendor discounts and credits and from any potential penalties or fines that may have to be paid in connection with our SEC investigation. In 2006, we will be required to pay to the IRS and state and local taxing authorities approximately $93.4 (including interest), related to tax audit matters. This amount has been reclassified from non current liabilities to current liabilities on the balance sheet. As a result of our Prior Restatement review, we estimate that we will pay approximately $250.0 related to Vendor Discounts or Credits, Internal Investigations and International Compensation Agreements over the next 18 months. We regularly evaluate market conditions for opportunities to raise additional financing on favorable terms, in order to enhance our financial flexibility. Substantially all of our operating cash flow is generated by the agencies. Our liquid assets are held primarily at the holding company level, but also at our larger subsidiaries. The legal or contractual restrictions on our ability to transfer funds within the group, whether in the form of dividends, loans or advances, do not significantly reduce our financial flexibility. 59 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) FINANCING Long Term Debt A summary of our long term debt is as follows: December 31, 2005 2004 7.875% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2005 $ $ 255.0 Floating Rate Senior Unsecured Notes due 2008 250.0 5.40% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2009 (less unamortized discount of $0.3) 249.7 249.7 7.25% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2011 499.2 500.0 6.25% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2014 (less unamortized discount of $0.9) 350.3 347.3 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 800.0 800.0 Other notes payable and capitalized leases at interest rates from 3.3% to 14.44% 36.9 42.1 Total long term debt 2,186.1 2,194.1 Less: current portion 3.1 258.1 Long term debt, excluding current portion $ 2,183.0 $ 1,936.0 Annual repayments of long term debt as of December 31, 2005 are scheduled as follows: 2006 $ 3.1 2007 4.7 2008* 256.7 2009 250.8 2010 0.8 Thereafter* 1,670.0 Total long term debt $ 2,186.1 * Holders of our $800.0 4.50% Notes may require us to repurchase the 4.50% Notes for cash at par in March 2008. If all holders require us to repurchase these Notes, a total of $1,056.7 will be payable in 2008 in respect of long term debt. These Notes will mature in 2023 if not converted or repurchased. Redemption and Repurchase of Long Term Debt In August 2005, we redeemed the remainder of the outstanding 7.875% Senior Unsecured Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $250.0 at maturity at gross proceeds of approximately $258.6, which included the principal amount of the Notes, accrued interest to the redemption date and a prepayment penalty. To redeem these Notes we used the proceeds from the sale and issuance in July 2005 of $250.0 Floating Rate Senior Unsecured Notes due in July 2008. Consent Solicitation In March 2005, we completed a consent solicitation to amend the indentures governing five series of our outstanding public debt to provide, among other things, that our failure to file with the trustee our 60 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) SEC reports, including our 2004 Annual Report on Form 10 K and Quarterly Reports for the first and second quarters of 2005 on Form 10 Q, would not constitute a default under the indentures until October 1, 2005. The indenture governing our 4.50% Notes was also amended in March 2005 to provide for: (i) an extension from March 15, 2008 to September 15, 2009 of the date on or after which we may redeem the 4.50% Notes and (ii) an additional make whole adjustment to the conversion rate in the event of a change of control meeting specified conditions. 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes Our 4.50% Notes are convertible to common stock at a conversion price of $12.42 per share, subject to adjustment in specified circumstances. They are convertible at any time if the average price of our common stock for 20 trading days immediately preceding the conversion date is greater than or equal to a specified percentage, beginning at 120% in 2003 and declining 0.5% each year until it reaches 110% at maturity, of the conversion price. They are also convertible, regardless of the price of our common stock, if: (i) we call the 4.50% Notes for redemption; (ii) we make specified distributions to shareholders; (iii) we become a party to a consolidation, merger or binding share exchange pursuant to which our common stock would be converted into cash or property (other than securities) or (iv) the credit ratings assigned to the 4.50% Notes by any two of Moodys Investors Service, Standard & Poors and Fitch Ratings are lower than Ba2, BB and BB, respectively, or the 4.50% Notes are no longer rated by at least two of these ratings services. Because of our current credit ratings, the 4.50% Notes are currently convertible into approximately 64.4 shares of our common stock. Holders of the 4.50% Notes may require us to repurchase the 4.50% Notes on March 15, 2008 for cash and on March 15, 2013 and March 15, 2018, for cash or common stock or a combination of both, at our election. Additionally, investors may require us to repurchase the 4.50% Notes in the event of certain change of control events that occur prior to March 15, 2008 for cash or common stock or a combination of both, at our election. If at any time on or after March 13, 2003 we pay cash dividends on our common stock, we will pay contingent interest in an amount equal to 100% of the per share cash dividend paid on the common stock multiplied by the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the 4.50% Notes. At our option, we may redeem the 4.50% Notes on or after September 15, 2009 for cash. The redemption price in each of these instances will be 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The 4.50% Notes also provide for an additional make whole adjustment to the conversion rate in the event of a change of control meeting specified conditions. In accordance with EITF Issue No. 03 6, Participating Securities and the Two Class Method under FASB Statement No. 128, Earnings Per Share, the 4.50% Notes are considered securities with participation rights in earnings available to common stockholders due to the feature of these securities that allows investors to participate in cash dividends paid on our common stock. For periods in which we experience net income, the impact of these securities participation rights is included in the calculation of earnings per share. For periods in which we experience a net loss, the 4.50% Notes have no impact on the calculation of earnings per share due to the fact that the holders of these securities do not participate in our losses. Convertible Preferred Stock We currently have two series of convertible preferred stock outstanding: our 5.375% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (Series A Preferred Stock) and our 5.25% Series B Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock (Series B Preferred Stock). 61 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Series B Preferred Stock On October 24, 2005, we completed a private offering of 0.525 shares of our Series B Preferred Stock at an aggregate offering price of $525.0. The net proceeds from the sale were approximately $507.3 after deducting discounts to the initial purchasers and the estimated expenses of the offering. Each share of the Series B Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference of $1,000.00 per share and is convertible at the option of the holder at any time into 73.1904 shares of our common stock, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, which represents a conversion price of approximately $13.66, representing a conversion premium of approximately 30% over our closing stock price on October 18, 2005 of $10.51 per share. On or after October 15, 2010, each share of the Series B Preferred Stock may be converted at our option if the closing price of our common stock multiplied by the conversion rate then in effect equals or exceeds 130% of the liquidation preference of $1,000.00 per share for 20 trading days during any consecutive 30 trading day period. Holders of the Series B Preferred Stock will be entitled to an adjustment to the conversion rate if they convert their shares in connection with a fundamental change meeting certain specified conditions. The Series B Preferred Stock is junior to all of our existing and future debt obligations, on parity with our Series A Preferred Stock and senior to our common stock, with respect to payments of dividends and rights upon liquidation, winding up or dissolution, to the extent of the liquidation preference of $1,000.00 per share. There are no registration rights with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock, shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion thereof or any shares of our common stock that may be delivered in connection with a dividend payment. In accordance with EITF Issue No. 03 6, the Series B Preferred Stock is not considered a security with participation rights in earnings available to common stockholders due to the contingent nature of the conversion feature of these securities. Series A Preferred Stock We currently have outstanding 7.475 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference of $50.00 per share. On the automatic conversion date of December 15, 2006, each share of the Series A Preferred Stock will convert, subject to certain adjustments, into between 3.0358 and 3.7037 shares of common stock, depending on the then current market price of our common stock. At any time prior to December 15, 2006, holders may elect to convert each share of their Series A Preferred Stock, subject to certain adjustments, into 3.0358 shares of our common stock. If the closing price per share of our common stock exceeds $24.71 for at least 20 trading days within a period of 30 consecutive trading days, we may elect, subject to certain limitations, to cause the conversion of all of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of 3.0358 shares of our common stock for each share of our Series A Preferred Stock. The Series A Preferred Stock is junior to all of our existing and future debt obligations, on parity with our Series B Preferred Stock and senior to our common stock, with respect to payments of dividends and rights upon liquidation, winding up or dissolution, to the extent of the liquidation preference of $50.00 per share. In accordance with EITF Issue No. 03 6, the Series A Preferred Stock is considered a security with participation rights in earnings available to common stockholders due to the conversion feature of these securities. For periods in which we experience net income, the impact of these securities participation rights is included in the calculation of earnings per share. For periods in which we experience a net loss, the Series A Preferred Stock has no impact on the calculation of earnings per share due to the fact that the holders of these securities do not participate in our losses. 62 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Credit Arrangements We have committed and uncommitted credit facilities with various banks that permit borrowings at variable interest rates. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, there were no borrowings under our committed facilities. However, there were borrowings under the uncommitted facilities made by several of our subsidiaries outside the U.S. totaling $53.7 and $67.8, respectively. We have guaranteed the repayment of some of these borrowings by our subsidiaries. The weighted average interest rate on outstanding balances under the uncommitted short term facilities at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was approximately 5% in each year. A summary of our credit facilities is as follows: December 31, 2005 2004 Total Amount Letters Total Total Amount Letters Total Facility Outstanding of Credit Available Facility Outstanding of Credit Available Committed 364 Day Revolving Credit Facility $ $ $ $ $ 250.0 $ $ $ 250.0 Three Year Revolving Credit Facility 500.0 162.4 337.6 450.0 165.4 284.6 Other Facilities 0.7 0.7 0.8 0.8 $ 500.7 $ $ 162.4 $ 338.3 $ 700.8 $ $ 165.4 $ 535.4 Uncommitted Non U.S. $ 516.2 $ 53.7 $ $ 462.5 $ 738.1 $ 67.8 $ $ 670.3 Our primary bank credit agreement is a three year revolving credit facility (as amended, the Three Year Revolving Credit Facility). The Three Year Revolving Credit Facility expires on May 9, 2007 and provides for borrowings of up to $500.0, of which $200.0 is available for the issuance of letters of credit. This facility was amended as of October 17, 2005 to increase the amount that we may borrow under the facility by $50.0 to $500.0. Our $250.0 364 Day Revolving Credit Facility expired on September 30, 2005. The terms of our Three Year Revolving Credit Facility at December 31, 2005 do not permit us: (i) to make cash acquisitions in excess of $50.0 until October 2006, or thereafter in excess of $50.0 until expiration of the agreement in May 2007, subject to increases equal to the net cash proceeds received during the applicable period from any disposition of assets or any business; (ii) to make capital expenditures in excess of $210.0 annually; (iii) to repurchase our common stock or to declare or pay dividends on our capital stock, except that we may declare or pay dividends in shares of our common stock, declare or pay cash dividends on our preferred stock, and repurchase our capital stock in connection with the exercise of options by our employees or with proceeds contemporaneously received from an issue of new shares of our capital stock; or (iv) to incur new debt at our subsidiaries, other than unsecured debt incurred in the ordinary course of business of our subsidiaries outside the U.S. and unsecured debt, which may not exceed $10.0 in the aggregate, incurred in the ordinary course of business of our U.S. subsidiaries. The terms also permit the issuance of letters of credit with expiration dates beyond the termination date of the facility, subject to certain conditions. Such conditions include the requirement for us, on the 105th day prior to the termination date of the facility, to provide a cash deposit in an amount equal to the total amount of outstanding letters of credit with expiration dates beyond the termination date of the facility. These terms were previously modified by three amendments on March 31, June 22 and September 27, 2005, respectively. The March 21, 2006 amendment effective as of December 31, 2005 added one new financial covenant so that we are required to maintain, based on a five business day testing period, in cash and securities, an average daily ending balance of $300.0 plus the aggregate principal amount of 63 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) borrowings under the credit facility in domestic accounts with our lenders. For further explanation of these and other amendments see Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. We also obtained a waiver from the lenders under the Three Year Revolving Credit Facility on March 21, 2006, to waive any default arising from the restatement of our financial data presented in this report. Our Three Year Revolving Credit Facility now contains certain financial covenants. These covenants have been modified by amendments and waivers on March 31, 2005, June 22, 2005, September 27, 2005, November 7, 2005 (effective as of September 30, 2005) and March 21, 2006 (effective as of December 31, 2005). We have been in compliance with all covenants under the Three Year Revolving Credit Facility, as amended or waived from time to time. For further detail of these changes to the financial covenants see Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our financial covenants, effective as of December 31, 2005, require us to maintain with respect to each fiscal quarter set forth below: (i) an interest coverage ratio for the four fiscal quarters then ended of not less than that set forth opposite the corresponding quarter in the table below: Four Fiscal Quarters Ending Ratio December 31, 2005 * March 31, 2006 * June 30, 2006 * September 30, 2006 1.75 to 1 December 31, 2006 2.15 to 1 March 31, 2007 2.50 to 1 * The March 21, 2006 amendment, effective as of December 31, 2005, removed the financial covenant requirements with respect to the interest coverage ratio for the fiscal quarters ending December 31, 2005, March 31, 2006 and June 30, 2006. (ii) a debt to EBITDA ratio, where debt is the balance at period end and EBITDA is for the four fiscal quarters then ended, of not greater than that set forth opposite the corresponding quarter in the table below: Four Fiscal Quarters Ending Ratio December 31, 2005 * March 31, 2006 * June 30, 2006 * September 30, 2006 5.15 to 1 December 31, 2006 4.15 to 1 March 31, 2007 3.90 to 1 * The March 21, 2006 amendment, effective as of December 31, 2005, removed the financial covenant requirements with respect to the debt to EBITDA ratio for the fiscal quarters ending December 31, 2005, March 31, 2006 and June 30, 2006. 64 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) and (iii) minimum levels of EBITDA for the four fiscal quarters then ended of not less than that set forth opposite the corresponding quarter in the table below: Four Fiscal Quarters Ending Amount December 31, 2005 $ 233.0 March 31, 2006 175.0 June 30, 2006 100.0 September 30, 2006 440.0 December 31, 2006 545.0 March 31, 2007 585.0 The terms used in these ratios, including EBITDA, interest coverage and debt, are subject to specific definitions set forth in the agreement. Under the definition set forth in the Three Year Revolving Credit Facility, EBITDA is determined by adding to net income or loss the following items: interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation expense, amortization expense, and certain specified cash payments and non cash charges subject to limitations on time and amount set forth in the agreement. Interest coverage is defined as a ratio of EBITDA of the period of four fiscal quarters then ended to interest expense during such period. We have in the past been required to seek and have obtained amendments and waivers of the financial covenants under our committed bank facility. There can be no assurance that we will be in compliance with these covenants in future periods. If we do not comply and are unable to obtain the necessary amendments or waivers at that time, we would be unable to borrow or obtain additional letters of credit under the Three Year Revolving Credit Facility and could choose to terminate the facility and provide a cash deposit in connection with any amount under the outstanding letters of credit. The lenders under the Three Year Revolving Credit Facility would also have the right to terminate the facility, accelerate any outstanding principal and require us to provide a cash deposit in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of outstanding letters of credit. The outstanding amount of letters of credit was $162.4 as of December 31, 2005. We have not drawn under the Three Year Credit Facility over the past two years, and we do not currently expect to do so. So long as there are no amounts to be accelerated under the Three Year Revolving Credit Facility, termination of the facility would not trigger the cross acceleration provisions of our public debt. Credit Agency Ratings Our credit ratings at year end 2005 and 2004 were as follows: December 31, 2005 2004 Senior Senior Unsecured Outlook Unsecured Outlook Moodys Ba1 Negative Baa3 Stable Standard & Poors B+ Negative BB+ Credit watch Negative Fitch B+ Stable BB+ Stable Although a ratings downgrade by any of the ratings agencies will not trigger an acceleration of any of our indebtedness, a downgrade may adversely affect our ability to access capital and would likely result in more stringent covenants and higher interest rates under the terms of any new indebtedness. Our current long term debt credit ratings as of March 15, 2006 are Ba1 with negative outlook, B+ with negative 65 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) outlook and B+ with stable outlook, as reported by Moodys Investors Service, Standard & Poors and Fitch Ratings, respectively. Payment of Dividends We have not paid any dividends on our common stock since December of 2002. As previously discussed, our ability to declare or pay dividends on common stock is currently restricted by the terms of our Three Year Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, the terms of our outstanding series of preferred stock do not permit us to pay dividends on our common stock unless all accumulated and unpaid dividends have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid, or provision for the payment thereof has been made. We pay annual dividends on each share of Series A Preferred Stock in the amount of $2.6875. Annual dividends on each share of Series A Preferred Stock are payable quarterly in cash or, if certain conditions are met, in common stock, at our option, on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year. In addition to the stated annual dividend, if at any time on or before December 15, 2006, we pay a cash dividend on our common stock, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock participate in such distributions via adjustments to the conversion ratio, thereby increasing the number of common shares into which the Preferred Stock will ultimately convert. In March 2006, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.671875 per share on our Series A Preferred Stock, resulting in a maximum possible aggregate dividend of $5.0. We pay annual dividends on each share of Series B Preferred Stock in the amount of $52.50 per share. The initial dividend on our Series B Preferred Stock is $11.8125 per share and was declared on December 19, 2005 and paid in cash on January 17, 2006. Annual dividends on each share of Series B Preferred Stock are payable quarterly in cash or, if certain conditions are met, in common stock, at our option, on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year. The dividend rate of the Series B Preferred Stock will be increased by 1.0% if we do not pay dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock for six quarterly periods (whether consecutive or not). The dividend rate will revert back to the original rate once all unpaid dividends are paid in full. The dividend rate of the Series B Preferred Stock will also be increased by 1.0% if we do not file our periodic reports with the SEC within 15 days after the required filing date during the first two year period following the closing of the offering. In March 2006, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $13.125 per share on our Series B Preferred Stock, resulting in a maximum possible aggregate dividend of $6.9. Dividends on each series of our preferred stock are cumulative from the date of issuance and are payable on each payment date to the extent that we are in compliance with our Three Year Revolving Credit Facility, assets are legally available to pay dividends and our Board of Directors or an authorized committee of our Board declares a dividend payable. If we do not pay dividends on any series of our preferred stock for six quarterly periods (whether consecutive or not), then holders of all series of our preferred stock then outstanding will have the right to elect two additional directors to the Board. These additional directors will remain on the Board until all accumulated and unpaid dividends on our cumulative preferred stock have been paid in full, or to the extent our series of non cumulative preferred stock is outstanding, until non cumulative dividends have been paid regularly for at least one year. 66 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following summarizes our estimated contractual obligations at December 31, 2005, and their effect on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods: 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total Long term debt* $ 3.1 $ 4.7 $ 256.7 $ 250.8 $ 0.8 $ 1,670.0 $ 2,186.1 Interest payments $ 128.1 $ 128.8 $ 123.5 $ 107.6 $ 58.1 $ 123.8 $ 669.9 Non cancelable operating lease obligations $ 287.1 $ 250.2 $ 222.5 $ 194.6 $ 172.2 $ 793.6 $ 1,920.2 * Holders of our $800.0 4.50% Notes may require us to repurchase the 4.50% Notes for cash at par in March 2008. If all holders require us to repurchase these Notes, a total of $1,056.7 will be payable in 2008 in respect of long term debt. These Notes will mature in 2023 if not converted or repurchased. We have contingent obligations under guarantees of certain obligations of our subsidiaries (parent company guarantees) relating principally to credit facilities, guarantees of certain media payables and operating leases of certain subsidiaries. The amount of such parent company guarantees was approximately $306.8 and $601.8 at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In the event of non payment by the applicable subsidiary of the obligations covered by a guarantee, we would be obliged to pay the amounts covered by that guarantee. As of December 31, 2005, there are no material assets pledged as security for such parent company guarantees. We have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans in the contractual obligations table. Our funding policy regarding our funded pension plan is to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements plus such additional amounts from time to time as are determined to be appropriate to improve the plans funded status. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets, level of market interest rates and levels of voluntary contributions to the plans. Declines in long term interest rates have had a negative impact on the funded status of the plans. For 2006, we expect to contribute $17.8 to fund our domestic pension plans, and expect to contribute $22.1 to our foreign pension plans. We have structured certain acquisitions with additional contingent purchase price obligations in order to reduce the potential risk associated with negative future performance of the acquired entity. In addition, we have entered into agreements that may require us to purchase additional equity interests in certain consolidated and unconsolidated subsidiaries. The amounts relating to these transactions are based on estimates of the future financial performance of the acquired entity, the timing of the exercise of these rights, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other factors. We have not recorded a liability for these items on the balance sheet since the definitive amounts payable are not determinable or distributable. When the contingent acquisition obligations have been met and the consideration is distributable, we will record the fair value of this consideration as an additional cost of the acquired entity. The following table details the estimated liability and the estimated amount that would be paid under such options, in the event of exercise at the earliest exercise date. All payments are contingent upon achieving projected operating performance targets and satisfying other conditions specified in the related agreements and are subject to revisions as the earn out periods progress. 67 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) The following contingent acquisition obligations are net of compensation expense, except as noted below, as defined by the terms and conditions of the respective acquisition agreements and employment terms of the former owners of the acquired businesses. This future expense will not be allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired. As of December 31, 2005, our estimated contingent acquisition obligations are as follows: 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total Deferred Acquisition Payments Cash $ 18.3 $ 1.8 $ 0.9 $ 10.5 $ $ $ 31.5 Stock 11.3 0.3 11.6 Put Options with Consolidated Affiliates* Cash 23.4 2.3 11.4 2.8 1.8 2.9 44.6 Stock 0.1 0.3 0.5 0.9 Put Options with Unconsolidated Affiliates* Cash 1.3 2.5 11.5 0.3 15.6 Stock 0.4 1.0 0.6 0.3 2.3 Call Options with Consolidated Affiliates* Cash 3.3 0.4 0.4 0.1 2.7 6.9 Stock 0.1 0.1 Subtotal Cash 46.3 7.0 24.2 13.7 4.5 2.9 98.6 Subtotal Stock 11.9 1.6 1.1 0.3 14.9 Total Contingent Acquisition Payments $ 58.2 $ 8.6 $ 25.3 $ 14.0 $ 4.5 $ 2.9 $ 113.5 In accounting for acquisitions, we recognize deferred payments and purchases of additional interests after the effective date of purchase that are contingent upon the future employment of owners as compensation expense in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. As of December 31, 2005, our estimated contingent acquisition payments with associated compensation expense impacts are as follows: 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total Compensation Expense Related Payments Cash $ 16.6 $ 0.8 $ 12.8 $ 5.4 $ 1.3 $ 0.9 $ 37.8 Stock 0.1 0.1 Subtotal 16.7 0.8 12.8 5.4 1.3 0.9 37.9 Total Payments $ 74.9 $ 9.4 $ 38.1 $ 19.4 $ 5.8 $ 3.8 $ 151.4 * We have entered into certain acquisitions that contain both put and call options with similar terms and conditions. In such instances, we have included the related estimated contingent acquisition obligations with Put Options. We maintain certain put options with consolidated affiliates that are exercisable at the discretion of the minority owners as of December 31, 2005. These put options are assumed to be exercised in the earliest possible period subsequent to December 31, 2005. Therefore, the related estimated acquisition payments of $33.5 have been included within the total payments expected to be made in 2006 in the table above. These payments, if not made in 2006, will continue to carry forward into 2007 or beyond until they are exercised or expire. The 2006 obligations relate primarily to acquisitions that were completed prior to December 31, 2001. 68 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES We periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements and forward contracts to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations and to mitigate foreign exchange volatility. In January 2005, we executed an interest rate swap which synthetically converted $150.0 of the $500.0, 7.25% Senior Unsecured Notes due August 2011, of fixed rate debt to floating rates. We entered into the swap to hedge a portion of our floating interest rate exposure on our cash investments. In May of 2005, we terminated all of our long term interest rate swap agreements covering the $350.0 6.25% Senior Unsecured Notes and $150.0 of the $500.0 7.25% Senior Unsecured Notes. In connection with the interest rate swap termination, our net cash receipts were approximately $1.1, which will be recorded as an offset to interest expense over the remaining life of the related debt. We have entered into foreign currency transactions in which various foreign currencies are bought or sold forward. These contracts were entered into to meet currency requirements arising from specific transactions. The changes in value of these forward contracts have been recorded as other income or expense in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had contracts covering approximately $6.2 and $1.8, respectively, of notional amount of currency and the fair value of the forward contracts was negligible. The terms of the 4.50% Notes include two embedded derivative instruments and the terms of our Series B Preferred Stock include one embedded derivative. The fair value of the three derivatives on December 31, 2005 was negligible. INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING We have identified numerous material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, as set forth in greater detail in Item 8, Managements Assessment on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting and Item 9A, Controls and Procedures, of this report. Each of our material weaknesses results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. As a result, we have assessed that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2005. We are in the process of developing and implementing remedial measures to address the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. However, because of our decentralized structure and our many disparate accounting systems of varying quality and sophistication, we have extensive work remaining to remedy these material weaknesses. We are in the process of developing a work plan for remedying all of the identified material weaknesses and this work will extend beyond the 2006 fiscal year. At present, there can be no assurance as to when these material weaknesses will be remedied. Until our remediation is completed, we will continue to incur the expenses and management burdens associated with the manual procedures and additional resources required to prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements. There will also continue to be a substantial risk that we will be unable to file our periodic reports with the SEC in a timely manner. We discuss these risks in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Annual Report. LIABILITIES RELATING TO OUR PRIOR RESTATEMENT Restatement Related Matters As described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in our 2004 Annual Report on Form 10 K filed in September 2005, we restated previously reported financial statements for 2003, 2002, 2001, 2000 and for the first three quarters of 2004 and all four quarters of 2003. We refer to that restatement as the Prior Restatement. During our Prior Restatement, we conducted an extensive 69 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) examination of financial information and significant transactions and recorded expense and liabilities related to Vendor Discounts or Credits, Internal Investigations, and International Compensation Arrangements. A summary of the remaining liabilities related to these matters is as follows: Balance as of Balance as of 12/31/05 12/31/04 Vendor Discounts or Credits* $ 284.8 $ 283.9 Internal Investigations* (includes asset reserves) 24.7 61.7 International Compensation Arrangements 36.2 40.3 Total $ 345.7 $ 385.9 * $37.5 of vendor credits disclosed within Internal Investigations as of December 31, 2004 has been reclassified to Vendor Discounts or Credits for current year presentation. Vendor Discounts or Credits We receive credits from our vendors and media outlets for the acquisition of goods and services that are entered into on behalf of our clients. The expenses include the purchase of various forms of media, including television, radio, and print advertising space, or production costs, such as the creation of advertising campaigns, commercials, and print advertisements. Revenues in the advertising and communicative services business are frequently recorded net of third party costs as the business is primarily an agent for its clients. Since these costs are billed to clients, there are times when vendor credits or price differences can affect the net revenue recorded by the agency. These third party discounts, rebates, or price differences are frequently referred to as credits. Our contracts are typically fixed fee arrangements or cost based arrangements. In fixed fee arrangements, the amount we charge our clients is comprised of a fee for our services. The fee we earn, however, is not affected by the level of expenses incurred. Therefore, any rebates or credits received in servicing these accounts do not create a liability to the client. In cost based arrangements, we earn a percentage commission or flat fee based on or incremental to the expenses incurred. In these cases, rebates or credits received may accrue to the benefit of our clients and create a liability payable to the client. The interpretation of cost language included in our contracts can vary across international and domestic markets in which we operate and can affect whether or not we have a liability to the client. The terms of agreements with our clients are significantly impacted by the following: 1) the types of vendor credits obtained (rebates, discounts, media and production credits); 2) differing contract types with clients (fixed fee vs. cost based arrangements); 3) varying industry practices and laws in the regions of the world in which we operate; 4) determining which contract (global, regional or local) governs our relationships with clients; and 5) unique contract provisions in specific contracts. Prior to filing our 2004 Annual Report, we performed an extensive examination of our client contracts and arrangements and considered local law in the international jurisdictions where we conduct business to determine the impact of improperly recognizing these vendor credits as additional revenue instead of recognizing a liability to our clients. We identified areas where there were differences in prices billed to customers and prices received from vendors. All differences associated with cost based contracts not already passed back to customers were established as liabilities. 70 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Following the filing of the 2004 10 K in September of 2005, we began contacting clients to notify them of these liabilities and to negotiate an appropriate settlement. During this process the additional following information came to our attention. Additional global or regional master contracts, with contractual terms that required us to rebate vendor discounts or credits, took precedence over local contracts that did not require us to rebate vendor discounts or credits. Certain misinterpretations of contractual terms and or applicable local law in our Prior Restatement led us to re examine our agencies legal assessment process. As a result, our legal department coordinated the engagement of local counsel in order to provide definitive guidance regarding specific local laws, existing legal precedent and historical, as well as, ongoing legal market practices. This legal guidance required additional adjustments to be made to the liabilities established in the Prior Restatement. The liability recorded during our Prior Restatement in some instances either covered too many years or did not cover enough years as required by the statute of limitations, based on the contract we determined ultimately governed. We adjusted our liabilities for all years required under the statute of limitations in the appropriate jurisdiction. In connection with our Prior Restatement, we estimated certain amounts of our exposures. We have determined that in certain instances our initial estimate of the liability recorded required adjustment. Additionally, certain entries originally recorded as estimates have been revised based on actual data retrieved from agency books and records. We performed a detailed review of situations in which billings from vendors and billings to our clients were different. An appropriate adjustment was recorded for any known scenarios where such information was fully reconciled and the difference was not related to a cost based contract. For certain liabilities where the statute of limitations has lapsed, we appropriately released such liabilities, unless the liabilities were associated with customers with whom we are in the process of settling or we intend to settle such liabilities. We have included a table that depicts the beginning balance, the additional liabilities recorded and the adjustment reducing these liabilities. While we had changes to our original reserve positions, the net impact of adjustments, excluding fluctuations related to payments and foreign currency and other was an increase to the liability balance of $22.9, and that was primarily attributable to the out of period vendor discounts or credits adjustments. Balance as of Liability Additional Balance as of 12/31/04 Reversals Liabilities Payments Other 12/31/05 Vendor Discounts or Credits $ 283.9 (76.5 ) 99.4 (11.6 ) (10.4 ) $ 284.8 Internal Investigations In our Prior Restatement review, we noted instances of possible employee misconduct. As a result, through December 31, 2004, we recorded adjustments with a cumulative impact on income of $114.8. Of this amount, $61.7 related to liabilities and asset reserves, $15.6 to asset write offs, and $37.5 related to Vendor Discounts or Credits as of December 31, 2004. These adjustments were recorded to correct certain unintentional errors in our accounting that were discovered as a result of investigations and primarily related to agencies outside the United States. However, certain of these investigations revealed deliberate 71 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) falsification of accounting records, evasion of taxes in jurisdictions outside the United States, inappropriate charges to clients, diversion of corporate assets, non compliance with local laws and regulations, and other improprieties. These errors were not prevented or detected earlier because of material weaknesses in our control environment and decentralized operating structure. We recorded liabilities related to these matters, for business locations under investigation in our Prior Restatement review, which represented managements best estimate of probable exposure based on the facts available at that time. The law firm of Dewey Ballantine LLP was retained to advise the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors regarding the discharge of its obligations. Through the filing of this document, Dewey Ballantine has reviewed all internal investigations cases that were included in our Prior Restatement and continues to oversee our related remediation plans. Dewey Ballantine retained a forensic accounting firm to assist with its review. During 2005, we recorded a net decrease in our liabilities for Internal Investigations of $37.0. The decrease is primarily due to write off of assets reserves, the recognition of deferred revenue, and payment of taxes, penalties and interest. We also divested certain agencies in Greece, Spain, Azerbaijan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Bulgaria and Kazakhstan. We have increased our reserves related to additional VAT and payroll related taxes. Below is an update of our significant cases. At our McCann and FCB agencies in Turkey we recorded adjustments related to the retention of vendor discounts that should have been remitted to clients, the improper valuation of a previously acquired business over billing clients for payments to vendors and evasion of local taxes. In 2005, the investigation has concluded and we have taken the appropriate personnel actions, including the termination of local senior management. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the remaining liabilities were $12.6 and $19.8, respectively. At Media First in New York City we recorded adjustments related primarily to inadequate recordkeeping and the payment of certain employee salaries through accounts payable, without appropriate tax withholdings, resulting in increased earn out payments. In 2005, we recorded asset write offs and have taken the appropriate personnel actions, including the termination of local senior management. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the remaining liabilities and asset reserves were $1.2 and $10.8, respectively. At our FCB agency in Spain we recorded adjustments related to the use of companies that were formed to account for the production and media volume discounts received from production suppliers on a separate set of books and records, to prevent the detection of discounts and rebates in the event of a client audit. In addition compensation was paid to an agency executives personal service company out of these companies without proper withholding for income taxes. In 2005, we have divested our interest in a component of FCB Spain and signed an affiliation agreement with the management, with an appropriate control structure to assure future business is properly conducted. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the remaining liabilities and asset reserves were $0 and $9.8, respectively. At five McCann agencies in Azerbaijan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Bulgaria and Kazakhstan we recorded adjustments related to the failure to record and pay compensation related taxes, value added taxes and corporate income taxes, and inadequate record keeping. In 2005, we have sold these entities and signed affiliation agreements with Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan Bulgaria and Kazakhstan and intend to sign an affiliation agreement with Ukraine agency management. There will be an appropriate control structure to assure business is properly conducted. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the remaining liabilities and asset reserves were $6.2 and $8.7, respectively. 72 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) In addition, we also conducted other investigations in our Prior Restatement review for errors found that were similar in nature to those described above. In the aggregate, for these other investigations, we recorded $4.7 and $12.6 in liabilities as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. International Compensation Arrangements In our Prior Restatement review, we performed an extensive examination of employee compensation practices across our organization. While most practices were found to be acceptable, we identified some practices in certain jurisdictions that required additional review. In certain jurisdictions in which we operate, particularly in Europe and Latin America, it is common for individuals to establish a personal service company (PSC), in which case the hiring company will normally contract directly with the PSC for the services of the individual. We reviewed every situation where one of our agencies had contracted with a PSC and determined that in a number of instances, the use of a PSC was determined not to be supportable. We also identified other arrangements or practices in certain jurisdictions, such as payment of personal expenses outside the normal payroll mechanism, split salary payments, equity grants and retirement payments, and independent contractors/employees that led to an avoidance of paying certain taxes as well as not reporting compensation to local authorities. For these issues, liabilities represented our best estimate of expected payments to various governmental organizations in the jurisdictions involved. These amounts were estimates as of such date of our liabilities that we believed were sufficient to cover the obligations that we may have had to various authorities. As a result of the disclosures that were made in our 2004 Annual Report, we anticipate that the authorities in certain jurisdictions may undertake reviews to determine whether any of the activities disclosed violated local laws and regulations. This may lead to further investigations and the levy of additional assessments including possible fines and penalties. While we intend to defend against any assessment that we determine to be unfounded, nevertheless we could receive assessments which may be substantial. However, it cannot be determined at this time whether such investigations would be commenced or, if they are, what the outcome will be with any reasonable certainty. During 2005, we recorded a net decrease in our liabilities for International Compensation Arrangements of $4.1. The decrease is comprised of reductions in our liabilities due to the expiration of one year under the statutes of limitations, changes in managements estimates and the favorable outcome of audits in certain jurisdictions. The decrease is net of increases to our accruals due to additional liabilities incurred in 2005 through the continued use of a PSC or other such arrangements which we are in the process of terminating, as well as interest on amounts not yet settled. OUT OF PERIOD ADJUSTMENTS In the fourth quarter, we identified certain vendor discounts and credits, tax, and other miscellaneous adjustments in which our previously reported financial statements were in error or did not conform to GAAP. Because these changes are not material to our financial statements for the periods prior to 2005, or to 2005 as a whole, we have recorded them in the fourth quarter of 2005. The errors in our previously reported financial information, and the failure to prevent them or detect them in our financial reporting process, were largely attributable to weak internal controls. We concluded that our control environment has not progressed sufficiently to serve as an effective foundation for all other components of internal control. See Managements Assessment on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. 73 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) The following tables summarize the impact to the fourth quarter of 2005 of amounts recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005 which relate to reported revenue, operating income (loss), income (loss) from continuing operations before provision for income taxes, loss from continuing operations and loss per share. Impact of Adjustments on Revenue For the Three Months Ended December 31, 2005 Revenue as reported $ 1,895.7 Impact of adjustments: Vendor Discounts or Credits 21.2 Other adjustments (3.9 ) Total net adjustments 17.3 Revenue (exclusive of out of period amounts) $ 1,913.0 Impact of Adjustments on Operating Income For the Three Months Ended December 31, 2005 Operating Income as reported $ 57.6 Impact of adjustments: Vendor Discounts or Credits 23.2 Other adjustments (1.6 ) Total net adjustments 21.6 Operating Income (exclusive of out period amounts) $ 79.2 Impact of Adjustments on Income from Continuing Operations Before Provision For Income Taxes For the Three Months Ended December 31, 2005 Income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes as reported $ 44.6 Impact of adjustments: Vendor Discounts or Credits 22.9 Other adjustments (2.2 ) Total net adjustments 20.7 Income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes (exclusive of out of period amounts) $ 65.3 74 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC.

Description of Out of Period Adjustments: Vendor Discounts or Credits: We performed extensive procedures as a result of the initiation of settlement discussions with clients. The procedures broadly considered global or regional contracts, review of key changes in legal interpretations, review of statutes of limitations, estimated exposures and vendor price differences related to cost based contracts. As a result of these additional procedures, adjustments were recorded to our previously established liabilities. Other Adjustments We have identified other items which do not conform to GAAP and recorded adjustments to our 2005 Consolidated Financial Statements which relate to previously reported periods. The most significant include accounting related to the capitalization of software costs, acquisition related costs and international compensation arrangements. Tax Adjustments We recorded adjustments to correct the Accrued and Deferred income taxes for items primarily related to the computation of income tax benefits on the 2004 Long lived Asset Impairment Charges, the establishment of certain valuation allowances, the accounting for certain international tax structures and 75 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) the computation of interest accruals on certain non US income tax contingencies. The impact of amounts recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005 was $8.7 of tax benefit. We also record the tax impact of the out of period adjustments described above, where applicable, based on the local statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction of the entity recording the adjustment. The impact of amounts recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005 was $10.8 of tax benefit. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the accompanying notes. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following critical accounting estimates involve managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. We consider these accounting estimates to be critical because changes in the underlying assumptions or estimates have the potential to materially impact our financial statements. Management has discussed with our Audit Committee the development, selection, application and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates. We regularly evaluate our judgments, assumptions and estimates based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be relevant under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Revenue Recognition Our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of advertising programs in various media and the planning and execution of other marketing and communications programs. Most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and accordingly, the terms of client engagements and the bases on which we earn commissions and fees vary significantly. Our client contracts are also becoming increasingly complex arrangements that frequently include provisions for incentive compensation and govern vendor rebates and credits. Our largest clients are multinational entities and, as such, we often provide services to these clients out of multiple offices and across various agencies. In arranging for such services to be provided, it is possible for both a global and local agreement to be initiated. Multiple agreements of this nature are reviewed by legal counsel to determine the governing terms to be followed by the offices and agencies involved. Critical judgments and estimates are involved in determining both the amount and timing of revenue recognition under these arrangements. Revenue for our services is recognized when all of the following criteria are satisfied: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) the price is fixed or determinable; (iii) collectibility is reasonably assured; and (iv) services have been performed. Depending on the terms of the client contract, fees for services performed can be primarily recognized three ways: proportional performance, straight line (or monthly basis) or completed contract. Fees are generally recognized as earned based on the proportional performance method of revenue recognition in situations where our fee is reconcilable to the actual hours incurred to service the client as detailed in a contractual staffing plan or where the fee is earned on a per hour basis, with the amount of revenue recognized in both situations limited to the amount realizable under the client contract. We believe an input based measure (the hour) is appropriate in situations where the client arrangement essentially functions as a time and out of pocket expense contract and the client receives the benefit of the services provided throughout the contract term. Fees are recognized on a straight line or monthly basis when service is provided essentially on a pro rata basis and the terms of the contract support monthly basis accounting. 76 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Certain fees (such as for major marketing events) are deferred until contract completion as the final act is so significant in relation to the service transaction taken as a whole. Fees are also recognized on a completed contract basis when the terms of the contract call for the delivery of discrete projects (milestone arrangements), if any of the criteria of SAB No. 104 were not satisfied prior to job completion or the terms of the contract do not otherwise qualify for proportional performance or monthly basis recognition. Incremental direct costs incurred related to contracts where revenue is accounted for on a completed contract basis are generally expensed as incurred. There are certain exceptions made for significant contracts or for certain agencies where the majority of the contracts are project based and systems are in place to properly capture appropriate direct costs. Commissions are generally earned on the date of the broadcast or publication. Contractual arrangements with clients may also include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of the revenue to our performance relative to both qualitative and quantitative goals. Performance incentives are recognized as revenue for quantitative targets when the target has been achieved and for qualitative targets when confirmation of the incentive is received from the client. Therefore, depending on the terms of the client contract, revenue is derived from diverse arrangements involving fees for services performed, commissions, performance incentive provisions and combinations of the three. The classification of client arrangements to determine the appropriate revenue recognition involves judgments. If the judgments change there can be a material impact on our financial statements, and particularly on the allocation of revenues between periods. Substantially all of our revenue is recorded as the net amount of our gross billings less pass through expenses charged to a client. In most cases, the amount that is billed to clients significantly exceeds the amount of revenue that is earned and reflected in our financial statements, because of various pass through expenses such as production and media costs. In compliance with EITF Issue No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, we assess whether the agency or the third party supplier is the primary obligor. We evaluate the terms of our client agreements as part of this assessment. In addition, we give appropriate consideration to other key indicators such as latitude in establishing price, discretion in supplier selection and credit risk to the vendor. Because we operate broadly as an advertising agency based on our primary lines of business and given the industry practice to generally record revenue on a net versus gross basis, we believe that there must be strong evidence in place to overcome the presumption of net revenue accounting. Accordingly, we generally record revenue net of pass through charges as we believe the key indicators of the business suggest we generally act as an agent on behalf of our clients in our primary lines of business. In those businesses (primarily sales promotion, event, sports and entertainment marketing and corporate and brand identity services) where the key indicators suggest we act as a principal, we record the gross amount billed to the client as revenue and the related costs incurred as operating expenses. The determination whether revenue in a particular line of business should be recognized net or gross involves difficult judgments. If we make these judgments differently, it could significantly affect our financial performance. If it were determined that we must recognize a significant portion of revenues on a gross basis rather than a net basis, it would positively impact revenues, but have no impact on our operating income. Conversely, if it were determined that we must recognize a significant portion of revenues on a net basis rather than a gross basis, it would negatively impact revenues, but have no impact on our operating income. As we provide services as part of our core operations, we generally incur incidental expenses, which, in practice, are commonly referred to as out of pocket expenses. These expenses often include expenses related to airfare, mileage, hotel stays, out of town meals and telecommunication charges. In accordance 77 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) with EITF Issue No. 01 14, Income Statement Characterization of Reimbursements Received for Out of Pocket Expenses Incurred, we record the reimbursements received for incidental expenses as revenue. We receive credits from our vendors and media outlets for transactions entered into on behalf of our clients, which are passed through to our clients in accordance with contractual provisions and local law. If a pass through is not required, then these credits are a reduction of vendor cost, and are generally recorded as additions to revenue. In connection with our Prior Restatement, where it was impractical to review client contracts, we used statistical methods to estimate our exposure that could arise from credits, discounts and other rebates owed to clients. If our estimate is insufficient, we may be required to recognize additional liabilities. If the initial estimate of the liability recorded is subsequently determined to be over or under provided for, the difference is recorded as an adjustment to revenue. If we are able to negotiate a favorable settlement of a recorded liability, however, the reversal of this amount is recorded in a non operating income account since negotiating a favorable outcome with a client is not considered a revenue generating activity. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on the aging of accounts receivable, reviews of client credit reports, industry trends and economic indicators, as well as analysis of recent payment history for specific customers. The estimate is based largely on a formula driven calculation but is supplemented with economic indicators and knowledge of potential write offs of specific client accounts. Though we consider the balance to be adequate, changes in general domestic and international economic conditions in specific markets could have a material impact on the required reserve balance. A 10% increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts would result in a $10.6 increase in bad debt expense for 2005. Income Taxes The provision for income taxes includes federal, state, local and foreign taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. The realization of our deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future earnings. Any reduction in estimated forecasted results may require that we record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets. In connection with the U.S. deferred tax assets, management believes that it is more likely than not that a substantial amount of the deferred tax assets will be realized; a valuation allowance has been established for the remainder. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future U.S. taxable income are lower than anticipated. Once a valuation allowance has been established, it will be maintained until there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. A pattern of sustained profitability will generally be considered as sufficient positive evidence to reverse a valuation allowance. If the allowance is reversed in a future period, our income tax provision will be correspondingly reduced. Accordingly, the establishment and reversal of valuation allowances has had and could have a significant negative or positive impact on our future earnings. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 78 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that, if changed, would result in either an increase or decrease in the provision for income taxes in the period of change. Undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are permanently reinvested. While the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Jobs Act) creates a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate undistributed international earnings by providing an 85% dividends received deduction, we have reviewed the provisions and determined not to take advantage of this provision to repatriate undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. Land, Buildings and Equipment The assignment of useful lives to buildings and equipment involves judgments and the use of estimates. Buildings and equipment are depreciated generally using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from 3 to 7 years for furniture, equipment and computer software costs, 10 to 35 years for buildings and the shorter of the useful life of the asset (which ranges from 3 to 10 years) or the remaining lease term for leasehold improvements. A one year decrease in the useful lives of these assets would result in an $19.1 increase in annual depreciation expense for 2005. Certain events or changes in circumstances could cause us to conclude that the carrying value of our buildings and equipment may not be recoverable. Events or circumstances that might require impairment testing include, but are not limited to, decrease in market price, negative forecasted cash flow, or a significant adverse change in business climate of the asset grouping. If the total estimate of the expected future undiscounted cash flows of an asset grouping over its useful life is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized in the financial statements equal to the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of the asset grouping. If our estimates change, it may have a material impact on our financial statements. Investments We regularly review our cost and equity method investments to determine whether a significant event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have an adverse effect on the fair value of each investment. In the event a decline in fair value of an investment occurs, we must determine if the decline has been other than temporary. We consider our investments strategic and long term in nature, so we must determine if the fair value decline is recoverable within a reasonable period. For investments accounted for using the cost or equity basis, we evaluate fair value based on specific information (valuation methodologies, estimates of appraisals, financial statements, etc.) in addition to quoted market price, if available. Factors indicative of an other than temporary decline also include recurring operating losses, credit defaults and subsequent rounds of financing with pricing that is below the cost basis of the investment. This list is not all inclusive; we consider all known quantitative and qualitative factors in determining if an other than temporary decline in value of an investment has occurred. Our assessments of fair value represent our best estimates at the time of impairment review. If different fair values are later estimated, it could have a material impact on our financial statements. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We account for our business combinations using the purchase accounting method. The total costs of the acquisitions are allocated to the underlying net assets, based on their respective estimated fair market values and the remainder allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets. Considering the characteristics 79 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) of advertising, specialized marketing and communication services companies, our acquisitions usually do not have significant amounts of tangible assets as the principal asset we typically acquire is creative talent. As a result, a substantial portion of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill. Determining the fair market value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires managements judgment and involves the use of significant estimates, including future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market multiples. We review goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization (e.g., customer lists, trade names and customer relationships) annually or whenever events or significant changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at a reporting unit level. We have 16 reporting units that are either the entities at the operating segment level or one level below the operating segment level. For 2005, in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, we did not test certain reporting units whose 2004 fair value determination exceeded their carrying amount by a substantial margin, where no significant event occurred since the last fair value determination that would significantly change this margin and where the reporting units did not have a triggering event during 2005. The remaining reporting units were tested either as part of the 2005 annual impairment testing as their 2004 fair value did not significantly exceed their carrying value by a substantial margin or as a result of a triggering event. We review intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization whenever events or circumstances indicate that a carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization are amortized on a straight line basis with estimated useful lives generally ranging from 1 to 15 years. Events or circumstances that might require impairment testing include the loss of a significant client, the identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit, loss of key personnel, the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit, or a significant adverse change in business climate or regulations. SFAS No. 142 specifies a two step process for testing for goodwill impairment and measuring the magnitude of any impairment. The first step of the impairment test is a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. Goodwill allocated to a reporting unit whose fair value is equal to or greater than its carrying value is not impaired and no further testing is required. Should the carrying amount for a reporting unit exceed its fair value, then the first step of the impairment test is failed and the magnitude of any goodwill impairment is determined under the second step. The second step is a comparison of the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill to its carrying value. Goodwill of a reporting unit is impaired when its carrying value exceeds its implied fair value. Impaired goodwill is written down to its implied fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified. The fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using our projections of discounted future operating cash flows (without interest) of the unit. Such projections require the use of significant estimates and assumptions as to matters such as future revenue growth, profit margins, capital expenditures, assumed tax rates and discount rates. We believe that the estimates and assumptions made are reasonable but they are susceptible to change from period to period. For example, our strategic decisions or changes in market valuation multiples could lead to impairment charges. Actual results of operations, cash flows and other factors used in a discounted cash flow valuation will likely differ from the estimates used and it is possible that differences and changes could be material. For the year ended December 31, 2005, we changed the date of our annual impairment test for goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives from September 30th to October 1st. During 2005 we performed this annual impairment test on September 30th and then again on October 1st to ensure that multiples used in the reporting units tested were consistent. By moving the date into the fourth 80 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) quarter we will be able to utilize the most current and accurate plan and forecast information. The new date also provides us additional time to meet future accelerated public reporting requirements. This change did not delay, accelerate or avoid an impairment charge. This change in accounting principle also did not have an effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Accordingly, we believe that the accounting change described above is an alternative accounting principle that is preferable. Our annual impairment reviews as of September 30th and October 1st, 2005 resulted in an impairment charge at a reporting unit within our sports and entertainment marketing business. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2005, there was a loss of a significant client at one of our reporting units that caused us to perform additional impairment testing. As a result, we recorded $97.0 of impairments during 2005. See Notes 8 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. The excess of the low range of the fair value over the carrying value for each of the non impaired reporting units ranged from approximately $2.4 to $1,501.9 and $6.4 to $1,501.9 in 2005 and 2004, respectively. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. The hypothetical 10% decrease applied to 2005 fair values for each of the non impaired reporting units would result in a range of an impairment charge of approximately $38.2 to excess fair value over carrying value of approximately $871.9. This hypothetical 10% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value for each of the non impaired reporting units ranging from approximately $3.4 to $871.9 in 2004. Acquisitions The majority of our acquisitions involve an initial payment at the time of closing and provide for additional contingent purchase price payments over a specified time. The initial purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values with any excess being recorded as goodwill and other intangible assets. These contingent payments, which are also known as earn outs and put options, are calculated based on estimates of the future financial performance of the acquired entity, the timing of the exercise of these rights, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other factors. Earn outs and put options are recorded within the financial statements as an increase to goodwill and other intangible assets once the terms and conditions of the contingent acquisition obligations have been met and the consideration is distributable or expensed as compensation based on the acquisition agreement and the terms and conditions of employment for the former owners of the acquired businesses. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this report and Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding future contingent acquisition obligations. Restructuring Reserves When appropriate, we establish restructuring reserves for severance and termination costs and lease termination and other exit costs related to our restructuring programs. We have established reserves for restructuring programs initiated in 2001 and 2003. The reserves reflect our best estimates for the costs of the plans. However, actual results may differ from the estimated amounts based on, but not limited to, changes in demand for advertising services and unexpected usage of leased properties. Comparison of actual results to estimates may materially impact the amount of the restructuring charges or reversals. We will continue to monitor our restructuring reserves and may adjust the current balances based on future events. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 81 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Pension and Postretirement Benefits We use various actuarial methods and assumptions in determining our pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations, including the discount rate used to determine the present value of future benefits, expected long term rate of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates. The discount rate determination is one of the significant assumptions that impacts our benefit cost and recorded obligations for pension and postretirement plans. Discount rates used for our benefit plans attempt to match the duration of the underlying liability with highly rated securities that could be used to effectively settle the obligation. For example, in 2005, a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would have increased our net benefit cost by approximately $2.0. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. OTHER MATTERS SEC Investigation The SEC opened a formal investigation in response to the restatement we first announced in August 2002 and, as previously disclosed, the SEC staffs investigation has expanded to encompass our Prior Restatement. In particular, since we filed our 2004 Form 10 K, we have received subpoenas from the SEC relating to matters addressed in our Prior Restatement. We continue to cooperate with the investigation. We expect that the investigation will result in monetary liability, but because the investigation is ongoing, in particular with respect to the Prior Restatement, we cannot reasonably estimate either the timing of a resolution or the amount. Accordingly, we have not yet established any accounting provision relating to these matters. RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete description of recent accounting pronouncements that have affected us or may affect us. 82 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks related to interest rates and foreign currency rates. From time to time, we use derivatives, pursuant to established guidelines and policies, to manage some portion of these risks. Derivative instruments utilized in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools, involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest Rates Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations. As further described in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, our principal debt obligations at December 31, 2005 consisted of our 4.50% Notes and Senior Unsecured Notes, with expiration dates ranging from 2009 to 2014. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, 86.0% and 81.1% of our debt obligations bore interest at fixed interest rates. Accordingly, assuming the fixed rate debt is not refinanced, there would be no impact on interest expense or cash flow from either a 10% increase or decrease in market rates of interest. However, there would be an impact on the fair market value of the debt, as the fair market value of debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates. For 2005, the fair market value of the debt obligations would decrease by approximately $27.7 if market rates were to increase by 10% and would increase by approximately $28.0 if market rates were to decrease by 10%. For 2004, the fair market value of the debt obligations would have decreased by approximately $16.3 if market rates increased by 10% and would have increased by approximately $19.5 if market rates decreased by 10%. For that portion of the debt that bore interest at variable rates, based on outstanding amounts and rates at December 31, 2005, interest expense and cash out flow would increase or decrease by approximately $2.1 if market rates were to increase or decrease by 10%, respectively. For that portion of the debt that bore interest at variable rates, based on outstanding amounts and rates at December 31, 2004, interest expense and cash out flow would have increased or decreased by approximately $1.8 if market rates increased or decreased by 10%, respectively. From time to time we have used interest rate swaps to manage the mix of our fixed and floating rate debt obligations. In May 2005, we terminated all our existing long term interest rate swap agreements, and currently have none outstanding. Foreign Currencies We face translation and transaction risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Amounts invested in our foreign operations are translated into U.S. Dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the stockholders equity section of our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, mitigating transaction risk. Since the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally the local currency, foreign currency translation of the balance sheet is reflected as a component of stockholders equity and does not impact operating results. Revenues and expenses in foreign currencies translate into varying amounts of U.S. Dollars depending upon whether the U.S. Dollar weakens or strengthens against other currencies. Therefore, changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses (as expressed in U.S. Dollars) from foreign operations. Currency transaction gains or losses arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in results of operations and were not significant in the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. We have not entered into a material amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 83 Table of Contents
