EXECUTIVE SUMMARY We are one of the worlds largest advertising and marketing services companies, comprised of communication agencies around the world that deliver custom marketing solutions on behalf of our clients. These agencies cover the spectrum of marketing disciplines and specialties, from traditional services such as consumer advertising and direct marketing, to emerging services such as mobile and search engine marketing. To meet the challenge of an increasingly complex consumer culture, we create customized marketing solutions for each of our clients. These solutions vary from project based work between one agency and its client to long term, fully integrated campaigns involving several of our companies working on behalf of a client. Furthermore, our agencies cover all major markets geographically and can operate in a single region or align work globally across many markets. Our strategy is focused on improving organic revenue growth and our operating income, and we are working to achieve a level of organic revenue growth comparable to industry peers and double digit operating margins by 2008. We analyze period to period changes in our operating performance by determining the portion of the change that is attributable to foreign currency rates and the change attributable to the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures, and the remainder is considered the organic change. For purposes of analyzing this change, acquisitions and divestitures are treated as if they occurred on the first day of the quarter during which the transaction occurred. Revenue is directly dependent upon the advertising, marketing and corporate communications requirements of our clients. For 2006, our revenues were negatively affected primarily by the client losses and dispositions that occurred in 2005, and we expect our operating margin will continue to be negatively affected, as compared to our peers, by high expenses for professional fees, although to a decreasing extent. It is typical in our industry to lose or resign from client accounts and assignments for many reasons, including conflicts with recent client wins. We 15 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) believe we are continuing our turnaround and our results for 2006 reflect the challenges we face improving revenues and operating margins. However, we have achieved some notable success in new client wins as well as fewer client losses in 2006, which supports our efforts in our turnaround. Our reported results are affected by fluctuations in the exchange rates of the foreign currencies of our international businesses, principally the Brazilian Real, Canadian Dollar, Japanese Yen, Pound Sterling, South African Rand and Euro. In 2006, the U.S. Dollar was weaker against most of these currencies compared to 2005. In 2005, the U.S. Dollar was weaker against most of these currencies compared to 2004. As a result, the net effect of foreign currency changes from comparable prior year periods was to increase revenues and operating expenses in 2006 and 2005. As discussed in more detail in this MD&A, for 2006 compared to 2005: Total revenue declined by 1.3%. Organic revenue increase was 1.0% primarily due to higher revenue from existing clients. Operating margin was 1.7% in 2006, compared to (1.7%) in 2005. Operating margin was negatively impacted by restructuring and other reorganization related charges and long lived asset impairment and other charges by 1.0% and 1.5% in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Excluding the impact of these items, operating margin improved to 2.7% in 2006 from (0.2%) in 2005. Operating expenses were $6,084.8 in 2006, compared to $6,378.5 in 2005, a decrease of 4.6%. Operating expenses were negatively impacted by restructuring and other reorganization related charges and long lived asset impairment and other charges of $61.7 and $91.3, in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Excluding the impact of these items, operating expenses decreased by $264.1, or 4.2%, in 2006. Total salaries and related expenses decreased 1.4% mainly due to net divestitures and lower severance charges, partly offset by higher incentive compensation. The organic increase was 0.5%. Total office and general expenses decreased 9.1% mainly due to the effect of net divestitures and lower professional fees. The organic decrease was 5.2%. As of December 31, 2006, cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased $234.4 primarily due to working capital usage, as well as costs associated with capital markets activity and capital expenditures, partially offset by improved operating results. We made substantial progress in remediating previous material weaknesses. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the accompanying notes. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following critical accounting estimates involve managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. We consider these accounting estimates to be critical because changes in the underlying assumptions or estimates have the potential to materially impact our financial statements. Management has discussed with our Audit Committee the development, selection, application and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates. We regularly evaluate our judgments, assumptions and estimates based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be relevant under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Revenue Recognition Our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of advertising programs in various media and the planning and execution of other marketing and communications programs. Most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and accordingly, the terms of client engagements and the basis on which we earn commissions and fees vary significantly. Our client contracts are complex arrangements that may include provisions for incentive compensation and govern vendor rebates and credits. Our largest clients are multinational entities and, as such, we often provide services to these clients out of multiple offices and across 16 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) various agencies. In arranging for such services to be provided, it is possible for a global, regional and local agreement to be initiated. Multiple agreements of this nature are reviewed by legal counsel to determine the governing terms to be followed by the offices and agencies involved. Critical judgments and estimates are involved in determining both the amount and timing of revenue recognition under these arrangements. Revenue for our services is recognized when all of the following criteria are satisfied: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) the price is fixed or determinable; (iii) collectibility is reasonably assured; and (iv) services have been performed. Depending on the terms of a client contract, fees for services performed can be primarily recognized in one of three ways: proportional performance, straight line (or monthly basis) or completed contract. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Depending on the terms of the client contract, revenue is derived from diverse arrangements involving fees for services performed, commissions, performance incentive provisions and combinations of the three. Commissions are generally earned on the date of the broadcast or publication. Contractual arrangements with clients may also include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of the revenue to our performance relative to both qualitative and quantitative goals. Performance incentives are recognized as revenue for quantitative targets when the target has been achieved and for qualitative targets when confirmation of the incentive is received from the client. The classification of client arrangements to determine the appropriate revenue recognition involves judgments. If the judgments change there can be a material impact on our financial statements, and particularly on the allocation of revenues between periods. Incremental direct costs incurred related to contracts where revenue is accounted for on a completed contract basis are generally expensed as incurred. There are certain exceptions made for significant contracts or for certain agencies where the majority of the contracts are project based and systems are in place to properly capture appropriate direct costs. Substantially all of our revenue is recorded as the net amount of our gross billings less pass through expenses charged to a client. In most cases, the amount that is billed to clients significantly exceeds the amount of revenue that is earned and reflected in our financial statements, because of various pass through expenses such as production and media costs. In compliance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 99 19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, we assess whether our agency or the third party supplier is the primary obligor. We evaluate the terms of our client agreements as part of this assessment. In addition, we give appropriate consideration to other key indicators such as latitude in establishing price, discretion in supplier selection and credit risk to the vendor. Because we operate broadly as an advertising agency based on our primary lines of business and given the industry practice to generally record revenue on a net versus gross basis, we believe that there must be strong evidence in place to overcome the presumption of net revenue accounting. Accordingly, we generally record revenue net of pass through charges as we believe the key indicators of the business suggest we generally act as an agent on behalf of our clients in our primary lines of business. In those businesses (primarily sales promotion, event, sports and entertainment marketing and corporate and brand identity services) where the key indicators suggest we act as a principal, we record the gross amount billed to the client as revenue and the related costs incurred as operating expenses. Revenue is reported net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are directly imposed on our revenue producing transactions. The determination as to whether revenue in a particular line of business should be recognized net or gross involves difficult judgments. If we make these judgments differently, it could significantly affect our financial performance. If it were determined that we must recognize a significant portion of revenues on a gross basis rather than a net basis, it would positively impact revenues, but have no impact on our operating income and an adverse impact on operating margin. Conversely, if it were determined that we must recognize a significant portion of revenues on a net basis rather than a gross basis, it would negatively impact revenues, but have no impact on our operating income and a positive impact on operation margin. We receive credits from our vendors and media outlets for transactions entered into on behalf of our clients that, based on the terms of our contracts and local law, are either remitted to our clients or retained by us. If amounts are to be passed through to clients they are recorded as liabilities until settlement or, if retained by us, are recorded as revenue when earned. 17 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Negotiations with a client at the close of a current engagement could result in either payments to the client in excess of the contractual liability or in payments less than the contractual liability. These items, referred to as concessions, relate directly to the operations of the period and are recorded as operating expense or income. Concession income or expense may also be realized in connection with settling vendor discount or credit liabilities that were established as part of the 2005 Restatement. In these situations, and given the historical nature of these liabilities, we have recorded such items as other income or expense in order to prevent distortion of current operating results. See also Notes 1 and 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Stock Based Compensation On January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R). SFAS No. 123R requires compensation costs related to share based transactions, including employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on fair value. We implemented SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective transition method. Under this transition method, the compensation expense recognized beginning January 1, 2006 includes compensation expense for (i) all stock based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, and (ii) all stock based awards granted subsequent to December 31, 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123R. Compensation cost is generally recognized ratably over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted, which requires the input of subjective assumptions including the options expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock. Changes in the assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value and our results of operations could be materially impacted. The expected volatility factor is based on a blend of historical volatility of our common stock and implied volatility of our tradable forward put and call options to purchase and sell shares of our common stock. The expected term is based on the average of an assumption that outstanding options are exercised upon achieving their full vesting date and will be exercised at the midpoint between the current date (i.e., the date awards have been ratably vested through) and their full contractual term. Additionally, we calculate an estimated forfeiture rate which impacts our recorded expense. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Income Taxes The provision for income taxes includes federal, state, local and foreign taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed. Changes to enacted tax rates would result in either increases or decreases in the provision for income taxes in the period of changes. We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and recognize a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. The realization of our deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future earnings. Any reduction in estimated forecasted results may require that we record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets. Once a valuation allowance has been established, it will be maintained until there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. A pattern of sustained profitability will generally be considered as sufficient positive evidence to reverse a valuation allowance. If the allowance is reversed in a future period, our income tax provision will be correspondingly reduced. Accordingly, the increase and decrease of valuation allowances has had and could have a significant negative or positive impact on our future earnings. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 18 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We account for our business combinations using the purchase accounting method. The total costs of the acquisitions are allocated to the underlying net assets, based on their respective estimated fair market values and the remainder allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets. Considering the characteristics of advertising, specialized marketing and communication services companies, our acquisitions usually do not have significant amounts of tangible assets as the principal asset we typically acquire is creative talent. As a result, a substantial portion of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill. Determining the fair market value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires managements judgment and involves the use of significant estimates, including future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market multiples. We review goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization during the fourth quarter or whenever events or significant changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at a reporting unit level. We identified 14 reporting units for the 2006 annual impairment testing that are either the entities at the operating segment level or one level below the operating segment level. We review intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization whenever events or circumstances indicate that a carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization are amortized on a straight line basis with estimated useful lives of up to 15 years. Events or circumstances that might require impairment testing include the loss of a significant client, the identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit, loss of key personnel, the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit, or a significant adverse change in business climate or regulations. SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, specifies a two step process for goodwill impairment testing and measuring the magnitude of any impairment. The first step of the impairment test is a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. Goodwill allocated to a reporting unit whose fair value is equal to or greater than its carrying value is not impaired, and no further testing is required. Should the carrying amount for a reporting unit exceed its fair value, then the first step of the impairment test is failed and the magnitude of any goodwill impairment is determined under the second step. The second step is a comparison of the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill to its carrying value. Goodwill of a reporting unit is impaired when its carrying value exceeds its implied fair value. Impaired goodwill is written down to its implied fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified. The fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using traditional valuation techniques such as the income approach, which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow method and the market approach, which incorporates the use of earning and revenue multiples. These techniques use projections which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions as to matters such as future revenue growth, profit margins, capital expenditures, assumed tax rates and discount rates. We believe that the estimates and assumptions made are reasonable but they are susceptible to change from period to period. For example, our strategic decisions or changes in market valuation multiples could lead to impairment charges. Actual results of operations, cash flows and other factors used in a discounted cash flow valuation will likely differ from the estimates used and it is possible that differences and changes could be material. Our annual impairment reviews as of October 1st, 2006 resulted in an impairment charge of $27.2 at one of our domestic advertising reporting units. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. The excess of the fair value over the carrying value at the low end of the valuation range for each of the non impaired reporting units ranged from $0.2 to $1,990.2 and $2.4 to $1,501.9 in 2006 and 2005, respectively. For 2006, this excess ranged from $2.4 to $2,400.2 at the high end of the valuation range. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. For 2006, this would result in the total carrying value being less than the total fair value at the low end of the range by $46.8, which would have triggered additional step two tests. For 2005, this hypothetical 10% decrease would result in the total carrying value being less than the total fair value at the low end of the range by $38.2, which would have triggered additional step two tests. 19 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Pension and Postretirement Benefits We use various actuarial assumptions in determining our net pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations. These assumptions include discount rates and expected returns on plan assets and are updated annually or more frequently with the occurrence of significant events. Changes in the related pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in the assumptions. The discount rate is one of the significant assumptions that impacts our net pension and postretirement costs and obligations. The discount rates are determined at the beginning of the year based on prevailing interest rates as of the measurement date and are adjusted to match the duration of the underlying obligation. For 2007, we plan to use weighted average discount rates of 5.68%, 4.82% and 5.75% for the domestic pension plans, foreign plans and the postretirement plan, respectively. Changes in the discount rates are generally due to increases or decreases in long term interest rates. A higher discount rate will decrease our pension cost. A 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the 2006 net pension and postretirement cost by $2.3 and $0.1, respectively. In addition, a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the December 31, 2006 benefit obligation by $31.4. The expected rate of return on pension plan assets is another significant assumption that impacts our net pension cost and is determined at the beginning of the year. Changes in the rates are due to lower or higher expected future returns based on the mix of assets held and studies performed by our external investment advisors. For 2007, we plan to use weighted average expected rates of return of 8.16% and 7.57% for the domestic and foreign pension plans, respectively. A lower expected rate of return will increase our net pension cost. A 25 basis point increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would have decreased or increased the 2006 net pension cost by $1.1. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Results of Operations REVENUE 2006 Compared to 2005 Components of change during 2006 Change Net Net Foreign acquisitions/ Foreign acquisitions/ 2005 currency (divestitures) Organic 2006 currency (divestitures) Organic Total Total $ 6,274.3 20.6 (165.4 ) 61.3 $ 6,190.8 0.3 % (2.6 )% 1.0 % (1.3 )% Domestic 3,461.1 (38.3 ) 18.4 3,441.2 (1.1 )% 0.5 % (0.6 )% International 2,813.2 20.6 (127.1 ) 42.9 2,749.6 0.7 % (4.5 )% 1.5 % (2.3 )% Revenue decreased due to net divestitures partially offset by organic revenue increases and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Net divestitures primarily impacted the Integrated Agency Networks (IAN) segment, largely from Draftfcb and McCann during 2005. There were net organic revenue increases in both our international and domestic locations. The international organic increase was driven by higher revenue from existing clients primarily in the Asia Pacific and Latin America regions partially offset by net client losses, primarily in 2005, at IAN as well as decreases in the events marketing businesses at the Constituency Management Group (CMG) in the United Kingdom region. The domestic organic increase was primarily driven by growth in the public relations and branding businesses at CMG as well as higher revenue from existing clients, partially offset by net client losses and decreased client spending at IAN. 20 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC.

The revenue decline from net divestitures was largely due to dispositions at McCann during 2005 primarily in the Europe and United States regions and the sale of the Motorsports business during 2004. The organic revenue decrease was driven by IAN, partially offset by an increase at CMG. The decrease at IAN was a result of client losses and a reduction in revenue from existing clients primarily in our European offices. The increase at CMG was primarily driven by growth in public relations businesses internationally and the sports marketing businesses domestically as a result of increased spending from existing clients and client wins.

Salaries and related expenses do not vary significantly with short term changes in revenue levels. However, salaries may fluctuate due to the timing of hiring freelance contractors who are utilized to support business development, changes in the funding levels of short and long term incentive awards and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our financial performance over the past few years has lagged behind our peers, primarily due to lower revenue growth. As a result, salaries and related expenses reflect significant severance charges, primarily incurred in previous years, and investments in hiring creative talent to realign the business for revenue growth and improved operating margins. Also, salaries and related expenses reflect the hiring of additional finance professionals and information technology staff to upgrade system infrastructure and to address weaknesses in our accounting and control environment, as well as to develop shared services.

AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) 2006 Compared to 2005 Salaries and related expenses decreased during 2006 due to net divestitures, primarily from the sale of several businesses at IAN during 2005, partially offset by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and a slight organic increase. Total salaries and related expenses as a percentage of revenue remained flat as a result of the decline in revenue. Key factors behind the change in salaries and related expenses from the prior year were a significant reduction in severance expense of $63.7, offset by an increase in long term incentive awards and bonus awards of $67.2. Expenses related to incentive awards increased in 2006 due to long term equity based awards granted in June 2006 and the full year impact of awards granted in August 2005, while expenses related to bonus awards increased primarily due to performance. The slight organic increase reflected in CMG and Corporate was offset by a decrease at IAN and was primarily the result of higher salary costs to upgrade our talent and to support revenue initiatives and technology related projects, increased incentive awards and bonus awards. This was partially offset by a decrease in severance expense, primarily at international locations within IAN, which we incurred in 2005 due to client losses. 2005 Compared to 2004 Salaries and related expenses increased primarily due to an organic increase and changes in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by net divestitures, primarily at McCann during 2005 and the sale of the Motorsports business during 2004. The organic increase was primarily the result of higher severance expense, largely recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005 for international headcount reductions within IAN as a result of client losses, the hiring of additional creative talent to enable future revenue growth, additional staff to address weaknesses in our accounting and control environment, and to develop shared services at certain locations. Office and General Expenses Office and general expenses include rent expense, professional fees, expenses attributable to the support of client service professional staff, depreciation and amortization costs, bad debt expense relating to accounts receivable, the costs associated with the development of a shared services center and implementation costs associated with upgrading our information technology infrastructure. Office and general expenses also include costs directly attributable to client engagements. These costs include out of pocket costs such as travel for client service professional staff, production costs and other direct costs that are rebilled to our clients.

The decline in office and general expenses occurred in both segments as well as Corporate. Partially offsetting this decrease were higher rent expense and reduced foreign exchange gains on certain balance sheet items. The above items resulted in an organic decline which was primarily reflected at Corporate and IAN. 2005 Compared to 2004 Office and general expenses for 2005 increased as a result of an organic increase and changes in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by net divestitures, primarily at McCann during 2005 and the sale of the Motorsports business during 2004. The organic increase was primarily the result of higher professional fees, 22 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) primarily at IAN and our Corporate group, driven by our ongoing efforts in internal control compliance, the 2005 Restatement process and the preliminary development, application and maintenance of information technology systems and processes related to our shared services initiatives. Restructuring and Other Reorganization Related Charges (Reversals) The components of restructuring and other reorganization related charges (reversals) were as follows: Years ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Other reorganization related charges $ 33.0 $ $ Restructuring charges (reversals) 1.5 (7.3 ) 62.2 Total $ 34.5 $ (7.3 ) $ 62.2 Other Reorganization Related Charges Other reorganization related charges primarily represent severance charges directly associated with two significant strategic business decisions: the merger of Draft Worldwide and Foote, Cone and Belding Worldwide to create a global integrated marketing organization called Draftfcb; and our realignment of our media business to meet evolving client needs. In addition, we have recorded lease termination charges in relation to the exit of certain properties for these strategic business decisions. These charges were separated from salaries and related expenses and office and general expenses as they did not result from charges that occurred in the normal course of business. We expect charges relating to these business decisions to be complete during the first half of 2007. Restructuring Charges (Reversals) We record charges and (reversals) primarily related to changes in assumptions in connection with lease termination and other exit costs and severance and termination costs for the 2003 and 2001 restructuring programs. The 2003 program was initiated in response to softness in demand for advertising and marketing services. The 2001 program was initiated following the acquisition of True North Communications Inc. and was designed to integrate the acquisition and improve productivity. A summary of the net charges and (reversals) for the 2003 and 2001 restructuring program is as follows: Years ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Lease termination and other exit costs $ 1.5 $ (5.9 ) $ 47.8 Severance and termination costs (1.4 ) 14.4 Total $ 1.5 $ (7.3 ) $ 62.2 During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 net lease termination and other exit costs were primarily related to adjustments to managements estimates to decrease the restructuring reserves as a result of changes in sublease rental income assumptions and utilization of previously vacated properties relating to the 2003 program by certain of our agencies due to improved economic conditions in certain markets. During the year ended December 31, 2004 net lease termination and other exit costs were recorded primarily for the 2003 restructuring program for the vacating of 43 offices located primarily in the U.S. and Europe. Charges were recorded at net present value and were net of estimated sublease rental income. These charges were partially offset primarily by managements adjustments to estimates as a result of our negotiation of terms upon the exit of leased properties and for other reasons similar to those mentioned above for 2006 and 2005. Severance and termination costs were recorded for a worldwide workforce reduction of approximately 400 employees. The restructuring program affected employee groups across all levels and functions, including executive, regional and account management and administrative, creative and media production personnel. These charges were partially 23 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) offset by adjustments to managements estimates to reduce the prior restructuring reserves primarily as a result of decreases in the number of terminated employees, change in amounts paid to terminated employees and change in estimates of related restricted stock payments and payroll taxes. Long Lived Asset Impairment and Other Charges Long lived assets include land, buildings, equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets. Buildings, equipment and other intangible assets with finite lives are generally depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over their respective estimated useful lives. When necessary, we record an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the implied fair value. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for fair value determination and impairment testing methodologies. The following table summarizes long lived asset impairment and other charges: Years ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 IAN IAN CMG Total IAN CMG Motorsports Total Goodwill impairment $ 27.2 $ 97.0 $ $ 97.0 $ 220.2 $ 91.7 $ $ 311.9 Other 1.5 0.1 1.6 6.9 0.4 3.0 10.3 Total $ 27.2 $ 98.5 $ 0.1 $ 98.6 $ 227.1 $ 92.1 $ 3.0 $ 322.2 2006 IAN Our long term projections, which were updated in the fourth quarter of 2006, showed previously unanticipated declines in discounted future operating cash flows due primarily to recent client losses at one of our domestic advertising reporting units. These discounted future operating cash flow projections indicated that the implied fair value of goodwill at this reporting unit was less than its book value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of $27.2. 2005 IAN A triggering event occurred subsequent to our 2005 annual impairment test when a major client was lost by Lowes London agency and the possibility of losing other clients was considered a higher risk due to recent management defections and changes in the competitive landscape. This caused projected revenue growth to decline. As a result of these changes, our long term projections showed declines in discounted future operating cash flows. These revised cash flows indicated that the implied fair value of Lowes goodwill was less than the related book value resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of $91.0 at our Lowe reporting unit. IAN During the third quarter of 2005, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $5.8 at a reporting unit within our sports and entertainment marketing business. The long term projections showed previously unanticipated declines in discounted future operating cash flows and, as a result, these discounted future operating cash flows indicated that the implied fair value of goodwill was less than the related book value. 2004 IAN During the third quarter of 2004, we recorded goodwill impairment charges of $220.2 at The Partnership reporting unit, which was comprised of Lowe Worldwide, Draft Worldwide, Mullen, Dailey & Associates and Berenter Greenhouse & Webster (BGW). Our long term projections showed previously unanticipated declines in discounted future operating cash flows due to recent client losses, reduced client spending, and declining industry valuation metrics. These discounted future operating cash flow projections indicated that the implied fair value of goodwill was less than the related book value. The Partnership was subsequently disbanded in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the remaining goodwill was allocated to the agencies within the Partnership based on the relative fair value of its component agencies at the time of disbandment. 24 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) CMG As a result of the annual impairment review, a goodwill impairment charge of $91.7 was recorded at our CMG reporting unit, which was comprised of Weber Shandwick, GolinHarris, DeVries, MWW Group and FutureBrand. The fair value of CMG was adversely affected by declining industry market valuation metrics, specifically, a decrease in the EBITDA multiples used in the underlying valuation calculations. The impact of the lower EBITDA multiples indicated that the implied fair value of goodwill was less than the related book value. Motorsports Contract Termination Costs We recorded a pre tax charge of $113.6 during 2004 terminating a series of agreements with the British Racing Drivers Club and Formula One Administration Limited, which released us from certain guarantees and lease obligations in the United Kingdom. EXPENSE AND OTHER INCOME Years ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Interest expense $ (218.7 ) $ (181.9 ) $ (172.0 ) Interest income 113.3 80.0 50.8 Other (expense) income (5.6 ) 19.5 (51.4 ) Total $ (111.0 ) $ (82.4 ) $ (172.6 ) Interest Expense The increase in interest expense during 2006 was primarily due to increases in non cash amortization of approximately $27.0. This included the amortization of fees and deferred warrant costs incurred as a result of the ELF Financing transaction, prior year benefit from the amortization of gains on terminated swaps and the amortization of the remaining costs associated with our previous committed credit agreement. Additionally, the increase was due to one time fees associated with the exchange of our Floating Rate Notes in 2006. The 2006 year over year comparison benefited from the fact that we did not incur waiver and consent fees similar to those incurred in 2005 for the amendment of the indentures governing our debt securities and our credit facility. The increase in interest expense during 2005 was primarily due to waiver and consent fees incurred for the amendment of our existing debt agreements in 2005 and higher average interest rates on newly issued debt when compared to extinguished debt. Interest Income The increase in interest income during 2006 was primarily due to an increase in interest rates and higher average cash balances compared to the prior year. The increase in interest income during 2005 was primarily due to an increase in average interest rates as well an increase in cash and cash equivalents primarily resulting from our Series B Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock offering. 25 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Other Income (Expense) Years ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Loss on early extinguishment of debt $ (80.8 ) $ $ Gains (losses) on sales of businesses 8.1 10.1 (18.2 ) Vendor discount and credit adjustments 28.2 2.6 Gains on sales of available for sale securities and miscellaneous investment income 36.1 16.3 5.4 Investment impairments (0.3 ) (12.2 ) (63.4 ) Litigation reversals 32.5 Other income (expense) 3.1 2.7 (7.7 ) Total $ (5.6 ) $ 19.5 $ (51.4 ) Loss on early extinguishment of debt In November 2006, we exchanged $400.0 of our 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the 4.50% Notes) for $400.0 aggregate principal amount of 4.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the 4.25% Notes). In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 96 19, Debtors Accounting for a Modification or Exchange of Debt Instruments, this exchange is treated as an extinguishment of the 4.50% Notes and an issuance of 4.25% Notes for accounting purposes because the present value of the remaining cash flows plus the fair value of the embedded conversion option under the terms of the original instrument differ substantially from the new instrument. As a result, we recorded a non cash charge at issuance of $77.0, reflecting the difference between the fair value of the new debt and the carrying value of the old debt. The difference between fair value and carrying value will be amortized to interest expense through March 15, 2012, which is the first date holders may require us to repurchase the 4.25% Notes. This results in a reduction of reported interest expense of $14.4 per year in future annual periods. We also recorded a non cash charge of $3.8 for the extinguishment of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the exchanged 4.50% Notes. Gains (losses) on sales of businesses In connection with the 2005 sale of a European FCB agency, we released $11.1 into income in the fourth quarter of 2006. This primarily related to certain contingent liabilities that we retained subsequent to the sale, which were resolved in the fourth quarter of 2006. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we had net gains related to the sale of a McCann agency of $18.6, offset partially by a loss of $13.0 from the sale of a European FCB agency. In 2004, we had net losses related to the sale of 19 agencies. The losses related primarily to the sale of a U.S. based promotions agency, which resulted in a loss of $8.6, and a $6.2 loss for the final liquidation of the Motorsports investment. We have evaluated each asset held for sale and disposed entity on an individual and an aggregate basis to determine if they should be classified as a component of discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements. We believe that the impact of these dispositions and assets held for sale are not material to our consolidated financial statements. These dispositions and assets held for sale, in the aggregate, provided income to continuing operations of $2.5 for the year ended December 31, 2006. Vendor discount and credit adjustments These adjustments reflect the reversal of certain liabilities, primarily established during the 2005 Restatement, where the statute of limitations has lapsed or where negotiations with clients have resulted in concessions. We may have similar reversals in the future, although to a lesser extent than in 2006. We believe that presenting amounts realized due to lapses in the statute of limitations or concession settlements as other income or expense prevents the trend of operating results from being distorted. For further information on vendor discounts and credits see Notes 1 and 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Gains on sales of available for sale securities and miscellaneous investment income In the second quarter of 2006, we had net gains of $20.9 related to the sale of an investment located in Asia Pacific and the sale of our remaining ownership interest in an agency within The Lowe Group. In addition, during the third quarter of 2006, we sold our interest in a German advertising agency and recognized the related remaining cumulative translation adjustment balance, which resulted in a non cash benefit of $17.0. In 2005, we had net gains of $8.3 related to the 26 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) sale of our remaining equity ownership interest in an agency within FCB, and net gains on sales of available for sale securities of $7.9, of which $3.8 related to appreciation of Rabbi Trust investments restricted for the purpose of paying our deferred compensation and deferred benefit arrangement liabilities. Investment Impairments We recorded charges of $12.2 during 2005, primarily related to a $7.1 adjustment of the carrying amount of our remaining unconsolidated investment in Latin America to fair value as a result of our intent to sell and $3.7 related to a decline in value of certain available for sale investments that were determined to be other than temporary. We recorded investment impairment charges of $63.4 during 2004, primarily related to a $50.9 charge for an unconsolidated investment in a German advertising agency as a result of a decrease in projected operating results. Additionally, we recorded impairment charges of $4.7 related to unconsolidated affiliates primarily in Israel, Brazil, Japan and India, and $7.8 related to several other available for sale investments. Litigation Reversals During 2004 the settlement of thirteen class actions under the federal securities laws became final and we agreed to pay $115.0, comprised of $20.0 in cash and $95.0 in shares of our common stock valued at $14.50 per share. We received insurance proceeds of $20.0, which we recorded as a reduction in litigation charges. We also recorded a reduction of $12.5 relating to a decrease in the share price between the tentative settlement date and the final settlement date. INCOME TAXES Years ended December 31, Change 2006 2005 2004 06 vs. 05 05 vs. 04 Loss from continuing operations before provision for income taxes $ (5.0 ) $ (186.6 ) $ (267.0 ) (97.3 )% (30.1 )% Provision for income taxes continuing operations $ 18.7 $ 81.9 $ 262.2 (77.2 )% (68.8 )% (Benefit) provision for income taxes discontinued operations (5.0 ) (9.0 ) 3.5 (44.4 )% Total provision for income taxes $ 13.7 $ 72.9 $ 265.7 (81.2 )% (72.6 )% The tax provision for 2006 was primarily impacted by domestic losses, foreign profits subject to tax at different rates and losses in certain foreign locations where we receive no tax benefit due to 100% valuation allowances. Other factors included state and local taxes, the write off of deferred tax assets from restricted stock, the release of valuation allowances, non deductible financing costs and the reversal of previously claimed foreign tax credits. The tax provision for 2005 was primarily impacted by an increase in valuation allowances, a non deductible asset impairment, state and local taxes and the resolution of various income tax audits and issues. Valuation Allowance Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, we are required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets. SFAS No. 109 requires that a valuation allowance be recognized when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. In circumstances where there is significant negative evidence, establishment of valuation allowance must be considered. We believe that cumulative losses in the most recent three year period represent significant negative evidence under the provisions of SFAS No. 109 and, as a result, we recognized a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets. The deferred tax assets for which an allowance was recognized relate primarily to tax credit carryforwards, foreign tax loss and U.S. capital loss carryforwards, which may not be realized in the future. During 2006 and 2005, valuation allowances of $63.6 and $69.9, respectively, were recorded in continuing operations on existing deferred tax assets, each years loss and temporary differences. The total valuation allowance as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $504.0 and $501.0, respectively. 27 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) During 2004, a valuation allowance of $236.0 was established in continuing operations on existing deferred tax assets and 2004 losses with no benefit. The total valuation allowance as of December 31, 2004 was $488.6. For additional information, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Segment Results of Operations As discussed in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have two reportable segments as of December 31, 2006: IAN and CMG. We also report results for the Corporate and other group. As of December 31, 2005, we had an additional segment, Motorsports operations (Motorsports), which was sold during 2004 and had immaterial residual operating results in 2005. On June 1, 2006, we announced we would merge two units included in our IAN segment, Draft Worldwide (Draft) and Foote, Cone & Belding Worldwide (FCB), to create a global integrated marketing organization. The new merged entity, Draftfcb, remains within the IAN segment. INTEGRATED AGENCY NETWORKS (IAN) REVENUE 2006 Compared to 2005 Components of change during 2006 Change Net Net Foreign acquisitions/ Foreign acquisitions/ 2005 currency (divestitures) Organic 2006 currency (divestitures) Organic Total Total $ 5,327.8 19.7 (151.9 ) 35.0 $ 5,230.6 0.4 % (2.9 )% 0.7 % (1.8 )% Domestic 2,904.6 (37.8 ) (26.8 ) 2,840.0 (1.3 )% (0.9 )% (2.2 )% International 2,423.2 19.7 (114.1 ) 61.8 2,390.6 0.8 % (4.7 )% 2.6 % (1.3 )% The revenue decline in 2006 was a result of net divestitures, primarily from the sale of several businesses at Draftfcb and McCann in 2005, partially offset by an organic increase and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The organic increase was driven primarily by McCann and Draftfcb, partially offset by decreases at Lowe and The Works, one of our independent agencies. The organic increase at McCann was the result of higher revenue from existing clients across domestic and international regions, primarily Asia Pacific and Latin America. McCanns increase was primarily driven by digital, direct and event marketing services. The increase at Draftfcb was primarily the result of increased spending from existing clients partially offset by net client losses, primarily in 2005, across domestic and most international regions, primarily Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America. The decrease at Lowe was primarily due to reduced spending by existing clients and net client losses, primarily in domestic locations in 2005. The revenue decrease at The Works, a dedicated General Motors resource, was primarily due to the loss of the General Motors U.S. media buying business in 2005. 2005 Compared to 2004 Components of change during 2005 Change Net Net Foreign acquisitions/ Foreign acquisitions/ 2004 currency (divestitures) Organic 2005 currency (divestitures) Organic Total Total $ 5,399.2 39.5 (46.0 ) (64.9 ) $ 5,327.8 0.7 % (0.9 )% (1.2 )% (1.3 )% Domestic 2,933.3 (23.1 ) (5.6 ) 2,904.6 (0.8 )% (0.2 )% (1.0 )% International 2,465.9 39.5 (22.9 ) (59.3 ) 2,423.2 1.6 % (0.9 )% (2.4 )% (1.7 )% The revenue decline in 2005 primarily resulted from organic revenue decreases and net divestitures, partially offset by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The organic revenue decrease was primarily driven by declines at Deutsch and Lowe, partially offset by increases at Draftfcb and Mullen. The decline at Deutsch was due to client losses and reduced spending from existing clients domestically, partially offset by client wins. The decline 28 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) at Lowe was primarily driven by client losses and reduced spending from existing clients in their European offices, as well as reduced spending domestically. Draftfcb experienced growth mainly domestically due to client wins and increased spending from existing clients. Although McCann is a significant part of the business, they did not contribute considerably to the organic change in revenue year over year. The decrease due to net divestitures primarily related to the sale of small businesses at McCann and Draftfcb. SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME Years ended December 31, Change 2006 2005 2004 06 vs. 05 05 vs. 04 Segment operating income $ 391.4 $ 249.7 $ 577.1 56.7 % (56.7 )% Operating margin 7.5 % 4.7 % 10.7 % 2006 Compared to 2005 Operating income increased during 2006 due to a decrease in office and general expenses of $139.7, a decrease in salaries and related expenses of $99.2, partially offset by a decrease in revenue of $97.2. The primary drivers for our reduced office and general expenses related to lower production expenses of $46.4, reduced professional fees of $26.3 and lower bad debt expense of $22.2. The primary drivers for our reduced salaries and related expenses related to lower severance expense of $63.1 and decreased salaries of $42.0. The organic segment operating income increase was driven primarily by increases at McCann, partially offset by net decreases at our independent agencies. The increase at McCann was due to higher revenue as discussed above in the revenue section and reduced office and general expenses and salaries and related expenses. Office and general expenses decreased due to lower production expenses, reduced professional fees in connection with accounting projects, such as those related to our restatement activities, and lower bad debt expenses. Salaries and related expenses decreased primarily due to reduced severance expense for headcount reductions that occurred in international locations in 2005 and reduced pension costs, partially offset by higher incentive and bonus awards due to improved performance. The net decline at our independent agencies was driven by decreased revenue, primarily at The Works, for the reasons mentioned above in the revenue section. 2005 Compared to 2004 A decrease in revenues of $71.4, an increase in salaries and related expenses of $202.3 and an increase in office and general expenses of $53.7 were the primary drivers that contributed to the decrease in operating income during 2005. IANs organic operating income decrease was primarily driven by McCann, Draftfcb, Lowe and Deutsch. The decrease at McCann was primarily caused by increased severance, temporary staffing costs, salary and related benefits and professional fees. Higher severance expense was the result of international headcount reductions. Temporary staffing and salary and related benefits were impacted by additional staffing necessary to address weaknesses in our accounting and control environment. Professional fees increased as a result of costs associated with the 2005 Restatement process and internal control compliance. The decrease at Draftfcb was due to higher salaries and freelance costs as additional staff were hired to service new clients and additional business from existing clients as well as increased severance costs reflecting headcount reductions at our international agencies. At Lowe, the decrease was primarily due to organic revenue decreases as compared to the prior year. Deutsch experienced organic revenue decreases as compared to the prior year, partially offset by lower salaries, related benefits and freelance costs due to client losses and reduced incentive compensation expense as a result of a reduction in operating performance. Also, operating income of most units was negatively impacted by higher professional fees to support the 2005 Restatement process and internal control compliance. 29 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC.

Additionally, there were organic revenue increases domestically in the sports marketing and events marketing businesses due to higher revenue from existing clients and client wins. The domestic increase was partially offset by declines at some CMG agencies that lost clients. Internationally, the decline related primarily to a decrease in the events marketing and sports marketing businesses caused by client losses. The international decrease was partially offset by increases in the public relations and branding businesses due to higher revenue from existing clients. 2005 Compared to 2004 Components of change during 2005 Change Net Net Foreign acquisitions/ Foreign acquisitions/ 2004 currency (divestitures) Organic 2005 currency (divestitures) Organic Total Total $ 935.8 1.2 (12.1 ) 19.3 $ 944.2 0.1 % (1.3 )% 2.1 % 0.9 % Domestic 576.0 (5.9 ) (13.6 ) 556.5 (1.0 )% (2.4 )% (3.4 )% International 359.8 1.2 (6.2 ) 32.9 387.7 0.3 % (1.7 )% 9.1 % 7.8 % Revenue growth was a result of an organic revenue increase in the public relations businesses internationally and the sports marketing businesses domestically as a result of increased spending from existing clients and client wins. Domestically, the increase in the sports marketing businesses was offset by a decline in the events marketing businesses. Although revenue from the events marketing businesses declined domestically, they had an overall positive impact on our organic revenue increase due to international client wins. Partially offsetting this increase were the dispositions of two businesses in 2005 and three businesses in 2004. SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME Years ended December 31, Change 2006 2005 2004 06 vs. 05 05 vs. 04 Segment operating income $ 51.6 $ 53.0 $ 83.7 (2.6 )% (36.7 )% Operating margin 5.4 % 5.6 % 8.9 % 2006 Compared to 2005 Operating income decreased slightly, primarily as a result of an increase in salaries and related expenses of $32.0, partially offset by a decrease in office and general expenses of $14.6 and an increase in revenue of $16.0. The primary driver for our increase in salaries and related expenses was higher base salaries expense of $22.3 and the primary driver for our decrease in office and general expenses was lower production expenses of $19.8. The slight organic segment operating income decrease was due to decreases in the sports marketing businesses and other CMG agencies, offset by growth at the public relations and branding businesses. The decline in the sports marketing 30 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) businesses was due to revenue decreases due to client losses and increases in salaries and related expenses due to higher bonus awards related to improved domestic performance. The decrease in other CMG agencies was due to decreased revenue for the reasons described in the revenue section. Growth at the public relations businesses was driven by increased revenue, partially offset by higher salaries and related expenses from increased headcount to support the growth in the business. The increase at the branding businesses was driven primarily by higher revenue from existing clients. 2005 Compared to 2004 Operating income decreased due to an increase of $23.3 in salary and related expenses and an increase in office and general expenses of $15.8, partially offset by an increase in revenue of $8.4. The organic operating income decrease was primarily driven by increases in salary expense across all businesses due to increased headcount to address weaknesses in our accounting and control environment. The decrease was also attributable to increases in salary expenses in the public relations businesses to support revenue growth. CORPORATE AND OTHER Certain corporate and other charges are reported as a separate line within total segment operating income (loss) and include corporate office expenses and shared services center expenses, as well as certain other centrally managed expenses that are not fully allocated to operating divisions, as shown in the table below. The amounts allocated to operating divisions are calculated monthly based on a formula that uses the revenues of the operating unit. Amounts allocated also include specific charges for information technology related projects, which are allocated based on utilization. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of corporate and other charges. The following expenses are included in corporate and other: Years ended December 31, Change 2006 2005 2004 06 vs. 05 05 vs. 04 Salaries and related expenses $ 214.1 $ 201.3 $ 151.2 6.4 % 33.1 % Professional fees 139.7 199.3 145.3 (29.9 )% 37.2 % Rent, depreciation and amortization 65.4 45.3 38.4 44.4 % 18.0 % Corporate insurance 21.7 26.0 29.7 (16.5 )% (12.5 )% Other 25.3 15.2 16.8 66.4 % (9.5 )% Expenses allocated to operating divisions (190.9 ) (170.8 ) (138.2 ) 11.8 % 23.6 % Total $ 275.3 $ 316.3 $ 243.2 (13.0 )% 30.1 % 2006 Compared to 2005 Corporate and other expenses decreased primarily due to reduced professional fees and higher amounts allocated to operating divisions, partially offset by higher rent, depreciation and amortization and increased salaries and related expenses. We incurred lower professional fees for accounting projects, which included those related to our prior year restatement activities. Higher rent, depreciation and amortization were due to software related costs from our ongoing initiatives to consolidate and upgrade our financial systems, as well as to further develop our shared services. Salaries and related expenses increased due to higher headcount, primarily related to our technology initiatives, and for larger incentive compensation and bonus awards related to performance. Amounts allocated to operating divisions increased primarily due to the implementation of new information technology related projects, the consolidation of information technology support staff, and the allocation of audit fees, which are now being allocated back to operating divisions. 2005 Compared to 2004 Corporate and other expenses increased primarily due to higher salaries and related expenses and professional fees. Salary expenses increased from additional staffing to address weaknesses in our accounting and control 31 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) environment and to develop shared services. Professional fees increased due to costs associated with internal control compliance, costs associated with the 2005 Restatement process, and related audit costs. Amounts allocated to operating divisions increased primarily due to the implementation of new information technology related projects and the consolidation of information technology support staff, the costs of which were not being allocated back to operating divisions in 2004. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH FLOW OVERVIEW Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased by $234.4 to $1,957.1 during 2006 primarily due to fees associated with capital market activity, capital expenditures and working capital usage, partially offset by improved operating results and proceeds from sales of investments. Of this change, marketable securities decreased by $114.2. A summary of our cash flow activities is as follows: Years ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 9.0 $ (20.2) $ 464.8 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 11.6 166.4 (544.6 ) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (129.7 ) 410.1 (259.5 ) Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to improved operating results during 2006, partially offset by working capital usage of $250.6. Working capital usages reflects changes in accounts receivable, expenditures billable to clients, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Media buying on behalf of our clients affects our working capital and operating cash flow. In most of our businesses, we collect funds from our clients which we use, on their behalf, to pay production costs and media costs. The amounts involved substantially exceed our revenues, and primarily impact the level of accounts receivable, expenditures billable to clients, accounts payable and accrued media and production liabilities in any given period for these pass through arrangements. Our assets include both cash received and accounts receivable from clients for these pass through arrangements, while our liabilities include amounts owed on behalf of clients to media and production suppliers. Generally, we pay production and media charges after we have received funds from our clients, and our risk from client nonpayment has historically not been significant. During 2006, a reduction in accounts payable of $370.0 was partially offset by a reduction in accounts receivable of $235.4. The change in accounts payable includes a reduction of our vendor discount and credit liabilities established as part of the 2005 Restatement of $73.6, of which $53.1 was satisfied through cash payments. Cash used by changes in accrued liabilities of $21.4 was primarily the result of higher accrued media liabilities, offset by payments for professional fees primarily related to our prior year restatement activities. Accrued liabilities are also affected by the timing of certain payments. For example, while employee incentive awards are accrued throughout the year, they are generally paid during the first quarter of the subsequent year. The net loss of $31.7 during 2006 includes non cash items that are not expected to generate cash or require the use of cash. Net non cash expense items of $294.4 primarily include the loss on early extinguishment of debt, long lived asset impairment and other charges, add back of depreciation of fixed assets and the amortization of intangible assets, restricted stock awards and non cash compensation, bond discounts and deferred financing costs. Investing Activities Cash provided by investing activities during 2006 primarily reflects net maturities of short term marketable securities, capital expenditures, acquisitions and divestitures and purchases and sales of investments. The cash flows attributable to short term marketable securities vary from one period to another because of changes in the 32 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) maturity profile of our treasury investments. The net amount of these securities was $193.8 lower as of December 31, 2006 compared to December 31, 2005. Cash provided by investing activities was also impacted by capital expenditures of $127.8, primarily related to computer hardware and leasehold improvements. Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities during 2006 reflects fees and costs of $90.1 that we incurred in connection with our financing transactions. This includes fees of $41.8 and call spread costs of $29.2 for our new credit agreement and related transactions in the second quarter. We incurred fees of $19.1 in the fourth quarter when we exchanged $400.0 of our 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 for the same aggregate principal amount of our 4.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 and when we exchanged all of our $250.0 Floating Rate Notes due 2008 for the same aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Notes due 2010. These costs are being amortized in interest expense. In addition, $3.5 of fees, incurred as part of the Floating Rate Note exchange, were recorded in interest expense and will not be amortized. Cash used in financing activities also included dividend payments of $47.0 on our Series A and Series B Preferred Stock. LIQUIDITY OUTLOOK We expect our operating cash flow, cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating requirements at a minimum for the next twelve months. We believe that a conservative approach to liquidity is appropriate for our Company, in view of the cash requirements resulting from, among other things, high professional fees, liabilities to our clients for vendor discounts and credits, any potential penalties or fines that may have to be paid in connection with the ongoing SEC investigation, the normal cash variability inherent in our operations and other unanticipated requirements. In addition, until our margins consistently improve in connection with our turnaround, cash generation from operations could be challenged in certain periods. A reduction in our liquidity in future periods as a result of the above items or other business objectives could lead us to seek new or additional sources of liquidity to fund our working capital needs. From time to time we evaluate market conditions and financing alternatives for opportunities to raise additional financing or otherwise improve our liquidity profile and enhance our financial flexibility. There can be no guarantee that we would be able to access new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Funding Requirements Our most significant funding requirements include: our operations, non cancelable operating lease obligations, capital expenditures, payments related to vendor discounts and credits, debt service, preferred stock dividends, contributions to pension and postretirement plans, acquisitions and dispositions and taxes. Our non cancelable lease commitments primarily relate to office premises and equipment. These commitments are partially offset by sublease rental income we receive under non cancelable subleases. Capital expenditures are primarily to upgrade computer and telecommunications systems and to modernize offices. Of the liabilities recognized as part of the 2005 Restatement, we estimate that we will pay approximately $100.0 related to vendor discounts and credits, internal investigations and international compensation arrangements over the next 12 months. We have no significant scheduled amounts of long term debt due until March 2008, when holders of our $400.0 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes may require us to repurchase the Notes for cash at par. 33 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) We pay annual dividends on each share of Series B Preferred Stock in the amount of $52.50 per share, or $27.6. Dividends on each share of Series B Preferred Stock are payable quarterly in cash or, if certain conditions are met, in common stock, at our option. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. We have not paid any dividends on our common stock since December of 2002. The terms of our Series B Preferred Stock do not permit us to pay dividends on our common stock unless all accumulated and unpaid dividends on our Series B Preferred Stock have been, or contemporaneously are, declared and paid, or provision for the payment thereof has been made. We make contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans throughout the year, as determined using actuarial methods and assumptions. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, we made contributions of $42.7 and $34.1, respectively, to our domestic and foreign pension plans. For 2007, we do not anticipate making additional contributions to our domestic pension plans. We expect to contribute an additional $20.6 to our foreign pension plans. Our capital requirements are affected by purchases and sales of agencies. From time to time we contemplate acquisitions that may require payment in cash or stock. In past years, deferred payments related to past acquisitions were a significant funding requirement for us, although these payments have decreased significantly in recent years as we have made fewer acquisitions. Under the contractual terms of certain of our past acquisitions we have long term obligations to pay additional consideration or to purchase additional equity interests in certain consolidated or unconsolidated subsidiaries if specified conditions, mostly relating to operating performance, are met. Some of the consideration under these arrangements is in shares of our common stock, but most is in cash. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we made cash payments related to past acquisitions of $22.9, $97.0 and $161.7, respectively. In relation to our contingent acquisition obligations, $7.8, $5.3 and $20.1 were recorded as compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We have various tax years under examination in various countries in which we have significant business operations. We do not know whether these examinations will, in the aggregate, result in our paying additional income taxes, which we believe are adequately reserved for. FINANCING AND SOURCES OF FUNDS Substantially all of our operating cash flow is generated by our agencies. Our liquid assets are held primarily at the holding company level, and to a lesser extent at our largest subsidiaries. In recent years, we have obtained long term financing in the capital markets by issuing debt securities, convertible debt securities and convertible preferred stock. We have also used bank borrowing facilities to provide us with liquidity for working capital needs. Our outstanding long term debt, including convertible debt, is detailed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and our convertible preferred stock is detailed in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We also have two series of equity warrants outstanding. We have entered into call spread transactions in connection with one of the series of equity warrants. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2006, we engaged in several transactions to improve our liquidity and debt maturity profile: In June 2006, we replaced our existing $500.0 Three Year Revolving Credit Facility, which would have expired in May 2007, with a new $750.0 Three Year Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement) as part of a capital markets transaction that we refer to as the ELF Financing. In November 2006, we exchanged $400.0 of our 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 for the same aggregate principal amount of our 4.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023. This transaction extended the first date on which holders can require us to repurchase this portion of our debt for cash from 2008 to 2012. It also extended the second date on which holders can require us to repurchase this portion of our debt for cash, stock or a combination at our option from 2013 to 2015. 34 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) In December 2006, we exchanged all of our $250.0 Floating Rate Notes due 2008 for the same aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Notes due 2010. The new Floating Rate Notes bear interest at a per annum rate equal to three month LIBOR plus 200 basis points, 125 basis points less than the interest rate on the old Floating Rate Notes. Also in December 2006, each share of our Series A Preferred Stock converted into 3.7037 shares of our common stock. We issued a total of 27.7 shares of common stock to holders of the Series A Preferred Stock. As a result of this conversion, future preferred stock dividend requirements will be lower. ELF Financing Under the Credit Agreement, a special purpose entity called ELF Special Financing Ltd. (ELF) acts as the lender and letter of credit issuer. ELF is obligated at our request to make cash advances to us and to issue letters of credit for our account, in an aggregate amount not to exceed $750.0 outstanding at any time. The aggregate face amount of letters of credit may not exceed $600.0 at any time. The Credit Agreement is a revolving facility, under which amounts borrowed may be repaid and borrowed again, and the aggregate available amount of letters of credit may decrease or increase, subject to the overall limit of $750.0 and the $600.0 limit on letters of credit. We have not drawn on the Credit Agreement or our previous committed credit agreements since late 2003. We are not subject to any financial or other material restrictive covenants under the Credit Agreement. For additional information, see Notes 10 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Credit Facilities In addition to the Credit Agreement, we have uncommitted credit facilities with various banks that permit borrowings at variable interest rates. We use our uncommitted credit lines for working capital needs at some of our operations outside the United States. There were borrowings under the uncommitted facilities made by several of our subsidiaries outside the United States totaling $80.3 and $53.7 as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We have guaranteed the repayment of some of these borrowings by our subsidiaries. If we lose access to these credit lines, we would have to provide funding directly to some overseas operations. The weighted average interest rate on outstanding balances under the uncommitted short term facilities as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 was approximately 5% in each year. Letters of Credit We are required from time to time to post letters of credit, primarily to support our commitments, or those of our subsidiaries, to purchase media placements, mostly in locations outside the United States, or to satisfy other obligations. These letters of credit are generally backed by letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement. The aggregate amount of outstanding letters of credit issued for our account under the Credit Agreement and our previous committed credit agreement was $219.9 and $162.4 as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. These letters of credit have historically not been drawn upon. Cash Pooling We aggregate our net domestic cash position on a daily basis. Outside the United States, we use cash pooling arrangements with banks to help manage our liquidity requirements. In these pooling arrangements, several Interpublic agencies agree with a single bank that the cash balances of any of the agencies with the bank will be subject to a full right of setoff against amounts the other agencies owe the bank, and the bank provides overdrafts as long as the net balance for all the agencies does not exceed an agreed upon level. Typically each agency pays interest on outstanding overdrafts and receives interest on cash balances. Our Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect cash net of overdrafts for each pooling arrangement. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005 a gross amount of $1,052.5 and $842.6, respectively, in cash was netted against an equal gross amount of overdrafts under pooling arrangements. 35 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) CREDIT AGENCY RATINGS Our long term debt credit ratings as of February 16, 2007 were Ba3 with negative outlook, B CreditWatch negative and B with negative outlook, as reported by Moodys Investors Service, Standard & Poors and Fitch Ratings, respectively. A downgrade in our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to access capital and could result in more stringent covenants and higher interest rates under the terms of any new indebtedness. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following summarizes our estimated contractual obligations at December 31, 2006, and their effect on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods: 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total Long term debt 1 $ 2.6 $ 2.8 $ 257.0 $ 240.9 $ 500.0 $ 1,247.9 $ 2,251.2 Interest payments 122.0 116.1 107.1 93.6 75.1 74.1 588.0 Non cancelable operating lease obligations 292.3 265.2 237.4 207.9 181.9 861.2 2,045.9 Contingent acquisition payments 2 47.2 34.2 20.8 2.5 2.0 3.1 109.8 1 Holders of our $400.0 4.50% Notes may require us to repurchase their Notes for cash at par in March 2008. These Notes will mature in 2023 if not converted or repurchased. 2 We have structured certain acquisitions with additional contingent purchase price obligations in order to reduce the potential risk associated with negative future performance of the acquired entity. All payments are contingent upon achieving projected operating performance targets and satisfying other conditions specified in the related agreements and are subject to revisions as the earn out periods progress. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. We have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans in the contractual obligations table. Our funding policy regarding our funded pension plan is to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements plus such additional amounts from time to time as are determined to be appropriate to improve the plans funded status. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets, level of market interest rates and levels of voluntary contributions to the plans. Declines in long term interest rates have had a negative impact on the funded status of the plans. For 2007, we do not expect to contribute to our domestic pension plans, and expect to contribute $20.6 to our foreign pension plans. We have not included our deferred tax obligations in the contractual obligations table as the timing of any future payments in relation to these obligations is uncertain. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES We periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements and forward contracts to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations and to mitigate foreign exchange volatility. In May of 2005, we terminated all of our long term interest rate swap agreements covering the $350.0 6.25% Senior Unsecured Notes and $150.0 of the $500.0 7.25% Senior Unsecured Notes. In connection with the interest rate swap termination, our net cash receipts were $1.1, which is recorded as an offset to interest expense over the remaining life of the related debt. We have entered into foreign currency transactions in which various foreign currencies are bought or sold forward. These contracts were entered into to meet currency requirements arising from specific transactions. The changes in value of these forward contracts have been recorded in other income or expense. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had contracts covering $0.2 and $6.2, respectively, of notional amount of currency and the fair value of the forward contracts was negligible. The terms of the 4.50% Notes include two embedded derivative instruments and the terms of our 4.25% Notes and our Series B Preferred Stock each include one embedded derivative instrument. The fair value of these derivatives on December 31, 2006 was negligible. 36 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) OUT OF PERIOD AMOUNTS Year Ended December 31, 2006 During 2006, we recorded adjustments to certain vendor discounts and credits, contractual liabilities, foreign exchange, tax and other miscellaneous items which related to prior periods. For the year ended December 31, 2006, these adjustments resulted in a net favorable impact to revenue of $9.1, a net favorable impact to salaries and related expenses of $5.1, a net unfavorable impact to office and general expenses of $6.6 and a net favorable impact to net loss of $6.9. The operating income impact of these adjustments primarily affected our IAN segment. Because these changes are not material to our financial statements for the periods prior to 2006, for the quarters of 2006 or for 2006 as a whole, we recorded these out of period amounts in their respective quarters of 2006. See also Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Three Months Ended December 31, 2005 In the fourth quarter of 2005, we recorded adjustments to certain vendor discounts and credits, tax, and other miscellaneous items which related to prior periods. Because these adjustments were not material to our financial statements for the periods prior to 2005 or for 2005 as a whole, we have recorded them in the fourth quarter of 2005. The following table details the impact these out of period amounts have on the results for the three months ended December 31, 2005 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2004 on a consolidated and segment basis. Favorable/ For the three months ended December 31, (unfavorable) (as reported) out of period 2005 2004 $ change % change amounts Consolidated results of operations Revenue $ 1,895.7 $ 1,965.7 $ (70.0 ) (3.6 )% $ (17.3 ) Salaries and related expenses 1,107.5 1,021.9 85.6 8.4 % (3.2 ) Office and general expenses 637.1 630.3 6.8 1.1 % (6.1 ) Segment results of operations IAN Revenue $ 1,614.8 $ 1,700.0 $ (85.2 ) (5.0 )% $ (17.8 ) Operating income 221.2 359.2 (138.0 ) (38.4 )% (22.1 ) CMG Revenue $ 280.6 $ 261.0 $ 19.6 7.5 % $ 0.5 Operating income 30.7 29.7 1.0 3.4 % (3.5 ) INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING We have identified numerous material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, as set forth in greater detail in Item 8, Managements Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting and Item 9A, Controls and Procedures, in this report. Each of our material weaknesses results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. As a result, we have determined that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2006. We are in the process of implementing remedial measures to address the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. We continue to have extensive work remaining to remediate our remaining material weaknesses. The magnitude of the work is attributable partly to our decentralized structure and the number of disparate accounting systems of varying quality and sophistication. We have developed a work plan with the goal of remediating all of the identified material weaknesses by the time we file our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ending December 31, 2007. There can be no assurance, however, as to when the remediation plan will be fully implemented and all the material weaknesses remediated. There also can be no assurance that new problems will not 37 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) be found in the future. Until our remediation is completed, we will continue to incur the expenses and management burdens associated with the manual procedures and additional resources required to prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements. OTHER MATTERS SEC Investigation The SEC opened a formal investigation in response to the restatement we first announced in August 2002 and the investigation expanded to encompass the 2005 Restatement set forth in our 2004 Annual Report on Form 10 K filed in September 2005. In particular, since we filed our 2004 Annual Report on Form 10 K, we have received subpoenas from the SEC relating to matters addressed in our 2005 Restatement. We have also responded to inquiries from the SEC staff concerning the restatement of the first three quarters of 2005 that we made in our 2005 Annual Report on Form 10 K. We continue to cooperate with the investigation. We expect that the investigation will result in monetary liability, but because the investigation is ongoing, in particular with respect to the 2005 Restatement, we cannot reasonably estimate the amount, range of amounts or timing of a resolution. Accordingly, we have not yet established any provision relating to these matters. Review of Stock Option Practices During the third quarter of 2006, at our recommendation, our Audit Committee retained independent counsel to review our stock option practices related to our current and prior senior officers for a 10 year period beginning in 1996. We also performed a comprehensive accounting review that supplemented the review done by independent counsel. These reviews were completed during the fourth quarter of 2006. Based on these reviews, in the third quarter of 2006 we recorded a charge of $26.4 to accumulated deficit, a $23.3 credit to additional paid in capital and a $3.1 credit to other non current liabilities. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete description of recent accounting pronouncements that have affected us or may affect us. 38 Table of Contents THE INTERPUBLIC GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks related to interest rates and foreign currency rates. From time to time, we use derivatives, pursuant to established guidelines and policies, to manage some portion of these risks. Derivative instruments utilized in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools, involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. Interest Rates Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, 85.1% and 86.0% of our debt obligations bore interest at fixed interest rates. Accordingly, assuming the fixed rate debt is not refinanced, there would be no impact on interest expense or cash flow from either a 10% increase or decrease in market rates of interest. However, there would be an impact on the fair market value of the debt, as the fair market value of debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates. For 2006, the fair market value of the debt obligations would decrease by $28.8 if market rates were to increase by 10% and would increase by $29.5 if market rates were to decrease by 10%. For 2005, the fair market value of the debt obligations would have decreased by $27.7 if market rates increased by 10% and would have increased by $28.0 if market rates decreased by 10%. For that portion of the debt that bore interest at variable rates, based on outstanding amounts and rates at December 31, 2006, interest expense and cash out flow would increase or decrease by $2.3 if market rates were to increase or decrease by 10%, respectively. For that portion of the debt that bore interest at variable rates, based on outstanding amounts and rates at December 31, 2005, interest expense and cash out flow would have increased or decreased by $2.1 if market rates increased or decreased by 10%, respectively. Interest rate swaps have been used to manage the mix of our fixed and floating rate debt obligations. In May 2005, we terminated all our existing long term interest rate swap agreements, and currently have none outstanding. Foreign Currencies We face translation and transaction risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Amounts invested in our foreign operations are translated into U.S. Dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the stockholders equity section of our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, mitigating transaction risk. Since the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally the local currency, foreign currency translation of the balance sheet is reflected as a component of stockholders equity and does not impact operating results. Since we report revenues and expenses in U.S. Dollars changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses (as expressed in U.S. Dollars) from foreign operations. Currency transaction gains or losses arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in results of operations and were not significant in the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. We have not entered into a material amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 39 Table of Contents
