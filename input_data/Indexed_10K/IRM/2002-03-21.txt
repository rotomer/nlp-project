Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with "Item 6. Selected Consolidated Financial and Operating Information" and the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto and the other financial and operating information included elsewhere in this filing. This discussion contains "forward looking statements" as that term is defined in the federal securities laws. These forward looking statements concern our operations, economic performance and financial condition. The forward looking statements are subject to various known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors. When we use words such as "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "estimates" or similar expressions, we are making forward looking statements. Although we believe that our forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, our expected results may not be achieved, and actual results may differ materially from our expectations. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations include, among others: the cost and availability of appropriate storage facilities; our significant indebtedness and the cost and availability of financing for contemplated growth; changes in customer preferences and demand for our services; rapid and significant changes in technology; uncertainties related to international expansion; difficulties related to the integration of acquisitions; uncertainties related to expansion into digital businesses, including the timing of introduction and market acceptance of our products and services; effects of future changes in regulatory standards and requirements; and other general economic and business conditions. Critical Accounting Policies The following "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations", as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this filing, are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the 16 financial statements and for the period then ended. On an on going basis, we evaluate the estimates used, including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts, impairments of tangible and intangible assets, income taxes, purchase accounting related reserves, self insurance liabilities, incentive compensation liabilities, litigation liabilities and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience, actuarial estimates, current conditions and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and are not readily apparent from other sources. We use these estimates to assist us in the identification and assessment of the accounting treatment necessary with respect to commitments and contingencies. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies involve more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Accounting for Acquisitions Part of our growth strategy has included the acquisition of numerous businesses. The purchase price of these acquisitions has been determined after due diligence of the acquired business, market research, strategic planning, and the forecasting of expected future results and synergies. Estimated future results and expected synergies are subject to revisions as we integrate each acquisition and attempt to leverage resources. Each acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method as defined under the applicable accounting standards at the date of each acquisition, including, Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16, "Accounting for Business Combinations", and more recently, Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") 141, "Business Combinations." Accounting for these acquisitions has resulted in the capitalization of the cost in excess of fair value of the net assets acquired in each of these acquisitions as goodwill. We estimated the fair values of the assets acquired in each acquisition as of the date of acquisition and these estimates are subject to adjustment. These estimates are subject to final assessments of the fair value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, operating leases and deferred income taxes. We complete these assessments within one year of the date of acquisition. We are not aware of any information that would indicate that the final purchase price allocations for acquisitions completed in 2001 would differ meaningfully from preliminary estimates. In connection with each of our acquisitions, we have undertaken certain restructurings of the acquired businesses to realize efficiencies and potential cost savings. Our restructuring activities include the elimination of duplicate facilities, reductions in staffing levels, and other costs associated with exiting certain activities of the businesses we acquire. These activities are included as costs of the acquisition and are recorded as goodwill consistent with the guidance of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 95 3, "Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination." While we finalize our plans to restructure the businesses we acquire within one year of the date of acquisition, it may take more than one year to complete all activities related to the restructuring of an acquired business. Our acquisitions have resulted in a significant accumulation of goodwill which, for acquisitions prior to July 1, 2001, we amortized over an estimated benefit period of 20 to 30 years. We have not amortized any goodwill for our acquisitions completed after July 1, 2001 and will no longer amortize any goodwill beginning on January 1, 2002, in accordance with SFAS 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets". Through December 31, 2001, we reviewed our existing goodwill for impairment, consistent with the guidelines of SFAS 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to be Disposed Of" and determined that no amounts of goodwill were impaired using the undiscounted future cash flow methodology of SFAS 121. Effective January 1, 2002, we will review goodwill for impairment consistent with the guidelines of SFAS 142 using a discounted future cash flow approach. The methodology for determining impairment under SFAS 142 is significantly different and could result in different determinations than under SFAS 121. Pursuant to SFAS 142, we will test our goodwill for impairment upon adoption and, if impairment is indicated, record such impairment as a cumulative effect of accounting change. We are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption may have on our consolidated results of operations and financial position. 17  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments or disputes with customers regarding payment terms. When calculating the allowance, we consider our past loss experience, current and prior trends in our aged receivables, current economic conditions, and specific circumstances of individual receivable balances. If the financial condition of our customers were to significantly change, resulting in a significant improvement or impairment of their ability to make payments, an adjustment of the allowance may be required. Accounting for Synthetic Leases We participate in several synthetic leasing programs that involve 30 of the 519 leased facilities that we occupy. Under these synthetic lease facilities, special purpose entities are established to acquire properties and subsequently lease those properties to us. The leases are designed and qualify as operating leases for accounting purposes, where the monthly lease expense is recorded as rent expense in our income statement. We do not consolidate the assets or liabilities related to these facilities in our consolidated financial statements. Synthetic lease facilities require the application of complex lease and special purpose entity accounting rules and interpretations. We are aware that the Financial Accounting Standards Board is currently reviewing these accounting rules and interpretations and is considering their current and future application. In the course of applying these complex accounting rules and interpretations, we have made certain judgments, estimates and assumptions relative to their treatment. We had properties in our synthetic lease facilities with a lessors original cost of $74.3 million as of December 31, 2000. During 2001, we added 16 properties to our synthetic lease program with an original cost of $77.6 million bringing the total original cost of properties in our synthetic lease program to $151.9 million as of December 31, 2001. If all of our synthetic leases were accounted for as capital leases rather than operating leases or if these special purpose entities were consolidated in our 2001 historical financial statements: (1) our gross property, plant and equipment and long term debt would each be increased in an amount equal to $151.9 million as of December 31, 2001; (2) depreciation expense would increase in an amount equal to $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 for the properties leased pursuant to the synthetic lease facilities; and (3) rent expense for these properties would be reclassified as interest expense in an amount equal to $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Consequently, our EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, operating income and interest expense would have increased by $8.5 million, $8.5 million, $6.3 million and $8.5 million, respectively. In addition, net income before tax would have decreased by $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. See " Liquidity and Capital Resources Synthetic Leases." We believe that the following pro forma information will further assist in the understanding of this topic. If we had occupied all 30 properties on January 1, 2001 and all of our synthetic leases were accounted for as capital leases rather than operating leases or if these special purpose entities were consolidated in our financial statements: (1) our gross property, plant and equipment and long term debt would each be increased in an amount equal to $151.9 million as of December 31, 2001; (2) depreciation expense would increase in an amount equal to $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 for the properties leased pursuant to the synthetic lease facilities; and (3) rent expense for these properties would be reclassified as interest expense in an amount equal to $11.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Consequently, our EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, operating income and interest expense would have increased by $8.5 million, $8.5 million, $5.6 million and $11.4 million, respectively. In addition, net income before tax would have decreased by $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. 18 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS No. 133, "Accounting For Derivative Instruments And Hedging Activities", establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives), and for hedging activities. SFAS 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on its balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (1) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment; (2) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction; or (3) a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation, an unrecognized firm commitment, an available for sale security, or a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income, assets and liabilities or earnings depending on the nature of such derivatives. For cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. For hedges of foreign currency the accounting treatment generally follows the treatment for cash flow hedges or fair value hedges depending on the nature of the foreign currency hedge. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. Although we apply some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is generally high. We had $10.1 million of interest rate risk management liabilities and had a corresponding amount for unrealized losses to other comprehensive income ($6.1 million, net of tax) primarily related to cash flow hedges at December 31, 2001. Accounting for Internal Use Software We develop various software applications for internal use. We account for those costs in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Position 98 1, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use". SOP 98 1 requires computer software costs associated with internal use software to be expensed as incurred until certain capitalization criteria are met. SOP 98 1 also defines which types of costs should be capitalized and which should be expensed. Payroll and related costs for employees who are directly associated with, and who devote time to, the development of internal use computer software projects to the extent time is spent directly on the project, are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the software. Capitalization begins when the design stage of the application has been completed and it is probable that the project will be completed and used to perform the function intended. Depreciation begins when the software is placed in service. Computer software costs that are capitalized are evaluated for impairment in accordance with SFAS 121. It may be necessary for us to write off amounts associated with the development of internal use software if the project cannot be completed as intended. Our expansion into new technology based service offerings requires the development of internal use software that will be susceptible to rapid and 19 significant changes in technology. We may be required to write off unamortized costs if an internal use software program is replaced with an alternative tool prior to the end of the softwares estimated useful life. General uncertainties related to expansion into digital businesses, including the timing of introduction and market acceptance of our services, may adversely impact the recoverability of these assets. Accounting for Investments We hold investments in companies having operations or technology in areas within our strategic focus. We record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary. Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investments current carrying value, thereby possibly resulting in an impairment charge in the future. Overview Our primary financial objective has been to increase consolidated EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which is a source of funds for investment in continued growth and to service indebtedness. We use Adjusted EBITDA as our internal measurement of financial performance and as the basis for allocating resources to our internal operating segments. In addition, substantially all of our financing agreements contain covenants in which Adjusted EBITDA based calculations are used as a measure of financial performance for financial ratio purposes. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA based calculations are used by the holders of our publicly issued debt as important criteria for evaluating our business and, as a result, all of our bond indentures contain covenants in which Adjusted EBITDA based calculations are used as the primary measure of financial performance. However, you should not consider EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA to be substitutes for operating or net income (as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP) as indicators of our performance or for cash flow from operations (as determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of liquidity. We have benefited from our growth in consolidated EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA has increased from $129.4 million for 1999 to $282.1 million for 2001 (a compound annual growth rate of 47.7%). Adjusted EBITDA has increased from $129.7 million for 1999 to $302.2 million for 2001 (a compound annual growth rate of 52.7%). However, the focus on generating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA has negatively affected other measures of our financial performance, such as consolidated net income. For the years ended December 31, 1999 through 2001, we experienced consolidated net losses of $14.2 million, $27.8 million and $44.1 million, respectively. We attribute such losses in part to significant charges associated with the pursuit of our growth strategy, namely: increases in depreciation expense associated with expansion of storage capacity as well as development and acquisition of information systems assets; increases in goodwill amortization associated with acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method prior to July 1, 2001; increases in interest expense associated with the borrowings used to fund acquisitions; in 2000, charges for non cash stock option compensation expense and in 2000 and 2001, merger related expenses, both primarily associated with the integration of the operations of Iron Mountain and Pierce Leahy; 20 in 2001, extraordinary charges for early extinguishment of debt associated with the retirement of our 111/8% senior subordinated notes due 2006 and 101/8% senior subordinated notes due 2006, or the 111/8% notes and the 101/8% notes, respectively; and in 2000 and 2001, non cash foreign currency losses primarily due to a change in the value of the Canadian dollar as compared to the U.S. dollar, as it relates to the U.S. dollar denominated debt and intercompany balances of our principal Canadian subsidiary. Our revenues consist of storage revenues as well as service and storage material sales revenues. Storage revenues consist of periodic charges related to the storage of materials (either on a per unit or per cubic foot of records basis) and have accounted for approximately 60% of total revenues in each of the last five years. In certain circumstances, based upon customer requirements, storage revenues include periodic charges associated with normal, recurring service activities. Service and storage material sales revenues are comprised of charges for related service activities and courier operations and the sale of storage materials. Related service revenues arise from additions of new records, temporary removal of records from storage, refiling of removed records, destructions of records, permanent withdrawals from storage and sales of specially designed storage containers, magnetic media including computer tapes and related supplies. Courier operations consist primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request. Customers are generally billed on a monthly basis on contractually agreed upon terms. Cost of sales (excluding depreciation) consists primarily of wages and benefits for field personnel, facility occupancy costs, vehicle and other equipment costs and supplies. Of these, wages and benefits and facility occupancy costs are the most significant. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits for management, administrative, information technology, sales, account management and marketing personnel, as well as expenses related to communications and data processing, travel, professional fees, bad debts, training, office equipment and supplies. Our depreciation and amortization charges result primarily from the capital intensive nature of our business and the acquisitions we have completed. The principal components of depreciation relate to storage systems and related equipment, new buildings and leasehold improvements, equipment for new facilities and computer system hardware and software. Amortization relates primarily to goodwill arising from acquisitions and customer acquisition costs. We have accounted for all of our acquisitions under the purchase method. Since the purchase price for companies in our industry is usually substantially in excess of the fair value of their net assets, these purchases have given rise to significant goodwill and, accordingly, significant levels of amortization. Although amortization is a non cash charge, it does decrease reported consolidated net income. Because certain of our acquisitions have given rise to nondeductible goodwill, our effective tax rate historically has been higher than the statutory rate. See " Recent Pronouncements." We acquired 17 businesses in 1999, 12 in 2000 and 16 in 2001. With the exception of the Pierce Leahy merger in 2000, most acquisitions had lower Adjusted EBITDA margins than the rest of our business. We generally do not realize anticipated synergies relating to acquisitions immediately. We were able to increase our recent Adjusted EBITDA margins through improved overall operating efficiencies, economies of scale and the realization of synergies in connection with earlier acquisitions, as well as the addition of the higher margin Pierce Leahy business in 2000. This increase was partially offset by additional labor expense due to wage and incentive compensation equalization in conjunction with the Pierce Leahy integration. As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated Adjusted EBITDA margins were 25.0% for 1999, 26.1% for 2000 and 25.8% for 2001. Included in Adjusted EBITDA for 2001 is $5.4 million (0.5% of consolidated revenue) of development expenses for our new technology based services. 21 On December 5, 2001, our board authorized and approved a three for two stock split effected in the form of a dividend on our common stock. We issued the additional shares of common stock on December 31, 2001 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 17, 2001. All share and per share amounts have been restated to reflect the stock split. Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, information derived from our consolidated statements of operations, expressed as a percentage of total consolidated revenues. Year Ended December 31, 1999 2000 2001 Revenues: Storage 61.1 % 59.4 % 59.3 % Service and Storage Material Sales 38.9 40.6 40.7 Total Revenues 100.0 100.0 100.0 Operating Expenses: Cost of Sales (excluding depreciation) 50.2 48.9 48.0 Selling, General and Administrative 24.8 25.0 26.2 Depreciation and Amortization 12.6 12.9 13.1 Stock Option Compensation Expense 1.6 Merger related Expenses 0.9 0.3 Total Operating Expenses 87.6 89.3 87.6 Operating Income 12.4 10.7 12.4 Interest Expense, Net 10.5 12.0 11.5 Other Income (Expense), Net 0.0 (0.5 ) (1.7 ) Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations Before Provision for Income Taxes and Minority Interest 1.9 (1.8 ) (0.8 ) Provision for Income Taxes 2.0 0.9 2.2 Minority Interest in (Losses) Earnings of Subsidiaries 0.1 (0.2 ) (0.2 ) Loss from Continuing Operations before Extraordinary Item (0.2 ) (2.5 ) (2.8 ) Income from Discontinued Operations 0.1 Loss on Sale of Discontinued Operations (2.6 ) Extraordinary Charge from Early Extinguishment of Debt (net of tax benefit) (0.3 ) (1.0 ) Net Loss (2.7 )% (2.8 )% (3.8 )% Other Data: EBITDA from Continuing Operations 24.9 % 23.2 % 24.1 % Adjusted EBITDA from Continuing Operations 25.0 % 26.1 % 25.8 % Year Ended December 31, 2001 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2000 Consolidated revenues increased $184.7 million, or 18.7%, to $1,171.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $986.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Internal revenue growth for the year ended December 31, 2001 was 10.5%, comprised of 11.1% for storage revenue and 9.5% for service and storage material sales revenues. We calculate internal revenue growth in local currency for our international operations and as if Pierce Leahy had merged with us on January 1, 2000. 22 Consolidated storage revenues increased $108.8 million, or 18.6%, to $694.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $585.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase was primarily attributable to: (1) internal revenue growth of 11.1% resulting primarily from net increases in records and other media stored by existing customers and sales to new customers; and (2) acquisitions, particularly the inclusion of Pierce Leahys revenue for twelve months of 2001 versus eleven months of 2000. The total increase in storage revenues was partially offset by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation of $3.8 million as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against certain currencies, primarily the Canadian dollar and the British pound sterling. Consolidated service and storage material sales revenues increased $75.9 million, or 19.0%, to $476.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $400.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase was primarily attributable to: (1) internal revenue growth of 9.5% resulting primarily from net increases in service and storage material sales to existing customers and sales to new customers; and (2) acquisitions, particularly the inclusion of Pierce Leahys revenue for twelve months of 2001 versus eleven months of 2000. The total increase in service and storage material sales revenues was partially offset by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation of $3.3 million as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against certain currencies during 2001, primarily the Canadian dollar and the British pound sterling. Consolidated cost of sales (excluding depreciation) increased $79.2 million, or 16.4%, to $561.9 million (48.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $482.8 million (48.9% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2000. The dollar increase was primarily attributable to the required costs to support our revenue growth and was partially offset by operating efficiencies at our U.S. and Canadian operations, particularly related to the decrease in rent as a percent of consolidated revenue of 0.7% offset by a 0.2% increase in other facilities costs as a percent of consolidated revenues and a 0.2% increase in utility expenses (primarily, gas and oil charges) as a percent of consolidated revenues. In our U.S. and Canadian operations, facility costs increased $22.1 million and labor costs increased $33.7 million, which represented a decrease of 0.3% and 0.8% of consolidated revenues, respectively. The decrease as a percent of consolidated revenues was offset by relatively lower gross margins in our emerging confidential destruction services business, which increased cost of sales by 0.9% of consolidated revenues. Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses increased $60.4 million, or 24.5%, to $306.9 million (26.2% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $246.6 million (25.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2000. The dollar increase was primarily attributable to the required costs to support our revenue growth, while the increase as a percent of consolidated revenues was primarily attributable to: (1) higher overhead levels in our emerging confidential destruction services business (an increase of 0.6% of consolidated revenue) and our Latin American and European operations (an increase of 0.4% of consolidated revenue); (2) higher data communications costs resulting from network deployment and migration activities (an increase of 0.4% of consolidated revenues); and (3) expenditures for our marketing and information technology initiatives related to the development of complementary technology based service offerings (an increase of 0.5% of consolidated revenues). These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts for our U.S. and Canadian operations (a decrease of 0.4% of consolidated revenues). Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased $26.8 million, or 21.1%, to $153.6 million (13.1% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $126.8 million (12.9% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2000. Depreciation expense increased $20.3 million, primarily due to the additional depreciation expense related to the 2000 and 2001 acquisitions, particularly the inclusion of Pierce Leahys depreciation expense for twelve months of 2001 versus eleven months of 2000 and capital expenditures including storage systems, information systems and expansion of storage capacity in existing facilities. Amortization expense 23 increased $6.4 million, primarily due to the additional amortization expense related to the goodwill generated by our 2000 and 2001 acquisitions completed prior to July 1, 2001, particularly Pierce Leahy. Stock option compensation expense of $15.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 represents a non cash charge resulting from the acceleration and extension of previously granted stock options as a part of separation agreements with certain executives. There were no such costs for the year ended December 31, 2001. Merger related expenses are certain expenses directly related to our merger with Pierce Leahy that cannot be capitalized and include system conversion costs, costs of exiting certain facilities, severance, relocation and pay to stay payments and other transaction related costs. Merger related expenses were $3.7 million (0.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $9.1 million (0.9% of consolidated revenues) for the same period of 2000. As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated operating income increased $39.0 million, or 36.8%, to $145.0 million (12.4% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $106.0 million (10.7% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2000. Consolidated interest expense increased $16.8 million, or 14.2%, to $134.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $118.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase was primarily attributable to increased indebtedness related to: (1) $19.6 million of interest expense on the 85/8% senior subordinated notes due 2013, or the 85/8% notes, which were issued in April and September 2001; (2) the inclusion of term debt related to our credit facility for twelve months versus five months of 2000 resulting in an increase of $6.2 million; and (3) the inclusion of Pierce Leahys debt for twelve months of 2001 versus eleven months of 2000 resulting in an increase of $4.7 million. These increases were partially offset by reduced interest expense of $11.8 million due to the retirement of our 111/8% and 101/8% senior subordinated notes as well as a decline in the weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt. Consolidated other expense was $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The change was partially due to a $6.9 million impairment charge taken on our investment in convertible preferred stock of a technology development company. Additionally, we recorded a non cash foreign currency loss of $10.4 million, primarily due to the effect of further weakening of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar for the year ended December 31, 2001, versus the same period of 2000, as it relates to Iron Mountain Canada Corporations 81/8% senior notes due 2008, or the 81/8% notes, and the intercompany balances with our Canadian and European subsidiaries. In 2000, this amount was $6.3 million. As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated loss before provision for income taxes and minority interests decreased $9.9 million to $8.1 million (0.7% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $18.0 million (1.8% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2000. The provision for income taxes was $26.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. For the year ended December 31, 2001, we recorded approximately $38.9 million of nondeductible goodwill amortization expense. Consolidated loss before extraordinary item increased $7.3 million to $32.2 million (2.8% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $24.9 million (2.5% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2000. In 2001, we recorded an extraordinary charge of $11.8 million (net of tax benefit of $8.2 million) related to the early retirement of our 111/8% and 101/8% notes in conjunction with our underwritten public offerings of the 85/8% notes. In 2000, we recorded an extraordinary charge of $2.9 million (net of tax benefit of $1.9 million) related to the early extinguishment of debt in conjunction with the refinancing of our senior credit facility. The charges 24 primarily represented call and tender premiums and the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the extinguished debt. As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated Adjusted EBITDA increased $45.2 million, or 17.6%, to $302.2 million (25.8% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $257.0 million (26.1% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2000. Excluding the $5.4 million of expenses (0.5% of consolidated revenues) related to the development of our new technology related service offerings, our Adjusted EBITDA margin for the year ended December 31, 2001 was 26.3% of consolidated revenues. There were no such costs in the same period of 2000. Adjusted EBITDA as a percent of segment revenue for our business records management segment decreased from 27.4% to 26.8%, primarily due to: (1) increases in cost of sales associated with other facility costs, including utilities and property insurance; (2) increases in selling, general and administrative expenses as a result of divisionalization; (3) higher data communications costs resulting from network deployment and migration activities; and (4) an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts. This decrease was partially offset by increases in gross margin driven by real estate management and labor efficiencies obtained as a result of an increase in scale. Adjusted EBITDA as a percent of segment revenue for our off site data protection segment increased from 25.2% to 26.1% primarily due to an increase in gross margin as a result of improved labor, transportation and real estate management, as well as the contribution from the segments acquisition of two higher margin escrow businesses. This increase was partially offset by: (1) the decentralization of various overhead functions; (2) an increase in spending for sales and marketing; and (3) a decrease in contribution from the segments higher margin complementary services due to the relatively slower growth in revenue for those services. The Adjusted EBITDA margin for our international segment increased from 20.5% to 23.7% primarily due to: (1) the inclusion of an additional month in 2001 of our more profitable Canadian business acquired as a part of the Pierce Leahy acquisition; (2) efficiency gains from the economies of scale achieved through the December 2000 acquisition of FACS Record Centre Inc., a Canadian company; and (3) improved margins from our Latin American operations. This increase was partially offset by an increase of $0.7 million in the provision for doubtful accounts at our European operations. Year Ended December 31, 2000 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 1999 Consolidated revenues increased $466.9 million, or 89.9%, to $986.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $519.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Total internal revenue growth, calculated as if Pierce Leahy had merged with Iron Mountain on January 1, 1999, was 12.3%. Consolidated storage revenues increased $268.3 million, or 84.5%, to $585.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $317.4 million for the year ended December 31,1999. Consolidated storage revenues increased primarily due to acquisitions, particularly the Pierce Leahy acquisition. Pierce Leahys 1999 storage revenues were $190.1 million. Internal storage revenue growth, calculated as if Pierce Leahy had merged with Iron Mountain on January 1, 1999, was 11.7%. The internal storage revenue growth resulted primarily from net increases in records and other media stored by existing customers and from sales to new customers. Consolidated service and storage material sales revenues increased $198.5 million, or 98.2%, to $400.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $202.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Consolidated service and storage material sales revenues increased primarily due to acquisitions, particularly the Pierce Leahy acquisition. Pierce Leahys 1999 service and storage material sales revenues were $152.2 million. Internal service and storage material sales revenue growth, calculated as if Pierce Leahy had merged with Iron Mountain on January 1, 1999, was 13.3%. The internal revenue growth resulted from increases in service and storage material sales to existing customers and the addition of new customer accounts. 25  Consolidated cost of sales (excluding depreciation) increased $221.9 million, or 85.0%, to $482.8 million (48.9% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $260.9 million (50.2% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 1999. The dollar increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Pierce Leahy. The decrease as a percentage of revenues was primarily attributable to operating efficiencies, particularly related to labor and transportation, gained as a result of an increase in scale, offset by the increased facilities costs of Pierce Leahy, which are typical of a more paper storage intensive business. Our business records management and international segments are substantially paper based. Revenues for these segments have increased from 73% to 80% of total revenues from 1999 to 2000. Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses increased $117.7 million, or 91.2%, to $246.6 million (25.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $128.9 million (24.8% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 1999. The dollar increase was primarily attributable to the Pierce Leahy acquisition. The increase as a percentage of revenues was primarily attributable to increased spending on information technology related to: (1) the conversion of new systems for our off site data protection business; (2) increased staffing in preparation for systems conversions related to the integration of Pierce Leahy with us; and (3) our efforts to explore complementary digital service offerings. These increases were partially offset by general management overhead efficiencies driven by an increase in scale. Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased $61.4 million, or 93.8%, to $126.8 million (12.9% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $65.4 million (12.6% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 1999. The dollar increase was primarily attributable to the additional depreciation and amortization expense related to the 1999 and 2000 acquisitions, particularly the Pierce Leahy acquisition, and capital expenditures including racking systems, information systems and expansion of storage capacity in existing facilities. Stock option compensation expense represents a non cash charge resulting from the acceleration of vesting and extension of exercise periods for previously granted stock options as a part of separation agreements with certain executives relating to the Pierce Leahy merger. Stock option compensation expense was $15.1 million (1.6% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2000. Merger related expenses are certain expenses directly related to our merger with Pierce Leahy that cannot be capitalized and include severance, relocation and pay to stay payments, costs of exiting certain facilities, system conversion costs and other transaction related costs. Merger related expenses were $9.1 million (0.9% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2000. As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated operating income increased $41.8 million, or 65.0%, to $106.0 million (10.7% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $64.2 million (12.4% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 1999. Consolidated interest expense increased $63.6 million, or 116.8%, to $118.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $54.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. The increase was primarily attributable to increased indebtedness related to: (1) the debt assumed as a result of the Pierce Leahy acquisition; (2) the financing of acquisitions and capital expenditures; (3) the increase in our effective interest rate from the same period in 1999; and (4) our debt refinancing on August 14, 2000, resulting in additional principal outstanding and additional commitment fees, which were only partially offset by interest earned on excess cash. Consolidated other income (expense) was an expense of $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared to income of $0.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. The increase in expense was primarily due to a weakening of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar, as it relates to the 81/8% notes, and a weakening of the British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar on intercompany balances with our European subsidiaries. 26 As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated income (loss) from continuing operations before provision for income taxes and minority interests decreased $27.8 million to a loss of $18.0 million (1.8% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2000 from income of $9.8 million (1.9% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 1999. The provision for income taxes was $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared to $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Our effective tax rate is higher than statutory rates primarily due to the amortization of the nondeductible portion of goodwill associated with certain acquisitions (the tax laws generally permit deduction of such expenses for asset purchases, but not for acquisitions of stock). For the year ended December 31, 2000, we recorded approximately $35 million in nondeductible goodwill amortization expense. Consolidated loss from continuing operations increased $23.8 million to $24.9 million (2.5% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $1.1 million (0.2% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 1999. In addition, in August 2000, we recorded an extraordinary charge of $2.9 million (net of tax benefit of $1.9 million) related to the early extinguishment of debt in conjunction with the refinancing of our senior credit facility. The charge primarily represented the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the extinguished debt. As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated net loss increased $13.6 million, or 95.7%, to $27.8 million (2.8% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $14.2 million (2.7% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 1999. Recent Consolidated Quarterly Financial Data The following table sets forth, for the quarterly periods indicated, information derived from our consolidated statements of operations. The unaudited quarterly information has been prepared on the same basis as the annual financial information and, in managements opinion, includes all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) necessary to present fairly the information for the quarters presented. The operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the year or for any future period.

The 85/8% notes were issued at a price to investors of 100% of par. Our net proceeds of $218.6 million, after paying the underwriters discounts and commissions and related expenses, were used to fund our offer to purchase and consent solicitation relating to our outstanding 111/8% notes, to repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. In April 2001, we received and accepted tenders for $124.6 million of the outstanding principal amount of our 111/8% notes. We recorded an extraordinary charge of $4.8 million (net of tax benefit of $3.3 million) in the second quarter related to the early retirement of the 111/8% notes. Subsequently, we redeemed the remaining $5.4 million of principal amount of the 111/8% notes, at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) of 105.563% plus accrued and unpaid interest, for a total cost of redemption of $6.0 million. In September 2001, we completed an underwritten public offering which resulted in the issuance of an additional $210.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 85/8% notes. The additional notes were issued at a price to investors of 101.50% of par. Our net proceeds of $209.3 million, after paying the underwriters discounts and commissions and related expenses, were used to fund our offer to purchase and consent solicitation relating to our outstanding 101/8% notes and to redeem the remaining 101/8% notes, as well as to repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. In September 2001, we received and accepted tenders for $156.7 million of the $165.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 101/8% notes. We recorded an extraordinary charge of $7.0 million (net of tax benefit of $4.9 million) in the third quarter related to the early retirement of the 101/8% notes. Subsequently, we received and accepted tenders for an additional $0.3 million in aggregate principal amount of our 101/8% notes and redeemed the remaining $8.0 million of outstanding principal amount of our 101/8% notes, at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) of 105.06% plus accrued and unpaid interest, for a total cost of redemption of $9.0 million. On March 15, 2002, we entered into a new amended and restated revolving credit agreement (the "Amended and Restated Credit Agreement"). The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement replaces our existing credit agreement. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement has an aggregate principal amount of $650.0 million and includes a $400.0 million revolving credit facility and a term loan facility in the amount of $250.0 million. The revolving credit facility matures on January 31, 2005 while the term loan is to be paid in full on February 15, 2008; however, if our 91/8% senior subordinated notes due 2007, or the 91/8% notes, are not redeemed or repurchased prior to April 15, 2007 the term loan will mature on April 15, 2007. The interest rate on borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement varies depending on our choice of base rates and currency options, plus an applicable margin. This margin applicable to the term loans under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement is lower than the margin applicable to such loans under our existing credit agreement and will result in reduced interest expense on our borrowings as compared to the previous credit agreement. Restrictive covenants under this agreement are similar to those under our prior credit facility. All intercompany notes are now pledged to secure the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Net cash provided by financing activities was $134.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, consisting primarily of net proceeds of $427.9 million from the sale of the 85/8% notes and equity 28 contributions from minority shareholders of $24.8 million, partially offset by the early retirement of the 111/8% notes and the 101/8% notes of $312.7 million. Net cash provided by continuing operations was $160.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $157.6 million for the same period in 2000. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in operating income and trade payables, partially offset by an increase in trade accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and a decrease in accrued expenses. At December 31, 2001, we had estimated net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $173 million for federal income tax purposes. As a result of such loss carryforwards, cash paid for income taxes has historically been substantially lower than the provision for income taxes. The preceding net operating loss carryforwards do not include approximately $79 million of potential preacquisition net operating loss carryforwards of Arcus Group, Inc. and certain other foreign acquisitions. Any tax benefit realized related to preacquisition net operating loss carryforwards will be recorded as a reduction of goodwill when, and if, realized. The Arcus Group carryforwards expire in seven years. As a result of these loss carryforwards, we do not expect to pay any significant federal and state income taxes in the next three years. As of December 31, 2001, the annual maturities of our indebtedness for the years ending December 31, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006 were $35.3 million, $10.3 million, $5.1 million, $298.1 million and $54.6 million, respectively. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. None of our public debt is subject to scheduled mandatory redemption before 2006. As of December 31, 2001, the minimum future payments under our operating leases for the years ending December 31, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006 were $123.6 million, $111.4 million, $100.4 million, $86.3 million and $68.6 million, respectively. See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As of February 28, 2002, we had approximately $1,508.9 million of total debt, of which $1,317.8 million or 87.3% of total debt, including the $195.5 million of debt subject to the interest rate swap agreements (see Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), had fixed interest rates and $191.1 million had variable interest rates. Capital Investments As we have sought to increase our EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, we have made significant capital investments, consisting primarily of: (i) the purchase and construction of real estate; (ii) other capital expenditures; (iii) acquisitions; and (iv) customer acquisition costs. These investments have been primarily funded through cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. During 2001, total capital expenditures were $197.0 million. A significant portion of our capital expenditures are related to growth and consist primarily of storage systems, management information systems, new buildings and expansion of storage capacity in existing facilities. Approximately 10% of total capital expenditures were expended in order to maintain our then current revenue stream. We currently estimate that our capital expenditures (other than capital expenditures related to future acquisitions, which cannot be presently estimated, and our digital services offerings, which are described separately below) for 2002 will be approximately $175 to $200 million. We expect to fund these expenditures with cash flows from operations and borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, in 2001 was $71.4 million. In addition, in 2001, we incurred costs (net of revenues received for the initial transfer of records) related to the acquisition of large volume accounts (customer acquisition costs) of $8.4 million. 29  We have been assessing various opportunities in the technology based services business driven by e commerce and facilitated by the Internet. Services associated with this business would expand our range of services into the use of the Internet to facilitate the backup, storage and management of customer data. We estimate that we will incur expenses associated with the continuing development of our digital service offerings in the range of $7 million to $9 million during 2002. In addition, we expect the capital expenditures associated with the continuing development of our digital service offerings in 2002 will be in the range of $5 million to $6 million. We intend to fund this effort with cash flows from operations and borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Synthetic Leasing Our synthetic leases contain financial and other covenants, and events of default, that are similar to those contained in our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Seven financial institutions have provided over 50% of the capacity under our $400.0 million revolving credit facility. These seven financial institutions also participate in our synthetic lease programs. An event of default under one of our synthetic lease facilities would result in an event of default under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, enabling the lenders under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to terminate their commitments to lend and accelerate our obligations thereunder. An event of default under one of our synthetic lease facilities would not, directly, result in an event of default under any indenture pursuant to which our publicly traded notes were issued. However, an acceleration of our obligations under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement would result in an event of default under each indenture, thereby enabling the holders of such notes to accelerate our obligations under the applicable indenture. Under our synthetic lease facilities, special purpose entities are established to acquire properties and subsequently lease those properties to us. Neither we nor any of our related parties have invested, either via debt obligations or equity, in these special purpose entities. Our obligations under our synthetic lease facilities are considered indebtedness for purposes of financial covenants under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2001, our synthetic leasing program had a total capacity of $204.3 of which $151.9 million had been utilized for property acquisitions and $52.4 million is currently available for future property acquisitions. We have entered into these synthetic leases because we believe they afford meaningful benefits. Such benefits include rental payments below those available from traditional landlords and developers, and tax benefits and control provisions normally associated with direct ownership. Each of the leases under our synthetic lease facilities has a five to six and one half year term for specified records storage warehouses; commencement dates for these leases range from 1998 to 2002. During 2001, we recorded $8.5 million in rent expense on our income statement related to these lease commitments. We had synthetic lease facilities related to properties with a lessors original cost of $74.3 million and $151.9 million as of December 31, 2000 and December 31, 2001, respectively. If on January 1, 2001, the original cost of properties under synthetic lease facilities had equaled $151.9 million, rent expense for the year ended December 31, 2001 would have been approximately $11.4 million. See " Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for Synthetic Leases." At the end of each lease term, we, at our option, may: (1) negotiate a renewal of such lease (which is subject to the agreement of the relevant synthetic lease lessor and its lenders); (2) purchase the properties subject to such lease at a price equal to the lessors original cost; or (3) allow such lease to expire and cause the properties subject to it to be sold. Our ability to cause the properties to be sold depends upon our compliance with certain terms of the applicable lease. Under certain conditions, we would receive the excess, if any, of the net sales proceeds over the properties original cost. In the event that the net sales proceeds are less than the properties original cost, we would make certain contingent rental payments to the lessor equal to that difference, subject to a maximum amount of approximately 85% of the properties original cost. If any of our synthetic lease facilities are terminated following an event of default under the relevant synthetic 30 lease documents, or if, at the end of the lease term, we do not either negotiate a renewal of the lease or elect to cause the relevant leased properties to be sold, or if we do elect to cause such leased properties to be sold but fail to satisfy the conditions to such election, we would generally be obligated to pay the lessors original cost for such leased properties. Acquisitions Our liquidity and capital resources may be impacted by our acquisition strategy. Our future interest expense may increase significantly as a result of the additional indebtedness we may incur to finance possible future acquisitions. To the extent that future acquisitions are financed by additional borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement or other credit facilities, or the future issuance of debt securities, the resulting increase in debt and interest expense could have a negative effect on such measures of liquidity as the ratio of debt to equity, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to debt and to interest expense. We have historically financed the cash portion of our acquisitions with borrowings under our revolving credit facilities in conjunction with cash flows provided by operations and with the net proceeds from the issuance of debt securities and common stock. In connection with our acquisition program, we have undertaken certain restructurings of the acquired businesses. We complete formalized restructuring plans for acquisitions within one year of the date of acquisition. The restructuring activities include reductions in staffing levels, elimination of duplicate facilities and other costs associated with exiting certain activities of the acquired businesses. In connection with these restructuring activities, we established reserves of $3.8 million in 2001 as part of the purchase accounting for our acquisitions. During 2001, we expended $7.8 million for restructuring costs. These expenditures consisted primarily of severance costs and costs related to exiting facilities. In addition, we made $8.2 million of adjustments, which reduced goodwill, primarily as a result of our finalization of certain restructuring plans. At December 31, 2001, we had a total of $16.2 million accrued for restructuring costs for all of our then completed acquisitions. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. From January 1, 2002 through March 1, 2002, we acquired 2 confidential destruction services businesses for aggregate consideration of approximately $8 million. Iron Mountain/Pierce Leahy Integration The process of integrating the operations and headquarters functions of Iron Mountain and Pierce Leahy includes the planning, development and execution of an integration plan with the goal of full integration within three years after the merger. During 2000 and 2001, we completed the integration of the sales, overhead and support functions, and combined the two field operations. We currently estimate that the merger related expenses to integrate the two companies, the majority of which have been incurred in 2000 and 2001, will total approximately $15 million. These costs consisted primarily of severance and relocation payments to certain employees, transition bonuses, consultants fees, and system conversion costs. We recorded merger related expenses of $9.1 million and $3.7 million during 2000 and 2001. As a result of the integration effort, we expect to realize an estimated $15 million in annual operating cost savings within three years after the merger. These cost savings will result primarily from the elimination of redundant corporate expenses, more efficient operations, and utilization of real estate. We intend to fund the integration effort with cash flows from operations and borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Future Capital Needs Over the last year, our focus has shifted from growth through acquisitions to internally generated revenue growth. However, our primary financial goal has always been, and continues to be, to increase 31 consolidated EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in relation to capital invested, even now that our focus has shifted from growth through acquisitions to internal revenue growth. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are sources of funds for investment in continued growth and for servicing indebtedness. Our ability to generate sufficient cash to fund our needs depends generally on the results of our operations and the availability of financing. We believe that cash flows from operations in conjunction with borrowings from existing and possible future debt financings will be sufficient to meet debt service requirements for the foreseeable future and to make possible future acquisitions and capital expenditures. However, there can be no assurance in this regard or that the terms available for any future financing, if required, would be favorable to us. Seasonality Historically, our businesses have not been subject to seasonality in any material respect. Inflation Certain of our expenses, such as wages and benefits, occupancy, costs and equipment repair and replacement, are subject to normal inflationary pressures. Although to date we have been able to offset inflationary cost increases through increased operating efficiencies and the negotiation of favorable long term real estate leases, we can give no assurance that we will be able to offset any future inflationary cost increases through similar efficiencies, leases or increased storage or service charges. Foreign Currency Exchange Rates We generally view our investments in foreign businesses with a functional currency other than our reporting currency as long term. These investments are sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are principally Canadian dollar, the British pound sterling, the Euro and several Latin American currencies. The effect of a change in foreign exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the "Accumulated Other Comprehensive Items" component of shareholders equity. A 10% depreciation in year end 2001 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a $12.2 million reduction in our shareholders equity. Recent Pronouncements In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." Under SFAS 142, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized, but are reviewed at least annually for impairment. At December 31, 2001, we had net goodwill of $1.5 billion. Pursuant to SFAS 142, we will test our goodwill for impairment upon adoption and, if impairment is indicated, record such impairment as a cumulative effect of accounting change. We are currently evaluating the effect the adoption may have on our consolidated results of operations and financial position. The amortization provisions of SFAS 142 apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after June 30, 2001. With respect to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to July 1, 2001, we are required to adopt SFAS 142 effective January 1, 2002. Our impairment review may result in future periodic writedowns; however, the application of the non amortization provisions of SFAS 142 for goodwill is expected to result in an increase in operating income of approximately $59 million in 2002. We are also reviewing the estimated useful lives of intangible assets which may affect operating income in 2002. 32 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk. In December 2000 and January 2001, we entered into certain derivative financial contracts, which are variable for fixed swaps of interest payments payable on an aggregate principal amount of $195.5 million of our term loan and certain variable operating lease commitments. Our investments in Iron Mountain Europe Limited, Iron Mountain South America, Ltd. and other international investments may be subject to risks and uncertainties relating to fluctuations in currency valuation. One of our Canadian subsidiaries, Iron Mountain Canada Corporation, has U.S. dollar denominated debt. Gains and losses due to exchange rate fluctuations related to this debt are recognized in our consolidated statements of operations. After consideration of the swap contracts mentioned above, as of December 31, 2001, we had $180.6 million of variable rate debt outstanding with a weighted average variable interest rate of 4.4%, and $1,315.5 million of fixed rate debt outstanding. If the weighted average variable interest rate on our variable rate debt had increased by 1%, such increase would have had a negative impact on our net income for the year ended December 31, 2001 of $1.2 million. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our long term indebtedness, including the fair values of such indebtedness as of December 31, 2001.
