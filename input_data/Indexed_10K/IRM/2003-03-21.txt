Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with "Item 6. Selected Consolidated Financial and Operating Information" and the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto and the other financial and operating information included elsewhere in this filing. This discussion contains "forward looking statements," as that term is defined in the federal securities laws. See "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements" on page ii of this filing. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and for the period then ended. On an on going basis, we evaluate the estimates used, including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts, impairments of tangible and intangible assets, income taxes, purchase accounting related reserves, self insurance liabilities, incentive compensation liabilities, litigation liabilities and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience, actuarial estimates, current conditions and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and are not readily apparent from other sources. We use these estimates to assist us in the identification and assessment of the accounting treatment necessary with respect to commitments and contingencies. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our critical accounting policies include the following and are in no particular order: Accounting for Acquisitions Part of our growth strategy has included the acquisition of numerous businesses. The purchase price of these acquisitions has been determined after due diligence of the acquired business, market research, strategic planning, and the forecasting of expected future results and synergies. Estimated future results and expected synergies are subject to revisions as we integrate each acquisition and attempt to leverage resources. Each acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method as defined under the applicable accounting standards at the date of each acquisition, including, Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16, "Accounting for Business Combinations," and more recently, SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations." Accounting for these acquisitions has resulted in the capitalization of the cost in excess of fair value of the net assets acquired in each of these acquisitions as goodwill. We estimated the fair values of the assets acquired in each acquisition as of the date of acquisition and these estimates are subject to adjustment. These estimates are subject to final assessments of the fair value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, operating leases and deferred income taxes. We complete these assessments within one year of the date of acquisition. We are not aware of any information that would indicate that the final purchase price allocations for acquisitions completed in 2002 would differ meaningfully from preliminary estimates. See Note 7 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In connection with each of our acquisitions, we have undertaken certain restructurings of the acquired businesses to realize efficiencies and potential cost savings. Our restructuring activities include the elimination of duplicate facilities, reductions in staffing levels, and other costs associated with exiting certain activities of the businesses we acquire. The estimated cost of these restructuring activities are included as costs of the acquisition and are recorded as goodwill consistent with the guidance of Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 95 3, "Recognition of Liabilities in 20 Connection with a Purchase Business Combination." While we finalize our plans to restructure the businesses we acquire within one year of the date of acquisition, it may take more than one year to complete all activities related to the restructuring of an acquired business. Our acquisitions have resulted in a significant accumulation of goodwill, which for acquisitions prior to July 1, 2001, we amortized over an estimated benefit period of 20 to 30 years. We have not amortized any goodwill for our acquisitions completed after July 1, 2001 and, beginning on January 1, 2002, ceased to amortize any goodwill in accordance with SFAS No. 142. Through December 31, 2001, we reviewed our existing goodwill for impairment, consistent with the guidelines of SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to be Disposed Of" and determined that no amounts of goodwill were impaired using the undiscounted future cash flow methodology of SFAS No. 121. Effective January 1, 2002, we reviewed goodwill for impairment consistent with the guidelines of SFAS No. 142 using a discounted future cash flow approach. The result of testing our goodwill for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 142, as of January 1, 2002, was a non cash charge of $6.4 million (net of minority interest of $8.5 million), which, consistent with SFAS No. 142, is reported in the caption "cumulative effect of change in accounting principle" in our consolidated statement of operations. Impairment adjustments recognized in the future, if any, are generally required to be recognized as operating expenses. The $6.4 million charge relates to our South American reporting unit within our international reporting segment. The South American reporting unit failed the impairment test primarily due to a reduction in the expected future performance of the unit resulting from a deterioration of the local economic environment and the devaluation of the currency in Argentina. As goodwill amortization expense in our South American reporting unit is not deductible for tax purposes, this impairment charge is not net of a tax benefit. We have a controlling 50.1% interest in Iron Mountain South America, Ltd ("IMSA") and the remainder is owned by an unaffiliated entity. IMSA has acquired a controlling interest in entities in which local partners have retained a minority interest in order to enhance our local market expertise. These local partners have no ownership interest in IMSA. This has caused the minority interest portion of the non cash goodwill impairment charge ($8.5 million) to exceed our portion of the non cash goodwill impairment charge ($6.4 million). In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we selected October 1 as our annual goodwill impairment review date. We performed our annual goodwill impairment review as of October 1, 2002 and noted no impairment of goodwill at our reporting units as of that date. As of December 31, 2002, no factors were identified that would alter this assessment. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments. When calculating the allowance, we consider our past loss experience, current and prior trends in our aged receivables, current economic conditions, and specific circumstances of individual receivable balances. If the financial condition of our customers were to significantly change, resulting in a significant improvement or impairment of their ability to make payments, an adjustment of the allowance may be required. 21  Accounting for Variable Interest Entities Under our three synthetic lease facilities, three special purpose entities, which we now refer to as variable interest entities, were established to acquire properties and lease those properties to us. These leases were designed to qualify as operating leases for accounting purposes, where the monthly lease expense was recorded as rent expense in our consolidated statements of operations and where the related underlying assets and liabilities were not consolidated in our consolidated balance sheets. As described below, we changed the characterization and the related accounting for properties in one variable interest entity ("VIE III") during the third quarter of 2002 and prospectively for new property acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2002. In addition, anticipating the requirement to consolidate, and in line with our objective of transparent reporting, we voluntarily guaranteed all of the at risk equity in VIE III and our two other variable interest entities (together, the "Other Variable Interest Entities" and, collectively with VIE III, our "Variable Interest Entities") as of December 31, 2002. These guarantees resulted in our consolidating all of our Variable Interest Entities assets and liabilities. Synthetic lease facilities require the application of complex lease and variable interest entity accounting rules and interpretations. In the course of applying these complex accounting rules and interpretations, we have made certain judgments, estimates and assumptions relative to their treatment. We entered into these synthetic lease facilities because we believe they afforded, and continue to afford, meaningful benefits. Such benefits included rental payments (prospectively interest payments) below those available from traditional landlords and developers, and tax benefits and control provisions normally associated with direct ownership, including the right to buy the properties at original cost. Each of the leases under our synthetic lease facilities has a five to six and one half year term for specified records storage warehouses; commencement dates for these leases range from 1998 to 2002. Our Variable Interest Entities were financed with real estate term loans. These real estate term loans have always been and continue to be treated as indebtedness for purposes of our financial covenants under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. As of the date they were consolidated into our financial statements, they were considered indebtedness under our Indentures for our Senior Subordinated Notes and our Subsidiary notes. As of December 31, 2002, these real estate term loans amounted to $202.6 million. No further financing is currently available to our Variable Interest Entities to fund further property acquisitions. See Note 5 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In light of the impending changes in the accounting rules related to off balance sheet treatment of variable interest entities, which became final subsequent to December 31, 2002 as discussed below, management undertook an internal review of our Variable Interest Entities during the third quarter of 2002 in order to determine the future treatment of these transactions. During this review, management determined that VIE III should not have qualified for off balance sheet treatment due to a technical documentation error. VIE III was involved in a series of construction projects and other facility acquisitions that were initiated from mid 2001 through December 31, 2002. As a result, management changed the characterization and the related accounting for properties in VIE III during the third quarter of 2002 and prospectively for new property acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2002 to record these properties and their related financing obligations in our consolidated results. New property acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2002 totaled $10.4 million. Also, as of December 31, 2002, we voluntarily guaranteed all of the at risk equity in VIE III. This resulted in our consolidating all of its remaining assets and liabilities. VIE IIIs remaining assets and liabilities relate to an interest rate swap agreement, which it entered into upon its inception. This swap agreement hedges the majority of interest rate risk associated with VIE IIIs real estate term loans. Specifically, VIE III has swapped $97.0 million of floating rate debt to fixed rate debt. Since the time it entered into the swap agreement, interest rates have fallen. As a result, the estimated fair value of the derivative liability held by VIE III, and now consolidated on our balance sheet, related to the swap agreement was $13.7 million at December 31, 2002. This swap has been since inception and continues 22 to be, as of December 31, 2002, an effective hedge in accordance with SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." As of December 31, 2002, the total impact related to the change in characterization and the consolidation of VIE III, as compared to December 31, 2001, was an increase in gross property, plant and equipment, accumulated depreciation, long term debt, and interest expense of $98.7 million, $1.7 million, $98.7 million and $6.2 million, respectively. Additionally, we have recorded an additional derivative liability and deferred tax assets of $13.7 million and $5.0 million, respectively, and a charge to shareholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive items of $8.7 million as of December 31, 2002. See Notes 3, 4 and 5 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, as of December 31, 2002, we voluntarily guaranteed all of the at risk equity in the Other Variable Interest Entities. This resulted in our consolidating all of their assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2002, the total impact of consolidating the Other Variable Interest Entities was an increase of $103.9 million both in property, plant and equipment and long term debt. The underlying leases associated with the Other Variable Interest Entities were treated as operating leases from inception (as early as 1998) through consolidation on December 31, 2002. As a result, during the years ended December 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002, we recorded $4.8 million, $6.7 million and $5.9 million, respectively, in rent expense in our consolidated statements of operations related to these leases. On a prospective basis, we will be recording depreciation expense associated with the properties, interest expense associated with the real estate term loans and will no longer have rent expense related to leases associated with the Other Variable Interest Entities in our consolidated financial results. If the Other Variable Interest Entities had been consolidated in our historical financial statements as of January 1, 2002: (1) depreciation expense would have increased in an amount equal to $2.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002; and (2) rent expense for these properties would have been reclassified as interest expense in an amount equal to $5.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002. Consequently, our EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, operating income and interest expense would have increased by $5.9 million, $5.9 million, $3.9 million and $5.9 million, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002. In addition, net income before provision for income taxes would have decreased by $2.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002. In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 ("FIN 46"), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities," which addresses the financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities. FIN 46 addresses both unconsolidated variable interest entities and any new variable interest entities that are created subsequent to the issuance of the interpretation. As a result of the actions described above, as of December 31, 2002, we did not have any unconsolidated variable interest entities. Any future variable interest entities will be accounted for in accordance with FIN 46. Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives), and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on its balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (1) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment; (2) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction; or (3) a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation, an unrecognized firm commitment, an available for sale security, or a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as other comprehensive income which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive items included in 23 shareholders equity, assets and liabilities or earnings depending on the nature of such derivatives. See Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description of our derivative instruments. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. For cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For hedges of foreign currency the accounting treatment generally follows the treatment for cash flow hedges or fair value hedges depending on the nature of the foreign currency hedge. Although we apply some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is generally high. We had $35.3 million of interest rate risk management liabilities and had a corresponding amount for unrealized losses to other comprehensive income ($22.5 million, net of tax) related to cash flow hedges at December 31, 2002. One of our interest rate swaps was used to hedge interest rate risk on certain variable operating lease commitments. As a result of the December 31, 2002 consolidation of one of the Other Variable Interest Entities ("VIE I"), the operating lease commitments that were hedged by this swap are now considered to be inter company transactions and we determined that this hedge was no longer effective on a prospective basis. We have consolidated the real estate term loans of VIE I and we will prospectively record interest expense instead of rent expense as we make cash interest payments on this debt. The unrealized mark to market losses previously recorded in other comprehensive income attributable to this swap ($1.9 million, net of tax, as of December 31, 2002) will be amortized through other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statement of operations based on the changes in the fair value of the swap each period that the remaining interest payments are made on VIE Is external debt. We will prospectively account for mark to market changes in the derivative liability of this swap agreement through other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statement of operations. This accounting will have a net zero impact within our consolidated statement of operations as it relates to the amortization of unrealized mark to market losses and the fair valuing of the derivative liability. Accounting for Internal Use Software We develop various software applications for internal use. We account for those costs in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Position ("SOP") 98 1, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use." SOP 98 1 requires computer software costs associated with internal use software to be expensed as incurred until certain capitalization criteria are met. SOP 98 1 also defines which types of costs should be capitalized and which should be expensed. Payroll and related costs for employees who are directly associated with, and who devote time to, the development of internal use computer software projects, to the extent time is spent directly on the project, are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the software. Capitalization begins when the design stage of the application has been completed and it is probable that the project will be completed and used to perform the function intended. Depreciation begins when the software is placed in service. Computer software costs that are capitalized are evaluated for 24 impairment in accordance with SFAS No.144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." It may be necessary for us to write off amounts associated with the development of internal use software if the project cannot be completed as intended. Our expansion into new technology based service offerings requires the development of internal use software that will be susceptible to rapid and significant changes in technology. We may be required to write off unamortized costs or shorten the estimated useful life if an internal use software program is replaced with an alternative tool prior to the end of the softwares estimated useful life. General uncertainties related to expansion into digital businesses, including the timing of introduction and market acceptance of our services, may adversely impact the recoverability of these assets. See Note 2(f) to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we replaced one of our internal use software programs, which resulted in the write off to other (income) expense, net of the remaining net book value of $1.1 million. Deferred Income Taxes We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We have considered estimated future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the amount needed for the valuation allowance. If actual results differ unfavorably from those estimates used, we may not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets and additional valuation allowances may be required. Overview Our primary financial goal has always been, and continues to be, to increase consolidated Adjusted EBITDA in relation to capital invested, even as our focus has shifted from growth through acquisitions to internal revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA is a source of funds for investment in continued growth and for servicing indebtedness. We use Adjusted EBITDA as our internal measurement of financial performance and as the basis for allocating resources to our internal operating segments. In addition, substantially all of our financing agreements contain covenants in which Adjusted EBITDA based calculations are used as a measure of financial performance for financial ratio purposes. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA based calculations are used by the holders of our publicly issued debt as important criteria for evaluating our business and, as a result, all of our bond indentures contain covenants in which Adjusted EBITDA based calculations are used as the primary measure of financial performance. However, you should not consider EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA to be substitutes for operating or net income (as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP) as indicators of our performance or for cash flow from operations (as determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of liquidity. After March 28, 2003 we will no longer present Adjusted EBITDA in our public filings in compliance with SEC regulations. Effective July 1, 2001 and January 1, 2002, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 141 and SFAS No. 142. SFAS No. 141 requires all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using the purchase method. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives. Had SFAS No. 142 been effective January 1, 2000, goodwill amortization expense would have been reduced by $53.4 million and $59.2 million ($44.8 million and $50.9 million, net of tax) for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001, respectively. See Note 2(g) to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our revenues consist of storage revenues as well as service and storage material sales revenues. Storage revenues consist of periodic charges related to the storage of materials (either on a per unit or 25 per cubic foot of records basis) and have accounted for approximately 58% of total consolidated revenues in each of the last five years. In certain circumstances, based upon customer requirements, storage revenues include periodic charges associated with normal, recurring service activities. Service and storage material sales revenues are comprised of charges for related service activities and courier operations and the sale of storage materials. Related service revenues arise from additions of new records, temporary removal of records from storage, refiling of removed records, destructions of records, permanent withdrawals from storage and other complementary and auxiliary services, and sales of specially designed storage containers, magnetic media including computer tapes and related supplies. Courier operations consist primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request. Customers are generally billed on a monthly basis on contractually agreed upon terms. Cost of sales (excluding depreciation) consists primarily of wages and benefits for field personnel, facility occupancy costs including rent and utilities, transportation expenses including vehicle leases and fuel, other product cost of sales and other equipment costs and supplies. Of these, wages and benefits and facility occupancy costs are the most significant. The expansion of our secure shredding operations has resulted in changes to the mix of certain cost of sales components. Our secure shredding operations are more labor intensive, therefore, our labor expense will be higher as a percentage of revenue as compared to our traditional operations. In addition, our secure shredding operations incur higher transportation costs and lower facility costs, respectively, as a percentage of revenue, as compared to our traditional operations. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits for management, administrative, information technology, sales, account management and marketing personnel, as well as expenses related to communications and data processing, travel, professional fees, bad debts, training, office equipment and supplies. Our depreciation and amortization charges result primarily from the capital intensive nature of our business. The principal components of depreciation relate to storage systems, which include racking, building improvements and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and software, and new buildings. Amortization relates primarily to customer relationships and acquisition costs. Reclassifications and Changes in Presentation Previously, certain product revenues related to our off site data protection segment were recorded net of product costs. During the fourth quarter of 2002, we determined that it was more appropriate to record these revenues and costs on the gross rather than net basis. We have reflected this change in all applicable tables and discussions for all periods presented within the following discussion of results of operations. Gross profit, operating income, net income (loss), EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and cash flows were not impacted by this change. We have updated our presentation of segment results to report our operations in Canada, previously analyzed as part of our International segment, and now analyzed within the Business Records Management segment. All applicable tables and discussions have been updated to reflect this change in all periods presented within the following discussion of results of operations. See Note 12 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In an effort to further our objective of transparent reporting, our discussion of results for years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 has been expanded to provide what we believe is more meaningful detail and analysis. These periods represent the first two full years of operations subsequent to the merger with Pierce Leahy. As we have integrated Pierce Leahy and several other significant acquisitions we have improved our data collection systems, resulting in our ability to provide greater insight regarding our operations. 26 Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, information derived from our consolidated statements of operations, expressed as a percentage of total consolidated revenues.

This increase was principally a result of internal revenue growth, which for the year ended December 31, 2002 was 9.5%, comprised of 8.4% for storage revenue and 11.1% for service and storage material sales revenue. We calculate internal revenue growth in local currency for our international operations. Consolidated storage revenues increased $65.1 million, or 9.4%, to $759.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase was primarily attributable to internal revenue growth of 8.4% resulting from net increases in records and other media stored by existing customers and sales to new customers. The net effect of foreign currency translation on storage revenues was a decrease in revenue of $2.4 million. This was a result of a weakening of the Argentine peso, the Canadian dollar, and the Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar, offset by a strengthening of the British pound sterling and the Euro against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. Consolidated service and storage material sales revenues increased $67.7 million, or 13.8%, to $559.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase was primarily attributable to internal revenue growth of 11.1% resulting from net increases in service and storage material sales to existing customers and sales to new customers. The net effect of foreign currency translation on service and storage material sales revenues was a decrease in revenue of $0.7 million. This was a result of a weakening of the Argentine peso, the Canadian dollar, and the Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar, offset by a strengthening of the British pound sterling and the Euro against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. Internal Growth Eight Quarter Trend 2001 2002 First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Full Year First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Full Year Storage Revenue 12.7% 11.5% 10.9% 9.6% 11.1% 8.4% 8.6% 8.6% 8.0% 8.4% Service and Storage Material Sales Revenue 8.7% 8.7% 5.1% 10.6% 8.4% 9.1% 10.0% 15.4% 9.8% 11.1% Total Revenue 11.0% 10.3% 8.5% 10.0% 10.0% 8.7% 9.2% 11.4% 8.8% 9.5% The consecutive quarter storage revenue internal growth trend over the last eight quarters, as calculated quarterly comparing the current quarter to the applicable quarter in the prior year, is primarily attributable to a decline in the rate at which customers have added new cartons to their inventory, which may be a result of current economic conditions. However, we have not seen a decline in the duration that our customers maintain their cartons in inventory nor an increase in the rate of cartons destroyed or permanently removed from inventory as a percentage of the total population. In addition, growth from new sales was adversely affected in 2001 and 2002 as a result of the disruption caused by the merging of our sales force with that of Pierce Leahy in 2000. The sales force reorganization has been completed and growth from new sales has begun to increase. Service and storage material sales revenue internal growth is subject to fluctuations in the timing of non recurring service projects ordered by customers and in some cases can be affected by delays or cancellations as some customers seek to reduce short term costs. During 2002, we benefited from a number of large non recurring service projects in North America and Europe. While we expect to realize revenue associated with these and similar projects in 2003, it will be difficult to replace all of these projects. The volatility in the service revenue growth for the third and fourth quarters of 2001 and 2002 is primarily due to a disruption in the normal pattern of services we provide to our customers 30 following the events of September 11, 2001 and the resulting shift of some services and related revenue, to the fourth quarter of 2001. This caused a favorable comparison for the service revenue growth rate in the third quarter of 2002 and a difficult comparison in the fourth quarter of 2002. Cost of Sales Consolidated cost of sales (excluding depreciation) is comprised of the following expenses: % of Consolidated Revenues 2001 2002 Dollar Change Percent Change 2001 2002 Percent Change (Favorable)/ Unfavorable (In Thousands) Labor $ 286,951 $ 318,707 $ 31,756 11.1 % 24.2 % 24.2 % (0.0 )% Facilities 173,610 184,988 11,378 6.6 % 14.6 % 14.0 % (0.6 )% Transportation 55,167 56,972 1,805 3.3 % 4.7 % 4.3 % (0.4 )% Product Cost of Sales 31,363 34,552 3,189 10.2 % 2.6 % 2.6 % (0.0 )% Other 29,447 27,080 (2,367 ) (8.0 %) 2.5 % 2.1 % (0.4 )% $ 576,538 $ 622,299 $ 45,761 7.9 % 48.6 % 47.2 % (1.4 )% Labor The dollar increase in labor expense is primarily attributable to increases in headcount and changes in our labor mix resulting from the expansion of our secure shredding operations. Our secure shredding operations are more labor intensive, therefore, labor expense will be higher as a percentage of revenue as compared to our traditional operations. In 2002, this impact was mitigated by improved labor management in our off site data protection segment. In addition, our domestic operations, which comprise approximately 75% of our workforce, experienced an overall increase in wages due to normal inflation, merit increases and significant increases in medical insurance and workers compensation expenses of approximately $12.0 million. The majority of these increases are attributable to higher premiums and self insurance requirements. Facilities Our property management activities combined with a higher utilization of our space has driven the decrease of our facilities expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues from 14.6% in 2001 to 14.0% in 2002. The largest component of our facilities cost is rent expense, which decreased $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. We reduced the number of leased facilities we occupy by 23 in 2002 primarily through the consolidation of our property portfolio as we exited less desirable facilities and consolidated our remaining properties subsequent to the Pierce Leahy merger. The decrease in leased properties is also a result of the recharacterization of eight properties under synthetic lease facilities at the end of 2001, which are now consolidated on our balance sheet at the end of 2002. During 2001 and 2002, we recorded $1.8 million and $0.0 million of rent expense for these eight properties, respectively. An additional 23 properties under our synthetic leases facilities were consolidated as of December 31, 2002; however, they were accounted for as operating leases during 2002 and their costs were included in rent expense. For the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2002, we recorded rent expense of $6.7 million and $5.9 million, respectively, on these 23 properties and we will prospectively record the rent expense as interest expense beginning in 2003. The dollar increase in facilities expenses is attributable to property insurance, which increased $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to the year ended December 31, 2001. The market wide increase in property insurance premiums in the wake of the events of September 11, 31 2001, in addition to experience based annual premium adjustments, resulted in this dramatic increase. Increased rent and facilities expenses in our European operations of $4.6 million and higher domestic property taxes of $1.8 million have also contributed to the dollar increase in facilities expenses. Transportation Our transportation expenses are influenced by several variables including total number of vehicles, owned versus leased vehicles, use of subcontracted couriers, fuel expenses, and maintenance. For the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 our fleet of vehicles used in operations totaled 2,140 and 2,032, respectively, of which 1,429 and 1,269, respectively, were under operating leases. The net increase in vehicles is primarily attributable to an increase of 40 vehicles in our secure shredding division that were either acquired through acquisitions or added to support growth in the business. We reduced our operating lease expense by $0.6 million during 2002 as a result of our fleet leasing program, which has benefited from an overall reduction in interest rates and our improving credit rating. The results of our ongoing transportation efficiency projects and the completion of our conversions to the SafeKeeper Plus&reg; system have been significant in reducing transportation expenses, including fuel and outside courier fees, as a percentage of consolidated revenues. In 2002 we had an overall reduction in fuel consumption and a decrease in fuel expense of $0.4 million in spite of an average increase in the price per gallon of fuel during 2002. We also benefited from a $0.9 million decline in subcontracted courier expenses, which we believe is the result of better management of internal transportation resources. Our improvements in transportation have been partially offset by increased vehicle insurance and repair costs of $0.7 million and $0.9 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2002 over the year ended December 31, 2001, as a result of the increased size of our fleet. We experienced a $2.0 million increase in transportation expenses in our European operations, which is primarily attributable to the growth of operations and is also impacted by the weakening of the U.S. dollar in comparison to the British pound sterling in 2002 versus 2001. Product Cost of Sales and Other Cost of Sales Product and other cost of sales are highly correlated to complementary revenue streams. Product cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2002 was consistent with the year ended December 31, 2001 as a percentage of product revenues. The decrease in other cost of sales of $2.4 million is directly attributable to decreases in variable expenses from our changing mix of complementary services and will vary as our mix of special projects changes from period to period. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses are comprised of the following expenses: % of Consolidated Revenues 2001 2002 Dollar Change Percent Change 2001 2002 Percent Change (Favorable)/ Unfavorable (In Thousands) General and Administrative $ 193,966 $ 202,291 $ 8,325 4.3 % 16.4 % 15.3 % (1.0 )% Sales and Marketing 48,580 57,198 8,618 17.7 % 4.1 % 4.3 % 0.2 % Information Technology 48,663 52,236 3,573 7.3 % 4.1 % 4.0 % (0.1 )% Bad Debt Expense 10,334 11,533 1,199 11.6 % 0.9 % 0.9 % 0.0 % Digital 5,391 9,074 3,683 68.3 % 0.5 % 0.7 % 0.2 % $ 306,934 $ 332,332 $ 25,398 8.3 % 25.9 % 25.2 % (0.7 )% 32 General and Administrative The dollar increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to an increase in professional fees, office facilities, telephone, and supplies expenses. However, these costs were consistent with the increasing scale of our business, as indicated by the decrease of 1.4% as a percentage of consolidated revenues. Increased overhead leverage offset an increase in wages due to normal inflation and merit increases. Sales and Marketing The majority of our sales and marketing costs are labor related and are primarily driven by the headcount in each of these departments. Increased headcount and commissions are the most significant contributors to the increase in sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002. Throughout 2002, we continued to invest in the expansion and improvement of our sales force. We added approximately 60 new sales and marketing employees since December 31, 2001, a 15% increase in headcount. Information Technology Information technology expenses increased $3.6 million, or 7.3%, to $52.2 million (4.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2002 principally due to increased compensation costs as a result of increased headcount and normal inflation and merit increases, as well as, a decrease in capitalizable projects. Additionally, these costs were offset by savings of $1.7 million realized through improved management of information technology telecommunication expenses and a reduction of $1.1 million of information technology equipment lease expenses. Bad Debt Expense Consolidated bad debt expense increased $1.2 million, or 11.6%, to $11.5 million (0.9% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2002. Our projects to centralize collection efforts within our divisions have contributed significantly to holding bad debt expense flat as a percentage of consolidated revenues. Digital Expenses associated with our digital initiatives increased $3.7 million, or 68.3%, to $9.1 million (0.7% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2002 principally due to increases in information technology professionals and sales staff. Depreciation, Amortization, and Merger Related Expenses Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense decreased $43.8 million, or 28.5%, to $109.8 million (8.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $153.6 million (13.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2001. Depreciation expense increased $17.6 million, primarily due to the additional depreciation expense related to capital expenditures, including storage systems, which include racking, building improvements and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and software, and new buildings, and depreciation associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases. Depreciation associated with our digital initiatives increased $3.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2002 as a result of software and hardware assets placed in service during late 2001 and throughout 2002. In 2002, the recharacterization of eight properties added in 2001 under one of our synthetic lease programs, as well as nine properties added to such program in 2002, resulted in $1.7 million of additional depreciation. Amortization expense decreased $61.3 million, primarily due to eliminating amortization expense related to goodwill 33 in accordance with SFAS No. 142. See Note 2(g) to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and " Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for Acquisitions." Merger related expenses are certain expenses directly related to our merger with Pierce Leahy that cannot be capitalized and include system conversion costs, costs of exiting certain facilities, severance, relocation and pay to stay payments and other transaction related costs. Merger related expenses were $0.8 million (0.1% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended 2002 compared to $3.7 million (0.3% of consolidated revenues) for the same period of 2001. All merger related activities associated with the Pierce Leahy merger were completed in 2002. Interest Expense, Net Consolidated interest expense, net increased $1.9 million, or 1.4%, to $136.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $134.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. This increase was primarily attributable to $6.2 million of interest expense associated with 17 properties within one of our synthetic lease facilities and increased long term borrowings through our 2001 bond offerings. These increases were offset by a decline in our overall weighted average interest rate resulting from a general decline in interest rates coupled with our refinancing efforts. Other (Income) Expense, Net Consolidated other income, net was $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to other expense, net of $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Significant items included in other (income) expense, net include the following: 2001 2002 Change (In Thousands) Foreign currency transaction (gains) and losses $ 10,437 $ (5,043 ) $ (15,480 ) Loss on investments 6,900 827 (6,073 ) Other, net 1,034 865 (169 ) $ 18,371 $ (3,351 ) $ (21,722 ) Foreign currency gains of $5.0 million based on period end exchange rates were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2002 primarily due to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar and British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar as these currencies relate to our intercompany balances with our Canadian and European subsidiaries. During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Canadian dollar had weakened compared to the U.S. dollar and was the primary reason for the foreign currency loss of $10.4 million, based on period end exchange rates. The loss on investments is the result of a $6.9 million impairment charge taken on our investment in convertible preferred stock of a technology development company in the third quarter of 2001. In 2002, we recorded $0.9 million of similar write downs. The decrease in loss on investments is also attributable to a gain of $2.1 million recorded on the sale of a property held by one of our European subsidiaries during the second quarter of 2002 offset by losses recorded on disposals of software and write downs of assets held for sale of $1.1 million and $0.9 million, respectively. No such gains or losses were recorded in 2001. Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes was $49.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to $26.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The effective rate was 41.1% for the year ended December 31, 2002 and the primary reconciling item between the statutory rate of 35% and the effective rate is state income taxes (net of federal benefit). The effective rate was (320.2%) for the year ended December 31, 2001. During 2001, we amortized non deductible goodwill for book purposes, however, as result of the adoption of SFAS No. 142 in 2002, goodwill amortization ceased, thereby 34 reducing the effective rate and some of the volatility with respect to our effective rate in the future. Additionally, the 2001 effective rate was impacted by state income taxes (net of federal benefit). There may be future volatility with respect to our effective rate related to items including unusual unforecasted permanent items, significant changes in tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the need for additional valuation allowances. Also, as a result of our net operating loss carryforwards, we do not expect to pay any significant federal and state income taxes in the next three years. Minority Interest, Discontinued Operations, Extraordinary Charges, and Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle Minority interest in earnings of subsidiaries resulted in a charge to income of $3.6 million (0.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2002. This represents our minority partners share of earnings (losses) in our majority owned international subsidiaries that are consolidated in our operating results. In 2001, our subsidiaries incurred losses and the minority interest resulted in a credit to income of $1.9 million. The improved results are primarily a result of (1) the elimination of goodwill amortization expense in accordance with SFAS No. 142, (2) increased profitability in our European business and (3) our European minority partners share ($0.7 million, net of tax) of the $2.1 million gain recorded on the sale of a property held by one of our European subsidiaries during the second quarter of 2002. In the fourth quarter of 2002, we recorded income from discontinued operations of $1.1 million (net of tax of $0.8 million) as a result of resolving several outstanding contingencies remaining from the sale of the Arcus Staffing Resources, Inc. business unit in 1999. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we recorded an extraordinary charge of $0.8 million (net of tax benefit of $0.4 million) related to the early retirement of debt in conjunction with the refinancing of our credit facility and in the fourth quarter of 2002 we recorded an extraordinary charge of $2.7 million (net of tax benefit of $1.5 million) related to the early retirement of a portion of our 91/8% senior subordinated notes in conjunction with our underwritten public offering of the 73/4% senior subordinated notes. For the year ended December 31, 2001, we recorded an extraordinary charge of $11.8 million (net of tax benefit of $8.2 million) related to the early retirement of the 111/8% and 101/8% senior subordinated notes in conjunction with our underwritten public offerings of the 85/8% senior subordinated notes. The charges consisted primarily of the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs and call and tender premiums associated with the extinguished debt. In January 2003, we redeemed the remaining outstanding principal amount of our 91/8% notes resulting in a charge of $1.2 million (net of tax benefit of $0.7 million) in the first quarter of 2003 related to the early retirement of these remaining 91/8% notes. We will record this charge to other (income) expense, net in accordance with recent changes in accounting requirements. In the first quarter of 2002, we recorded a non cash charge for the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of $6.4 million (net of minority interest of $8.5 million) as a result of our implementation of SFAS No. 142. There was no such charge in 2001. Net Income (Loss) As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated net income increased $102.3 million, or 232.3%, to $58.3 (4.4% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2002 from a net loss of $44.1 (3.7% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2001. Adjusted EBITDA As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated Adjusted EBITDA increased $61.6 million, or 20.4%, to $363.9 million (27.6% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $302.2 million (25.5% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2001. Excluding the 35 $8.1 million of development costs, net of recorded revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2002 and $5.4 million of development costs, net of recorded revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2001 related to our new technology related service offerings, Adjusted EBITDA margins were 28.2% and 25.9% for the year ended December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001, respectively. Segment Analysis Business Records Management Off Site Data Protection International Corporate & Other Total Consolidated (In Thousands) Segment Revenue Year Ended December 31, 2002 $ 908,189 $ 233,834 $ 109,381 $ 67,093 $ 1,318,497 December 31, 2001 837,994 205,134 89,475 53,115 1,185,718 Increase in Revenues $ 70,195 $ 28,700 $ 19,906 $ 13,978 $ 132,779 Percentage Increase in Revenues 8.4 % 14.0 % 22.2 % 26.3 % 11.2 % Segment Adjusted EBITDA Year Ended December 31, 2002 $ 258,229 $ 61,542 $ 21,988 $ 22,107 $ 363,866 December 31, 2001 227,769 49,804 16,250 8,423 302,246 Segment Adjusted EBITDA as a Percentage of Segment Revenue Year Ended December 31, 2002 28.4 % 26.3 % 20.1 % 32.9 % 27.6 % December 31, 2001 27.2 % 24.3 % 18.2 % 15.9 % 25.5 % Revenue in our business records management segment increased 8.4% primarily due to increased storage revenues, strong special projects revenues and acquisitions. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA as a percent of segment revenue for our business records management segment is primarily due to labor and transportation efficiencies gained by the increasing scale of our business and the completion of our integration of Pierce Leahy. Lower facilities expenditures, including rent expense and utilities, and lower bad debt expense resulting from our improved collection efforts also contributed to the improvement of Adjusted EBITDA, as a percentage of segment revenue. This increase was partially offset by higher insurance premiums for property and casualty insurance and an increased investment in our sales force. Reductions in spending related to telecommunication expenditures, as a percentage of segment revenue, also contributed to increasing Adjusted EBITDA. Revenue in our off site data protection segment increased 14.0% primarily due to internal revenue growth from both existing and new customers. Adjusted EBITDA as a percent of segment revenue for our off site data protection segment increased primarily due to improved labor and transportation management. This increase was partially offset by higher insurance premiums for property and casualty insurance and an increase in bad debt expense. Revenue in our international segment increased primarily due to increased sales efforts and a large service project in the United Kingdom, as well as, acquisitions completed in Europe and South America in the fourth quarter of 2002. Adjusted EBITDA as a percent of segment revenue for our international segment increased primarily due to improved gross margins from our European operations and reduced bad debt expense. This increase was partially offset by higher insurance premiums for property and casualty insurance and reduced margins in our South American operations due to the deteriorating local economic conditions and devaluation of the currency in Argentina. 36 Unfavorable currency fluctuations in South America during 2002 reduced revenues, as measured in U.S. dollars, by $5.0 million during the year ending December 31, 2002. This reduction was offset by the impact of favorable currency fluctuations during 2002 in Europe that increased revenue $2.9 million when compared to the prior year rates.

Internal revenue growth for the year ended December 31, 2001 was 10.0%, comprised of 11.1% for storage revenue and 8.4% for service and storage material sales revenues. We calculate internal revenue growth in local currency for our international operations and as if Pierce Leahy had merged with us on January 1, 2000. Consolidated storage revenues increased $108.8 million, or 18.6%, to $694.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $585.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase was primarily attributable to: (1) internal revenue growth of 11.1% resulting primarily from net increases in records and other media stored by existing customers and sales to new customers; and (2) acquisitions, particularly the inclusion of Pierce Leahys revenue for twelve months of 2001 versus eleven months of 2000. The total increase in storage revenues was partially offset by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation of $3.8 million as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against certain currencies, primarily the Canadian dollar and the British pound sterling. Consolidated service and storage material sales revenues increased $72.7 million, or 17.4%, to $491.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $418.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase was primarily attributable to: (1) internal revenue growth of 8.4% resulting primarily from net increases in service and storage material sales to existing customers and sales to new customers; and (2) acquisitions, particularly the inclusion of Pierce Leahys revenue for twelve months of 2001 versus eleven months of 2000. The total increase in service and storage material sales revenues was partially offset by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation of $3.3 million as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against certain currencies, primarily the Canadian dollar and the British pound sterling. Consolidated cost of sales (excluding depreciation) increased $76.0 million, or 15.2%, to $576.5 million (48.6% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $500.6 million (49.8% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2000. The dollar increase was primarily attributable to the required costs to support our revenue growth and was partially offset by operating efficiencies at our U.S. and Canadian operations, particularly related to the decrease in rent as a percent of consolidated revenue of 0.7% offset by a 0.2% increase in other facilities costs as a percent of consolidated revenues and a 0.2% increase in utility expenses (primarily, 38 gas and oil charges) as a percent of consolidated revenues. In our U.S. and Canadian operations, facility costs increased $22.1 million and labor costs increased $33.7 million, which represented a decrease of 0.2% and 0.6% of consolidated revenues, respectively. The decrease as a percent of consolidated revenues was offset by relatively lower gross margins in our emerging secure shredding services business, which increased cost of sales by 0.9% of consolidated revenues. Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses increased $60.4 million, or 24.5%, to $306.9 million (25.9% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $246.6 million (24.6% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2000. The dollar increase was primarily attributable to the required costs to support our revenue growth, while the increase as a percent of consolidated revenues was primarily attributable to: (1) higher overhead levels in our emerging secure shredding services business (an increase of 0.6% of consolidated revenues) and our Latin American and European operations (an increase of 0.4% of consolidated revenues); (2) higher data communications costs resulting from network deployment and migration activities (an increase of 0.4% of consolidated revenues); and (3) expenditures for our marketing and information technology initiatives related to the development of complementary technology based service offerings (an increase of 0.5% of consolidated revenues). These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts for our U.S. and Canadian operations (a decrease of 0.3% of consolidated revenues). Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased $26.8 million, or 21.1%, to $153.6 million (13.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $126.8 million (12.6% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2000. Depreciation expense increased $20.3 million, primarily due to the additional depreciation expense related to the 2000 and 2001 acquisitions, particularly the inclusion of Pierce Leahys depreciation expense for twelve months of 2001 versus eleven months of 2000 and capital expenditures including storage systems, information systems and expansion of storage capacity in existing facilities. Amortization expense increased $6.4 million, primarily due to the additional amortization expense related to the goodwill generated by our 2000 and 2001 acquisitions completed prior to July 1, 2001, particularly Pierce Leahy. Stock option compensation expense of $15.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 represents a non cash charge resulting from the acceleration and extension of previously granted stock options as a part of separation agreements with certain executives. There were no such costs for the year ended December 31, 2001. Merger related expenses are certain expenses directly related to our merger with Pierce Leahy that cannot be capitalized and include system conversion costs, costs of exiting certain facilities, severance, relocation and pay to stay payments and other transaction related costs. Merger related expenses were $3.7 million (0.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $9.1 million (0.9% of consolidated revenues) for the same period of 2000. As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated operating income increased $39.0 million, or 36.8%, to $145.0 million (12.2% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $106.0 million (10.6% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2000. Consolidated interest expense increased $16.8 million, or 14.2%, to $134.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $118.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase was primarily attributable to increased indebtedness related to: (1) $19.6 million of interest expense on the 85/8% senior subordinated notes due 2013, or the 85/8% notes, which were issued in April and September 2001; (2) the inclusion of term debt related to our credit facility for twelve months versus five months of 2000 resulting in an increase of $6.2 million; and (3) the inclusion of Pierce Leahys debt for twelve months of 2001 versus eleven months of 2000 resulting in an increase of $4.7 million. These increases were partially offset by reduced interest expense of $11.8 million due to the retirement 39 of our 111/8% and 101/8% senior subordinated notes as well as a decline in the weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt. Consolidated other expense, net was $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The change was partially due to a $6.9 million impairment charge taken on our investment in convertible preferred stock of a technology development company. Additionally, we recorded a non cash foreign currency loss of $10.4 million, primarily due to the effect of further weakening of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar for the year ended December 31, 2001, versus the same period of 2000, as it relates to Iron Mountain Canada Corporations 81/8% senior notes due 2008, or the 81/8% notes, and the intercompany balances with our Canadian and European subsidiaries. In 2000, this amount was $6.3 million. As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated loss from continuing operations before provision for income taxes and minority interests decreased $9.9 million to $8.1 million (0.7% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $18.0 million (1.8% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2000. The provision for income taxes was $26.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. For the year ended December 31, 2001, we recorded approximately $38.9 million of nondeductible goodwill amortization expense. Consolidated loss from continuing operations before extraordinary charges increased $7.3 million to $32.2 million (2.7% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $24.9 million (2.5% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2000. In 2001, we recorded an extraordinary charge of $11.8 million (net of tax benefit of $8.2 million) related to the early retirement of our 111/8% and 101/8% notes in conjunction with our underwritten public offerings of the 85/8% notes. In 2000, we recorded an extraordinary charge of $2.9 million (net of tax benefit of $1.9 million) related to the early extinguishment of debt in conjunction with the refinancing of our senior credit facility. The charges primarily represented call and tender premiums and the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the extinguished debt. As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated Adjusted EBITDA increased $45.2 million, or 17.6%, to $302.2 million (25.5% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2001 from $257.0 million (25.6% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2000. Excluding the $5.4 million of expenses (0.5% of consolidated revenues) related to the development of our new technology related service offerings, our Adjusted EBITDA margin for the year ended December 31, 2001 was 25.9% of consolidated revenues. There were no such costs in the same period of 2000. Adjusted EBITDA as a percent of segment revenue for our business records management segment decreased from 27.3% to 27.2%, primarily due to: (1) increases in cost of sales associated with other facility costs, including utilities and property insurance; (2) increases in selling, general and administrative expenses as a result of divisionalization; (3) higher data communications costs resulting from network deployment and migration activities; and (4) an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts. This decrease was partially offset by increases in gross margin driven by real estate management and labor efficiencies obtained as a result of an increase in scale. Adjusted EBITDA as a percent of segment revenue for our off site data protection segment increased from 22.7% to 24.3% primarily due to an increase in gross margin as a result of improved labor, transportation and real estate management, as well as the contribution from the segments acquisition of two higher margin escrow businesses. This increase was partially offset by: (1) the decentralization of various overhead functions; (2) an increase in spending for sales and marketing; and (3) a decrease in contribution from the segments higher margin complementary services due to the relatively slower growth in revenue for those services. 40  The Adjusted EBITDA margin for our international segment increased from 16.5% to 18.2% primarily due to improved margins from our European and Latin American operations. This increase was partially offset by an increase of $0.7 million in the provision for doubtful accounts at our European operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following is a summary of our cash balances and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002 (in millions). 2000 2001 2002 Cash flows provided by operating activities $ 157.6 $ 160.9 $ 254.9 Cash flows used in investing activities (327.6 ) (278.1 ) (247.8 ) Cash flows provided by financing activities 172.4 134.9 27.1 Cash and cash equivalents at the end of year $ 6.2 $ 21.4 $ 56.3 Net cash provided by operating activities was $254.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to $160.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in operating income and working capital improvements primarily associated with accounts receivable collections. We have made significant capital investments, including: (1) capital expenditures, primarily related to growth, including investments in storage systems and information systems and discretionary investments in real estate; (2) acquisitions; and (3) customer relationship and acquisition costs. Cash paid for these investments during the year ended December 31, 2002 amounted to $197.0 million, $49.4 million and $8.4 million, respectively. These investments have been funded primarily through cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. In addition, we received proceeds from sales of property and equipment of $7.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2002. Included in capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2002 is $15.3 million related to our technology based service offerings. Excluding any potential acquisitions, we expect to invest between $190.0 million and $215.0 million on capital expenditures in 2003. Included in cash paid for acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2002 is a $7.2 million contingent payment that was paid during the third quarter of 2002 related to an acquisition made in 2000. Net cash provided by financing activities was $27.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, consisting primarily of net proceeds from the issuance of the 73/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2015 of $99.0 million and borrowings under our credit facilities of $188.8 million, offset by the net repayment of term loans of $99.0 million, the early retirement of 91/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2007 totaling $54.4 million, and the repayment of debt under our credit facilities and other debt of $113.2 million. Since December 31, 2002, we completed three acquisitions for total consideration, including related real estate, of approximately $16.8 million. These transactions will be reflected in our consolidated statement of cash flows in the first quarter of 2003. 41 We are highly leveraged and expect to continue to be highly leveraged for the foreseeable future. Our consolidated debt as of December 31, 2002 was comprised of the following: Revolving Credit Facility due 2005 $ 75,360 Term Loan due 2008 249,750 91/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2007 (the "91/8% notes") 22,409 81/8% Senior Notes due 2008 (the "Subsidiary notes") 124,666 83/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2009 (the "83/4% notes") 249,727 81/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011 (the "81/4% notes") 149,625 85/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013 (the "85/8% notes") 481,097 73/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2015 (the "73/4% notes") 100,000 Real Estate Term Loans 202,647 Real Estate Mortgages 16,262 Seller Notes 12,864 Other 47,690 Long term Debt 1,732,097 Less Current Portion (69,732 ) Long term Debt, Net of Current Portion $ 1,662,365 The indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants including covenants that restrict our ability to complete acquisitions, pay cash dividends, incur indebtedness, make investments, sell assets and take certain other corporate actions. The covenants do not contain a rating trigger. Therefore, a change in our debt rating would not trigger a default under our indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of December 31, 2002. Our key bond leverage ratio of indebtedness to Adjusted EBITDA, as calculated per our bond indenture agreements, decreased from 5.2 as of December 31, 2001 to 4.8 as of December 31, 2002. Our calculation of the ratio as of December 31, 2002 included our real estate term loans associated with our synthetic lease facilities. Our target for this ratio is generally in the range of 4.5 to 5.5. Our ability to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, working capital levels and capital structure, which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors which may be beyond our control. There can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future financings will be available on acceptable terms or in amounts sufficient to enable us to service or refinance our indebtedness, or to make necessary capital expenditures. On March 15, 2002, we entered into the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement replaced our prior credit agreement. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement has an aggregate principal amount of $650.0 million and includes a $400.0 million revolving credit facility, which includes the ability to borrow in certain foreign currencies, and a $250.0 million term loan facility. The revolving credit facility matures on January 31, 2005. Quarterly term loan payments of $0.3 million began in the fourth quarter of 2002 and will continue through maturity on February 15, 2008, at which time the remaining outstanding principal balance on the term loan facility is due. The interest rate on borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement varies depending on our choice of interest rate and currency options, plus an applicable margin. The margin applicable to the term loan under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement is lower than the margin applicable to term loans under our prior credit agreement and has resulted in reduced interest expense on our borrowings as compared to the previous credit agreement. All intercompany notes and the capital stock of all of our domestic subsidiaries are pledged to secure the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2002, we had $75.4 million of 42 borrowings under our revolving credit facility, all of which was denominated in Canadian dollars in the amount of CAD 118.8 million. We also had various outstanding letters of credit totaling $35.9 million. The remaining availability under the revolving credit facility was $288.7 million as of December 31, 2002 and the interest rates in effect ranged from 3.69% to 5.03% as of December 31, 2002. On November 8, 2002, we completed an exchange of 85/8% notes for 91/8% notes at an exchange ratio of 1.0237. This resulted in the issuance of $45.9 million in face value of our 85/8% notes and the retirement of $44.8 million of our 91/8% notes. This non cash debt exchange resulted in carryover basis and, therefore, no gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt in accordance with EITF No. 96 19, "Debtors Accounting for Modification or Exchange of Debt Instruments." In December 2002, we completed an underwritten public offering of $100.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 73/4% notes. The 73/4% notes were issued at a price to investors of 100% of par. Our net proceeds of $99.0 million, after paying the underwriters discounts and commissions, were used to fund our offer to purchase and consent solicitation relating to our outstanding 91/8% notes, to repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. In December 2002, we received and accepted tenders for $52.0 million of the $75.2 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 91/8% notes, at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) of 104.563%. We recorded an extraordinary charge of $2.7 million (net of tax benefit of $1.5 million) in the fourth quarter of 2002 related to the early retirement of the 91/8% notes. In January 2003, we redeemed the remaining $23.2 million of outstanding principal amount of our 91/8% notes, at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) of 104.563%, plus accrued and unpaid interest, totaling $25.3 million. We will record a charge to other (income) expense, net of $1.2 million (net of tax benefit of $0.7 million) in the first quarter of 2003 related to the early retirement of these remaining 91/8% notes. In March 2003, we completed two exchanges of our 73/4% notes for 83/4% notes. The exchanges resulted in the issuance of $31.3 million in face value of our 73/4% notes and the retirement of $30.0 million of our 83/4% notes. These non cash debt exchanges resulted in carryover basis and, therefore, no gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt in accordance with EITF No. 96 19. These exchanges result in a lower interest rate and, therefore, lower interest expense in future periods, as well as, extend the maturity of our debt obligations. From time to time, we may enter into similar exchange transactions that we deem appropriate. The real estate term loans held by our Variable Interest Entities have always been and continue to be treated as indebtedness for purposes of our financial covenants under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. As of the date they were consolidated into our financial statements, they were considered indebtedness under our Indentures for our Senior Subordinated Notes and our Subsidiary notes. As of December 31, 2002, these real estate term loans amounted to $202.6 million. No further financing is currently available to our Variable Interest Entities to fund further property acquisitions. See Notes 3, 4 and 5 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and " Critical Accounting Policies." The details of each real estate term loan is a follows: A $47.5 million real estate term note issued in October, 1998 bearing interest at various variable interest rates based on LIBOR (London Inter Bank Offered Rate) plus an applicable margin. This real estate term note has a principal payment due on March 31, 2004 of $28.8 million with the remaining $18.7 million maturing on March 31, 2005. A $56.4 million real estate term note issued in July, 1999 bearing interest at various variable interest rates based on LIBOR plus an applicable margin. This real estate term note matures on December 31, 2005. 43 A $98.7 million real estate term note issued in May, 2001 bearing interest at various variable interest rates based on LIBOR plus an applicable margin. This real estate term note matures on November 22, 2007. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2002 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years (in millions): Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 Years Long term Debt $ 1,741.3 $ 70.5 $ 191.6 $ 108.5 $ 1,370.7 Operating Lease Obligations 775.1 125.1 217.4 152.4 280.2 Deferred Tax Liabilities 166.7 166.7 Total $ 2,683.1 $ 195.6 $ 409.0 $ 260.9 $ 1,817.6 We expect to meet our cash flow requirements for the next twelve months from cash generated from operations, existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and other financings, which may include secured credit facilities, securitizations and mortgage or capital lease financings. See Notes 5, 10 and 13 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Net Operating Loss Carryforwards At December 31, 2002, we had estimated net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $162 million for federal income tax purposes. As a result of such loss carryforwards, cash paid for income taxes has historically been substantially lower than the provision for income taxes. These net operating loss carryforwards do not include approximately $79 million of potential preacquisition net operating loss carryforwards of Arcus Group, Inc. and certain foreign acquisitions. Any tax benefit realized related to preacquisition net operating loss carryforwards will be recorded as a reduction of goodwill when, and if, realized. The Arcus Group carryforwards expire in six years. As a result of these loss carryforwards, we do not expect to pay any significant federal and state income taxes in the next three years. Recent Pronouncements In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 ("FIN 45"), "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others." It clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee, including its ongoing obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of the guarantee in the event that the specified triggering events or conditions occur. The objective of the initial measurement of the liability is the fair value of the guarantee at its inception. The initial recognition and measurement provisions of FIN 45 are effective for us on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements of FIN 45 are effective for us as of December 31, 2002. We will record the fair value of new or modified material guarantees, if any, in accordance with FIN 45. See Notes 3, 5, 6, 7 and 13 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for current disclosure requirements related to our guarantee arrangements. In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46 which addresses both unconsolidated variable interest entities and any new variable interest entities that are created subsequent to the issuance of the interpretation. As of December 31, 2002, we did not have any unconsolidated variable interest entities. Any future variable interest entities will be accounted for in accordance with FIN 46. 44 In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections," which among other things, limits the classification of gains and losses from extinguishment of debt as extraordinary to only those transactions that are unusual and infrequent in nature as defined by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30 "Reporting the Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions." SFAS No. 145 is effective no later than January 1, 2003. Upon adoption, gains and losses on certain future debt extinguishments, if any, will be recorded in pre tax income. In addition, extraordinary losses of $2.9 million, net of tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2000, $11.8 million, net of tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2001, and $3.5 million, net of tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2002 will be reclassified to other (income) expense, net in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations to conform to the requirements under SFAS No. 145. In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities," which nullifies EITF Issue No. 94 3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)." SFAS No. 146 requires a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity to be recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred. If fair value cannot be reasonably estimated, the liability shall be recognized initially in the period in which fair value can be reasonably estimated. In periods subsequent to the initial measurement, changes to the liability resulting from revisions to either the timing or the amount of estimated cash flows must be recognized as adjustments to the liability in the period of the change. The provisions of SFAS No. 146 will be effective for us prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure", which amended SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation," to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to a fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation. SFAS No. 148 allows for (a) a prospective method, (b) a modified prospective method and (c) a retroactive restatement method. The prospective method involves recognizing expense for the fair value for all awards granted or modified in the year of adoption and thereafter with no expense recognition for previous awards. The modified prospective method involves recognizing expense for the fair value for all awards granted or modified in the year of adoption and thereafter and for all awards previously granted, modified or settled since 1994 (the original SFAS No. 123 implementation date) that are unvested at the beginning of the year of adoption. The retroactive restatement method involves restating all periods presented for the fair value of all awards previously granted, modified or settled since 1994 (the original SFAS No. 123 implementation date). We have elected to adopt the fair value method of accounting in our financial statements beginning in 2003 using the prospective method. We will apply the fair value recognition provisions to all stock based awards granted, modified or settled on or after January 1, 2003 and will continue to provide the required pro forma information in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements on an interim and annual basis. We do not expect the adoption of the fair value method of accounting to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations for the year ending December 31, 2003. We are not contractually committed to grant or modify awards in future accounting periods and we do not anticipate any changes to our policies or procedures in regards to stock based awards as a result of this implementation. Seasonality Historically, our businesses have not been subject to seasonality in any material respect. 45 Inflation Certain of our expenses, such as wages and benefits, insurance, occupancy costs and equipment repair and replacement, are subject to normal inflationary pressures. Although to date we have been able to offset inflationary cost increases through increased operating efficiencies and the negotiation of favorable long term real estate leases, we can give no assurance that we will be able to offset any future inflationary cost increases through similar efficiencies, leases or increased storage or service charges.  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Interest Rate Risk In December 2000, January 2001 and May 2001, we and variable interest entities which we now consolidate entered into a total of four derivative financial contracts, which are variable for fixed swaps consisting of (a) two contracts for interest payments payable on our term loan of an aggregate principal amount of $195.5 million, (b) one contract for interest payments payable (previously certain variable operating lease commitments payable) on our real estate term loans of an aggregate principal amount of $47.5 million and (c) one contract for interest payments payable on our real estate term loans of an aggregate principal amount of $97.0 million. See Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and "Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies" in this Form 10 K. After consideration of the swap contracts mentioned above, as of December 31, 2002, we had $225.8 million of variable rate debt outstanding with a weighted average variable interest rate of 4.5%, and $1,506.3 million of fixed rate debt outstanding. Over 85% of our total debt outstanding is fixed. If the weighted average variable interest rate on our variable rate debt had increased by 1%, such increase would have had a negative impact on our net income for the year ended December 31, 2002 by $1.3 million. See Note 5 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our long term indebtedness, including the fair values of such indebtedness as of December 31, 2002. Currency Risk Our investments in Iron Mountain Europe Limited, Iron Mountain South America, Ltd. and other international investments may be subject to risks and uncertainties related to fluctuations in currency valuation. Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. However, our international revenues are generated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate, primarily the Canadian dollar and British pound sterling. The currencies of many Latin American countries have experienced substantial volatility and depreciation in the past, including the Argentine peso. In addition, one of our Canadian subsidiaries, Iron Mountain Canada Corporation, has U.S. dollar denominated debt. Declines in the value of the local currencies in which we are paid relative to the U.S. dollar will cause revenues in the U.S. dollar terms to decrease and dollar denominated liabilities to increase in local currency. We also have several intercompany obligations between our foreign subsidiaries and Iron Mountain and our U.S. based subsidiaries. These intercompany obligations are primarily denominated in the local currency of the foreign subsidiary. We have attempted to limit our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations through borrowings of Canadian dollars in the U.S. at a level that approximates the U.S. dollar denominated borrowings of Iron Mountain Canada Corporation. However, our currency exposures to intercompany borrowings are unhedged. At December 31, 2002, we did not have any outstanding foreign currency hedging contracts. The impact of devaluation or depreciating currency on an entity depends on the residual effect on the local economy and the ability of an entity to raise prices and or reduce expenses. Due to our constantly changing currency exposure and the potential substantial volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange fluctuations on our business. 46 The effect of a change in foreign exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the "Accumulated Other Comprehensive Items" component of shareholders equity. A 10% depreciation in year end 2002 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a $11.1 million reduction in our shareholders equity.

Declines in the value of the local currencies in which we are paid relative to the U.S. dollar will cause revenues in the U.S. dollar terms to decrease and dollar denominated liabilities to increase in local currency. We also have several intercompany obligations between our foreign subsidiaries and Iron Mountain and our U.S. based subsidiaries. These intercompany obligations are primarily denominated in the local currency of the foreign subsidiary. We have attempted to limit our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations through borrowings of Canadian dollars in the U.S. at a level that approximates the U.S. dollar denominated borrowings of Iron Mountain Canada Corporation. However, our currency exposures to intercompany borrowings are unhedged. At December 31, 2002, we did not have any outstanding foreign currency hedging contracts. The impact of devaluation or depreciating currency on an entity depends on the residual effect on the local economy and the ability of an entity to raise prices and or reduce expenses. Due to our constantly changing currency exposure and the potential substantial volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange fluctuations on our business. 46 The effect of a change in foreign exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the "Accumulated Other Comprehensive Items" component of shareholders equity. A 10% depreciation in year end 2002 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a $11.1 million reduction in our shareholders equity.
