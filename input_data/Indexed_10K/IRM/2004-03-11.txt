Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with "Item 6. Selected Financial Data" and the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto and the other financial and operating information included elsewhere in this filing. This discussion contains "forward looking statements," as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and in other federal securities laws. See "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements" on page ii of this filing. Overview Our revenues consist of storage revenues as well as service and storage material sales revenues. Storage revenues, which are considered a key performance indicator for the records and information management services industry, consist of largely recurring periodic charges related to the storage of materials (either on a per unit or per cubic foot of records basis), which are typically retained by customers for many years, and have accounted for approximately 58% of total consolidated revenues in each of the last five years. Our quarterly revenues from these fixed periodic storage fees have grown for 60 consecutive quarters. In certain circumstances, based upon customer requirements, storage revenues include periodic charges associated with normal, recurring service activities. Service and storage material sales revenues are comprised of charges for related service activities and courier operations and the sale of storage materials. Related service revenues arise from additions of new records, temporary removal of records from storage, refiling of removed records, destructions of records, permanent withdrawals from storage and other complementary and ancillary services, and sales of specially designed storage containers, magnetic media including computer tapes and related supplies. Courier operations consist primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request. Customers are generally billed on a monthly basis on contractually agreed upon terms. Our consolidated revenues are subject to variations caused by the net effect of foreign currency translation on revenue derived from outside the U.S. For the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, we derived 19.0% and 14.0%, respectively, of our total revenues from outside the U.S. We expect the percentage of total revenues that we derive from outside the U.S. to increase in 2004 due to our acquisition of the European operations of Hays IMS. Cost of sales (excluding depreciation) consists primarily of wages and benefits for field personnel, facility occupancy costs including rent and utilities, transportation expenses including vehicle leases and fuel, other product cost of sales and other equipment costs and supplies. Of these, wages and benefits and facility occupancy costs are the most significant. Trends in total wages and benefits dollars and as a percentage of total consolidated revenue are influenced by changes in headcount and compensation levels, achievement of incentive compensation targets, workforce productivity and variability in costs associated with medical insurance and workers compensation. Trends in facility occupancy costs are similarly impacted by the total number of facilities we occupy, the mix of properties we own versus properties we occupy under operating leases, fluctuations in per square foot occupancy costs, and the levels of utilization of these properties. The expansion of our European and secure shredding operations have resulted in changes to the mix of certain cost of sales components. We expect that until we complete the integration of the European operations of Hays IMS, rationalize our European facilities and maximize their utilization, our facilities costs may increase as a percentage of consolidated revenue, as our European operations become a greater percentage of our consolidated results. Our European and secure shredding operations are more labor intensive; therefore, our labor expense will be higher as a percentage of revenue as compared to our mature operations. In addition, our secure shredding operations incur higher transportation costs and lower facility costs, as a percentage of consolidated revenue, as compared to our mature operations. 21 Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits for management, administrative, information technology, sales, account management and marketing personnel, as well as expenses related to communications and data processing, travel, professional fees, bad debts, training, office equipment and supplies. Trends in total wages and benefits dollars and as a percentage of total consolidated revenue are influenced by changes in headcount and compensation levels, achievement of incentive compensation targets, workforce productivity and variability in costs associated with medical insurance. We expect our adoption of the measurement provisions of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation," as amended by SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure," will result in increasing amounts of selling, general and administrative expenses in the future. We began using the fair value method of accounting in our financial statements beginning January 1, 2003 using the prospective method. The prospective method involves recognizing expense for the fair value for all awards granted or modified in the year of adoption and thereafter with no expense recognition for previous awards. As we continue to grant new options subject to these standards and amortize compensation expense associated with options granted after January 1, 2003, we expect our stock compensation expense will grow significantly over the $1.5 million we recorded for such expense in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003. It is not possible to predict the increase in stock compensation expense for 2004 as it is dependent upon the number of options that will be granted throughout 2004 and the valuation assumptions in use at the time those options are granted. The overhead structure of our expanding European operations, as compared to our mature operations, is more labor intensive and has not achieved the same level of overhead leverage, which may result in an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of consolidated revenue, as our European operations become a more meaningful percentage of our consolidated results. Our depreciation and amortization charges result primarily from the capital intensive nature of our business. The principal components of depreciation relate to storage systems, which include racking, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and software, and buildings. Amortization relates primarily to customer relationships and acquisition costs. Effective July 1, 2001 and January 1, 2002, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations" and SFAS No. 142. SFAS No. 141 requires all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives. Had SFAS No. 142 been effective January 1, 2001, goodwill amortization expense would have been reduced by $59.2 million ($50.9 million, net of tax) for the year ended December 31, 2001. See Note 2(g) to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In February 2004, we completed the acquisition of Mentmore plcs 49.9% equity interest in IME. This transaction should have no impact on revenue or operating income since we already fully consolidate IMEs financial results. Since we will be using the purchase method of accounting for this acquisition, 49.9% of the net assets of IME will be adjusted to reflect their fair market value if different from their current carrying value. As a result, we expect this transaction will increase depreciation and amortization expenses going forward. Additionally, we will record an increase in interest expense, net associated with debt used to fund this acquisition and will no longer record the minority interest in earnings of subsidiaries, net related to Mentmores ownership interest in IME. All of our costs are subject to variations caused by the net effect of foreign currency translation on costs incurred by our entities outside the U.S. During 2003, we have seen increases in costs as a result of the strengthening of the British pound sterling, the Euro, and the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. It is impossible to predict how much foreign currency exchange rates will fluctuate in the future and how those 22 fluctuations will impact individual balances reported in our consolidated statement of operations; however, given the relative increase in our international operations, these fluctuations may become material. Reclassifications and Changes in Presentation Previously, consolidated losses (gains) on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net were recorded within various captions of our consolidated statements of operations based on the nature of the underlying asset. During the first quarter of 2003, we determined that it was more appropriate to record these gains and losses separately within our results from operations. We have reflected this change in all applicable tables and discussions for all periods presented within the following discussion of results of operations. Previously, debt extinguishment expenses were recorded as an extraordinary charge within our consolidated statements of operations. Effective January 1, 2003, we have reflected these charges to other (income) expense, net in accordance with recent changes in accounting pronouncements. We have reflected this change in all applicable tables and discussions for all periods presented within the following discussion of results of operations. Non GAAP Measures Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization, or OIBDA OIBDA is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization expenses. OIBDA Margin is calculated by dividing OIBDA by total revenues. Our management uses these measures to evaluate the operating performance of our consolidated business. As such, we believe these measures provide relevant and useful information to our current and potential investors. We use OIBDA for planning purposes and multiples of current or projected OIBDA based calculations in conjunction with our discounted cash flow models to determine our overall enterprise valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets. We believe OIBDA and OIBDA Margin are useful measures to evaluate our ability to grow our revenues faster than our operating expenses and they are an integral part of our internal reporting system utilized by management to assess and evaluate the operating performance of our business. OIBDA does not include certain items, specifically (1) minority interest in earnings (losses) of subsidiaries, net, (2) other (income) expense, net, (3) income from discontinued operations and loss on sale of discontinued operations and (4) cumulative effect of change in accounting principle that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results. OIBDA also does not include interest expense, net and the provision for income taxes. These expenses are associated with our capitalization and tax structures, which management does not consider when evaluating the profitability of our core operations. Finally, OIBDA does not include depreciation and amortization expenses, in order to eliminate the impact of capital investments, which management believes is better evaluated by comparing capital expenditures to incremental revenue generated and as a percentage of total revenues. OIBDA and OIBDA Margin should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the Unites States of America, or GAAP, such as operating or net income or cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP). 23 Reconciliation of OIBDA to Operating Income and Net (Loss) Income (In Thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2001 2002 2003 OIBDA $ 297,387 $ 361,578 $ 435,811 Less: Depreciation and Amortization 153,271 108,992 130,918 Operating Income 144,116 252,586 304,893 Less: Interest Expense, Net 134,742 136,632 150,468 Other Expense (Income), Net 37,485 1,435 (2,564 ) Provision for Income Taxes 17,875 47,318 66,730 Minority Interest (1,929 ) 3,629 5,622 Income from Discontinued Operations (1,116 ) Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle 6,396 Net (Loss) Income $ (44,057 ) $ 58,292 $ 84,637 Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and for the period then ended. On an on going basis, we evaluate the estimates used, including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts, impairments of tangible and intangible assets, income taxes, purchase accounting related reserves, self insurance liabilities, incentive compensation liabilities, litigation liabilities and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience, actuarial estimates, current conditions and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and are not readily apparent from other sources. We use these estimates to assist us in the identification and assessment of the accounting treatment necessary with respect to commitments and contingencies. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Our critical accounting policies include the following and are in no particular order: Accounting for Acquisitions Part of our growth strategy has included the acquisition of numerous businesses. The purchase price of these acquisitions has been determined after due diligence of the acquired business, market research, strategic planning, and the forecasting of expected future results and synergies. Estimated future results and expected synergies are subject to revisions as we integrate each acquisition and attempt to leverage resources. Each acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting as defined under the applicable accounting standards at the date of each acquisition, including, Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16, "Accounting for Business Combinations," and more recently, SFAS No. 141. Accounting for these acquisitions has resulted in the capitalization of the cost in excess of fair value of the net assets acquired in each of these acquisitions as goodwill. We estimated the fair values of the assets acquired in each acquisition as of the date of acquisition and these estimates are subject to adjustment. These estimates are subject to final assessments of the fair value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, operating leases and deferred income taxes. We complete these assessments within one year of the date of acquisition. We are not aware of any information that would 24 indicate that the final purchase price allocations for acquisitions completed in 2003 would differ meaningfully from preliminary estimates. See Note 7 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In connection with each of our acquisitions, we have undertaken certain restructurings of the acquired businesses to realize efficiencies and potential cost savings. Our restructuring activities include the elimination of duplicate facilities, reductions in staffing levels, and other costs associated with exiting certain activities of the businesses we acquire. The estimated cost of these restructuring activities are included as costs of the acquisition and are recorded as goodwill consistent with the guidance of Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 95 3, "Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination." While we finalize our plans to restructure the businesses we acquire within one year of the date of acquisition, it may take more than one year to complete all activities related to the restructuring of an acquired business. Our acquisitions have resulted in a significant accumulation of goodwill. Beginning on January 1, 2002, we ceased to amortize goodwill in accordance with SFAS No. 142. We reviewed goodwill for impairment consistent with the guidelines of SFAS No. 142 using a discounted future cash flow approach to approximate fair value. The result of testing our goodwill for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 142, as of January 1, 2002, was a non cash charge of $6.4 million (net of minority interest of $8.5 million), which, consistent with SFAS No. 142, is reported in the caption "cumulative effect of change in accounting principle" in our consolidated statement of operations. Impairment adjustments recognized in the future, if any, are generally required to be recognized as operating expenses. The $6.4 million charge relates to our South American reporting unit within our international reporting segment. The South American reporting unit failed the impairment test primarily due to a reduction in the expected future performance of the unit resulting from a deterioration of the local economic environment and the devaluation of the currency in Argentina. As goodwill amortization expense in our South American reporting unit is not deductible for tax purposes, this impairment charge is not net of a tax benefit. We have a controlling 50.1% interest in Iron Mountain South America, Ltd ("IMSA") and the remainder is owned by an unaffiliated entity. IMSA has acquired a controlling interest in entities in which local partners have retained a minority interest in order to enhance our local market expertise. These local partners have no ownership interest in IMSA. This has caused the minority interest portion of the non cash goodwill impairment charge ($8.5 million) to exceed our portion of the non cash goodwill impairment charge ($6.4 million). In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we selected October 1 as our annual goodwill impairment review date. We performed our annual goodwill impairment review as of October 1, 2003 and noted no impairment of goodwill at our reporting units as of that date. As of December 31, 2003, no factors were identified that would alter this assessment. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments. When calculating the allowance, we consider our past loss experience, current and prior trends in our aged receivables, current economic conditions, and specific circumstances of individual receivable balances. If the financial condition of our customers were to significantly change, resulting in a significant improvement or impairment of their ability to make payments, an adjustment of the allowance may be required. As of December 31, 2002 and 2003, our allowance for doubtful accounts balance totaled $20.3 million and $18.3 million, respectively. The decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2003 compared to December 31, 2002 is primarily attributable to the success of our centralized collection efforts within the U.S. and Canada, which resulted in improved cash collections and an improved accounts receivable aging that enabled us to significantly reduce our allowance for doubtful accounts in the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts was partially offset by an increase in the 25 allowance for doubtful accounts associated with businesses acquired during the year ended December 31, 2003, including Hays IMS. Accounting for Variable Interest Entities Three variable interest entities were established to acquire properties and lease those properties to us. These leases were designed to qualify as operating leases for accounting purposes, where the monthly lease expense was recorded as rent expense in our consolidated statements of operations and where the related underlying assets and liabilities were not consolidated in our consolidated balance sheets. We changed the characterization and the related accounting for properties in one variable interest entity ("VIE III") during the third quarter of 2002 and prospectively for new property acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2002. In addition, anticipating the requirement to consolidate, and in line with our objective of transparent reporting, we voluntarily guaranteed all of the at risk equity in VIE III and our two other variable interest entities (together, the "Other Variable Interest Entities" and, collectively with VIE III, our "Variable Interest Entities") as of December 31, 2002. These guarantees resulted in our consolidating all of our Variable Interest Entities assets and liabilities. Our Variable Interest Entities were financed with real estate term loans. These real estate term loans have always been and continue to be treated as indebtedness for purposes of our financial covenants under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. As of the date they were consolidated into our financial statements, they were also considered indebtedness under our indentures for certain of our senior subordinated notes. As of December 31, 2003, these real estate term loans amounted to $202.6 million. No further financing is currently available to our Variable Interest Entities to fund further property acquisitions. See Note 5 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2002, we voluntarily guaranteed all of the at risk equity in VIE III. This resulted in our consolidating all of its remaining assets and liabilities. VIE IIIs remaining assets and liabilities relate to an interest rate swap agreement, which it entered into upon its inception. This swap agreement hedges the majority of interest rate risk associated with VIE IIIs real estate term loans. Specifically, VIE III has swapped $97.0 million of floating rate debt to fixed rate debt. Since the time it entered into the swap agreement, interest rates have fallen. As a result, the estimated fair value of the derivative liability held by VIE III, and now consolidated on our balance sheet, related to the swap agreement was $11.0 million at December 31, 2003. This swap has been since inception and continues to be, as of December 31, 2003, an effective hedge in accordance with SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." During the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2003, we recorded depreciation expense of $1.7 million and $1.8 million, respectively, associated with the properties and interest expense of $6.2 million and $8.2 million, respectively, associated with the real estate term loans. See Notes 3, 4 and 5 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, as of December 31, 2002, we voluntarily guaranteed all of the at risk equity in the Other Variable Interest Entities. This resulted in our consolidating all of their assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2002, the total impact of consolidating the Other Variable Interest Entities was an increase of $103.9 million both in property, plant and equipment and long term debt. The underlying leases associated with the Other Variable Interest Entities were treated as operating leases from inception (as early as 1998) through consolidation on December 31, 2002. As a result, during the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2002, we recorded $6.7 million and $5.9 million, respectively, in rent expense in our consolidated statements of operations related to these leases. In 2003, we began recording depreciation expense associated with the properties, interest expense associated with the real estate term loans and no longer have rent expense related to leases associated with the Other Variable Interest Entities in our consolidated financial results. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we recorded depreciation expense of $2.0 million associated with the properties and interest expense of $5.5 million associated with the real estate term loans. If the Other Variable Interest Entities had been consolidated in our historical financial statements as of January 1, 2002: (1) depreciation expense would 26 have increased in an amount equal to $2.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002; and (2) rent expense for these properties would have been reclassified as interest expense in an amount equal to $5.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002. Consequently, our OIBDA, operating income and interest expense would have increased by $5.9 million, $3.9 million and $5.9 million, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002. In addition, net income before provision for income taxes would have decreased by $2.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002. In January and December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 ("FIN 46") and No. 46, revised ("FIN 46R"), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities." These statements, which address perceived weaknesses in accounting for entities commonly known as special purpose or off balance sheet, require consolidation of certain interests or arrangements by virtue of holding a controlling financial interest in such entities. Certain provisions of FIN 46R related to interests in special purpose entities were applicable for the period ended December 31, 2003. We must apply FIN 46R to our interests in all entities subject to the interpretation as of the first interim or annual period ending after March 15, 2004. Adoption of this new method of accounting for variable interest entities did not and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position. As a result of the actions described above, as of December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2003, we did not have any unconsolidated variable interest entities. Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives), and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on its balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (1) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment; (2) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction; or (3) a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation, an unrecognized firm commitment, an available for sale security, or a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized gains and losses are recognized each period as other comprehensive income which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive items included in shareholders equity, assets and liabilities or earnings depending on the nature of such derivatives. See Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description of our derivative instruments. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. For cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For hedges of foreign currency the accounting treatment generally follows the treatment for cash flow hedges or fair value hedges depending on the nature of the foreign currency hedge. Although we apply some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the 27 correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is generally high. We had $25.6 million of interest rate risk management liabilities and had a corresponding amount for unrealized losses to other comprehensive income ($16.2 million, net of tax) related to cash flow hedges at December 31, 2003. We provided the initial financing totaling 190.5 million British pounds sterling to IME, our European joint venture, for all of the consideration associated with the acquisition of the European operations of Hays IMS using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We recorded a foreign currency gain of $27.8 million in other (income) expense, net for this intercompany balance for the year ended December 31, 2003. In order to minimize the foreign currency risk associated with providing IME with the consideration necessary for the acquisition of Hay IMS, we borrowed 80.0 million British pounds sterling under our revolving credit facility to create a natural hedge. We recorded a foreign currency loss of $11.5 million on the translation of this revolving credit balance to U.S. dollars in other (income) expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2003. In addition, we entered into two cross currency swaps with a combined notional value of 100.0 million British pounds sterling. These swaps each have a term of one year and at maturity we have a right to receive $162.8 million in exchange for 100.0 million British pounds sterling. We have not designated these swaps as hedges and, therefore, all mark to market fluctuations of the swaps are recorded in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of operations. We have recorded, for the year ended December 31, 2003, a foreign currency loss of $19.0 million in other (income) expense, net. One of our interest rate swaps was used to hedge interest rate risk on certain variable operating lease commitments. As a result of the December 31, 2002 consolidation of one of the Other Variable Interest Entities ("VIE I"), the operating lease commitments that were hedged by this swap are now considered to be inter company transactions and we determined that this hedge was no longer effective on a prospective basis. We have consolidated the real estate term loans of VIE I and we will prospectively record interest expense instead of rent expense as we make cash interest payments on this debt. The unrealized mark to market losses previously recorded in other comprehensive income attributable to this swap ($1.9 million and $0.8 million, net of tax, as of December 31, 2002 and 2003, respectively) will be amortized through other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statement of operations based on the changes in the fair value of the swap each period that the remaining interest payments are made on VIE Is external debt. We are accounting for mark to market changes in the derivative liability of this swap agreement through other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statement of operations. This accounting has a net zero impact within our consolidated statement of operations as it relates to the amortization of unrealized mark to market losses and the fair valuing of the derivative liability. Accounting for Internal Use Software We develop various software applications for internal use. We account for those costs in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Position ("SOP") 98 1, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use." SOP 98 1 requires computer software costs associated with internal use software to be expensed as incurred until certain capitalization criteria are met. SOP 98 1 also defines which types of costs should be capitalized and which should be expensed. Payroll and related costs for employees who are directly associated with, and who devote time to, the development of internal use computer software projects, to the extent time is spent directly on the project, are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the software. Capitalization begins when the design stage of the application has been completed and it is probable that the project will be completed and used to perform the function intended. Depreciation begins when the software is placed in service. Computer software costs that are capitalized are evaluated for impairment in accordance with SFAS No.144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." 28 It may be necessary for us to write off amounts associated with the development of internal use software if the project cannot be completed as intended. Our expansion into new technology based service offerings requires the development of internal use software that will be susceptible to rapid and significant changes in technology. We may be required to write off unamortized costs or shorten the estimated useful life if an internal use software program is replaced with an alternative tool prior to the end of the softwares estimated useful life. General uncertainties related to expansion into digital businesses, including the timing of introduction and market acceptance of our services, may adversely impact the recoverability of these assets. See Note 2(f) to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. During the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2003, we replaced internal use software programs, which resulted in the write off to loss on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of the remaining net book value of $1.1 million and $0.7 million, respectively. Deferred Income Taxes We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We have considered estimated future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the amount needed for the valuation allowance. If actual results differ unfavorably from those estimates used, we may not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets and additional valuation allowances may be required. Stock based Compensation As of January 1, 2003, we adopted the measurement provisions of SFAS No. 123 and SFAS No. 148. As a result we began using the fair value method of accounting in our financial statements beginning January 1, 2003 using the prospective method. The prospective method involves recognizing expense for the fair value for all awards granted or modified in the year of adoption and thereafter with no expense recognition for previous awards. We will apply the fair value recognition provisions to all stock based awards granted, modified or settled on or after January 1, 2003 and will continue to provide the required pro forma information for all awards previously granted, modified or settled before January 1, 2003 in our consolidated financial statements. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we recorded $1.7 million of stock compensation expense in our consolidated statement of operations. Had we elected to recognize compensation cost based on the fair value of all options as of their grant dates as prescribed by SFAS No. 123 and No. 148, we would have recorded stock compensation expense of $4.9 million, $4.5 million and $5.6 million in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively. 29 Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, information derived from our consolidated statements of operations, expressed as a percentage of total consolidated revenues.

The increase is attributable to internal revenue growth (8%) resulting from net increases in records and other media stored by existing customers and sales to new customers, acquisitions (5%), primarily consisting of $30.0 million from the operations of Hays IMS, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations (2%). Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations were primarily due to the strengthening of the British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, and Euro against the U.S. dollar, offset by a weakening of the Mexican peso and Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. Consolidated service and storage material sales revenues increased $67.3 million, or 12.0%, to $626.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase is attributable to acquisitions (7%), including revenue from the Hays IMS operations of $24.6 million, internal revenue growth (3%) resulting from net increases in service and storage material sales to existing customers and sales to new customers, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations (2%). Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations were primarily due to the strengthening of the British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, and Euro against the U.S. dollar, offset by a weakening of the Mexican peso and Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. For the reasons stated above, our consolidated revenues increased $182.8 million, or 13.9%, to $1,501.3 million. Internal revenue growth for the year ended December 31, 2003 was 6%. We calculate internal revenue growth in local currency for our international operations. Internal Growth Eight Quarter Trend 2002 2003 First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Full Year First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Full Year Storage Revenue 8 % 9 % 9 % 8 % 8 % 8 % 8 % 9 % 8 % 8 % Service and Storage Material Sales Revenue 9 % 10 % 15 % 10 % 11 % 8 % 3 % 2 % 1 % 3 % Total Revenue 9 % 9 % 11 % 9 % 10 % 8 % 6 % 6 % 5 % 6 % Our internal revenue growth rate represents the weighted average year over year growth rate of our revenues after removing the effects of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Over the past eight quarters, the internal growth rate of our storage revenues has ranged between 8% to 9%. Our storage revenue internal growth rate trend for the year ended December 31, 2003 reflects higher growth rates in our international businesses, primarily Europe, stabilized net carton volume growth in our North American records management business and higher growth rates in our digital businesses. We experienced higher volumes of carton destructions and permanent removals in the fourth quarter of 2003 as compared to the first three quarters of 2003, which contributed to the decline in our internal growth rate for storage revenue from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of 2003. We experienced similar volumes of destructions and permanent removals in the fourth quarter of 2002. Net carton volume growth is a function of the rate new cartons are added by existing and new customers offset by the rate of carton destructions and other permanent removals. The internal growth rate for service and storage material sales revenue is inherently more volatile than the storage revenue internal growth rate due to more discretionary services we offer such as large special projects, data products and carton sales and recycled paper. These revenues are impacted to a greater extent by economic downturns as customers defer or cancel the purchase of these services as a way to reduce their short term costs. As a commodity, recycled paper prices are subject to the volatility 32 of that market. The quarterly growth rates in 2003 were negatively impacted by several factors: (1) large special project service revenue did not achieve the same high levels experienced in the corresponding periods of 2002, (2) product sales, primarily data product sales, decreased and (3) carton destructions and other permanent removals have decreased relative to prior periods. In addition, our off site data protection business continued to operate in a market experiencing downward pressure on information technology spending as companies look to reduce their costs. Cost of Sales Consolidated cost of sales (excluding depreciation) is comprised of the following expenses (in thousands): % of Consolidated Revenues 2002 2003 Dollar Change Percent Change 2002 2003 Percent Change (Favorable)/ Unfavorable Labor $ 318,707 $ 344,761 $ 26,054 8.2 % 24.2 % 23.0 % (1.2 )% Facilities 184,988 211,597 26,609 14.4 % 14.0 % 14.1 % 0.1 % Transportation 56,972 65,142 8,170 14.3 % 4.3 % 4.3 % Product Cost of Sales 34,552 30,987 (3,565 ) (10.3 )% 2.6 % 2.1 % (0.5 )% Other 27,080 28,260 1,180 4.4 % 2.1 % 1.9 % (0.2 )% $ 622,299 $ 680,747 $ 58,448 9.4 % 47.2 % 45.3 % (1.9 )% Labor Labor expense decreased as a percentage of revenue as a result of improved labor management in our North American operations and lower incentive compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. This improvement was offset by increases in wages, medical expenses, and headcount due to growth and acquisitions in our secure shredding operations and the acquisition of Hays IMS. We expect labor expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues in 2004 may increase as we report a full year of integrated Hays IMS operations. Facilities The largest component of our facilities cost is rent expense, which increased $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 primarily as a result of increased rent in our European operations of $9.0 million attributable to new facilities and properties acquired through acquisitions, including our acquisition of Hays IMS. In addition, after adjusting for the consolidation of properties owned by our Variable Interest Entities, we have increased the number of leased facilities we occupy in the U.S. and Canada as of December 31, 2003 compared to December 31, 2002 primarily due to acquisitions. The increase in rent is offset by the consolidation of 38 properties owned by our Variable Interest Entities during the third and fourth quarter of 2002. The leases associated with these properties were accounted for as operating leases prior to December 31, 2002. We recorded $5.9 million of rent expense for these 38 properties during the year ended December 31, 2002 and no rent expense in the year ended December 31, 2003. Rather than rent expense, we recorded interest expense and depreciation expense associated with these properties for the year ended December 31, 2003. Excluding our European operations, the dollar increase in facilities expenses is attributable to property taxes, utilities, and property insurance, which increased $5.5 million, $4.0 million, and $1.9 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. Facilities expenses in our European operations increased $6.4 million primarily due to the growth of operations and acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. 33 We anticipate that reporting a full year of integrated Hays IMS operations and no longer having the offsetting impact caused by our Variable Interest Entities could cause an increase in rent expense and possibly in total facility costs as a percentage of consolidated revenues in 2004. Transportation Our transportation expenses, which were flat as a percentage of consolidated revenues, are influenced by several variables including total number of vehicles, owned versus leased vehicles, use of subcontracted couriers, fuel expenses, and maintenance. In the year ended December 31, 2003, we experienced a $3.4 million increase in transportation expenses in our European operations as compared to the year ended December 31, 2002, which is primarily attributable to an increase in fleet size and vehicles under operating lease resulting from the acquisition of Hays IMS and growth of operations. Transportation efficiencies achieved in our North American operations, partially offset by higher fuel costs and an increased percentage of vehicles under operating lease, mitigated the impact of our European operations on transportation expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues. Product Cost of Sales and Other Cost of Sales Product and other cost of sales are highly correlated to complementary revenue streams. Product cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2003 was lower than the year ended December 31, 2002 as a percentage of product revenues due to more focused selling efforts on higher margin products and improved product sourcing. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses are comprised of the following expenses (in thousands): % of Consolidated Revenues 2002 2003 Dollar Change Percent Change 2002 2003 Percent Change (Favorable)/ Unfavorable General and Administrative $ 179,550 $ 206,575 $ 27,025 15.1 % 13.6 % 13.8 % 0.2 % Sales, Marketing & Account Management 85,932 111,408 25,476 29.6 % 6.5 % 7.4 % 0.9 % Information Technology 55,971 67,950 11,979 21.4 % 4.2 % 4.5 % 0.3 % Bad Debt Expense 11,597 (2,292 ) (13,889 ) (119.8 )% 0.9 % (0.2 )% (1.1 )% $ 333,050 $ 383,641 $ 50,591 15.2 % 25.3 % 25.6 % 0.3 % General and Administrative The increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003 is primarily attributable to a $16.4 million increase in general and administrative expenses in our European operations due to the growth of operations and acquisitions. In our North American operations, general and administrative expenses increased as a result of higher wages due to normal inflation and merit increases, and increases in workers compensation and medical expenses. The increase in labor expenses was partially offset by decreases in general insurance expenses and lower incentive compensation expenses. We anticipate increased pressure on our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues as we integrate the operations of Hays IMS. 34 Sales, Marketing & Account Management The majority of our sales, marketing and account management costs are labor related and are primarily driven by the headcount in each of these departments. Increased headcount and commissions are the most significant contributors to the increase in sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003. Throughout the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2003, we continued to invest in the expansion and improvement of our sales force and account management personnel. Excluding our European operations, since December 31, 2002, we added 66 sales and marketing employees, a 16% increase in headcount, increased our account management force and initiated several new marketing and promotional efforts to develop awareness in the marketplace of our entire service offerings. The costs associated with these efforts have contributed to the increase in our sales, marketing and account management expenses. In addition, costs associated with our European sales and account management teams increased by $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2002, due to the hiring of new personnel and the expansion of our European sales force. We expect that sales, marketing and account management expenses will continue to increase as a percentage of consolidated revenues as we continue to expand and train our sales force and develop new marketing initiatives. Information Technology Information technology expenses increased $12.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 principally due to higher compensation costs resulting from increased headcount, normal inflation and merit increases, as well as an increase in external resources, which was partially offset by lower incentive compensation expenses. As our technology initiatives mature, less of our efforts are development related, thus decreasing capitalizable expenditures, which results in increased information technology expenses. In addition, we incurred additional costs to expand bandwidth and international connectivity in the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2002 to satisfy growth of our business and to integrate acquisitions. Bad Debt Expense The decrease in consolidated bad debt expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002 is primarily attributable to the success of our centralized collection efforts within the U.S. and Canada during 2002 and 2003, which resulted in improved cash collections and an improved accounts receivable aging that enabled us to significantly reduce our allowance for doubtful accounts in the year ended December 31, 2003. We do not expect to experience a similar decrease during 2004 and expect bad debt expense to be approximately 0.5% of consolidated revenues in 2004. Depreciation, Amortization, Merger Related Expenses and Loss on Disposal/Writedown of Property, Plant and Equipment, Net Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased $21.9 million to $130.9 million (8.7% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $109.0 million (8.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2002. Depreciation expense increased $19.8 million, primarily due to the additional depreciation expense related to recent capital expenditures, including storage systems, which include racking, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and software, and buildings, and depreciation associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases. Depreciation associated with our digital initiatives increased $5.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2003 as a result of software and hardware assets placed in service throughout the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2003. The consolidation of the properties owned by our Variable Interest Entities during the year ended December 31, 2002 resulted in $2.2 million of additional depreciation in the year ended December 31, 2003. Amortization expense increased as a 35 result of the amortization of intangible assets associated with acquisitions we completed in the fourth quarter of 2002 and during the year ended December 31, 2003. Merger related expenses are certain expenses directly related to our merger with Pierce Leahy that cannot be capitalized and included system conversion costs, costs of exiting certain facilities, severance, relocation and pay to stay payments and other transaction related costs. Merger related expenses were $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. All merger related activities associated with the Pierce Leahy merger were completed in 2002. Consolidated loss on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net consisted of disposals and asset writedowns partially offset by $4.2 million of gains on the sale of properties in Texas, Florida and the U.K. in the year ended December 31, 2003 and a gain of $2.1 million on the sale of a property in the U.K. in the year ended December 31, 2002. Operating Income As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated operating income increased $52.3 million, or 20.7%, to $304.9 million (20.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $252.6 million (19.2% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2002. OIBDA As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated OIBDA increased $74.2 million, or 20.5%, to $435.8 million (29.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $361.6 million (27.4% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2002. Interest Expense, Net Consolidated interest expense, net increased $13.8 million to $150.5 million (10.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $136.6 million (10.4% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily attributable to (1) $7.4 million of interest expense associated with real estate term loans held by our Variable Interest Entities that were consolidated in the second half of 2002, (2) borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the issuance of our 65/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016 (the "65/8% notes") which were used to finance the Hays IMS acquisition, and (3) an increase in our overall weighted average outstanding borrowings. The increase was offset by a decline in our overall weighted average interest rate from 8.3% as of December 31, 2002 to 7.7% as of December 31, 2003 resulting from our refinancing efforts and a decline in variable interest rates. Other Expense (Income), Net (in thousands) 2002 2003 Change Foreign currency transaction gains $ (5,045 ) $ (30,220 ) $ (25,175 ) Debt extinguishment expense 5,431 28,174 22,743 Loss on investments 901 (462 ) (1,363 ) Other, net 148 (56 ) (204 ) $ 1,435 $ (2,564 ) $ (3,999 ) Foreign currency gains of $30.2 million based on period end exchange rates were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2003 primarily due to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar and British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar as these currencies relate to our intercompany balances with our Canadian and U.K. subsidiaries, U.S. dollar denominated debt held by our Canadian subsidiary, 36 borrowings denominated in foreign currencies under our revolving credit facility, and our British pound sterling denominated cross currency swap. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we redeemed the remaining outstanding principal amount of our 91/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2007 (the "91/8% notes"), resulting in a charge of $1.8 million, the remaining outstanding principal amount of our 83/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2009 (the "83/4% notes"), resulting in a charge of $13.8 million, and $115.0 million of the outstanding principal of the 81/8% Senior Notes due 2008 of our Canadian subsidiary (the "Subsidiary notes"), resulting in a charge of $12.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we recorded a charge of $1.2 million related to the early retirement of debt in conjunction with the refinancing of our revolving credit facility and a charge of $4.2 million related to the early retirement of a portion of our 91/8% notes. The charges consisted primarily of the call and tender premiums associated with the extinguished debt and the write off of unamortized deferred financing cost and discounts. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2003 was 42.5%. The primary reconciling item between the statutory rate of 35% and our effective tax rate is state income taxes (net of federal benefit). The disallowance of certain intercompany interest charges by states, including a change in Massachusetts tax laws, retroactive to January 1, 2002, increased our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2003 by 1.1%. Our effective tax rate was 41.3% for the year ended December 31, 2002. There may be future volatility with respect to our effective tax rate related to items including unusual unforecasted permanent items, significant changes in tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the need for additional valuation allowances. Also, as a result of our net operating loss carryforwards, we do not expect to pay any significant international, U.S. federal and state income taxes during 2004. Minority Interest, Discontinued Operations, and Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle Minority interest in earnings of subsidiaries, net resulted in a charge to income of $5.6 million (0.4% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to $3.6 million (0.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2002. This represents our minority partners share of earnings in our majority owned international subsidiaries that are consolidated in our operating results. The increase is a result of the improved profitability of our European and South American businesses. In the fourth quarter of 2002, we recorded income from discontinued operations of $1.1 million (net of tax of $0.8 million) as a result of resolving several outstanding contingencies remaining from the sale of the Arcus Staffing Resources, Inc. business unit in 1999. There was no such income recorded in 2003. In the first quarter of 2002, we recorded a non cash charge for the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of $6.4 million (net of minority interest of $8.5 million) as a result of our implementation of SFAS No. 142. There was no such charge in 2003. Net Income As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated net income increased $26.3 million, or 45.2%, to $84.6 million (5.6% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2003 from net income of $58.3 million (4.4% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2002. 37 Segment Analysis (in thousands) The results of our various operating segments are discussed below. In general, our business records management segment offers records management, secure shredding, healthcare information services, vital records services, and service and courier operations in the U.S. and Canada. Our off site data protection segment offers data backup and disaster recovery services, vital records services, service and courier operations, and intellectual property protection services in the U.S. Our international segment offers elements of all our product and services lines outside the U.S. and Canada. Our corporate and other segment includes our corporate overhead functions and our fulfillment, consulting and digital archiving services. Business Records Management Off Site Data Protection International Corporate & Other Segment Revenue Year Ended December 31, 2003 $ 1,022,335 $ 251,141 $ 198,068 $ 29,785 December 31, 2002 944,845 239,081 109,381 25,190 Increase in Revenues $ 77,490 $ 12,060 $ 88,687 $ 4,595 Percentage Increase in Revenues 8.2 % 5.0 % 81.1 % 18.2 % Segment Contribution (1) Year Ended December 31, 2003 $ 286,208 $ 71,240 $ 46,825 $ 32,668 December 31, 2002 262,541 61,729 21,988 16,890 Segment Contribution (1) as a Percentage of Segment Revenue Year Ended December 31, 2003 28.0 % 28.4 % 23.6 % 109.7 % December 31, 2002 27.8 % 25.8 % 20.1 % 67.1 % (1)See Note 12 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for definition of Contribution and for the basis on which allocations are made and a reconciliation of Contribution to net income (loss) on a consolidated basis. Business Records Management During the year ended December 31, 2003, revenue in our business records management segment increased 8.2% primarily due to increased storage revenues, growth of our secure shredding operations and acquisitions (including revenue from the U.S. operations of Hays IMS of $8.2 million), and was offset by lower special project service revenue and lower permanent removal and destruction fees. In addition, favorable currency fluctuations during the year ended December 31, 2003 in Canada increased revenue $9.6 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue increased primarily due to lower bad debt expense and lower incentive compensation expense which were partially offset by higher property taxes, utilities and our increased investment in our sales and account management force. Items excluded from the calculation of Contribution include the following: (1) depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 of $71.7 million compared to $67.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, (2) foreign currency gains of $29.5 million and $1.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and (3) gain on disposal/writedown of property plant and equipment, net of 38 $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 and a loss on disposal/writedown of property plant and equipment, net of $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Off Site Data Protection Revenue in our off site data protection segment increased 5.0% primarily due to internal revenue growth from both existing and new customers in the face of increasing pressure in the marketplace to reduce information technology related spending. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue increased primarily due to reduced bad debt expense, increased product sales margins and improved labor management. This increase was partially offset by the growth of our sales and account management force. Items excluded from the calculation of Contribution include the following: (1) depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 of $13.8 million compared to $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 and (2) a loss on disposal/writedown of property plant and equipment, net of $1.9 million and $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. International Revenue in our international segment increased 81.1% primarily due to acquisitions completed in Europe, including $46.4 million from the acquisition of Hays IMS, and in South America, as well as increased sales efforts and a large service project in the U.K. Favorable currency fluctuations during the year ended December 31, 2003 in Europe increased revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, by $17.5 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was offset by $1.2 million of unfavorable currency fluctuations in Mexico and South America during the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue increased primarily due to improved gross margins from our European, South American, and Mexican operations and overall increased direct labor utilization and lower bad debt expenses. This increase was partially offset by increased overhead expenses associated with the growth of these emerging businesses. Items excluded from the calculation of Contribution include the following: (1) depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 of $16.0 million compared to $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, including $3.6 million associated with the acquisition of Hays IMS in the year ended December 31, 2003, (2) gains on disposal/writedown of property plant and equipment, net of $0.8 million and $2.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and (3) a foreign currency gain of $1.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to a loss of $0.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2002. 39 Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2001 Consolidated Results (in thousands) Year Ended December 31, Dollar Change Percent Change 2001 2002 Revenues: Storage $ 694,474 $ 759,536 $ 65,062 9.4 % Service and Storage Material Sales 491,244 558,961 67,717 13.8 % Total Revenues 1,185,718 1,318,497 132,779 11.2 % Operating Expenses: Cost of Sales (excluding depreciation) 576,538 622,299 45,761 7.9 % Selling, General and Administrative 307,800 333,050 25,250 8.2 % Depreciation and Amortization 153,271 108,992 (44,279 ) (28.9 )% Merger related Expenses 3,673 796 (2,877 ) (78.3 )% Loss on Disposal/Writedown of Property, Plant and Equipment, Net 320 774 454 141.9 % Total Operating Expenses 1,041,602 1,065,911 24,309 2.3 % Operating Income 144,116 252,586 108,470 75.3 % Interest Expense, Net 134,742 136,632 1,890 1.4 % Other Expense, Net 37,485 1,435 (36,050 ) (96.2 )% (Loss) Income from Continuing Operations Before Provision for Income Taxes and Minority Interest (28,111 ) 114,519 142,630 507.4 % Provision for Income Taxes 17,875 47,318 29,443 164.7 % Minority Interest in (Losses) Earnings of Subsidiaries (1,929 ) 3,629 5,558 288.1 % (Loss) Income from Continuing Operations before Discontinued Operations and Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle (44,057 ) 63,572 107,629 244.3 % Income from Discontinued Operations (net of tax) 1,116 1,116 Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle (net of minority interest) (6,396 ) (6,396 ) Net (Loss) Income $ (44,057 ) $ 58,292 $ 102,349 232.3 % Other Data: OIBDA (1) $ 297,387 $ 361,578 $ 64,191 21.6 % OIBDA Margin (1) 25.1 % 27.4 % (1)See "Non GAAP Measures Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization, or OIBDA" for definition, reconciliation and a discussion of why we believe these measures provide relevant and useful information to our current and potential investors. 40  Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2002 to Year Ended December 31, 2001 Revenue For the year ended December 31, 2002, our consolidated revenues increased $132.8 million, or 11.2%, compared to the same period of 2001. This increase was principally a result of internal revenue growth, which for the year ended December 31, 2002 was 10%, comprised of 8% for storage revenue and 11% for service and storage material sales revenue. We calculate internal revenue growth in local currency for our international operations. Consolidated storage revenues increased $65.1 million, or 9.4%, to $759.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase was primarily attributable to internal revenue growth of 8% resulting from net increases in records and other media stored by existing customers and sales to new customers. The net effect of foreign currency translation on storage revenues was a decrease in revenue of $2.4 million. This was a result of a weakening of the Argentine peso, the Canadian dollar, and the Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar, offset by a strengthening of the British pound sterling and the Euro against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. Consolidated service and storage material sales revenues increased $67.7 million, or 13.8%, to $559.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase was primarily attributable to internal revenue growth of 11% resulting from net increases in service and storage material sales to existing customers and sales to new customers. The net effect of foreign currency translation on service and storage material sales revenues was a decrease in revenue of $0.7 million. This was a result of a weakening of the Argentine peso, the Canadian dollar, and the Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar, offset by a strengthening of the British pound sterling and the Euro against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. Internal Growth Eight Quarter Trend 2001 2002 First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Full Year First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Full Year Storage Revenue 13 % 12 % 11 % 10 % 11 % 8 % 9 % 9 % 8 % 8 % Service and Storage Material Sales Revenue 9 % 9 % 5 % 11 % 8 % 9 % 10 % 15 % 10 % 11 % Total Revenue 11 % 10 % 9 % 10 % 10 % 9 % 9 % 11 % 9 % 10 % The consecutive quarter storage revenue internal growth trend over the last eight quarters, as calculated quarterly comparing the current quarter to the applicable quarter in the prior year, is primarily attributable to a decline in the rate at which customers have added new cartons to their inventory, which may be a result of current economic conditions. However, we have not seen a decline in the duration that our customers maintain their cartons in inventory nor an increase in the rate of cartons destroyed or permanently removed from inventory as a percentage of the total population. In addition, growth from new sales was adversely affected in 2001 and 2002 as a result of the disruption caused by the merging of our sales force with that of Pierce Leahy in 2000. The sales force reorganization has been completed and growth from new sales has begun to increase. Service and storage material sales revenue internal growth is subject to fluctuations in the timing of non recurring service projects ordered by customers and in some cases can be affected by delays or cancellations as some customers seek to reduce short term costs. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we benefited from a number of large non recurring service projects in North America and Europe. The volatility in the service revenue growth for the third and fourth quarters of 2001 and 2002 is primarily due to a disruption in the normal pattern of services we provide to our customers following 41 the events of September 11, 2001 and the resulting shift of some services and related revenue, to the fourth quarter of 2001. This caused a favorable comparison for the service revenue growth rate in the third quarter of 2002 and a difficult comparison in the fourth quarter of 2002. Cost of Sales Consolidated cost of sales (excluding depreciation) is comprised of the following expenses (in thousands): % of Consolidated Revenues 2001 2002 Dollar Change Percent Change 2001 2002 Percent Change (Favorable)/Unfavorable Labor $ 286,951 $ 318,707 $ 31,756 11.1 % 24.2 % 24.2 % Facilities 173,610 184,988 11,378 6.6 % 14.6 % 14.0 % (0.6 )% Transportation 55,167 56,972 1,805 3.3 % 4.7 % 4.3 % (0.4 )% Product Cost of Sales 31,363 34,552 3,189 10.2 % 2.6 % 2.6 % Other 29,447 27,080 (2,367 ) (8.0 %) 2.5 % 2.1 % (0.4 )% $ 576,538 $ 622,299 $ 45,761 7.9 % 48.6 % 47.2 % (1.4 )% Labor The dollar increase in labor expense is primarily attributable to increases in headcount and changes in our labor mix resulting from the expansion of our secure shredding operations. Our secure shredding operations are more labor intensive, therefore, labor expense will be higher as a percentage of revenue as compared to our mature operations. In the year ended December 31, 2002, this impact was mitigated by improved labor management in our off site data protection segment. In addition, our operations in the U.S. and Canada, which comprise approximately 75% of our workforce, experienced an overall increase in wages due to normal inflation, merit increases and significant increases in medical insurance and workers compensation expenses of approximately $12.0 million. The majority of these increases are attributable to higher premiums and self insurance requirements. Facilities Our property management activities combined with a higher utilization of our space has driven the decrease of our facilities expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues from 14.6% in the year ended December 31, 2001 to 14.0% in the year ended December 31, 2002. The largest component of our facilities cost is rent expense, which decreased $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. We reduced the number of leased facilities we occupy by 23 in the year ended December 31, 2002 primarily through the consolidation of our property portfolio as we exited less desirable facilities and consolidated our remaining properties subsequent to the Pierce Leahy merger. The decrease in leased properties is also a result of the recharacterization of eight properties held by our Variable Interest Entities at the end of 2001, which are now consolidated on our balance sheet at the end of 2002. During the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2002, we recorded $1.8 million and $0.0 million of rent expense for these eight properties, respectively. An additional 23 properties held by our Variable Interest Entities were consolidated as of December 31, 2002; however, they were accounted for as operating leases during the year ended December 31, 2002 and their costs were included in rent expense. For the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2002, we recorded rent expense of $6.7 million and $5.9 million, respectively, on these 23 properties and we recorded rent expense as interest expense beginning in 2003. 42 The dollar increase in facilities expenses is attributable to property insurance, which increased $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to the year ended December 31, 2001. The market wide increase in property insurance premiums in the wake of the events of September 11, 2001, in addition to experience based annual premium adjustments, resulted in this dramatic increase. Increased rent and facilities expenses in our European operations of $4.6 million and higher property taxes in the U.S. and Canada of $1.8 million have also contributed to the dollar increase in facilities expenses. Transportation Our transportation expenses are influenced by several variables including total number of vehicles, owned versus leased vehicles, use of subcontracted couriers, fuel expenses, and maintenance. For the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 our fleet of vehicles used in operations totaled 2,140 and 2,032, respectively, of which 1,429 and 1,269, respectively, were under operating leases. The net increase in vehicles is primarily attributable to an increase of 40 vehicles in our secure shredding division that were either acquired through acquisitions or added to support growth in the business. We reduced our operating lease expense by $0.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2002 as a result of our fleet leasing program, which has benefited from an overall reduction in interest rates and our improving credit rating. The results of our ongoing transportation efficiency projects and the completion of our conversions to the SafeKeeper Plus&reg; system have been significant in reducing transportation expenses, including fuel and outside courier fees, as a percentage of consolidated revenues. In the year ended December 31, 2002 we had an overall reduction in fuel consumption and a decrease in fuel expense of $0.4 million in spite of an average increase in the price per gallon of fuel during the year ended December 31, 2002. We also benefited from a $0.9 million decline in subcontracted courier expenses, which we believe is the result of better management of internal transportation resources. Our improvements in transportation have been partially offset by increased vehicle insurance and repair costs of $0.7 million and $0.9 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2002 over the year ended December 31, 2001, as a result of the increased size of our fleet. We experienced a $2.0 million increase in transportation expenses in our European operations, which is primarily attributable to the growth of operations and is also impacted by the weakening of the U.S. dollar in comparison to the British pound sterling in the year ended December 31, 2002 versus the year ended December 31, 2001. Product Cost of Sales and Other Cost of Sales Product and other cost of sales are highly correlated to complementary revenue streams. Product cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2002 was consistent with the year ended December 31, 2001 as a percentage of product revenues. The decrease in other cost of sales of $2.4 million is directly attributable to decreases in variable expenses from our changing mix of complementary services and will vary as our mix of special projects changes from period to period. 43 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses are comprised of the following expenses (in thousands): % of Consolidated Revenues 2001 2002 Dollar Change Percent Change 2001 2002 Percent Change (Favorable)/Unfavorable General and Administrative $ 175,639 $ 179,550 $ 3,911 2.2 % 14.8 % 13.6 % (1.2 )% Sales, Marketing & Account Management 70,956 85,932 14,976 21.1 % 6.0 % 6.5 % 0.5 % Information Technology 50,866 55,971 5,105 10.0 % 4.3 % 4.2 % (0.1 %) Bad Debt Expense 10,339 11,597 1,258 12.2 % 0.9 % 0.9 % $ 307,800 $ 333,050 $ 25,250 8.2 % 26.0 % 25.3 % (0.7 )% General and Administrative The dollar increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to an increase in professional fees, office facilities, telephone, and supplies expenses. However, these costs were consistent with the increasing scale of our business, as indicated by the decrease of 1.2% as a percentage of consolidated revenues. Increased overhead leverage offset an increase in wages due to normal inflation and merit increases. Sales, Marketing & Account Management The majority of our sales, marketing and account management expenses are labor related and are primarily driven by the headcount in each of these departments. Throughout the year ended December 31, 2002, we continued to expand our sales force and account management teams. We added approximately 60 new sales and marketing employees since December 31, 2001, a 15% increase in headcount. Information Technology Information technology expenses increased $5.1 million, or 10.0%, to $56.0 million (4.2% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2002 principally due to increased compensation costs as a result of increased headcount and normal inflation and merit increases, as well as, a decrease in capitalizable projects. Additionally, these costs were offset by savings of $1.7 million realized through improved management of information technology telecommunication expenses and a reduction of $1.1 million of information technology equipment lease expenses. Bad Debt Expense Consolidated bad debt expense increased $1.3 million, or 12.2%, to $11.6 million (0.9% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2002. Our projects to centralize collection efforts within our divisions have contributed significantly to holding bad debt expense flat as a percentage of consolidated revenues. Depreciation, Amortization, Merger Related Expenses and Loss on Disposal/Writedown of Property, Plant and Equipment, Net Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense decreased $44.3 million, or 28.9%, to $109.0 million (8.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $153.3 million (12.9% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2001. Depreciation 44 expense increased $16.7 million, primarily due to the additional depreciation expense related to capital expenditures, including storage systems, which include racking, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and software, and buildings, and depreciation associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases. Depreciation associated with our digital initiatives increased $3.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2002 as a result of software and hardware assets placed in service during late 2001 and throughout the years ended December 31, 2002. In the year ended December 31, 2002, the recharacterization of eight properties added in the year ended December 31, 2001 under one of our synthetic lease programs, as well as nine properties added to such program in the year ended December 31, 2002, resulted in $1.7 million of additional depreciation. Amortization expense decreased $61.3 million, primarily due to eliminating amortization expense related to goodwill in accordance with SFAS No. 142. See Note 2(g) to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and " Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for Acquisitions." Merger related expenses are certain expenses directly related to our merger with Pierce Leahy that cannot be capitalized and include system conversion costs, costs of exiting certain facilities, severance, relocation and pay to stay payments and other transaction related costs. Merger related expenses were $0.8 million (0.1% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to $3.7 million (0.3% of consolidated revenues) for the same period of 2001. All merger related activities associated with the Pierce Leahy merger were completed in the year ended December 31, 2002. Consolidated loss on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net for the year ended December 31, 2002 consisted of disposals and asset write downs partially offset by a gain of $2.1 million recorded on the sale of a property in the U.K. during the second quarter of 2002. Operating Income As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated operating income increased $108.5 million, or 75.3%, to $252.6 million (19.2% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $144.1 million (12.2% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2001. OIBDA As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated OIBDA increased $64.2 million, or 21.6%, to $361.6 million (27.4% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $297.4 million (25.1% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2001. Interest Expense, Net Consolidated interest expense, net increased $1.9 million, or 1.4%, to $136.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $134.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. This increase was primarily attributable to $6.2 million of interest expense associated with 17 properties within one of our Variable Interest Entities and increased long term borrowings through our 2001 bond offerings. These increases were offset by a decline in our overall weighted average interest rate resulting from a general decline in interest rates coupled with our refinancing efforts. 45 Other (Income) Expense, Net Significant items included in other (income) expense, net include the following (in thousands): 2001 2002 Change Foreign currency transaction (gains) and losses $ 10,437 $ (5,045 ) $ (15,482 ) Debt extinguishment expense 19,978 5,431 (14,547 ) Loss on investments 6,900 901 (5,999 ) Other, net 170 148 (22 ) $ 37,485 $ 1,435 $ (36,050 ) Foreign currency gains of $5.0 million based on period end exchange rates were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2002 primarily due to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar and British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar as these currencies relate to our intercompany balances with our Canadian and European subsidiaries. During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Canadian dollar had weakened compared to the U.S. dollar and was the primary reason for the foreign currency loss of $10.4 million, based on period end exchange rates. The loss on investments is the result of a $6.9 million impairment charge taken on our investment in convertible preferred stock of a technology development company in the third quarter of 2001. In the year ended December 31, 2002, we recorded $0.9 million of similar write downs. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we recorded a debt extinguishment charge of $1.2 million related to the early retirement of debt in conjunction with the refinancing of our revolving credit facility and in the fourth quarter of 2002 we recorded a debt extinguishment charge of $4.2 related to the early retirement of a portion of our 91/8% notes in conjunction with our underwritten public offering of the 73/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2015 (the "73/4% notes"). For the year ended December 31, 2001, we recorded a debt extinguishment charge of $20.0 million related to the early retirement of the 111/8% senior subordinated notes and 101/8% senior subordinated notes in conjunction with our underwritten public offerings of the 85/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013 (the "85/8% notes"). The charges consisted primarily of the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs and call and tender premiums associated with the extinguished debt. Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes was $47.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to $17.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The effective rate was 41.3% for the year ended December 31, 2002 and the primary reconciling item between the statutory rate of 35% and the effective rate is state income taxes (net of federal benefit). The effective rate was (63.6%) for the year ended December 31, 2001. During the year ended December 31, 2001, we amortized non deductible goodwill for book purposes, however, as result of the adoption of SFAS No. 142 in 2002, goodwill amortization ceased, thereby reducing the effective rate and some of the volatility with respect to our effective rate in the future. Additionally, the 2001 effective rate was impacted by state income taxes (net of federal benefit). Minority Interest, Discontinued Operations, and Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle Minority interest in earnings (losses) of subsidiaries, net resulted in a charge to income of $3.6 million (0.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2002. This represents our minority partners share of earnings (losses) in our majority owned international subsidiaries that are consolidated in our operating results. In the year ended December 31, 2001, our subsidiaries incurred losses and the minority interest resulted in a credit to income of $1.9 million. The improved results are primarily a result of (1) the elimination of goodwill amortization expense in accordance with 46 SFAS No. 142, (2) increased profitability in our European business and (3) our European minority partners share ($0.7 million, net of tax) of the $2.1 million gain recorded on the sale of a property held by one of our European subsidiaries during the second quarter of 2002. In the fourth quarter of 2002, we recorded income from discontinued operations of $1.1 million (net of tax of $0.8 million) as a result of resolving several outstanding contingencies remaining from the sale of the Arcus Staffing Resources, Inc. business unit in 1999. In the first quarter of 2002, we recorded a non cash charge for the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of $6.4 million (net of minority interest of $8.5 million) as a result of our implementation of SFAS No. 142. There was no such charge in 2001. Net Income (Loss) As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated net income increased $102.3 million, or 232.3%, to $58.3 (4.4% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2002 from a net loss of $44.1 (3.7% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2001. Segment Analysis (in thousands) The results of our various operating segments are discussed below. In general, our business records management segment offers records management, secure shredding, healthcare information services, vital records services, and service and courier operations in the U.S. and Canada. Our off site data protection segment offers data backup and disaster recovery services, vital records services, service and courier operations, and intellectual property protection services in the U.S. Our international segment offers elements of all our product and services lines outside the U.S. and Canada. Our corporate and other segment includes our corporate overhead functions and our fulfillment, consulting and digital archiving services. Business Records Management Off Site Data Protection International Corporate & Other Segment Revenue Year Ended December 31, 2002 $ 944,845 $ 239,081 $ 109,381 $ 25,190 December 31, 2001 861,302 209,429 89,475 25,512 Increase (Decrease) in Revenues $ 83,543 $ 29,652 $ 19,906 $ (322 ) Percentage Increase in Revenues 9.7 % 14.2 % 22.2 % (1.3 %) Segment Contribution (1) Year Ended December 31, 2002 $ 262,541 $ 61,729 $ 21,988 $ 16,890 December 31, 2001 227,164 50,254 16,250 7,712 Segment Contribution (1) as a Percentage of Segment Revenue Year Ended December 31, 2002 27.8 % 25.8 % 20.1 % 67.1 % December 31, 2001 26.4 % 24.0 % 18.2 % 30.2 % (1)See Note 12 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for definition of Contribution and for the basis on which allocations are made and a reconciliation of Contribution to net income (loss) on a consolidated basis. 47 Business Records Management Revenue in our business records management segment increased 9.7% primarily due to increased storage revenues, strong special projects revenues and acquisitions. The increase in Contribution, which we use as our internal measurement of financial performance and as the basis for allocating resources to our segments, as a percent of segment revenue for our business records management segment is primarily due to labor and transportation efficiencies gained by the increasing scale of our business and the completion of our integration of Pierce Leahy. Lower facilities expenditures, including rent expense and utilities, and lower bad debt expense resulting from our improved collection efforts also contributed to the improvement of Contribution, as a percentage of segment revenue. This increase was partially offset by higher insurance premiums for property and casualty insurance and an increased investment in our sales force. Reductions in spending related to telecommunication expenditures, as a percentage of segment revenue, also contributed to increasing Contribution. Off Site Data Protection Revenue in our off site data protection segment increased 14.2% primarily due to internal revenue growth from both existing and new customers. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue for our off site data protection segment increased primarily due to improved labor and transportation management. This increase was partially offset by higher insurance premiums for property and casualty insurance and an increase in bad debt expense. International Revenue in our international segment increased primarily due to increased sales efforts and a large service project in the U.K., as well as, acquisitions completed in Europe and South America in the fourth quarter of 2002. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue for our international segment increased primarily due to improved gross margins from our European operations and reduced bad debt expense. This increase was partially offset by higher insurance premiums for property and casualty insurance and reduced margins in our South American operations due to the deteriorating local economic conditions and devaluation of the currency in Argentina. Unfavorable currency fluctuations in South America and Mexico during the year ended December 31, 2002 reduced revenues, as measured in U.S. dollars, by $5.0 million. This reduction was offset by the impact of favorable currency fluctuations during the year ended December 31, 2002 in Europe that increased revenue $2.9 million when compared to the prior year rates. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following is a summary of our cash balances and cash flows for the years ended 2001, 2002 and 2003 (in thousands). 2001 2002 2003 Cash flows provided by operating activities $ 160,909 $ 254,948 $ 288,693 Cash flows used in investing activities (278,136 ) (247,757 ) (586,634 ) Cash flows provided by financing activities 134,901 27,098 315,054 Cash and cash equivalents at the end of year $ 21,359 $ 56,292 $ 74,683 Net cash provided by operating activities was $288.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to $254.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in operating income and non cash items, such as depreciation, amortization, debt extinguishment expenses and deferred income taxes. The net change in assets and liabilities primarily associated with growth in revenues and the resulting increase in receivables and disbursements to 48 vendors contributed $2.0 million to cash flows from operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to $27.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2002. We have made significant capital expenditures, additions to customer relationship costs and other investments, primarily acquisitions. Our capital expenditures are primarily related to growth and include investments in storage systems, information systems and discretionary investments in real estate. Cash paid for our capital expenditures and additions to customer relationship and acquisition costs during the year ended December 31, 2003 amounted to $204.5 million and $12.6 million, respectively. These investments have been funded entirely through cash flows from operations, as was the case in the year ended December 31, 2002, and we expect this to be the case again in the year ended December 31, 2004. In addition, we received proceeds from sales of property and equipment of $11.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2003. Excluding any potential acquisitions, we expect our capital expenditures to be between approximately $210 million and approximately $240 million in the year ending December 31, 2004. In the year ended December 31, 2003, we paid net cash consideration of $381.2 million for acquisitions and other investments including $333.0 million for the acquisition of Hays IMS. Cash flows from operations funded all but the Hays IMS acquisition, which was funded through borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and the net proceeds from other financing transactions. In the year ended December 31, 2002, cash flows from operations funded all of our acquisitions. Net cash provided by financing activities was $315.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. During the year we had gross borrowings under our revolving credit facilities of $744.0 million and we received net proceeds of $617.2 million from the issuance of our 73/4% notes and our 65/8% notes. We used the proceeds from these financing transactions to repay debt and term loans ($698.8 million), retire senior subordinated notes ($374.3 million) and to partially fund the acquisition of Hays IMS. Since December 31, 2003, we have completed three acquisitions for total consideration of approximately $26 million. In addition, we acquired the remaining 49.9% equity interest in IME for approximately $154 million. These transactions will be reflected in our consolidated statement of cash flows in the first quarter of 2004. We are highly leveraged and expect to continue to be highly leveraged for the foreseeable future. Our consolidated debt as of December 31, 2003 was comprised of the following (in thousands): Revolving Credit Facility due 2005 $ 142,280 Term Loan due 2008 248,750 81/8% Senior Notes due 2008 18,768 81/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011(1) 149,670 85/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013(1) 481,075 73/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2015(1) 441,331 65/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016(1) 314,071 Real Estate Term Loans 202,647 Real Estate Mortgages 17,584 Seller Notes 12,607 Other 61,145 Long term Debt 2,089,928 Less Current Portion (115,781 ) Long term Debt, Net of Current Portion $ 1,974,147 (1)These debt instruments are collectively referred to as the "Parent Notes." The Parent notes, along with our revolving credit facility and term loan, are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a 49 senior subordinated basis, by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries (the "Guarantors"). These guarantees are joint and several obligations of the Guarantors. The remainder of our subsidiaries do not guarantee the Parent notes or the revolving credit facility and term loan. Our indentures use OIBDA based calculations as primary measures of financial performance, including leverage ratios. Our key bond leverage ratio, as calculated per our bond indentures, increased to 5.0 as of December 31, 2003 from 4.8 as of December 31, 2002. The increase was primarily attributable to indebtedness incurred by us and lent to IME to fund IMEs acquisition of the European operations of Hays IMS. Noncompliance with this leverage ratio would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity. Subsequent to December 31, 2003, our key bond leverage ratio decreased to 4.9. The decrease was the result of the partial repayment by IME of the financing we provided to acquire Hays IMS offset by our January 2004 offering of 150 million British pounds sterling in aggregate principal amount of our 71/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 (the "71/4% notes") and the related use of the proceeds to acquire Mentmores 49.9% equity interest in IME and to repay existing debts. Our target for this ratio is generally in the range of 4.5 to 5.5 while the maximum ratio allowable under the bond indentures is 6.5. Our ability to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, working capital levels and capital structure, which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors which may be beyond our control. There can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future financings will be available on acceptable terms or in amounts sufficient to enable us to service or refinance our indebtedness, or to make necessary capital expenditures. Our indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants including covenants that restrict our ability to complete acquisitions, pay cash dividends, incur indebtedness, make investments, sell assets and take certain other corporate actions. The covenants do not contain a rating trigger. Therefore, a change in our debt rating would not trigger a default under our indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness. As of December 31, 2003, we were in compliance with all material debt covenants and agreements. As of December 31, 2003, we had $142.3 million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility, all of which was denominated in British pounds sterling in the amount of GBP 80.0 million. We also had various outstanding letters of credit totaling $34.4 million. The remaining availability under the revolving credit facility on December 31, 2003 was $223.3 million based on our current level of external debt and the leverage ratio under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The interest rate in effect was 5.6% as of December 31, 2003. In January 2003, we redeemed the remaining $23.2 million of outstanding principal amount of our 91/8% notes, at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) of 104.563%, plus accrued and unpaid interest, with proceeds from our underwritten public offering of $100.0 million in aggregate principal of our 73/4% notes. We recorded a charge to other (income) expense, net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations of $1.8 million in the first quarter of 2003 related to the early retirement of the remaining 91/8% notes. In March 2003, we completed two debt exchanges, which resulted in the issuance of $31.3 million in face value of our 73/4% notes and the retirement of $30.0 million of our 83/4% notes. These non cash debt exchanges resulted in carryover basis and, therefore, no gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt in accordance with EITF No. 96 19, "Debtors Accounting for Modification or Exchange of Debt Instruments." These exchanges result in a lower interest rate and, therefore, lower interest expense in future periods, as well as extend the maturity of our debt obligations. From time to time, we may enter into similar exchange transactions that we deem appropriate. 50 In April 2003, we completed an underwritten public offering of an additional $300 million in aggregate principal amount of our 73/4% notes, which were issued at a price to investors of 104% of par, implying an effective yield to worst of 7.066%. Our net proceeds of $307.3 million, after paying the underwriters discounts, commissions and transaction fees, were used to fund our offer to purchase and consent solicitation relating to our outstanding 83/4% notes, redeem the 83/4% notes not purchased in the offer, repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility, repay other indebtedness and pay for acquisitions. In April 2003, we received and accepted tenders for $143.3 million of the $220 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 83/4% notes. In May 2003, we redeemed the remaining $76.7 million of outstanding principal amount of our 83/4% notes, at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) of 104.375%, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We recorded a charge to other (income) expense, net of $13.8 million in the second quarter of 2003 related to the early retirement of the 83/4% notes, which consists of redemption premiums and transaction costs, as well as original issue discount and unamortized deferred financing costs related to the 83/4% notes. In June 2003, we completed an underwritten public offering of $150 million in aggregate principal amount of our 65/8% notes. The 65/8% notes were issued at a price to investors of 100% of par. Our net proceeds of $147.5 million, after paying the underwriters discounts, commissions and transaction fees, were used to redeem $50 million in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Subsidiary notes in the third quarter of 2003 and pay for acquisitions. In July 2003, using proceeds from our June 2003 offering of 65/8% notes, we redeemed $50 million of outstanding principal amount of the Subsidiary notes, at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) of 104.063%, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We recorded a charge to other (income) expense, net of $5.5 million in the third quarter of 2003 related to the early retirement of these Subsidiary notes, which consists of redemption premiums and transaction costs, as well as original issue discount related to these Subsidiary notes. In July 2003, we and IME completed the acquisition of Hays IMS in two simultaneous transactions. IME acquired the European operations of Hays IMS for aggregate cash consideration (including transaction costs) of approximately 190.0 million British pounds sterling ($309.0 million), while we acquired the U.S. operations of Hays IMS for aggregate cash consideration (including transaction costs) of 14.5 million British pounds sterling ($24.0 million). Both transactions were on a cash and debt free basis. We provided the initial financing totaling 190.5 million British pounds sterling to IME for all of the consideration associated with the acquisition of the European operations of Hays IMS using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We recorded a foreign currency gain of $27.8 million in other (income) expense, net for this intercompany balance for the year ended December 31, 2003. In order to minimize the foreign currency risk associated with providing IME with the consideration necessary for the acquisition of the European operations of Hay IMS, we borrowed 80.0 million British pounds sterling under our revolving credit facility to create a natural hedge. We recorded a foreign currency loss of $11.5 million on the translation of this revolving credit balance to U.S. dollars in other (income) expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2003. Additionally, on July 16, 2003 we entered into two cross currency swaps with a combined notional value of 100.0 million British pounds sterling. These swaps each have a term of one year and at maturity we have a right to receive $162.8 million in exchange for 100.0 million British pounds sterling. We have not designated these swaps as hedges and, therefore, all mark to market fluctuations of the swaps are recorded in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of operations. We have recorded, as of December 31, 2003, a foreign currency loss of $19.0 million in other (income) expense, net. In December 2003, we completed an underwritten public offering of an additional $170 million in aggregate principal amount of our 65/8% notes, which were issued at a price to investors of 96.5% of 51 par, implying an effective yield to worst of 7.06%. Our net proceeds of $161.3 million, after paying the underwriters discounts, commissions and transaction fees, were used to redeem $65.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Subsidiary notes in the fourth quarter of 2003, repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility, repay other indebtedness and pay for acquisitions. In December 2003, using proceeds from our December 2003 offering of 65/8% notes, we redeemed $65.0 million of outstanding principal amount of the Subsidiary notes, at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) of 104.313%, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We recorded a charge to other (income) expense, net of $7.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 related to the early retirement of these Subsidiary notes, which consists of redemption premiums and transaction costs, as well as original issue discount related to these Subsidiary notes. In January 2004, we completed an offering of 150 million British pounds sterling in aggregate principal amount of our 71/4% notes, which were issued at a price of 100.0% of par. Our net proceeds of 146.9 million British pounds sterling, after paying the initial purchasers discounts, commissions and transaction fees, were used to fund our acquisition of Mentmore plcs 49.9% equity interest in IME for total consideration of 82.5 million British pounds sterling, to redeem $20.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Subsidiary notes in the first quarter of 2004, repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility, repay other indebtedness and pay for other acquisitions. In February 2004, using proceeds from our January 2004 offering of 71/4% notes, we redeemed the remaining $20 million of outstanding principal amount of the Subsidiary notes, at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) of 104.063%, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We will record a charge of approximately $2 million to other (income) expense, net in the first quarter of 2004 related to the early retirement of these remaining Subsidiary notes, which consists of redemption premiums and transaction costs, as well as original issue discount related to these Subsidiary notes. In February 2004, we completed the acquisition of Mentmore plcs 49.9% equity interest in IME for total consideration of 82.5 million British pounds sterling ($154 million) in cash from proceeds of our 71/4% notes issued in January 2004. Included in this amount is the repayment of all trade and working capital funding owed to Mentmore by IME. Completion of the transaction gives us 100% ownership of IME, affording us full access to all future cash flows and greater strategic and financial flexibility. This transaction should have no impact on revenue or operating income since we already fully consolidate IMEs financial results. Since we will be using the purchase method of accounting for this acquisition, 49.9% of the net assets of IME will be adjusted to reflect their fair market value if different from their current carrying value. As a result, we expect this transaction will increase depreciation and amortization expenses going forward. Additionally, we will record an increase in interest expense, net associated with the 71/4% notes used to fund this acquisition and will no longer record the minority interest in earnings of subsidiaries, net related to Mentmores ownership interest in IME. In March 2004, IME and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement (the "IME Credit Agreement") with a syndicate of European lenders. The IME Credit Agreement provides for maximum borrowing availability in the principal amount of 210 million British pounds sterling, including a 100 million British pounds sterling revolving credit facility, (which includes the ability to borrow in certain other foreign currencies), a 100 million British pounds sterling term loan, and a 10 million British pounds sterling overdraft protection line. The revolving credit facility matures on March 2, 2009. The term loan facility is payable in three installments; two installments of 20 million British pounds sterling on March 2, 2007 and 2008, respectively, and the final payment of the remaining balance on March 2, 2009. The interest rate on borrowings under the IME Credit Agreement is based on LIBOR and varies depending on IMEs choice of interest rate period, plus an applicable margin. The IME Credit Agreement includes various financial covenants applicable to the results of IME, which may restrict IMEs ability to incur indebtedness under the IME Credit 52 Agreement and with third parties. Each of IMEs subsidiaries will either guarantee the obligations or pledge shares to secure the IME Credit Agreement. We have not guaranteed or otherwise provided security for the IME Credit Agreement nor have any of our U.S., Canadian, Mexican and South American subsidiaries. In March 2004, IME borrowed approximately 147 million British pounds sterling under the IME Credit Agreement, including the full amount of the term loan. IME used those proceeds to repay us 135 million British pounds sterling related to our initial financing of the acquisition of the European operations of Hays IMS. We expect to use those proceeds to: (1) pay down approximately $104 million of real estate term loans, (2) settle all obligations associated with terminating our two cross currency swaps used to hedge the foreign currency impact of our intercompany financing with IME, and (3) to pay down amounts outstanding under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. After the initial balance, IMEs availability under the IME Credit Agreement, based on its current level of external debt and the leverage ratio under the IME Credit Agreement, was approximately 9 million British pounds sterling. The real estate term loans held by our Variable Interest Entities have always been and continue to be treated as indebtedness for purposes of our financial covenants under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. As of the date they were consolidated into our financial statements, they were also considered indebtedness under our Indentures for our Senior Subordinated Notes and our Subsidiary notes. As of December 31, 2002 and 2003, these real estate term loans amounted to $202.6 million. No further financing is currently available to our Variable Interest Entities to fund further property acquisitions. See Notes 3, 4 and 5 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and " Critical Accounting Policies." The details of each real estate term loan is a follows: A $47.5 million real estate term loan made in October 1998 bearing interest at various variable interest rates based on LIBOR (London Inter Bank Offered Rate) plus an applicable margin. This real estate term note has a principal payment due on March 31, 2004 of $28.8 million with the remaining $18.7 million maturing on March 31, 2005. This real estate term loan is expected to be repaid in March 2004. A $56.4 million real estate term loan made in July 1999 bearing interest at various variable interest rates based on LIBOR plus an applicable margin. This real estate term note matures on December 31, 2005. This real estate term loan is expected to be repaid in March 2004. A $98.7 million real estate term loan made in May 2001 bearing interest at various variable interest rates based on LIBOR plus an applicable margin. This real estate term note matures on November 22, 2007. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2003 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 Years Long term Debt (including Capital Lease Obligations) $ 2,087,127 $ 116,998 $ 228,472 $ 347,209 $ 1,394,448 Operating Lease Obligations 902,884 135,512 222,238 158,722 386,412 Purchase Obligations 42,528 16,011 23,888 2,629 Total $ 3,032,539 $ 268,521 $ 474,598 $ 508,560 $ 1,780,860 In connection with some of our acquisitions, we have potential earn out obligations that would be payable in the event businesses we acquired meet certain operational objectives. These payments are 53 based on the future results of these operations and our estimate of the maximum contingent earn out payments we would be required to make under all such agreements as of December 31, 2003 is approximately $5 million. We expect to meet our cash flow requirements for the next twelve months from cash generated from operations, existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other financings, which may include secured credit facilities, securitizations and mortgage or capital lease financings. See Notes 5, 10 and 13 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Net Operating Loss Carryforwards At December 31, 2003, we had estimated net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $123 million for federal income tax purposes. As a result of such loss carryforwards, cash paid for income taxes has historically been substantially lower than the provision for income taxes. These net operating loss carryforwards do not include approximately $103 million of potential preacquisition net operating loss carryforwards of Arcus Group, Inc. and certain foreign acquisitions. Any tax benefit realized related to preacquisition net operating loss carryforwards will be recorded as a reduction of goodwill when, and if, realized. The Arcus Group carryforwards begin to expire in two years. As a result of these loss carryforwards, we do not expect to pay any significant international, U.S. federal and state income taxes in 2004. Seasonality Historically, our businesses have not been subject to seasonality in any material respect. Inflation Certain of our expenses, such as wages and benefits, insurance, occupancy costs and equipment repair and replacement, are subject to normal inflationary pressures. Although to date we have been able to offset inflationary cost increases through increased operating efficiencies and the negotiation of favorable long term real estate leases, we can give no assurance that we will be able to offset any future inflationary cost increases through similar efficiencies, leases or increased storage or service charges.  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Interest Rate Risk In December 2000, January 2001 and May 2001, we and our Variable Interest Entities, which we now consolidate, entered into a total of four derivative financial contracts, which are variable for fixed interest rate swaps consisting of (a) two contracts for interest payments payable on our term loan of an aggregate principal amount of $195.5 million, (b) one contract for interest payments payable (previously certain variable operating lease commitments payable) on our real estate term loans of an aggregate principal amount of $47.5 million and (c) one contract for interest payments payable on our real estate term loans of an aggregate principal amount of $97.0 million. See Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and "Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies" in this Form 10 K. After consideration of the swap contracts mentioned above, as of December 31, 2003, we had $308.1 million of variable rate debt outstanding with a weighted average variable interest rate of 4.72%, and $1,781.8 million of fixed rate debt outstanding. As of December 31, 2003, 85% of our total debt outstanding was fixed. If the weighted average variable interest rate on our variable rate debt had increased by 1%, our net income for the year ended December 31, 2003 would have been reduced by $1.7 million. See Note 5 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our 54 long term indebtedness, including the fair values of such indebtedness as of December 31, 2003 included in this Form 10 K. Currency Risk Our investments in IME, Iron Mountain Canada Corporation, Iron Mountain South America, Ltd. and other international investments may be subject to risks and uncertainties related to fluctuations in currency valuation. Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. However, our international revenues are generated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate, primarily the Canadian dollar and British pound sterling. The currencies of many Latin American countries have experienced substantial volatility and depreciation in the past, including the Argentine peso. In addition, one of our Canadian subsidiaries, Iron Mountain Canada Corporation, has U.S. dollar denominated debt. Declines in the value of the local currencies in which we are paid relative to the U.S. dollar will cause revenues in U.S. dollar terms to decrease and dollar denominated liabilities to increase in local currency. We also have several intercompany obligations between our foreign subsidiaries and Iron Mountain and our U.S. based subsidiaries. These intercompany obligations are primarily denominated in the local currency of the foreign subsidiary. Our currency exposures to intercompany borrowings are generally unhedged, except as discussed below. We provided the initial financing to IME for all of the consideration associated with the acquisition of the European operations of Hays IMS using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. In order to minimize the foreign currency risk associated with providing IME with the consideration necessary for the acquisition of Hay IMS, we borrowed 80.0 million British pounds sterling under our revolving credit facility to create a natural hedge. Additionally, on July 16, 2003 we entered into two cross currency swaps with a combined notional value of 100.0 million British pounds sterling. These swaps each have a term of one year and at maturity we have a right to receive $162.8 million in exchange for 100.0 million British pounds sterling. We have not designated these swaps as hedges and, therefore, all mark to market fluctuations of the swaps are recorded in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of operations. The impact of devaluation or depreciating currency on an entity depends on the residual effect on the local economy and the ability of an entity to raise prices and or reduce expenses. Due to our constantly changing currency exposure and the potential substantial volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange fluctuations on our business. The effect of a change in foreign exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the "Accumulated Other Comprehensive Items" component of shareholders equity. A 10% depreciation in year end 2003 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a $14.5 million reduction in our shareholders equity.
