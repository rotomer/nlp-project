Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with "Item 6. Selected Financial Data" and the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto and the other financial and operating information included elsewhere in this filing. This discussion contains "forward looking statements," as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and in other federal securities laws. See "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements" on page ii of this filing. Overview Our revenues consist of storage revenues as well as service and storage material sales revenues. Storage revenues, which are considered a key performance indicator for the information storage and protection services industry, consist of largely recurring periodic charges related to the storage of materials (either on a per unit or per cubic foot of records basis), which are typically retained by customers for many years, and have accounted for over 57% of total consolidated revenues in each of the last five years. Our quarterly revenues from these fixed periodic storage fees have grown for 64 consecutive quarters. In certain circumstances, based upon customer requirements, storage revenues include periodic charges associated with normal, recurring service activities. Service and storage material sales revenues are comprised of charges for related service activities and courier operations and the sale of storage materials. Related core service revenues arise from additions of new records, temporary removal of records from storage, refiling of removed records, destructions of records, permanent withdrawals from storage and the secure shredding of sensitive records. Our complementary services revenues arise from special project work, providing fulfillment services, consulting services and sales of software licenses, specially designed storage containers, magnetic media including computer tapes and related supplies. Courier operations consist primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request. Customers are generally billed on a monthly basis on contractually agreed upon terms. Our consolidated revenues are subject to variations caused by the net effect of foreign currency translation on revenue derived from outside the U.S. For the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004, we derived 19.0% and 26.8%, respectively, of our total revenues from outside the U.S. The increase in total revenues derived from outside the U.S. is primarily a result of our acquisition of Hays IMS. Cost of sales (excluding depreciation) consists primarily of wages and benefits for field personnel, facility occupancy costs including rent and utilities, transportation expenses including vehicle leases and fuel, other product cost of sales and other equipment costs and supplies. Of these, wages and benefits and facility occupancy costs are the most significant. Trends in total wages and benefits dollars and as a percentage of total consolidated revenue are influenced by changes in headcount and compensation levels, achievement of incentive compensation targets, workforce productivity and variability in costs associated with medical insurance and workers compensation. Trends in facility occupancy costs are similarly impacted by the total number of facilities we occupy, the mix of properties we own versus properties we occupy under operating leases, fluctuations in per square foot occupancy costs, and the levels of utilization of these properties. The expansion of our European operations, including the acquisition of Hays IMS, and secure shredding operations has resulted in changes to the mix of certain cost of sales components. Our European and secure shredding operations are more labor intensive; therefore, our labor expense will be higher as a percentage of revenue as compared to our North American information storage and protection operations. In addition, our secure shredding operations incur higher transportation costs and lower facility costs, as a percentage of consolidated revenue, as compared to our North American information storage and protection operations. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits for management, administrative, information technology, sales, account management and marketing 21 personnel, as well as expenses related to communications and data processing, travel, professional fees, bad debts, training, office equipment and supplies. Trends in total wages and benefits dollars and as a percentage of total consolidated revenue are influenced by changes in headcount and compensation levels, achievement of incentive compensation targets, workforce productivity and variability in costs associated with medical insurance. Our adoption of the measurement provisions of SFAS No. 123 as amended by SFAS No. 148 has resulted in increasing amounts of selling, general and administrative expenses. We began using the fair value method of accounting in our financial statements beginning January 1, 2003 using the prospective method. The prospective method involves recognizing expense for the fair value for all awards granted or modified in the year of adoption and thereafter with no expense recognition for previous awards. The overhead structure of our expanding European operations, as compared to our North American operations, is more labor intensive and has not achieved the same level of overhead leverage, which may result in an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of consolidated revenue, as our European operations become a more meaningful percentage of our consolidated results. Our depreciation and amortization charges result primarily from the capital intensive nature of our business. The principal components of depreciation relate to storage systems, which include racking, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and software, and buildings. Amortization relates primarily to customer relationships and acquisition costs. In February 2004, we completed the acquisition of the 49.9% equity interest held by Mentmore in IME. This transaction had no material impact on revenue or operating income since we already fully consolidate IMEs financial results. Since we have used the purchase method of accounting for this acquisition, 49.9% of the net assets of IME have been adjusted to reflect their fair market value if different from their carrying value on the acquisition date. As a result, this transaction increased depreciation and amortization expenses. Additionally, we have recorded an increase in interest expense, net associated with debt used to fund this acquisition and no longer record the minority interest in earnings of subsidiaries, net related to Mentmores ownership interest in IME. Our consolidated expenses are subject to variations caused by the net effect of foreign currency translation on expenses incurred by our entities outside the U.S. During 2004, we have seen increases in both revenues and expenses as a result of the strengthening of the British pound sterling, the Euro, and the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. It is difficult to predict how much foreign currency exchange rates will fluctuate in the future and how those fluctuations will impact individual balances reported in our consolidated statement of operations. Given the relative increase in our international operations, these fluctuations may become material on individual balances. However, because both the revenues and expenses are denominated in the local currency of the country in which they are derived or incurred, the impact of currency fluctuations of our operating income, operating margin and net income is mitigated. Non GAAP Measures Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization, or OIBDA OIBDA is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization expenses. OIBDA Margin is calculated by dividing OIBDA by total revenues. Our management uses these measures to evaluate the operating performance of our consolidated business. As such, we believe these measures provide relevant and useful information to our current and potential investors. We use OIBDA for planning purposes and multiples of current or projected OIBDA based calculations in conjunction with our discounted cash flow models to determine our overall enterprise valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets. We believe OIBDA and OIBDA Margin are useful measures to evaluate our ability to grow our revenues faster than our operating expenses and they are an integral part of our internal reporting system utilized by management to assess and evaluate the operating performance of our 22 business. OIBDA does not include certain items, specifically (1) minority interest in earnings (losses) of subsidiaries, net, (2) other (income) expense, net, (3) income from discontinued operations and loss on sale of discontinued operations and (4) cumulative effect of change in accounting principle that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results. OIBDA also does not include interest expense, net and the provision for income taxes. These expenses are associated with our capitalization and tax structures, which management does not consider when evaluating the profitability of our core operations. Finally, OIBDA does not include depreciation and amortization expenses, in order to eliminate the impact of capital investments, which management believes is better evaluated by comparing capital expenditures to incremental revenue generated and as a percentage of total revenues. OIBDA and OIBDA Margin should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the Unites States of America, or GAAP, such as operating or net income or cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP). Reconciliation of OIBDA to Operating Income and Net Income (In Thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2002 2003 2004 OIBDA $ 361,578 $ 435,811 $ 508,125 Less: Depreciation and Amortization 108,992 130,918 163,629 Operating Income 252,586 304,893 344,496 Less: Interest Expense, Net 136,632 150,468 185,749 Other Expense (Income), Net 1,435 (2,564 ) (7,988 ) Provision for Income Taxes 47,318 66,730 69,574 Minority Interest 3,629 5,622 2,970 Income from Discontinued Operations (1,116 ) Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle 6,396 Net Income $ 58,292 $ 84,637 $ 94,191 Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and for the period then ended. On an on going basis, we evaluate the estimates used, including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos, impairments of tangible and intangible assets, income taxes, purchase accounting related reserves, self insurance liabilities, incentive compensation liabilities, litigation liabilities and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience, actuarial estimates, current conditions and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and are not readily apparent from other sources. We use these estimates to assist us in the identification and assessment of the accounting treatment necessary with respect to commitments and contingencies. Actual results may 23 differ from these estimates. Our critical accounting policies include the following, which are listed in no particular order: Accounting for Acquisitions Part of our growth strategy has included the acquisition of numerous businesses. The purchase price of these acquisitions has been determined after due diligence of the acquired business, market research, strategic planning, and the forecasting of expected future results and synergies. Estimated future results and expected synergies are subject to revisions as we integrate each acquisition and attempt to leverage resources. Each acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting as defined under the applicable accounting standards at the date of each acquisition, including, Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16, "Accounting for Business Combinations," and more recently, SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations." Accounting for these acquisitions has resulted in the capitalization of the cost in excess of fair value of the net assets acquired in each of these acquisitions as goodwill. We estimated the fair values of the assets acquired in each acquisition as of the date of acquisition and these estimates are subject to adjustment. These estimates are subject to final assessments of the fair value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, operating leases and deferred income taxes. We complete these assessments within one year of the date of acquisition. We are not aware of any information that would indicate that the final purchase price allocations for acquisitions completed in 2004 would differ meaningfully from preliminary estimates. See Note 7 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In connection with each of our acquisitions, we have undertaken certain restructurings of the acquired businesses to realize efficiencies and potential cost savings. Our restructuring activities include the elimination of duplicate facilities, reductions in staffing levels, and other costs associated with exiting certain activities of the businesses we acquire. The estimated cost of these restructuring activities are included as costs of the acquisition and are recorded as goodwill consistent with the guidance of Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 95 3, "Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination." While we finalize our plans to restructure the businesses we acquire within one year of the date of acquisition, it may take more than one year to complete all activities related to the restructuring of an acquired business. Our acquisitions have resulted in a significant accumulation of goodwill. Beginning on January 1, 2002, we ceased to amortize goodwill in accordance with SFAS No. 142. We reviewed goodwill for impairment consistent with the guidelines of SFAS No. 142 using a discounted future cash flow approach to approximate fair value. The result of testing our goodwill for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 142, as of January 1, 2002, was a non cash charge of $6.4 million (net of minority interest of $8.5 million), which, consistent with SFAS No. 142, is reported in the caption "cumulative effect of change in accounting principle" in our consolidated statement of operations. Impairment adjustments recognized in the future, if any, are generally required to be recognized as operating expenses. The $6.4 million charge related to our South American reporting unit within our international reporting segment. The South American reporting unit failed the impairment test primarily due to a reduction in the expected future performance of the unit resulting from a deterioration of the local economic environment and the devaluation of the currency in Argentina. As goodwill amortization expense in our South American reporting unit is not deductible for tax purposes, this impairment charge is not net of a tax benefit. At the time of the impairment, we had a controlling interest in Iron Mountain South America, Ltd ("IMSA") and the remainder was owned by an unaffiliated entity; in January 2005 we acquired the unaffiliated entitys interest in IMSA. IMSA has acquired a controlling interest in entities in which local partners have retained a minority interest in order to enhance our local market expertise. These local partners have no ownership interest in IMSA. This caused the minority interest portion of the non cash goodwill impairment charge ($8.5 million) to 24 exceed our portion of the non cash goodwill impairment charge ($6.4 million). In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we selected October 1 as our annual goodwill impairment review date. We performed our most recent annual goodwill impairment review as of October 1, 2004 and noted no impairment of goodwill at our reporting units as of that date. As of December 31, 2004, no factors were identified that would alter this assessment. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Credit Memos We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments and disputes regarding billing and service issues. When calculating the allowance, we consider our past loss experience, current and prior trends in our aged receivables and credit memo activity, current economic conditions, and specific circumstances of individual receivable balances. If the financial condition of our customers were to significantly change, resulting in a significant improvement or impairment of their ability to make payments, an adjustment of the allowance may be required. As of December 31, 2003 and 2004, our allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos balance totaled $20.9 million and $13.9 million, respectively. The decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos as of December 31, 2004 compared to December 31, 2003 is primarily attributable to the success of our centralized collection efforts within the U.S. and Canada, which resulted in improved cash collections and an improved accounts receivable aging that enabled us to significantly reduce our allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos associated with businesses acquired during the year ended December 31, 2004. Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives), and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on its balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as (1) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment; (2) a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction; or (3) a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation, an unrecognized firm commitment, an available for sale security, or a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. Unrealized gains and losses are recognized each period as other comprehensive income which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive items included in shareholders equity, assets and liabilities or earnings depending on the nature of such derivatives. See Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description of our derivative instruments. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective. The effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter, throughout the period that the hedge is designated. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings. For fair value hedges, the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item. For cash flow hedges, the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks. For hedges of foreign currency the accounting treatment generally 25 follows the treatment for cash flow hedges or fair value hedges depending on the nature of the foreign currency hedge. Although we apply some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges, the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is generally high. We had net interest rate risk management liabilities of $11.3 million related to cash flow hedges at December 31, 2004. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded charges totaling $9.5 million due to the recharacterization of interest rate swaps associated with our real estate term loans. As of December 31, 2004, we had $2.7 million, net of tax of unrealized losses included in other comprehensive income in shareholders equity. We provided the initial financing totaling 190.5 million British pounds sterling to IME for all of the consideration associated with the July 2003 acquisition of the European operations of Hays IMS using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. In order to minimize the foreign currency risk associated with providing IME with the consideration necessary for the acquisition of Hays IMS, we borrowed 80.0 million British pounds sterling under our revolving credit facility to create a natural hedge against our British pounds sterling denominated intercompany receivable from IME. The 80.0 million British pounds sterling outstanding under our revolving credit facility was repaid in March 2004 using proceeds received from IME in repayment of the initial financing, which reduced the intercompany balance. Foreign currency losses and gains associated with the revolving credit balance were equivalent to gains and losses recorded on the associated portion of the intercompany balance with IME. In addition, we entered into two cross currency swaps with a combined notional value of 100.0 million British pounds sterling. These swaps each had a term of one year and at maturity we had a right to receive $162.8 million in exchange for 100.0 million British pounds sterling. We did not designate these swaps as hedges and, therefore, all mark to market fluctuations of the swaps were recorded in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of operations from inception to cash payment of the swaps. We have recorded foreign currency losses of $19.0 million and $8.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004, respectively, in other (income) expense, net. Both cross currency swaps were terminated in March 2004 and were settled with proceeds received from IME in repayment of the initial financing. One of our interest rate swaps was used to hedge interest rate risk on certain variable operating lease commitments. As a result of the December 31, 2002 consolidation of one of our variable interest entities ("VIE I"), the operating lease commitments that were hedged by this swap are now considered to be inter company transactions and we determined that this hedge was no longer effective on a prospective basis. We have consolidated the real estate term loans of VIE I, and beginning on January 1, 2003 we began prospectively recording interest expense instead of rent expense as we made cash interest payments on this debt. In March 2004, we repaid this real estate term loan. As a result, we recorded a charge of $0.8 million in interest expense due to recharacterization of the interest rate swap associated with this real estate term loan. This charge represents the fair market value of the swap, which is a calculation of the net present value of the expected monthly cash payments over the remaining term of the swap based on current market conditions, as of the date the real estate term loan was repaid. We did not terminate the swap and expect to enjoy the benefit of the fixed rate financing and will continue to mark to market the fair market value of the derivative liability to interest expense, net and make our monthly cash payments as required under the swap contract for the remaining term. This swap will terminate in March 2005. Another of our interest rate swaps was used to hedge interest rate risk on certain variable operating lease commitments. This swap agreement was established to hedge the majority of interest rate risk associated with another of our variable interest entitys ("VIE III") real estate term loans. This swap had been since inception an effective hedge in accordance with SFAS No. 133. As a result of repaying VIE IIIs real estate term loan in August 2004, we recorded an additional $8.7 million in interest expense due to recharacterization of the interest rate swap associated with this real estate term 26 loan. This charge represents the fair market value of the swap, which is a calculation of the net present value of the expected monthly cash payments over the remaining term of the swap based on current market conditions, as of the date the real estate term loan was repaid. We did not terminate the swap and expect to enjoy the benefit of the fixed rate financing and will continue to mark to market the fair market value of the derivative liability to interest expense, net and make our monthly cash payments as required under the swap contract for the remaining term of approximately three years. See Notes 3, 4 and 5 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Accounting for Internal Use Software We develop various software applications for internal use. We account for those costs in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Position ("SOP") 98 1, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use." SOP 98 1 requires computer software costs associated with internal use software to be expensed as incurred until certain capitalization criteria are met. SOP 98 1 also defines which types of costs should be capitalized and which should be expensed. Payroll and related costs for employees who are directly associated with, and who devote time to, the development of internal use computer software projects, to the extent time is spent directly on the project, are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the software. Capitalization begins when the design stage of the application has been completed and it is probable that the project will be completed and used to perform the function intended. Depreciation begins when the software is placed in service. Computer software costs that are capitalized are evaluated for impairment in accordance with SFAS No.144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." It may be necessary for us to write off amounts associated with the development of internal use software if the project cannot be completed as intended. Our expansion into new technology based service offerings requires the development of internal use software that will be susceptible to rapid and significant changes in technology. We may be required to write off unamortized costs or shorten the estimated useful life if an internal use software program is replaced with an alternative tool prior to the end of the softwares estimated useful life. General uncertainties related to expansion into digital businesses, including the timing of introduction and market acceptance of our services, may adversely impact the recoverability of these assets. During the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2003, we replaced internal use software programs, which resulted in the write off to loss on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of the remaining net book value of $1.1 million and $0.7 million, respectively. We did not have any such write offs during 2004. Deferred Income Taxes We have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. If actual results differ unfavorably from certain of our estimates used, we may not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets and additional valuation allowances may be required. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that our estimates reflected in the income tax provisions and accruals will equal our actual results. These differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. We have not provided deferred taxes on book basis differences related to certain foreign subsidiaries because such basis differences are not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future and we intend to reinvest indefinitely outside the U.S. These basis differences arose primarily through the undistributed book earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The basis differences could be reversed through a sale of the subsidiaries, the receipt of dividends from subsidiaries as well as certain other events or actions on our part, which would result in an increase in our provision for income taxes. 27 In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FASB Staff Position No. 109 2, "Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004" ("FSP 109 2"). The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 ("AJCA") introduces a special one time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a U.S. taxpayer ("repatriation provision"), provided certain criteria are met. FSP 109 2 provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the repatriation provision. The Treasury Department or Congress will be providing additional clarifying language on key elements of the repatriation provision in the future. FSP 109 2 grants an enterprise additional time beyond the year ended December 31, 2004, in which the AJCA was enacted, to evaluate the effects of the AJCA on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted earnings. FSP 109 2 calls for enhanced disclosures of, among other items, the status of our evaluations, the effects of completed evaluations, and the potential range of income tax effects of repatriations. Such disclosures are included in Note 10 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Stock based Compensation As of January 1, 2003, we adopted the measurement provisions of SFAS No. 123 and SFAS No. 148. As a result we began using the fair value method of accounting in our financial statements beginning January 1, 2003 using the prospective method. The prospective method involves recognizing expense for the fair value for all awards granted or modified in the year of adoption and thereafter with no expense recognition for previous awards. We have applied the fair value recognition provisions to all stock based awards granted, modified or settled on or after January 1, 2003 and will continue to provide the required pro forma information for all awards previously granted, modified or settled before January 1, 2003 in our consolidated financial statements. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded $3.9 million of stock compensation expense in our consolidated statement of operations. Had we elected to recognize compensation cost based on the fair value of all options as of their grant dates as prescribed by SFAS No. 123 and No. 148, we would have recorded stock compensation expense of $4.5 million, $5.6 million and $7.0 million in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively. In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 123R, "Share Based Payment." SFAS No. 123R is a revision of SFAS No. 123 and supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB No. 25"). Among other items, SFAS No. 123R eliminates the use of APB No. 25 and the intrinsic value method of accounting, and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, based on the grant date fair value of those awards, in the financial statements. The effective date of SFAS No. 123R is the first reporting period beginning after June 15, 2005, which would be our third quarter of 2005, although early adoption is allowed. SFAS No. 123R permits companies to adopt its requirements using either a "modified prospective" method, or a "modified retrospective" method. Under the "modified prospective" method, compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date, based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123R for all share based payments granted after that date, and based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123 for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 123R. Under the "modified retrospective" method, the requirements are the same as under the "modified prospective" method, but this method also permits entities to restate financial statements of previous periods based on pro forma disclosures made in accordance with SFAS No. 123. SFAS No. 123R also requires that the benefits associated with the tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current rules. This requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after the effective date. Since we do not pay significant cash taxes currently, we do not expect this provision to materially impact our statement of cash flows within the next few years. 28 We expect to adopt SFAS No. 123R effective July 1, 2005 using the modified prospective method of implementation. Based on outstanding stock options granted to employees prior to our prospective implementation of the measurement provisions of SFAS No. 123 and SFAS No. 148 on January 1, 2003, we expect to record approximately $0.9 million of stock compensation expense in the second half of 2005 associated with unvested stock option grants issued prior to January 1, 2003. Self Insured Liabilities We are self insured up to certain limits for costs associated with workers compensation claims, vehicle accidents, property and general business liabilities, and benefits paid under employee healthcare and long term disability programs. At December 31, 2003 and 2004 there were approximately $23.2 million and $25.7 million, respectively, of self insurance accruals reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. The measurement of these costs requires the consideration of historical cost experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim. We account for these costs primarily through actuarial methods, which develop estimates of the undiscounted liability for claims incurred, including those claims incurred but not reported. These methods provide estimates of future ultimate claim costs based on claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. We believe the use of actuarial methods to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals. However, the use of estimate techniques in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claims involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known. We believe our recorded obligations for these expenses are consistently measured on a conservative basis. Nevertheless, changes in healthcare costs, accident frequency and severity, and other factors can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities.

The increase is attributable to internal revenue growth (9% during 2004 and 8% during 2003) resulting from net increases in records and other media stored by existing customers and sales to new customers, acquisitions (8% during 2004 and 5% during 2003), primarily consisting of $91.2 million and $30.0 million from the operations of Hays IMS in 2004 and 2003, respectively, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations (3% during 2004 and 2% during 2003). Consolidated service and storage material sales revenues increased $147.9 million, or 23.6%, to $774.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and $67.3 million, or 12.0%, to $626.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, in comparison to the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase is attributable to acquisitions (14% during 2004 and 7% during 2003), including revenue from the Hays IMS operations of $86.3 million and $24.6 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively, internal revenue growth (6% during 2004 and 3% during 2003) resulting from net increases in service and storage material sales to existing customers and sales to new customers, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations (3% during 2004 and 2% during 2003). For the reasons stated above, our consolidated revenues increased $316.3 million, or 21.1%, to $1,817.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and $182.8 million, or 13.9%, to $1,501.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, in comparison to the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that impacted our revenues were primarily due to the strengthening of the British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, and Euro against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. Internal revenue growth was 10%, 6%, and 8% for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively. We calculate internal revenue growth in local currency for our international operations.

Over the past eight quarters, the internal growth rate of our storage revenues has consistently ranged between 8% and 9%. Our storage revenue internal growth rate trend for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 reflects stable net carton volume growth in our North American records management business and strong growth rates in our digital and international businesses. Net carton volume growth is a function of the rate new cartons are added by existing and new customers offset by the rate of carton destructions and other permanent removals. The internal growth rate for service and storage material sales revenue is inherently more volatile than the storage revenue internal growth rate due to more discretionary services we offer such as large special projects, data products and carton sales, and the cost of recycled paper. These revenues are impacted to a greater extent by economic downturns as customers defer or cancel the purchase of these 30 services as a way to reduce their short term costs. As a commodity, recycled paper prices are subject to the volatility of that market. The internal growth rate for service and storage material sales revenues increased during 2004 compared to 2003 due primarily to high growth in our Secure Shredding product line and several of our complementary service lines including data product sales, special projects and fulfillment services. The growth rate of our secure shredding product line increased for 2004 primarily due to increased sales production as our entire records management sales force began selling the shredding product for the first time. In addition, our data product sales were particularly strong in the second half of 2004 and we completed several large special projects in our film and sound and fulfillment product lines. Cost of Sales Consolidated cost of sales (excluding depreciation) is comprised of the following expenses (in thousands): % of Consolidated Revenues Percent Change (Favorable)/ Unfavorable Dollar Change Percent Change 2003 2004 2003 2004 Labor $ 344,761 $ 419,345 $ 74,584 21.6 % 23.0 % 23.1 % 0.1 % Facilities 211,597 246,325 34,728 16.4 % 14.1 % 13.6 % (0.5 )% Transportation 65,142 81,976 16,834 25.8 % 4.3 % 4.5 % 0.2 % Product Cost of Sales 30,987 35,908 4,921 15.9 % 2.1 % 2.0 % (0.1 )% Other 28,260 40,345 12,085 42.8 % 1.9 % 2.2 % 0.3 % $ 680,747 $ 823,899 $ 143,152 21.0 % 45.3 % 45.3 % % % of Consolidated Revenues Percent Change (Favorable)/ Unfavorable Dollar Change Percent Change 2002 2003 2002 2003 Labor $ 318,707 $ 344,761 $ 26,054 8.2 % 24.2 % 23.0 % (1.2 )% Facilities 184,988 211,597 26,609 14.4 % 14.0 % 14.1 % 0.1 % Transportation 56,972 65,142 8,170 14.3 % 4.3 % 4.3 % Product Cost of Sales 34,552 30,987 (3,565 ) (10.3 )% 2.6 % 2.1 % (0.5 )% Other 27,080 28,260 1,180 4.4 % 2.1 % 1.9 % (0.2 )% $ 622,299 $ 680,747 $ 58,448 9.4 % 47.2 % 45.3 % (1.9 )% Labor For the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, labor expense increased slightly as a percentage of revenue due primarily to our mix of services. Specifically, increases in labor expense were caused by (1) more labor intensive operations, primarily in Europe and in our secure shredding operations, (2) higher incentive compensation expense in 2004 compared to 2003, and (3) higher allocations of labor costs associated with internal information technology personnel and consultants to revenue producing projects in our digital business. These increases were partially offset by improved labor management in our data protection operations. For the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2002, labor expense as a percentage of revenue decreased as a result of improved labor management in our North American operations and lower incentive compensation expense. This improvement was partially offset by increases in wages, medical expenses, and headcount due to growth, acquisitions, including Hays 31 IMS, and changes in our labor mix resulting from the expansion of our secure shredding operations. Our secure shredding operations are more labor intensive, therefore, labor expense will be higher as a percentage of revenue in these operations as compared to our storage operations. Facilities Facilities costs as a percentage of consolidated revenues decreased to 13.6% as of December 31, 2004 from 14.1% as of December 31, 2003. The decrease in facilities costs as a percentage of consolidated revenues was primarily a result of maintaining approximately the same overall base rent per square foot in our North American operations during 2003 and 2004 while we increased our square footage under lease over that period. The largest component of our facilities cost is rent expense, which increased $21.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003 primarily as a result of increased rent in our European operations of $15.4 million attributable to new facilities and properties acquired through acquisitions, including our acquisition of Hays IMS. Other facilities expenses in our European operations for year ended December 31, 2004 increased $14.4 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2003 primarily due to the growth of operations and acquisitions. Aside from our European operations, the remaining facilities expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004 were consistent with the year ended December 31, 2003. Rent expense increased $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 primarily as a result of increased rent in our European operations of $9.0 million attributable to new facilities and properties acquired through acquisitions, including our acquisition of Hays IMS. In addition, after adjusting for the consolidation of properties owned by our variable interest entities, we increased the number of leased facilities we occupy in the U.S. and Canada as of December 31, 2003 compared to December 31, 2002 primarily due to acquisitions. The increase in rent was offset by the consolidation of 38 properties owned by our variable interest entities during the third and fourth quarter of 2002. The leases associated with these properties were accounted for as operating leases prior to December 31, 2002. We recorded $5.9 million of rent expense for these 38 properties during the year ended December 31, 2002 and no rent expense in the year ended December 31, 2003. Rather than rent expense, we recorded interest expense and depreciation expense associated with these properties for the year ended December 31, 2003. Aside from our European operations, the dollar increase in facilities expenses is attributable to property taxes, utilities, and property insurance, which increased $5.5 million, $4.0 million, and $1.9 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. Facilities expenses in our European operations increased $6.4 million primarily due to the growth of operations and acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. Transportation Our transportation expenses, which increased 0.2% as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, are influenced by several variables including total number of vehicles, owned versus leased vehicles, use of subcontracted couriers, fuel expenses, and maintenance. In the year ended December 31, 2004, we experienced a $7.0 million increase in transportation expenses in our European operations as compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, which is primarily attributable to an increase in fleet size and vehicles under operating lease resulting from the acquisition of Hays IMS and growth of operations. An increased percentage of vehicles under operating lease, higher fuel expenses, and increased subcontracted courier expenses during the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003 also contributed to higher expenses. In the year ended December 31, 2003, our transportation expenses were flat as a percentage of consolidated revenues. Transportation expenses increased $3.4 million in our European operations as compared to the year ended December 31, 2002, which is primarily attributable to an increase in fleet 32 size and vehicles under operating lease resulting from the acquisition of Hays IMS and growth of operations. Transportation efficiencies achieved in our North American operations, partially offset by higher fuel costs and an increased percentage of vehicles under operating lease, mitigated the impact of our European operations on transportation expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues. Product and Other Cost of Sales Product and other cost of sales are highly correlated to complementary revenue streams. Product and other cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 were higher than the year ended December 31, 2003 as a percentage of consolidated revenues due to increased royalty payments associated with our electronic vaulting revenues and increased sales of lower margin data products in the second half of 2004. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses are comprised of the following expenses (in thousands): % of Consolidated Revenues Percent Change (Favorable)/ Unfavorable Dollar Change Percent Change 2003 2004 2003 2004 General and Administrative $ 206,293 $ 259,209 $ 52,916 25.7 % 13.7 % 14.3 % 0.6 % Sales, Marketing & Account Management 111,432 150,419 38,987 35.0 % 7.4 % 8.3 % 0.9 % Information Technology 68,208 81,187 12,979 19.0 % 4.5 % 4.5 % % Bad Debt Expense (2,292 ) (4,569 ) (2,277 ) (99.3 )% (0.2 )% (0.3 )% (0.1 )% $ 383,641 $ 486,246 $ 102,605 26.7 % 25.6 % 26.8 % 1.2 % % of Consolidated Revenues Percent Change (Favorable)/ Unfavorable Dollar Change Percent Change 2002 2003 2002 2003 General and Administrative $ 179,550 $ 206,293 $ 26,743 14.9 % 13.6 % 13.7 % 0.1 % Sales, Marketing & Account Management 85,932 111,432 25,500 29.7 % 6.5 % 7.4 % 0.9 % Information Technology 55,971 68,208 12,237 21.9 % 4.2 % 4.5 % 0.3 % Bad Debt Expense 11,597 (2,292 ) (13,889 ) (119.8 )% 0.9 % (0.2 )% (1.1 )% $ 333,050 $ 383,641 $ 50,591 15.2 % 25.3 % 25.6 % 0.3 % General and Administrative The increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003 is primarily attributable to a $31.0 million increase in general and administrative expenses in our European operations due to the growth of operations and acquisitions, including Hays IMS. In our North American operations, general and administrative expenses increased as a result of increased headcount and higher wages due to normal inflation and merit increases, increased stock compensation expense, increased travel, recruiting, and professional fees, including costs associated with compliance with the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. These increases were partially offset by lower incentive compensation expenses. 33 The increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003 is primarily attributable to a $16.4 million increase in general and administrative expenses in our European operations due to the growth of operations and acquisitions. In our North American operations, general and administrative expenses increased as a result of higher wages due to normal inflation and merit increases, and increases in workers compensation and medical expenses and was partially offset by decreases in general insurance expenses and lower incentive compensation expenses. Sales, Marketing & Account Management The majority of our sales, marketing and account management costs are labor related and are primarily driven by the headcount in each of these departments. Increased headcount and commissions are the most significant contributors to the increase in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004. Throughout the year ended December 31, 2003 and during 2004, we continued to invest in the expansion and improvement of our sales force and account management personnel. We added sales and marketing employees, enlarged our account management force, and continued several new marketing and promotional efforts to develop awareness in the marketplace of our entire service offerings. The costs associated with these efforts contributed to the increase in our sales, marketing and account management expenses. Our larger North American sales force generated a $10.3 million increase in sales commissions for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. During the year ended December 31, 2003 our North American sales force generated a comparable increase of $10.3 million over the year ended December 31, 2002. In addition, costs associated with our European sales and account management teams increased by $7.7 million and $4.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, compared to the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, due to the doubling of our sales force through the hiring of new personnel and acquisitions. We expect that sales, marketing and account management expenses will continue to increase as a percentage of consolidated revenues as our sales force gains traction and we continue to develop new product development and marketing initiatives. Information Technology Information technology expenses remained flat as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. Higher utilization of existing information technology resources and increased allocations of information technology resources to revenue producing projects were offset by increases in internal software development projects within our digital business, the acquisition of Connected, associated research and development activities and increased information technology spending in our European operations of $8.5 million. Information technology expenses increased as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003 principally due to higher compensation costs resulting from increased headcount, normal inflation and merit increases, as well as an increase in external resources, which was partially offset by lower incentive compensation expenses. As our technology initiatives mature, less of our efforts are development related, thus decreasing capitalizable expenditures, which results in increased information technology expenses. In addition, we incurred additional costs to expand bandwidth and international connectivity in the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2002 to satisfy growth of our business and to integrate acquisitions. Bad Debt Expense The decrease in consolidated bad debt expense for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004 compared to prior years is primarily attributable to the success of our centralized collection efforts within the U.S. and Canada, which resulted in improved cash collections and an improved accounts 34 receivable aging that allowed us to reduce our allowance for doubtful accounts during the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004. Depreciation, Amortization and (Gain) Loss on Disposal/Writedown of Property, Plant and Equipment, Net Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased $32.7 million to $163.6 million (9.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $130.9 million (8.7% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2003. Depreciation expense increased $28.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003 primarily due to the additional depreciation expense related to recent capital expenditures, including storage systems, which include racking, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and software, and buildings. Amortization expense increased $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003 due to amortization of intangible assets, primarily customer relationship intangible assets acquired through business combinations. We expect that amortization expense will continue to increase as we acquire new businesses and buy out our minority interest partners. Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased $21.9 million to $130.9 million (8.7% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $109.0 million (8.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2002. Depreciation expense increased $19.8 million, primarily due to the additional depreciation expense related to recent capital expenditures, including storage systems, which include racking, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and software, and buildings, and depreciation associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases. Depreciation associated with our digital initiatives increased $5.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2003 as a result of software and hardware assets placed in service throughout the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2003. The consolidation of the properties owned by our variable interest entities during the year ended December 31, 2002 resulted in $2.2 million of additional depreciation in the year ended December 31, 2003. Amortization expense increased as a result of the amortization of intangible assets associated with acquisitions we completed in the fourth quarter of 2002 and during the year ended December 31, 2003. Consolidated gains on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, consisted primarily of a $1.2 million gain on the sale of a property in Florida during the second quarter of 2004 offset by disposals and asset writedowns. We recorded consolidated losses on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of $1.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2003 consisting of disposals and asset writedowns partially offset by $4.2 million of gains on the sale of properties in Texas, Florida and the U.K. We recorded consolidated losses on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of $0.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2002 consisting of disposals and asset writedowns partially offset by a $2.1 million gain on the sale of a property in the U.K. Operating Income As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated operating income increased $39.6 million, or 13.0%, to $344.5 million (19.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $304.9 million (20.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2003. Consolidated operating income increased $52.3 million, or 20.7%, to $304.9 million (20.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $252.6 million (19.2% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2002. 35 OIBDA As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated OIBDA increased $72.3 million, or 16.6%, to $508.1 million (28.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $435.8 million (29.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2003. Consolidated OIBDA increased $74.2 million, or 20.5%, to $435.8 million (29.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $361.6 million (27.4% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2002. Interest Expense, Net Consolidated interest expense, net increased $35.3 million to $185.7 million (10.2% of consolidated revenues) for year ended December 31, 2004 from $150.5 million (10.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2003. Increased borrowings, primarily from the issuance of our 71/4% GBP Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014, contributed to the dollar increase in interest expense. The increase of interest expense, net as a percentage of consolidated revenues was partially due to charges totaling $9.5 million (0.5% of consolidated revenues) related to recharacterization of interest rate swaps associated with real estate term loans we repaid in March and August 2004. These charges represent the fair market value of the swaps, which is a calculation of the net present value of the expected monthly cash payments over the remaining term of the swap based on current market conditions, as of the date the real estate term loan was repaid. We did not terminate the swaps and will continue to mark to market the fair market value of the derivative liability to interest expense, net and make our monthly cash payments as required under the swap contract for the remaining term of approximately three years. Consolidated interest expense, net increased $13.8 million to $150.5 million (10.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $136.6 million (10.4% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was primarily attributable to (1) $7.4 million of interest expense associated with real estate term loans held by our variable interest entities that were consolidated in the second half of 2002, (2) borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the issuance of our 65/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016 (the "65/8% notes") which were used to finance the Hays IMS acquisition, and (3) an increase in our overall weighted average outstanding borrowings. The decrease as a percentage of revenues was attributable to the decline in our overall weighted average interest rate from 8.3% as of December 31, 2002 to 7.7% as of December 31, 2003 resulting from our refinancing efforts and a decline in variable interest rates. 36 Other Expense (Income), Net (in thousands) 2003 2004 Change Foreign currency transaction gains $ (30,220 ) $ (8,915 ) $ 21,305 Debt extinguishment expense 28,174 2,454 (25,720 ) Loss on investments (462 ) 0 462 Other, net (56 ) (1,527 ) (1,471 ) $ (2,564 ) $ (7,988 ) $ (5,424 ) 2002 2003 Change Foreign currency transaction gains $ (5,045 ) $ (30,220 ) $ (25,175 ) Debt extinguishment expense 5,431 28,174 22,743 Loss on investments 901 (462 ) (1,363 ) Other, net 148 (56 ) (204 ) $ 1,435 $ (2,564 ) $ (3,999 ) Foreign currency gains of $8.9 million based on period end exchange rates were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to the strengthening of the British pound sterling, Euro, and the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar as these currencies relate to our intercompany balances with our Canadian, U.K. and European subsidiaries, U.S. dollar denominated debt held by our Canadian subsidiary, borrowings denominated in foreign currencies under our revolving credit facility, British pounds sterling denominated debt held by our U.S. parent company, British pounds sterling currency held in the U.S. and our British pound sterling denominated cross currency swap, which was terminated in March 2004. We recorded foreign currency gains of $30.2 million and $5.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, based on period end exchange rates, primarily due to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar and British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar as these currencies relate to our intercompany balances with our Canadian and U.K. subsidiaries, U.S. dollar denominated debt held by our Canadian subsidiary, borrowings denominated in foreign currencies under our revolving credit facility, and our British pound sterling denominated cross currency swap. During the three months ended March 31, 2004, we redeemed the remaining outstanding principal amount of the 81/8% Senior Notes due 2008 of our Canadian subsidiary (the "Subsidiary notes"), resulting in a charge of $2.0 million, and we repaid a portion of our real estate term loans, which resulted in a charge of $0.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we redeemed the remaining outstanding principal amount of our 91/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2007 (the "91/8% notes"), resulting in a charge of $1.8 million, the remaining outstanding principal amount of our 83/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2009 (the "83/4% notes"), resulting in a charge of $13.8 million, and $115.0 million of the outstanding principal of our Subsidiary notes, resulting in a charge of $12.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we recorded a charge of $1.2 million related to the early retirement of debt in conjunction with the refinancing of our revolving credit facility and a charge of $4.2 million related to the early retirement of a portion of our 91/8% notes. The charges consisted primarily of the call and tender premiums associated with the extinguished debt and the write off of unamortized deferred financing cost and discounts. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2003, and 2004 were 41.3%, 42.5%, and 41.7%, respectively. The primary reconciling item between the statutory rate of 35% and our effective rate is state income taxes (net of federal benefit). The disallowance of certain intercompany 37 interest charges by states, including a change in Massachusetts tax laws, retroactive to January 1, 2002, increased our provision for income taxes by 1.1% and 1.0% for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004, respectively. We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Additional taxes assessed as a result of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods in which that determination is made. As a result of our net operating loss carryforwards, we do not expect to pay any significant international, U.S. federal and state income taxes during 2005. Minority Interest, Discontinued Operations, and Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle Minority interest in earnings of subsidiaries, net resulted in a charge to income of $3.6 million (0.3% of consolidated revenues), $5.6 million (0.4% of consolidated revenues) and $3.0 million (0.2% of consolidated revenues) for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively. This represents our minority partners share of earnings in our majority owned international subsidiaries that are consolidated in our operating results. The decrease during 2004 is a result of our acquisition of the remaining 49.9% equity interest in IME which was reflected for the first time during the second quarter of 2004. Increased profitability of our South American businesses in 2003 and 2004 contributed to the increase in minority interest in 2003 and offset the impact of acquiring the remaining 49.9% equity interest in IME in 2004. In the fourth quarter of 2002, we recorded income from discontinued operations of $1.1 million (net of tax of $0.8 million) as a result of resolving several outstanding contingencies remaining from the sale of the Arcus Staffing Resources, Inc. business unit in 1999. There was no such income recorded in 2003 and 2004. In the first quarter of 2002, we recorded a non cash charge for the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of $6.4 million (net of minority interest of $8.5 million) as a result of our implementation of SFAS No. 142. There was no such charge in 2003 and 2004. Net Income As a result of the foregoing factors, for the year ended December 31, 2004 consolidated net income increased $9.6 million, or 11.3%, to $94.2 million (5.2% of consolidated revenues) from net income of $84.6 million (5.6% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2003. Consolidated net income for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased $26.3 million, or 45.2%, to $84.6 million (5.6% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2003 from net income of $58.3 million (4.4% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2002.

During the year ended December 31, 2004, revenue in our business records management segment increased 8.3% primarily due to increased storage revenues, growth of our secure shredding operations and acquisitions (including a full year of revenue from the U.S. operations of Hays IMS in 2004 which represents an increase of $8.6 million over the partial year of revenue recorded in 2003), and was impacted by slower growth in service and special project revenue. In addition, favorable currency fluctuations during the year ended December 31, 2004 in Canada increased revenue $7.8 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue decreased in the year ended December 31, 2004 due to higher transportation expenses and our increased investment in our sales and account management force, which were partially offset by reduced facility expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2003, revenue in our business records management segment increased 8.2% primarily due to increased storage revenues, growth of our secure shredding operations and acquisitions (including a partial year of revenue from the U.S. operations of Hays IMS of $8.2 million), and was offset by lower special project service revenue and lower permanent removal and destruction fees. In addition, favorable currency fluctuations during the year ended December 31, 2003 in Canada increased revenue $9.6 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue increased primarily due to lower bad debt expense and lower incentive compensation expense which were partially offset by higher property taxes, utilities and our increased investment in our sales and account management force. 39 Data Protection Segment Revenue Increase in Revenues Percentage Increase in Revenues For Years Ended December 31, 2002 December 31, 2003 December 31, 2004 December 31, 2003 December 31, 2004 December 31, 2003 December 31, 2004 $ 239,081 $ 251,141 $ 278,984 $ 12,060 $ 27,843 5.0 % 11.1 % Segment Contribution(1) Segment Contribution(1) as a Percentage of Segment Revenue For Years Ended December 31, 2002 December 31, 2003 December 31, 2004 December 31, 2002 December 31, 2003 December 31, 2004 $ 61,729 $ 71,240 $ 78,597 25.8 % 28.4 % 28.2 % Items Excluded from the Calculation of Segment Contribution(1) Depreciation and Amortization Loss (Gain) on Disposal/Writedown of Property, Plant and Equipment, Net For Years Ended December 31, 2002 December 31, 2003 December 31, 2004 December 31, 2002 December 31, 2003 December 31, 2004 $ 12,835 $ 13,792 $ 14,808 $ 237 $ 1,944 $ 18 (1)See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for definition of Contribution and for the basis on which allocations are made and a reconciliation of Contribution to net income on a consolidated basis. During the year ended December 31, 2004, revenue in our data protection segment increased 11.1% primarily due to internal revenue growth from both existing and new customers. Higher revenue growth rates from our product sales, electronic vaulting, and intellectual property management services augmented the segments overall revenue growth rate. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue decreased primarily due to decreased product sales margins, increased royalty payments, and the growth of our sales and account management force including higher sales commissions. This decrease was partially offset by improved labor management and stable overhead costs. During the year ended December 31, 2003, revenue in our data protection segment increased 5.0% primarily due to internal revenue growth from both existing and new customers in the face of increasing pressure in the marketplace to reduce information technology related spending. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue increased primarily due to reduced bad debt expense and improved labor management. This increase was partially offset by the growth of our sales and account management force. 40  International Segment Revenue Increase in Revenues Percentage Increase in Revenues For Years Ended December 31, 2002 December 31, 2003 December 31, 2004 December 31, 2003 December 31, 2004 December 31, 2003 December 31, 2004 $ 109,381 $ 198,068 $ 380,033 $ 88,687 $ 181,965 81.1 % 91.9 % Segment Contribution(1) Segment Contribution(1) as a Percentage of Segment Revenue For Years Ended December 31, 2002 December 31, 2003 December 31, 2004 December 31, 2002 December 31, 2003 December 31, 2004 $ 21,988 $ 46,825 $ 89,751 20.1 % 23.6 % 23.6 % Items Excluded from the Calculation of Segment Contribution(1) Depreciation and Amortization Foreign Currency (Gains) Losses, Net Loss (Gain) on Disposal/Writedown of Property, Plant and Equipment, Net For Years Ended December 31, 2002 December 31, 2003 December 31, 2004 December 31, 2002 December 31, 2003 December 31, 2004 December 31, 2002 December 31, 2003 December 31, 2004 $ 7,074 $ 16,048 $ 33,234 $ 250 $ 507 $ 1,562 $ (1,927 ) $ (879 ) $ 176 (1)See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for definition of Contribution and for the basis on which allocations are made and a reconciliation of Contribution to net income on a consolidated basis. Revenue in our international segment increased 91.9% during the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to acquisitions completed in Europe, including a full year of revenue from the acquisition of Hays IMS in 2004 which represents an increase of $114.2 million over the partial year of revenue recorded in 2003, and in South America and strong internal growth in both Europe and Latin America. Favorable currency fluctuations during the year ended December 31, 2004 in Europe, Mexico and South America increased revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, by $35.7 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue remained flat primarily due to lower gross margins and increased overhead in our European operations attributable to our acquisition integration efforts and the establishment of a new shared service center offset by improved gross margins from our South American and Mexican operations. Revenue in our international segment increased 81.1% primarily due to acquisitions completed in Europe, including $46.4 million from the acquisition of Hays IMS, and in South America, as well as strong internal growth and a large service project in the U.K. Favorable currency fluctuations during the year ended December 31, 2003 in Europe increased revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, by $17.5 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was offset by $1.2 million of unfavorable currency fluctuations in Mexico and South America during the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue increased primarily due to improved gross margins from our European, South American, and Mexican operations and overall increased direct labor utilization and lower bad debt expenses. This increase was partially offset by increased overhead expenses associated with the growth of these emerging businesses. Corporate and Other The Corporate and Other segment is comprised of results from operations not discussed above, including our digital archiving services, PC/Desktop computing electronic vaulting services, consulting 41 and fulfillment operations and costs associated with our corporate headquarters operations. Certain costs incurred by our Corporate division were allocated to the other segments in 2002, 2003, and 2004, primarily to our Business Records Management and Data Protection segments. These allocations, which include rent, workers compensation, property, general liability, auto and other insurance, pension/medical costs, incentive compensation, real estate property taxes and provision for bad debts, are based on rates set at the beginning of each year. Revenue in our Corporate and Other segment increased $21.2 million to $51.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and $4.6 million to $29.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $25.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Contribution decreased $2.2 million to $30.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and increased $15.8 million to $32.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $16.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Items excluded from the calculation of Contribution include the following: (1) depreciation and amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2003, and 2004 of $21.4 million, $29.4 million, and $32.6 million, respectively, (2) foreign currency gains of $3.4 million, $1.3 million, and $8.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively, (3) debt extinguishment expense of $5.4 million, $15.6 million, and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively, and (4) a $0.8 million and $0.7 million loss on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2003, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following is a summary of our cash balances and cash flows for the years ended 2002, 2003 and 2004 (in thousands). 2002 2003 2004 Cash flows provided by operating activities $ 254,948 $ 288,693 $ 305,364 Cash flows used in investing activities (247,757 ) (586,634 ) (626,523 ) Cash flows provided by financing activities 27,098 315,054 276,569 Cash and cash equivalents at the end of year $ 56,292 $ 74,683 $ 31,942 Net cash provided by operating activities was $305.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to $288.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in operating income and non cash items, such as depreciation offset by the net change in assets and liabilities. The net change in assets and liabilities is primarily associated with growth in revenues and the resulting increase in receivables, growth in deferred revenue from selling efforts in our digital businesses, an increase in days sales outstanding in our European operations and increased purchase reserve payments year over year. We have made significant capital expenditures, additions to customer relationship and acquisition costs and other investments, primarily acquisitions. Our capital expenditures are primarily related to growth and include investments in storage systems, information systems and discretionary investments in real estate. Cash paid for our capital expenditures and additions to customer relationship and acquisition costs during the year ended December 31, 2004 amounted to $232.0 million and $12.5 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, capital expenditures, net and additions to customer relationship and acquisition costs were funded entirely with cash flows provided by operating activities. Excluding acquisitions, we expect our capital expenditures to be between approximately $220 million and approximately $250 million in the year ending December 31, 2005. In the year ended December 31, 2004, we paid net cash consideration of $384.3 million for acquisitions, which included $111.7 million associated with the purchase of Mentmores 49.9% equity interest in IME and approximately $109 million (net of cash acquired) to acquire Connected. Cash 42 flows from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and net proceeds from other financing transactions funded these acquisitions. Since December 31, 2004, we completed 6 acquisitions for total consideration of approximately $15 million. We also closed on two transactions to buy out minority interest partners in our Latin American subsidiaries for total consideration of $19 million. These transactions will be reflected in our consolidated statement of cash flows in the first quarter of 2005. Net cash provided by financing activities was $276.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. During the year ended December 31, 2004 we had gross borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and term loan facilities of $1,148.3 million and we received net proceeds of $269.4 million from the issuance of our 71/4% GBP Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 ("71/4% notes"). We used the proceeds from these financing transactions to repay debt and term loans ($1,085.0 million), retire notes of our principal Canadian subsidiary, that we guaranteed, (the "Subsidiary notes"), ($20.8 million), repay debt financing from minority shareholders, net ($42.0 million) and to fund acquisitions. We are highly leveraged and expect to continue to be highly leveraged for the foreseeable future. Our consolidated debt as of December 31, 2004 was comprised of the following (in thousands): IMI Revolving Credit Facility $ 122,563 IMI Term Loan Facility 349,000 IME Revolving Credit Facility 101,478 IME Term Loan Facility 184,330 81/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011(1) 149,715 85/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013(1) 481,054 71/4% GBP Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014(1) 288,990 73/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2015(1) 440,418 65/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016(1) 314,565 Real Estate Mortgages 5,908 Seller Notes 11,307 Other 28,694 Long term Debt 2,478,022 Less Current Portion (39,435 ) Long term Debt, Net of Current Portion $ 2,438,587 (1)These debt instruments are collectively referred to as the "Parent Notes." The Parent notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior subordinated basis, by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries (the "Guarantors"). These guarantees are joint and several obligations of the Guarantors. The remainder of our subsidiaries do not guarantee the Parent notes or the IMI revolving credit facility and IMI term loan facility. Our indentures use OIBDA based calculations as primary measures of financial performance, including leverage ratios. Our key bond leverage ratio, as calculated per our bond indentures, was 5.0 as of December 31, 2003 and 2004. Noncompliance with this leverage ratio would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity. Our target for this ratio is generally in the range of 4.5 to 5.5 while the maximum ratio allowable under the bond indentures is 6.5. Our ability to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, working capital levels and capital structure, which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors which may be beyond our control. There can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future financings will be available on acceptable terms or in amounts sufficient to enable us to service or refinance our indebtedness, or to make necessary capital expenditures. 43 Our indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants including covenants that restrict our ability to complete acquisitions, pay cash dividends, incur indebtedness, make investments, sell assets and take certain other corporate actions. The covenants do not contain a rating trigger. Therefore, a change in our debt rating would not trigger a default under our indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness. As of December 31, 2004, we were in compliance with all material debt covenants and agreements. In January 2004, we completed an offering of 150 million British pounds sterling in aggregate principal amount of our 71/4% notes, which were issued at a price of 100.0% of par. Our net proceeds of 146.9 million British pounds sterling (approximately $270 million), after paying the initial purchasers discounts, commissions and transaction fees, were used to fund our acquisition of Mentmores 49.9% equity interest in IME for total consideration of 82.5 million British pounds sterling (approximately $154 million), to redeem $20.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding Subsidiary notes in February 2004, to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility, to repay $48.8 million of our term loans, to repay other indebtedness and to pay for other acquisitions. In February 2004, using proceeds from our January 2004 offering of 71/4% notes, we redeemed the remaining $20 million of outstanding principal amount of the Subsidiary notes, at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) of 104.063%, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We recorded a charge of approximately $2 million to other (income) expense, net in the first quarter of 2004 related to the early retirement of these remaining Subsidiary notes, which consists of redemption premiums and transaction costs as well as original issue discount related to these Subsidiary notes. In February 2004, we completed the acquisition of the 49.9% equity interest held by Mentmore in IME for total consideration of 82.5 million British pounds sterling (approximately $154 million) in cash from proceeds of our 71/4% notes issued in January 2004. Included in this amount is the repayment of all trade and working capital funding owed to Mentmore by IME. Completion of the transaction gave us 100% ownership of IME, affording us full access to all future cash flows and greater strategic and financial flexibility. In March 2004, IME and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement (the "IME Credit Agreement") with a syndicate of European lenders. The IME Credit Agreement provides for maximum borrowing availability in the principal amount of 210 million British pounds sterling, including a 100 million British pounds sterling revolving credit facility (the "IME revolving credit facility"), which includes the ability to borrow in certain other foreign currencies, a 100 million British pounds sterling term loan (the "IME term loan facility"), and a 10 million British pounds sterling overdraft protection line. The IME revolving credit facility matures on March 5, 2009. The IME term loan facility is payable in three installments; two installments of 20 million British pounds sterling on March 5, 2007 and 2008, respectively, and the final payment of the remaining balance on March 5, 2009. The interest rate on borrowings under the IME Credit Agreement varies depending on IMEs choice of currency options and interest rate period, plus an applicable margin. The IME Credit Agreement includes various financial covenants applicable to the results of IME, which may restrict IMEs ability to incur indebtedness under the IME Credit Agreement and from third parties, as well as limit IMEs ability to pay dividends to us. Most of IMEs non dormant subsidiaries have either guaranteed the obligations or have their shares pledged to secure IMEs obligations under the IME Credit Agreement. We have not guaranteed or otherwise provided security for the IME Credit Agreement nor have any of our U.S., Canadian, Mexican or South American subsidiaries. In March 2004, IME borrowed approximately 147 million British pounds sterling under the IME Credit Agreement, including the full amount of the term loan. IME used those proceeds to repay us 135 million British pounds sterling related to our initial financing of the acquisition of the European operations of Hays IMS, to repay amounts outstanding under its prior term loan and revolving credit facility and to pay transaction costs associated with the IME Credit Agreement. We used the 44 135 million British pounds sterling received from IME to: (1) pay down approximately $104 million of real estate term loans, (2) settle all obligations totaling $27.7 million associated with terminating our two cross currency swaps used to hedge the foreign currency impact of our intercompany financing with IME related to the Hays IMS acquisition and (3) to pay down amounts outstanding under our prior credit agreement. The IME Credit Agreement in conjunction with our 71/4% notes provided permanent financing for the Hays IMS acquisition and allowed us to maintain the economics of the transaction with respect to exchange rates as originally contemplated at the time of the acquisition. Our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2004 included 155.1 million British pounds sterling (approximately $285.8 million) of borrowings under the IME Credit Agreement. The remaining availability, based on its current level of external debt and the leverage ratio under the IME revolving credit facility on October 31, 2004, was approximately 49.0 million British pounds sterling (approximately $90.2 million). On April 2, 2004 and subsequently on July 8, 2004, we entered into a new amended and restated credit facility and term loan facility (the "IMI Credit Agreement") to replace our prior credit agreement and to reflect more favorable pricing of our term loans. The IMI Credit Agreement has an aggregate principal amount of $550.0 million and is comprised of a $350.0 million revolving credit facility (the "IMI revolving credit facility"), which includes the ability to borrow in certain foreign currencies, and a $200.0 million term loan facility (the "IMI term loan facility"). The IMI revolving credit facility matures on April 2, 2009. With respect to the IMI term loan facility, quarterly loan payments of $0.5 million began in the third quarter of 2004 and will continue through maturity on April 2, 2011, at which time the remaining outstanding principal balance of the IMI term loan facility is due. The interest rate on borrowings under the IMI Credit Agreement varies depending on our choice of interest rate and currency options, plus an applicable margin. All intercompany notes and the capital stock of most of our U.S. subsidiaries are pledged to secure the IMI Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2004, we had $122.6 million of borrowings under the IMI revolving credit facility, of which $3 million was denominated in U.S. dollars and the remaining balance was denominated in Canadian dollars (CAD 144.0 million); we also had various outstanding letters of credit totaling $22.1 million. The remaining availability, based on IMIs current level of external debt and the leverage ratio under the IMI revolving credit facility, on December 31, 2004 was $205.3 million. In November 2004, we entered into an additional $150.0 million of term loans as permitted under our IMI Credit Agreement. The new term loans will mature at the same time as our current IMI term loan facility with quarterly loan payments of $0.4 million beginning in the first quarter of 2005 and are priced at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.75%. As a result, the IMI Credit Agreement has an aggregate maximum principal amount of $700 million as of December 31, 2004. The interest rate in effect under the IMI revolving credit facility was 4.6% as of December 31, 2004. In April 2004, IME entered into two floating for fixed interest rate swap contracts, each with a notional value of 50.0 million British pounds sterling and a duration of two years, which were designated as cash flow hedges. These swap agreements hedge interest rate risk on IMEs term loan facility. Our variable interest entities were financed with real estate term loans. In March 2004, approximately $104 million of these real estate term loans was repaid. In August 2004, we repaid the remaining $98.7 million of real estate term loans held by one of our variable interest entities using available borrowing capacity under the IMI revolving credit facility. As a result, we recorded a charge of $9.5 million due to recharacterization of the interest rate swaps associated with these real estate term loans during 2004. This charge represents the fair market value of the swap, which is a calculation of the net present value of the expected monthly cash payments over the remaining term of the swap based on current market conditions, as of the date the real estate term loan was repaid. We did not terminate the swap and expect to enjoy the benefit of the fixed rate financing and will continue to mark to market the fair market value of the derivative liability to interest expense, net and make our 45 monthly cash payments as required under the swap contract for the remaining term of approximately three years. See Notes 4 and 5 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The IME Credit Agreement, IMI Credit Agreement and our indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to complete acquisitions, pay cash dividends, incur indebtedness, make investments, sell assets and take certain other corporate actions. The covenants do not contain a rating trigger. Therefore, a change in our debt rating would not trigger a default under the IME Credit Agreement and IMI Credit Agreement. We were in compliance with all material debt covenants as of December 31, 2004. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 Years Long term Debt (including Capital Lease Obligations) $ 2,474,399 $ 39,435 $ 52,508 $ 370,238 $ 2,012,218 Interest Payments(1) 1,257,981 163,244 281,821 262,627 550,289 Operating Lease Obligations 1,077,681 151,166 253,298 182,915 490,302 Purchase Obligations(2) 70,362 21,428 31,784 17,150 Total $ 4,880,423 $ 375,273 $ 619,411 $ 832,930 $ 3,052,809 (1)Amounts do not include variable rate interest payments; see Note 5 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the applicable interest rates. (2)In addition, in connection with some of our acquisitions, we have potential earn out obligations that would be payable in the event businesses we acquired meet certain operational objectives. These payments are based on the future results of these operations and our estimate of the maximum contingent earn out payments we would be required to make under all such agreements as of December 31, 2004 is approximately $16.8 million. We expect to meet our cash flow requirements for the next twelve months from cash generated from operations, existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, borrowings under the IMI revolving credit facility and other financings, which may include secured credit facilities, securitizations and mortgage or capital lease financings. See Notes 5, 10 and 13 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Regulation S K, Item 303(a)(4)(ii). Net Operating Loss Carryforwards At December 31, 2004, we had estimated net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $170 million for federal income tax purposes. As a result of such loss carryforwards, cash paid for income taxes has historically been substantially lower than the provision for income taxes. These net operating loss carryforwards do not include approximately $103 million of potential preacquisition net operation loss carryforwards of Arcus Group, Inc. ("Arcus Group"). Any tax benefit realized related to preacquisition net operating loss carryforwards will be recorded as a reduction of goodwill when, and if, 46 realized. The Arcus Group carryforwards begin to expire next year. As a result of these loss carryforwards, we do not expect to pay any significant international, U.S. federal and state income taxes in 2005. Seasonality Historically, our businesses have not been subject to seasonality in any material respect. Inflation Certain of our expenses, such as wages and benefits, insurance, occupancy costs and equipment repair and replacement, are subject to normal inflationary pressures. Although to date we have been able to offset inflationary cost increases through increased operating efficiencies and the negotiation of favorable long term real estate leases, we can give no assurance that we will be able to offset any future inflationary cost increases through similar efficiencies, leases or increased storage or service charges.  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Interest Rate Risk Given the recurring nature of our revenues and the long term nature of our asset base, we have the ability and the preference to use long term, fixed interest rate debt to finance our business, thereby helping to preserve our long term returns on invested capital. We target a range 80% to 85% of our debt portfolio to be fixed with respect to interest rates. Occasionally, we will use floating to fixed interest rate swaps as a tool to maintain our targeted level of fixed rate debt. As part of this strategy, in December 2000, January 2001, May 2001, and April 2004 we, IME, and variable interest entities we now consolidate, entered into a total of six derivative financial contracts, which are variable for fixed interest rate swaps consisting of (a) two contracts for interest payments payable on the IMI term loan facility of an aggregate principal amount of $195.5 million, (b) one contract based on interest payments previously payable on our real estate term loans of an aggregate principal amount of $47.5 million that have been subsequently repaid, (c) one contract based on interest payments previously payable on our real estate term loans of an aggregate principal amount of $97.0 million that have been subsequently repaid, and (d) two contracts for interest payments payable on IMEs term loan facility of an aggregate principal amount of 100.0 million British pounds sterling. See Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and "Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies" in this Form 10 K. After consideration of the swap contracts mentioned above, as of December 31, 2004, we had $275.3 million of variable rate debt outstanding with a weighted average variable interest rate of 5.1%, and $2,202.8 million of fixed rate debt outstanding. As of December 31, 2004, 89% of our total debt outstanding was fixed. If the weighted average variable interest rate on our variable rate debt had increased by 1%, our net income for the year ended December 31, 2004 would have been reduced by $1.5 million. See Note 5 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K for a discussion of our long term indebtedness, including the fair values of such indebtedness as of December 31, 2004. Currency Risk Our investments in IME, Iron Mountain Canada Corporation ("IM Canada"), Iron Mountain Mexico, SA de RL de CV, IMSA and other international investments may be subject to risks and uncertainties related to fluctuations in currency valuation. Our reporting currency is the U..S. dollar. However, our international revenues and expenses are generated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate, primarily the Canadian dollar and British pound sterling. The currencies of many Latin American countries, particularly the Argentine peso, have experienced substantial volatility and 47 depreciation. Declines in the value of the local currencies in which we are paid relative to the U.S. dollar will cause revenues in U.S. dollar terms to decrease and dollar denominated liabilities to increase in local currency. The impact on our earnings is mitigated somewhat by the fact that most operating and other expenses are also incurred and paid in the local currency. We also have several intercompany obligations between our foreign subsidiaries and Iron Mountain and our U.S. based subsidiaries. These intercompany obligations are primarily denominated in the local currency of the foreign subsidiary. We have adopted and implemented a number of strategies to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in currency valuations. One strategy is to finance our largest international subsidiaries with local debt that is denominated in local currencies, thereby providing a natural hedge. In determining the amount of any such financing, we take into account local tax strategies among other factors. Another strategy we utilize is to borrow in foreign currencies at the U.S. parent level to hedge our intercompany financing activities. Finally, on occasion, we enter into currency swaps to temporarily hedge an overseas investment, such as a major acquisition to lock in certain transaction economics, while we arrange permanent financing. We have implemented these strategies for our two major foreign investments in the U.K. and Canada. Specifically, through IME borrowing under the IME Credit Agreement and our 150 million British pounds sterling denominated 71/4% senior subordinated notes, which effectively hedges most of our outstanding intercompany loan with IME. With respect to Canada, in August 2004, we repaid the remaining $98.7 million of real estate term loans by having IM Canada draw on its portion of the IMI revolving credit facility in local currency and repaying a portion of its intercompany loan back to the U.S. parent. This has created a natural hedge on a portion of the intercompany balance and will reduce our currency fluctuations with regard to our investment in IM Canada while providing IM Canada with additional borrowings and interest expenses to reduce its income tax burden. As of December 31, 2004, except as noted above, our currency exposures to intercompany balances are unhedged. The impact of devaluation or depreciating currency on an entity depends on the residual effect on the local economy and the ability of an entity to raise prices and or reduce expenses. Due to our constantly changing currency exposure and the potential substantial volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange fluctuations on our business. The effect of a change in foreign exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the "Accumulated Other Comprehensive Items" component of shareholders equity. A 10% depreciation in year end 2004 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction in our shareholders equity of approximately $20 million.
