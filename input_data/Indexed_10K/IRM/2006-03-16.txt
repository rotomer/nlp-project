(2) Effective January 1, 2002, we ceased amortizing our goodwill balance in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The accounting change impacts the comparability of results to previous years. (3) Effective January 1, 2003, we began using the fair value method of accounting in our financial statements using the prospective method in accordance with SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. As a result, we recorded $1,664, $3,857 and $6,189 for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively, associated with such stock compensation expenses. (4) OIBDA is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization expenses. OIBDA Margin is calculated by dividing OIBDA by total revenues. For a more detailed definition and reconciliation of OIBDA and a discussion of why we believe these measures provide relevant and useful information to our current and potential investors, see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Non GAAP Measures. (5) We reported a loss from continuing operations before provision for income taxes and minority interest for the year ended December 31, 2001. We would have needed to generate for the year ended December 31, 2001 additional income from operations before provision for income taxes and minority interest of $28,111 to cover our fixed charges of $177,032. (6) In connection with the sale of Arcus Staffing Resources, Inc., which was accounted for as a discontinued operation, we recorded income from discontinued operations of $1,116 (net of tax of $768) in 2002 related to the reversal of remaining liabilities associated with certain contingencies which have been resolved. (7) Effective January 1, 2002, we reviewed goodwill for impairment consistent with the guidelines of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and other Intangible Assets, using a discounted future cash flow approach to approximate fair value. The result of testing our goodwill for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 142, as of January 1, 2002, was a non cash charge of $6,396 (net of minority interest of $8,487) 21 related to the impairment of goodwill associated with our investment in South America due primarily to the deterioration of the economy and the devaluation of the currency in Argentina. (8) Effective December 31, 2005, we adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143. As a result, a non cash charge of $2,751 net of tax benefit was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005 as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. See Note 2(f) to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Item 6. Selected Financial Data and the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto and the other financial and operating information included elsewhere in this filing. This discussion contains forward looking statements, as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and in other federal securities laws. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements on page ii of this filing and Item 1A. Risk Factors on page 13 of this filing. Overview Our revenues consist of storage revenues as well as service and storage material sales revenues. Storage revenues, both physical and digital, which are considered a key performance indicator for the information protection and storage services industry, consist of largely recurring periodic charges related to the storage of materials or data (generally on a per unit or per cubic foot of records basis), which are typically retained by customers for many years, and have accounted for over 56% of total consolidated revenues in each of the last five years. Our quarterly revenues from these fixed periodic storage fees have grown for 68 consecutive quarters. Service and storage material sales revenues are comprised of charges for related service activities and courier operations and the sale of software licenses and storage materials. Related core service revenues arise from: (a) the handling of records including the addition of new records, temporary removal of records from storage, refiling of removed records, destruction of records, and permanent withdrawls from storage; (b) courier operations, consisting primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request; (c) secure shredding of sensitive documents; and (d) other recurring services including maintenance and support contracts. Our complementary services revenues arise from special project work, including data restoration, providing fulfillment services, consulting services and product sales, including software licenses, specially designed storage containers, magnetic media including computer tapes and related supplies. Our consolidated revenues are subject to variations caused by the net effect of foreign currency translation on revenue derived from outside the U.S. For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004, and 2005, we derived approximately 19%, 27% and 28%, respectively, of our total revenues from outside the U.S. The increase in total revenues from 2003 to 2004 is primarily a result of our acquisition of Hays IMS. We recognize revenue when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Storage and service revenues are recognized in the month the respective storage or service is provided and customers are generally billed on a monthly basis on contractually agreed upon terms. Amounts related to future storage or prepaid service contracts, including maintenance and support contracts, for customers where storage fees or services are billed in advance are accounted for as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the applicable storage or service period or when the service is performed. Storage material sales are recognized when shipped to the customer and include software license sales (less than 1% of consolidated revenues in 2005). Sales of software licenses to 22 distributors are recognized at the time a distributor reports that the software has been licensed to an end user and all revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. Cost of sales (excluding depreciation) consists primarily of wages and benefits for field personnel, facility occupancy costs including rent and utilities, transportation expenses including vehicle leases and fuel, other product costs of sales and other equipment costs and supplies. Of these, wages and benefits and facility occupancy costs are the most significant. Trends in total wages and benefits dollars and as a percentage of total consolidated revenue are influenced by changes in headcount and compensation levels, achievement of incentive compensation targets, workforce productivity and variability in costs associated with medical insurance and workers compensation. Trends in facility occupancy costs are similarly impacted by the total number of facilities we occupy, the mix of properties we own versus properties we occupy under operating leases, fluctuations in per square foot occupancy costs, and the levels of utilization of these properties. The expansion of our European, secure shredding and digital services businesses has impacted the major cost of sales components. Our European and secure shredding operations are more labor intensive than our core physical businesses and therefore increase our labor costs as a percent of consolidated revenues. This trend is partially offset by our digital services businesses, which require significantly less direct labor. Our secure shredding operations incur less facility costs and higher transportation costs as a percent of revenues compared to our core physical businesses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits for management, administrative, information technology, sales, account management and marketing personnel, as well as expenses related to communications and data processing, travel, professional fees, bad debts, training, office equipment and supplies. Trends in total wages and benefits dollars and as a percentage of total consolidated revenue are influenced by changes in headcount and compensation levels, achievement of incentive compensation targets, workforce productivity and variability in costs associated with medical insurance. The overhead structure of our expanding European operations, as compared to our North American operations, is more labor intensive and has not achieved the same level of overhead leverage, which may result in an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of consolidated revenue, as our European operations become a more meaningful percentage of our consolidated results. Similarly, our digital services business requires a higher level of overhead, particularly in the area of information technology, than our core physical businesses. Our adoption of the measurement provisions of SFAS No. 123 as amended by SFAS No. 148 has resulted in increasing amounts of selling, general and administrative expenses. We began using the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation in our financial statements beginning January 1, 2003 using the prospective method. The prospective method involves recognizing expense for the fair value for all awards granted or modified in the year of adoption and thereafter with no expense recognition for previous awards. We expect to record approximately $0.9 million of additional stock compensation expense in 2006 associated with unvested stock option grants issued prior to January 1, 2003 associated with adopting SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment. Our depreciation and amortization charges result primarily from the capital intensive nature of our business. The principal components of depreciation relate to storage systems, which include racking, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and software, and buildings. Amortization relates primarily to customer relationships and acquisition costs and core technology and is impacted by the nature and timing of acquisitions. Our consolidated revenues and expenses are subject to variations caused by the net effect of foreign currency translation on revenues and expenses incurred by our entities outside the U.S. During 2005, we have seen increases in both revenues and expenses as a result of the strengthening of the British pound sterling, the Euro, and the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted 23 average rates for the comparable periods. It is difficult to predict how much foreign currency exchange rates will fluctuate in the future and how those fluctuations will impact individual balances reported in our consolidated statement of operations. Given the relative increase in our international operations, these fluctuations may become material on individual balances. However, because both the revenues and expenses are denominated in the local currency of the country in which they are derived or incurred, the impact of currency fluctuations on our operating income, operating margin and net income is mitigated. Non GAAP Measures Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization, or OIBDA OIBDA is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization expenses. OIBDA Margin is calculated by dividing OIBDA by total revenues. Our management uses these measures to evaluate the operating performance of our consolidated business. As such, we believe these measures provide relevant and useful information to our current and potential investors. We use OIBDA for planning purposes and multiples of current or projected OIBDA based calculations in conjunction with our discounted cash flow models to determine our overall enterprise valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets. We believe OIBDA and OIBDA Margin are useful measures to evaluate our ability to grow our revenues faster than our operating expenses and they are an integral part of our internal reporting system utilized by management to assess and evaluate the operating performance of our business. OIBDA does not include certain items, specifically (1) minority interest in earnings (losses) of subsidiaries, net, (2) other (income) expense, net, (3) income from discontinued operations and loss on sale of discontinued operations and (4) cumulative effect of change in accounting principle that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results. OIBDA also does not include interest expense, net and the provision for income taxes. These expenses are associated with our capitalization and tax structures, which management does not consider when evaluating the profitability of our core operations. Finally, OIBDA does not include depreciation and amortization expenses, in order to eliminate the impact of capital investments, which management evaluates by comparing capital expenditures to incremental revenue generated and as a percentage of total revenues. OIBDA and OIBDA Margin should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the Unites States of America, or GAAP, such as operating or net income or cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP). Reconciliation of OIBDA to Operating Income and Net Income (In Thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2003 2004 2005 OIBDA $ 435,811 $ 508,125 $ 573,706 Less: Depreciation and Amortization 130,918 163,629 186,922 Operating Income 304,893 344,496 386,784 Less: Interest Expense, Net 150,468 185,749 183,584 Other (Income) Expense, Net (2,564 ) (7,988 ) 6,182 Provision for Income Taxes 66,730 69,574 81,484 Minority Interests in Earnings of Subsidiaries 5,622 2,970 1,684 Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle (net of tax benefit) 2,751 Net Income $ 84,637 $ 94,191 $ 111,099 Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles 24 generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and for the period then ended. On an on going basis, we evaluate the estimates used, including those related to accounting for acquisitions, allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos, impairment of tangible and intangible assets, income taxes, stock based compensation and self insured liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience, actuarial estimates, current conditions and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Our critical accounting policies include the following, which are listed in no particular order: Accounting for Acquisitions Part of our growth strategy has included the acquisition of numerous businesses. The purchase price of these acquisitions has been determined after due diligence of the acquired business, market research, strategic planning, and the forecasting of expected future results and synergies. Estimated future results and expected synergies are subject to revisions as we integrate each acquisition and attempt to leverage resources. Each acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting as defined under the applicable accounting standards at the date of each acquisition, including, Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16, Accounting for Business Combinations, and more recently, SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations. Accounting for these acquisitions has resulted in the capitalization of the cost in excess of fair value of the net assets acquired in each of these acquisitions as goodwill. We estimated the fair values of the assets acquired in each acquisition as of the date of acquisition and these estimates are subject to adjustment. These estimates are subject to final assessments of the fair value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, operating leases and deferred income taxes. We complete these assessments within one year of the date of acquisition. We are not aware of any information that would indicate that the final purchase price allocations for acquisitions completed in 2005 would differ meaningfully from preliminary estimates. See Note 6 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In connection with each of our acquisitions, we have undertaken certain restructurings of the acquired businesses to realize efficiencies and potential cost savings. Our restructuring activities include the elimination of duplicate facilities, reductions in staffing levels, and other costs associated with exiting certain activities of the businesses we acquire. The estimated cost of these restructuring activities are included as costs of the acquisition and are recorded as goodwill consistent with the guidance of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 95 3, Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination. While we finalize our plans to restructure the businesses we acquire within one year of the date of acquisition, it may take more than one year to complete all activities related to the restructuring of an acquired business. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Credit Memos We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments and disputes regarding billing and service issues. When calculating the allowance, we consider our past loss experience, current and prior trends in our aged receivables and credit memo activity, current economic conditions, and specific circumstances of individual receivable balances. If the financial condition of our customers were to significantly change, resulting in a significant improvement or impairment of their ability to make payments, an adjustment of the allowance may be required. As of December 31, 2004 and 2005, our 25 allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos balance totaled $13.9 million and $14.5 million, respectively. Impairment of Tangible and Intangible Assets Assets subject to amortization: In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, we review long lived assets and all amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operation to which the assets relate to their carrying amount. The operations are generally distinguished by the business segment and geographic region in which they operate. If the operation is determined to be unable to recover the carrying amount of its assets, then intangible assets are written down first, followed by the other long lived assets of the operation, to fair value. Fair value is based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, depending upon the nature of the assets. Goodwill Assets not subject to amortization: We apply the provisions of SFAS No. 142 to goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives which are not amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives are amortized over their useful lives. We have selected October 1 as our annual goodwill impairment review date. We performed our annual goodwill impairment review as of October 1, 2003, 2004 and 2005 and noted no impairment of goodwill. In making this assessment, management relies on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and managements judgement in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. As of December 31, 2005, no factors were identified that would alter this assessment. Impairment adjustments recognized in the future, if any, will be recognized as operating expenses. Our operating segments at which level we perform our goodwill impairment analysis as of December 31, 2005 were as follows: Business Records Management, Data Protection, Fulfillment, Digital Archiving Services, Europe, South America, Mexico and Asia Pacific. When changes occur in the composition of one or more operating segments, the goodwill is reassigned to the segments affected based on their relative fair values. Goodwill valuations have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each operating segment. This approach incorporates many assumptions including future growth rates, discount factors, expected capital expenditures and income tax cash flows. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in a goodwill impairment in future periods. Accounting for Internal Use Software We develop various software applications for internal use. We account for those costs in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Position (SOP) 98 1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. SOP 98 1 requires computer software costs associated with internal use software to be expensed as incurred until certain capitalization criteria are met. SOP 98 1 also defines which types of costs should be capitalized and which should be expensed. Payroll and related costs for employees who are directly associated with, and who devote time to, the development of internal use computer software projects, to the extent time is spent directly on the project, are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the software. Capitalization begins when the design stage of the application has been completed and it is probable that the project will be completed and used to perform the function intended. Depreciation begins when the software is placed in service. Computer software costs that are capitalized are evaluated for impairment in accordance with SFAS No.144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. It may be necessary for us to write off amounts associated with the development of internal use software if the project cannot be completed as intended. Our expansion into new technology based service 26 offerings requires the development of internal use software that will be susceptible to rapid and significant changes in technology. We may be required to write off unamortized costs or shorten the estimated useful life if an internal use software program is replaced with an alternative tool prior to the end of the softwares estimated useful life. General uncertainties related to expansion into digital businesses, including the timing of introduction and market acceptance of our services, may adversely impact the recoverability of these assets. See Note 2(f) to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. During the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2005, we replaced internal use software programs, which resulted in the write off to loss on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of the remaining net book value of $0.7 million and $1.1 million, respectively. We did not have any such write offs during 2004. Income Taxes We have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. If actual results differ unfavorably from certain of our estimates used, we may not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred income tax assets and additional valuation allowances may be required. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that our estimates reflected in the tax provisions and accruals will equal our actual results. These differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. We are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. Although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in changes in our estimates. We have not provided deferred taxes on book basis differences related to certain foreign subsidiaries because such basis differences are not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future and we intend to reinvest indefinitely outside the U.S. These basis differences arose primarily through the undistributed book earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The basis differences could be reversed through a sale of the subsidiaries, the receipt of dividends from subsidiaries as well as certain other events or actions on our part, which would result in an increase in our provision for income taxes. Stock Based Compensation As of January 1, 2003, we adopted the measurement provisions of SFAS No. 123, as amended by SFAS No. 148. As a result we began using the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation in our financial statements beginning January 1, 2003 using the prospective method. The prospective method involves recognizing expense for the fair value for all awards granted or modified in the year of adoption and thereafter with no expense recognition for previous awards. We have applied the fair value recognition provisions to all stock based awards granted, modified or settled on or after January 1, 2003 and will continue to provide the required pro forma information for all awards previously granted, modified or settled before January 1, 2003 in our consolidated financial statements. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded $6.2 million of stock compensation expense in our consolidated statement of operations. Had we elected to recognize compensation cost based on the fair value of all options as of their grant dates as prescribed by SFAS No. 123 and No. 148, we would have recorded stock compensation expense (net of tax benefit) of $3.3 million, $5.4 million and $6.0 million in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. 27 In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment. SFAS No. 123R is a revision of SFAS No. 123 and supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB No. 25). Among other items, SFAS No. 123R eliminates the use of APB No. 25 and the intrinsic value method of accounting, and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, based on the grant date fair value of those awards, in the financial statements. The effective date of SFAS No. 123R is the first reporting period in the first fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005, which would be our first quarter of 2006. SFAS No. 123R permits companies to adopt its requirements using either a modified prospective method, or a modified retrospective method. Under the modified prospective method, compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date, based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123R for all share based payments granted after that date, and based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123 for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 123R. Under the modified retrospective method, the requirements are the same as under the modified prospective method, but this method also permits entities to restate financial statements of previous periods based on pro forma disclosures made in accordance with SFAS No. 123. SFAS No. 123R also requires that the benefits associated with the tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current rules. This requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after the effective date. We will adopt SFAS No. 123R effective January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective method of implementation. Based on outstanding stock options granted to employees prior to our prospective implementation of the measurement provisions of SFAS No. 123 and SFAS No. 148 on January 1, 2003, we expect to record approximately $0.9 million of additional stock compensation expense in 2006 associated with unvested stock option grants issued prior to January 1, 2003. Self Insured Liabilities We are self insured up to certain limits for costs associated with workers compensation claims, vehicle accidents, property and general business liabilities, and benefits paid under employee healthcare and long term disability programs. At December 31, 2004 and 2005 there were approximately $25.7 million, and $30.4 million, respectively, of self insurance accruals reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. The measurement of these costs requires the consideration of historical cost experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim. We account for these costs primarily through actuarial methods, which develop estimates of the undiscounted liability for claims incurred, including those claims incurred but not reported. These methods provide estimates of future ultimate claim costs based on claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. We believe the use of actuarial methods to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals. However, the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claims involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known. We believe our recorded obligations for these expenses are appropriate. Nevertheless, changes in healthcare costs, accident frequency and severity, and other factors can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities. 28 Results of Operations Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2005 to Year Ended December 31, 2004 and Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2004 to Year Ended December 31, 2003: Year Ended December 31, Dollar Percent 2004 2005 Change Change Revenues $ 1,817,589 $ 2,078,155 $ 260,566 14.3 % Operating Expenses 1,473,093 1,691,371 218,278 14.8 % Operating Income 344,496 386,784 42,288 12.3 % Other Expenses, Net 250,305 275,685 25,380 10.1 % Net Income $ 94,191 $ 111,099 $ 16,908 18.0 % OIBDA(1) $ 508,125 $ 573,706 $ 65,581 12.9 % OIBDA Margin(1) 28.0 % 27.6 % Year Ended December 31, Dollar Percent 2003 2004 Change Change Revenues $ 1,501,329 $ 1,817,589 $ 316,260 21.1 % Operating Expenses 1,196,436 1,473,093 276,657 23.1 % Operating Income 304,893 344,496 39,603 13.0 % Other Expenses, Net 220,256 250,305 30,049 13.6 % Net Income $ 84,637 $ 94,191 $ 9,554 11.3 % OIBDA(1) $ 435,811 $ 508,125 $ 72,314 16.6 % OIBDA Margin(1) 29.0 % 28.0 % (1) See Non GAAP Measures Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization, or OIBDA for definition, reconciliation and a discussion of why we believe these measures provide relevant and useful information to our current and potential investors. Revenue Our consolidated storage revenues increased $138.2 million, or 13.2%, to $1,181.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and $168.3 million, or 19.2%, to $1,043.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, in comparison to the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase is attributable to internal revenue growth (9% during both 2005 and 2004) resulting from net increases in records and other media stored by existing customers and sales to new customers, acquisitions (3% during 2005 and 8% during 2004), primarily consisting of $91.2 million from the operations of Hays IMS in 2004, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations (1% during 2005 and 3% during 2004). Consolidated service and storage material sales revenues increased $122.4 million, or 15.8%, to $896.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and $147.9 million, or 23.6%, to $774.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, in comparison to the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase is attributable to acquisitions (7% during 2005 and 14% during 2004), including revenue from the Hays IMS operations of $86.3 million in 2004, internal revenue growth (7% during 2005 and 6% during 2004) resulting from net increases in service and storage material sales to existing customers and sales to new customers, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations (1% during 2005 and 3% during 2004). For the reasons stated above, our consolidated revenues increased $260.6 million, or 14.3%, to $2,078.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and $316.3 million, or 21.1%, to $1,817.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, in comparison to the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, 29 respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that impacted our revenues were primarily due to the strengthening of the British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and Euro against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. Internal revenue growth was 6%, 8%, and 8% for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. We calculate internal revenue growth in local currency for our international operations. Internal Growth Eight Quarter Trend 2004 2005 First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Storage Revenue 8 % 9 % 8 % 9 % 8 % 9 % 9 % 10 % Service and Storage Material Sales Revenue 6 % 4 % 5 % 9 % 3 % 6 % 12 % 9 % Total Revenue 8 % 7 % 7 % 9 % 6 % 8 % 10 % 9 % Our internal revenue growth rate represents the weighted average year over year growth rate of our revenues after removing the effects of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Over the past eight quarters, the internal growth rate of our storage revenues has consistently ranged between 8% and 10%. In our North American paper business, net carton volume growth showed improvement and we benefited from a more positive pricing environment in 2005 compared to 2004. Strong growth rates in our digital services business more than offset the impact of reduced growth rates in Europe resulting from the inclusion of the slower growing Hays IMS business in our base revenues for internal growth calculation purposes. Net carton volume growth is a function of the rate new cartons are added by existing and new customers offset by the rate of carton destructions and other permanent removals. 30 The internal growth rate for service and storage material sales revenue is inherently more volatile than the storage revenue internal growth rate due to the more discretionary nature of the services we offer such as large special projects or data products and carton sales, as well as the price of recycled paper. These revenues are often event driven and impacted to a greater extent by economic downturns as customers defer or cancel the purchase of these services as a way to reduce their short term costs. As a commodity, recycled paper prices are subject to the volatility of that market. The internal growth rate for service and storage material sales revenues increased during 2005 compared to 2004. The internal growth rate for service and storage material sales revenues reflects the following: (1) strong data product sales; (2) a large data restoration project completed by our digital services business; (3) growth in North American storage related service revenue; (4) continued growth in our secure shredding business; and (5) improved growth rates in our data protection business. These positive factors were partially offset by: (1) lower special project revenues related to the public sector business in the UK; and (2) a large software license sale in the first quarter of 2004 that did not repeat in 2005.

We also experienced improvement in our ratio of labor costs to revenues in our European operations as a result of completing the integration of Hays IMS in 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, labor expense increased slightly as a percentage of revenue due primarily to our mix of services. Specifically, increases in labor expense were caused by (1) more labor intensive operations, primarily in Europe and in 31 our secure shredding operations, (2) higher incentive compensation expense in 2004 compared to 2003, and (3) higher allocations of labor costs associated with internal information technology personnel and consultants to revenue producing projects in our digital business. These increases were partially offset by improved labor management in our data protection operations. Facilities Facilities costs as a percentage of consolidated revenues decreased to 13.3% for the year ended December 31, 2005 from 13.6% for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease in facilities costs as a percentage of consolidated revenues was primarily a result of maintaining approximately the same overall base rent per square foot in our North American operations during 2004 and 2005 while consolidated revenues increased. The largest component of our facilities cost is rent expense, which increased $15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily as a result of properties under lease acquired through acquisitions in both Europe and North America. The expansion of our secure shredding business, which incurs lower facilities costs than our core physical businesses, also helped lower our facilities costs as a percentage of consolidated revenues. Facilities costs as a percentage of consolidated revenues decreased to 13.6% as of December 31, 2004 from 14.1% as of December 31, 2003. The decrease in facilities costs as a percentage of consolidated revenues was primarily a result of maintaining approximately the same overall base rent per square foot in our North American operations during 2003 and 2004 while consolidated revenues increased. Rent expense increased $21.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003 primarily as a result of increased rent in our European operations of $15.4 million attributable to new facilities and properties acquired through acquisitions, including our acquisition of Hays IMS. Other facilities expenses in our European operations for year ended December 31, 2004 increased $14.4 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2003 primarily due to the growth of operations and acquisitions. Aside from our European operations, the remaining facilities expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004 were consistent with the year ended December 31, 2003. Transportation Our transportation expenses, which increased 0.2% as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, are influenced by several variables including total number of vehicles, owned versus leased vehicles, use of subcontracted couriers, fuel expenses and maintenance. Higher fuel expenses during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 were primarily responsible for the increase in transportation expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues. Our transportation expenses increased 0.2% as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, are influenced by several variables including total number of vehicles, owned versus leased vehicles, use of subcontracted couriers, fuel expenses, and maintenance. In the year ended December 31, 2004, we experienced a $7.0 million increase in transportation expenses in our European operations as compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, which is primarily attributable to an increase in fleet size and vehicles under operating lease resulting from the acquisition of Hays IMS and growth of operations. An increased percentage of vehicles under operating lease, higher fuel expenses, and increased subcontracted courier expenses during the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003 also contributed to higher expenses. Product and Other Cost of Sales Product and other cost of sales are highly correlated to complementary revenue streams. Product and other cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 were higher than the year ended December 31, 32 2004 as a percentage of consolidated revenues due to increased sales of data products at lower margins in North America, increased royalty payments associated with our electronic vaulting revenues and increases in technology costs associated with these revenue producing activities. Product and other cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 were higher than the year ended December 31, 2003 as a percentage of consolidated revenues due to increased royalty payments associated with our electronic vaulting revenues and increased sales of lower margin data products in the second half of 2004. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses are comprised of the following expenses (in thousands): % of Consolidated Revenues Percent Change 2004 2005 Dollar Change Percent Change 2004 2005 (Favorable)/ Unfavorable General andAdministrative $ 259,209 $ 285,558 $ 26,349 10.2 % 14.3 % 13.7 % (0.6 )% Sales, Marketing & Account Management 150,419 180,558 30,139 20.0 % 8.3 % 8.7 % 0.4 % Information Technology 81,187 99,177 17,990 22.2 % 4.5 % 4.8 % 0.3 % Bad Debt Expense (4,569 ) 4,402 8,971 196.3 % (0.3 )% 0.2 % 0.5 % $ 486,246 $ 569,695 $ 83,449 17.2 % 26.8 % 27.4 % 0.6. % % of Consolidated Revenues Percent Change 2003 2004 Dollar Change Percent Change 2003 2004 Favorable)/ Unfavorable General and Administrative $ 206,293 $ 259,209 $ 52,916 25.7 % 13.7 % 14.3 % 0.6 % Sales, Marketing & Account Management 111,432 150,419 38,987 35.0 % 7.4 % 8.3 % 0.9 % Information Technology 68,208 81,187 12,979 19.0 % 4.5 % 4.5 % % Bad Debt Expense (2,292 ) (4,569 ) (2,277 ) (99.3 )% (0.2 )% (0.3 )% (0.1 )% $ 383,641 $ 486,246 $ 102,605 26.7 % 25.6 % 26.8 % 1.2 % General and Administrative The decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 is attributable to strong revenue growth and controls over overhead spending implemented in late 2004. These decreases were partially offset by increased incentive compensation expense and growth of our North American and European operations due to expansion and acquisitions. The increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003 is primarily attributable to a $31.0 million increase in general and administrative expenses in our European operations due to the growth of operations and acquisitions, including Hays IMS. In our North American operations, general and administrative expenses increased as a result of increased headcount and higher wages due to normal inflation and merit increases, increased stock compensation expense, increased travel, recruiting, and professional fees, including costs associated with compliance with the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. These increases were partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense. Sales, Marketing & Account Management The majority of our sales, marketing and account management costs are labor related and are primarily driven by the headcount in each of these departments. Increased headcount and related 33 compensation and commissions are the most significant contributors to the increase in sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. Throughout the year ended December 31, 2004 and during 2005, we have continued to invest in the expansion and improvement of our sales force and account management personnel. We have added sales and marketing employees and enlarged our account management force.The costs associated with these efforts have contributed to the increase in our sales, marketing and account management expenses. Our larger North American sales force generated a $3.0 million increase in sales commissions and an increase of $14.8 million of compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased $3.3 million due to the introduction of several new marketing and promotional efforts to continue to develop awareness in the marketplace of our entire portfolio of services, especially our digital services. During the year ended December 31, 2004 our North American sales force generated an increase in sales commissions of $10.3 million over the year ended December 31, 2003. In addition, costs associated with our European sales, marketing and account management teams increased by $8.1 million and $7.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, compared to the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, due to additions to our sales force through the hiring of new personnel and acquisitions. Information Technology Information technology expenses increased as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 due to increases in internal software development projects within our digital services business, the acquisitions of Connected and LiveVault and associated research and development activities, and increased information technology spending in our European operations. Higher utilization of existing information technology resources to revenue producing projects, which are charged to cost of goods sold, partially offset this increase. Information technology expenses remained flat as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. Higher utilization of existing information technology resources and increased allocations of information technology resources to revenue producing projects, which are charged to cost of goods sold, were offset by increases in internal software development projects within our digital services business, the acquisition of Connected, associated research and development activities and increased information technology spending in our European operations of $8.5 million. Bad Debt Expense Consolidated bad debt expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 reflects what we believe to be more normal levels of bad debt expense. The decrease in consolidated bad debt expense for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004 compared to prior years is primarily attributable to the success of our centralized collection efforts within the U.S. and Canada, which resulted in improved cash collections and an improved accounts receivable aging that allowed us to reduce our allowance for doubtful accounts during the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004. Depreciation, Amortization, and (Gain) and Loss on Disposal/Writedown of Property, Plant and Equipment, Net Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased $23.3 million to $187.0 million (9.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $163.6 million (9.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2004. Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased $32.7 million to $163.6 million (9.0% of consolidated revenues) for the 34 year ended December 31, 2004 from $130.9 million (8.7% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2003. Depreciation expense increased $18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 and increased $28.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, primarily due to the additional depreciation expense related to recent capital expenditures and acquisitions, including storage systems, which include racking, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and software, and buildings. Amortization expense increased $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 and increased $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, primarily due to amortization of intangible assets, such as customer relationship intangible assets and intellectual property acquired through business combinations, including the Connected acquisition in November 2004. We expect that amortization expense will continue to increase as we acquire new businesses and reflect the full year impact of recent acquisitions, including LiveVault and Pickfords. Consolidated gains on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, consisted primarily of a gain on the sale of a property in the U.K of $4.5 million offset primarily by software asset writedowns of $1.1 million. Consolidated gains on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, consisted primarily of a $1.2 million gain on the sale of a property in Florida during the second quarter of 2004 offset by disposals and asset writedowns. We recorded consolidated losses on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of $1.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2003 consisting of disposals and asset writedowns partially offset by $4.2 million of gains on the sale of properties in Texas, Florida and the U.K. Operating Income As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated operating income increased $42.3 million, or 12.3%, to $386.8 million (18.6% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $344.5 million (19.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2004. Consolidated operating income increased $39.6 million, or 13.0%, to $344.5 million (19.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $304.9 million (20.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2003. OIBDA As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated OIBDA increased $65.6 million, or 12.9%, to $573.7 million (27.6% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $508.1 million (28.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2004. Consolidated OIBDA increased $72.3 million, or 16.6%, to $508.1 million (28.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $435.8 million (29.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2003. Interest Expense, Net Consolidated interest expense, net decreased $2.2 million to $183.6 million (8.8% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $185.7 million (10.2% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2004. The dollar decrease in interest expense, net was primarily due to the recording of interest expense totaling $21.5 million for the year ending December 31, 2004 compared to interest expense totaling $2.3 million for the year ending December 31, 2005 related to the net impact of 35 mark to market adjustments and cash payments on all of our interest rate swap contracts. This was offset by increased borrowings, primarily an additional $150.0 million of term loans borrowed in November 2004 as permitted under our IMI Credit Agreement and the full year effect of the March 2004 IME Credit Agreement. Consolidated interest expense, net increased $35.3 million to $185.7 million (10.2% of consolidated revenues) for year ended December 31, 2004 from $150.5 million (10.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2003. Increased borrowings, primarily from the issuance of our 714% GBP Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014, contributed to the dollar increase in interest expense. The increase of interest expense, net as a percentage of consolidated revenues was partially due to charges totaling $9.5 million (0.5% of consolidated revenues) related to recharacterization of interest rate swaps associated with real estate term loans we repaid in March and August 2004. These charges represent the fair market value of the swaps, which is a calculation of the net present value of the expected monthly cash payments over the remaining term of the swap based on current market conditions, as of the date the real estate term loans were repaid. We did not terminate the swaps and will continue to mark to market the fair market value of the derivative liability to expense, net and make our monthly cash payments as required under the swap contract for their remaining terms.

Foreign currency gains of $30.2 million and $8.9 million based on period end exchange rates were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004, respectively, primarily due to the strengthening of the British pound sterling, Euro, and the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar as these currencies relate to our inter company balances with and between our Canadian, U.K., and European subsidiaries, U.S. dollar denominated debt held by our Canadian subsidiary, borrowings denominated in foreign currencies under our revolving credit facility, British pounds sterling denominated debt held by our U.S. parent company, British pounds sterling currency held in the U.S. and our British pound sterling denominated cross currency swap, which was terminated in March 2004. During the three months ended March 31, 2004, we redeemed the remaining outstanding principal amount of the 818% Senior Notes due 2008 of our Canadian subsidiary (the Subsidiary notes), resulting 36 in a charge of $2.0 million, and we repaid a portion of our real estate term loans, which resulted in a charge of $0.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we redeemed the remaining outstanding principal amount of our 918% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2007, resulting in a charge of $1.8 million, the remaining outstanding principal amount of our 834% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2009, resulting in a charge of $13.8 million, and $115.0 million of the outstanding principal of our Subsidiary notes, resulting in a charge of $12.6 million. The charges consisted primarily of the call and tender premiums associated with the extinguished debt and the write off of unamortized deferred financing cost and discounts. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004, and 2005 were 42.5%, 41.7%, and 41.4%, respectively. The primary reconciling item between the statutory rate of 35% and our effective rate is state income taxes (net of federal benefit). We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. Although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in changes in our estimates. Minority Interest Minority interest in earnings of subsidiaries, net resulted in a charge to income of $5.6 million (0.4% of consolidated revenues), $3.0 million (0.2% of consolidated revenues) and $1.7 million (0.1% of consolidated revenues) for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004, and 2005, respectively. This represents our minority partners share of earnings in our majority owned international subsidiaries that are consolidated in our operating results. The decrease during 2005 is the result of our acquisition of various Latin American minority partner interests. The decrease during 2004 is a result of our acquisition of the remaining 49.9% equity interest in IME which was reflected for the first time during the second quarter of 2004. Increased profitability of our South American businesses in 2003 and 2004 contributed to the increase in minority interest in 2003 and offset the impact of acquiring the remaining 49.9% equity interest in IME in 2004. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations (FIN 47), an interpretation of SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS No. 143). FIN 47 clarifies that conditional asset retirement obligations meet the definition of liabilities and should be recognized when incurred if their fair values can be reasonably estimated. Uncertainty surrounding the timing and method of settlement that may be conditional on events occurring in the future are factored into the measurement of the liability rather than the existence of the liability. SFAS No. 143 established accounting and reporting standards for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets legally required by law, regulatory rule or contractual agreement and the associated asset retirement costs. SFAS No. 143 requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset, which is then depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The liability is increased over time through income as a component of depreciation expense, such that the liability will equate to the future cost to retire the long lived asset at the expected retirement date. Upon settlement of the liability, an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement. Our obligations are primarily the result of requirements under our facility lease agreements which generally have return to original condition clauses which would require us to remove or restore items such as 37 shred pits, vaults, demising walls and office build outs, among others. As of December 31, 2005, we have recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying FIN 47 as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle as prescribed in FIN 47, which resulted in a gross charge of $4.4 million ($2.8 million, net of tax). Net Income As a result of the foregoing factors, for the year ended December 31, 2005, consolidated net income increased $16.9 million, or 18.0%, to $111.1 million (5.3% of consolidated revenues) from net income of $94.2 million (5.2% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2004. As a result of the foregoing factors, for the year ended December 31, 2004, consolidated net income increased $9.6 million, or 11.3%, to $94.2 million (5.2% of consolidated revenues) from net income of $84.6 million (5.6% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2003.

During the year ended December 31, 2005, revenue in our business records management segment increased 8.9% primarily due to increasing storage internal growth rates resulting from higher net volume growth and a more positive pricing environment, increased service revenue growth rates, growth of our secure shredding operations and acquisitions. In addition, favorable currency fluctuations during the year ended December 31, 2005 in Canada increased revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, by $8.7 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue increased in the year ended December 31, 2005 due to strong revenue growth and the effectiveness of recent labor 38 and cost management initiatives, which were partially offset by increases in transportation, bad debt and facility related expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2004, revenue in our business records management segment increased 8.3% primarily due to increased storage revenues, growth of our secure shredding operations and acquisitions (including a full year of revenue from the U.S. operations of Hays IMS in 2004 which represents an increase of $8.6 million over the partial year of revenue recorded in 2003), and was impacted by slower growth in service and special project revenue. In addition, favorable currency fluctuations during the year ended December 31, 2004 in Canada increased revenue $7.8 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue decreased in the year ended December 31, 2004 due to higher transportation expenses and our increased investment in our sales and account management force, which were partially offset by reduced facility expenses. Data Protection Segment Revenue Increase in Revenues Percentage Increase in Revenues For Years Ended December 31, 2003 December 31, 2004 December 31, 2005 December 31, 2004 December 31, 2005 December 31, 2004 December 31, 2005 $251,141 $278,984 $324,536 $27,843 $45,552 11.1% 16.3% Segment Contribution(1) Segment Contribution(1) as a Percentage of Segment Revenue For Years Ended December 31, 2003 December 31, 2004 December 31, 2005 December 31, 2003 December 31, 2004 December 31, 2005 $71,240 $78,597 $95,115 28.4% 28.2% 29.3% Items Excluded from the Calculation of Segment Contribution(1) Depreciation and Amortization Loss (Gain) on Disposal/Writedown of Property, Plant and Equipment, Net For Years Ended December 31, 2003 December 31, 2004 December 31, 2005 December 31, 2003 December 31, 2004 December 31, 2005 $13,792 $14,808 $15,096 $1,944 $18 $8 (1) See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for definition of Contribution and for the basis on which allocations are made and a reconciliation of Contribution to income before provision for income taxes and minority interest on a consolidated basis. During the year ended December 31, 2005, revenue in our data protection segment increased 16.3% primarily due to higher internal growth rates from our product sales and electronic vaulting services which were supported by improved internal growth rates in our core data protection business. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue increased primarily due to strong revenue growth, labor and cost management initiatives and was partially offset by increased product sales at lower margins and the growth of our sales and account management force, including higher sales commissions. During the year ended December 31, 2004, revenue in our data protection segment increased 11.1% primarily due to internal revenue growth from both existing and new customers. Higher revenue growth rates from our product sales, electronic vaulting, and intellectual property management services augmented the segments overall revenue growth rate. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue decreased primarily due to decreased product sales margins, increased royalty payments, and the growth of our sales and account management force including higher sales commissions. This decrease was partially offset by improved labor management and stable overhead costs. 39 International Segment Revenue Increase in Revenues Percentage Increase in Revenues For Years Ended December 31, 2003 December 31, 2004 December 31, 2005 December 31, 2004 December 31, 2005 December 31, 2004 December 31, 2005 $198,068 $ 380,033 $ 435,269 $ 181,965 $ 55,236 91.9 % 14.5 % Segment Contribution(1) Segment Contribution(1) as a Percentage of Segment Revenue For Years Ended December 31, 2003 December 31, 2004 December 31, 2005 December 31, 2003 December 31, 2004 December 31, 2005 $46,825 $ 89,751 $ 113,278 23.6 % 23.6 % 26.0 % Items Excluded from the Calculation of Segment Contribution(1) Depreciation and Amortization Foreign Currency (Gains) Losses, Net Loss (Gain) on Disposal/Writedown of Property, Plant and Equipment, Net For Years Ended December 31, 2003 December 31, 2004 December 31, 2005 December 31, 2003 December 31, 2004 December 31, 2005 December 31, 2003 December 31, 2004 December 31, 2005 $16,048 $ 33,234 $ 43,285 $ 507 $ 1,562 $ 6,347 $ (879 ) $ 176 $ (3,757 ) (1) See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for definition of Contribution and for the basis on which allocations are made and a reconciliation of Contribution to income before provision for income taxes and minority interest on a consolidated basis. Revenue in our international segment increased 14.5% during the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to acquisitions completed in Europe and in South America and strong internal growth in Latin America, offset by lower revenue in our U.K. public sector business. Favorable currency fluctuations during the year ended December 31, 2005 in Europe, Mexico and South America increased revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, by $13.8 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue increased primarily due to improvements in both cost of sales and overhead labor ratios as a result of completing the integration of Hays IMS in the second half of 2004 offset by increased compensation associated with additional sales, marketing, and account management personnel, several new marketing and promotional efforts, and increased bad debt expense. Revenue in our international segment increased 91.9% during the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to acquisitions completed in Europe, including a full year of revenue from the acquisition of Hays IMS in 2004 which represents an increase of $114.2 million over the partial year of revenue recorded in 2003, and in South America and strong internal growth in both Europe and Latin America. Favorable currency fluctuations during the year ended December 31, 2004 in Europe, Mexico and South America increased revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, by $35.7 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue remained flat primarily due to lower gross margins and increased overhead in our European operations attributable to our acquisition integration efforts and the establishment of a new shared service center offset by improved gross margins from our South American and Mexican operations. Corporate and Other The Corporate and Other segment is comprised of results from operations not discussed above, including our digital archiving services, PC/Desktop computing electronic vaulting services, consulting and fulfillment operations and costs associated with our corporate headquarters operations. Certain costs 40 incurred by our Corporate division were allocated to the other segments in the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, primarily to our Business Records Management and Data Protection segments. These allocations, which include rent, workers compensation, property, general liability, auto and other insurance, pension/medical costs, incentive compensation, real estate property taxes and provision for bad debts, are based on rates set at the beginning of each year. Revenue in our Corporate and Other segment increased $61.0 million to $112.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and $21.2 million to $51.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $29.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The 2005 dollar increases were due primarily to strong internal growth in our digital services business, including a large data restoration project and the acquisition of Connected in November 2004. Contribution decreased $7.9 million to $22.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and decreased $2.2 million to $30.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $32.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Items excluded from the calculation of Contribution include the following: (1) depreciation and amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004, and 2005 of $29.4 million, $32.6 million, and $42.3 million, respectively; (2) foreign currency (gains) loss of $(1.3) million, $(8.4) million, and $4.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004, and 2005, respectively; (3) debt extinguishment expense of $15.6 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004, respectively, and (4) losses on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of $0.7 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2005, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following is a summary of our cash balances and cash flows for the years ended 2003, 2004 and 2005 (in thousands). 2003 2004 2005 Cash flows provided by operating activities $ 288,693 $ 305,364 $ 377,176 Cash flows used in investing activities (586,634 ) (626,523 ) (436,175 ) Cash flows provided by financing activities 315,054 276,569 81,449 Cash and cash equivalents at the end of year 74,683 31,942 53,413 Net cash provided by operating activities was $305.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to $377.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in operating income and non cash items, such as depreciation and amortization and an improvement in working capital year over year. Due to the nature of our businesses, we make significant capital expenditures and additions to customer relationship and acquisition costs. Our capital expenditures are primarily related to growth and include investments in storage systems, information systems and discretionary investments in real estate. Cash paid for our capital expenditures and additions to customer relationship and acquisition costs during the year ended December 31, 2005 amounted to $272.1 million and $13.4 million, respectively. From time to time and in the normal course of business we sell certain fixed assets, primarily real estate. In the year ended December 31, 2005, we received $28.6 million of net proceeds from the sales of assets. For the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, capital expenditures, net and additions to customer relationship and acquisition costs were funded entirely with cash flows provided by operating activities. Excluding acquisitions, we expect our capital expenditures to be between $300 million and $355 million in the year ending December 31, 2006. In the year ended December 31, 2005, we paid net cash consideration of $178.2 million for acquisitions, which included approximately $86 million to purchase Pickfords and $36 million to purchase 41 LiveVault. Cash flows from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and net proceeds from other financing transactions funded these acquisitions. Net cash provided by financing activities was $81.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we had gross borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and term loan facilities of $568.7 million. We used the proceeds from these financing transactions and cash flows from operations to repay debt and term loans ($509.6) million, to repay debt financing from minority shareholders, net ($2.4) million and to fund acquisitions. We are highly leveraged and expect to continue to be highly leveraged for the foreseeable future. Our consolidated debt as of December 31, 2005 was comprised of the following (in thousands): IMI Revolving Credit Facility(1) $ 216,396 IMI Term Loan Facility(1) 345,500 IME Revolving Credit Facility 84,262 IME Term Loan Facility 177,450 814% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011(2) 149,760 858% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013(2) 481,032 714% GBP Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014(2) 258,120 734% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2015(2) 439,506 658% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016(2) 315,059 Real Estate Mortgages 4,707 Seller Notes 9,398 Other 48,241 Long term Debt 2,529,431 Less Current Portion (25,905 ) Long term Debt, Net of Current Portion $ 2,503,526 (1) All intercompany notes and the capital stock of most of our U.S. subsidiaries are pledged to secure these debt instruments. (2) These debt instruments are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior subordinated basis, by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries (the Guarantors). These guarantees are joint and several obligations of the Guarantors. The remainder of our subsidiaries do not guarantee the senior subordinated notes. Our indentures use OIBDA based calculations as primary measures of financial performance, including leverage ratios. Our key bond leverage ratio, as calculated per our bond indentures, was 5.0 as of December 31, 2004 and 2005. Noncompliance with this leverage ratio would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity. Our target for this ratio is generally in the range of 4.5 to 5.5 while the maximum ratio allowable under the bond indentures is 6.5. Our ability to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, working capital levels and capital structure, which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors which may be beyond our control. There can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future financings will be available on acceptable terms or in amounts sufficient to enable us to service or refinance our indebtedness, or to make necessary capital expenditures. In March 2004, IME and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement (the IME Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of European lenders. The IME Credit Agreement provides for maximum borrowing availability in the principal amount of 200 million British pounds sterling, including a 100 million British pounds sterling revolving credit facility (the IME revolving credit facility), which includes 42 the ability to borrow in certain other foreign currencies and a 100 million British pounds sterling term loan (the IME term loan facility). The IME revolving credit facility matures on March 5, 2009. The IME term loan facility is payable in three installments; two installments of 20 million British pounds sterling on March 5, 2007 and 2008, respectively, and the final payment of the remaining balance on March 5, 2009. The interest rate on borrowings under the IME Credit Agreement varies depending on IMEs choice of currency options and interest rate period, plus an applicable margin. The IME Credit Agreement includes various financial covenants applicable to the results of IME, which may restrict IMEs ability to incur indebtedness under the IME Credit Agreement and from third parties, as well as limit IMEs ability to pay dividends to us. Most of IMEs non dormant subsidiaries have either guaranteed the obligations or have their shares pledged to secure IMEs obligations under the IME Credit Agreement. We have not guaranteed or otherwise provided security for the IME Credit Agreement nor have any of our U.S., Canadian, Asia Pacific, Mexican or South American subsidiaries. In March 2004, IME borrowed approximately 147 million British pounds sterling under the IME Credit Agreement, including the full amount of the term loan. IME used those proceeds to repay us 135 million British pounds sterling related to our initial financing of the acquisition of the European operations of Hays IMS, to repay amounts outstanding under its prior term loan and revolving credit facility and to pay transaction costs associated with the IME Credit Agreement. We used the 135 million British pounds sterling received from IME to: (1) pay down approximately $104 million of real estate term loans, (2) settle all obligations totaling $27.7 million associated with terminating our two cross currency swaps used to hedge the foreign currency impact of our intercompany financing with IME related to the Hays IMS acquisition and (3) to pay down amounts outstanding under our prior credit agreement. Our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2005 included 147.5 million British pounds sterling ($261.7 million) of borrowings under the IME Credit Agreement. The remaining availability, based on its current level of external debt and the leverage ratio under the IME revolving credit facility on October 31, 2005, was approximately 61.4 million British pounds sterling ($109.0 million). The interest rate in effect under the IME revolving credit facility ranged from 3.3% to 6.2% as of December 31, 2005. On April 2, 2004 and subsequently on July 8, 2004, we entered into a new amended and restated credit facility and term loan facility (the IMI Credit Agreement) to replace our prior credit agreement and to reflect more favorable pricing of our term loans. The IMI Credit Agreement had an aggregate principal amount of $550.0 million and was comprised of a $350.0 million revolving credit facility (the IMI revolving credit facility), which included the ability to borrow in certain foreign currencies, and a $200.0 million term loan facility (the IMI term loan facility). The IMI revolving credit facility matures on April 2, 2009. With respect to the IMI term loan facility, quarterly loan payments of $0.5 million began in the third quarter of 2004 and will continue through maturity on April 2, 2011, at which time the remaining outstanding principal balance of the IMI term loan facility is due. In November 2004, we entered into an additional $150.0 million of term loans as permitted under our IMI Credit Agreement. The new term loans will mature at the same time as our current IMI term loan facility with quarterly loan payments of $0.4 million that began in the first quarter of 2005 and are priced at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.75%. On October 31, 2005, we entered into the second amendment to the IMI Credit Agreement increasing availability from $350.0 million to $400.0 million. As a result, the IMI Credit Agreement had an aggregate maximum principal amount of $750 million as of December 31, 2005. The interest rate on borrowings under the IMI Credit Agreement varies depending on our choice of interest rate and currency options, plus an applicable margin. All intercompany notes and the capital stock of most of our U.S. subsidiaries are pledged to secure the IMI Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2005, we had $216.4 million of borrowings under the IMI revolving credit facility, of which $9 million was denominated in U.S. dollars and the remaining balance was denominated in Canadian dollars (CAD 168.3 million) and in Australian dollars (AUD 86.3 million); we also had various outstanding letters of credit totaling $24.0 million. The remaining availability, based on IMIs current level of external debt and the leverage ratio under the IMI revolving 43 credit facility, on December 31, 2005 was $159.6 million. The interest rate in effect under the IMI revolving credit facility and IMI term loan facility was 5.8% and 6.2%, respectively, as of December 31, 2005. The IME Credit Agreement, IMI Credit Agreement and our indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to complete acquisitions, pay cash dividends, incur indebtedness, make investments, sell assets and take certain other corporate actions. The covenants do not contain a rating trigger. Therefore, a change in our debt rating would not trigger a default under the IME Credit Agreement, IMI Credit Agreement and our indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness. As of December 31, 2005, we were in compliance with all material debt covenants and agreements. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2005 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 Years Long term Debt (including Capital Lease Obligations) $ 2,526,201 $ 25,905 $ 95,574 $ 420,169 $ 1,984,553 Interest Payments(1) 1,090,003 141,961 267,885 260,307 419,850 Operating Lease Obligations 1,113,797 164,022 273,256 202,936 473,583 Purchase and Asset Retirement Obligations(2) 95,426 40,952 34,911 9,628 9,935 Total $ 4,825,427 $ 372,840 $ 671,626 $ 893,040 $ 2,887,921 (1) Amounts do not include variable rate interest payments; see Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the applicable interest rates. (2) In addition, in connection with some of our acquisitions, we have potential earn out obligations that may be payable in the event businesses we acquired meet certain operational objectives. These payments are based on the future results of these operations, and our estimate of the maximum contingent earn out payments we may be required to make under all such agreements as of December 31, 2005 is approximately $21.2 million. We expect to meet our cash flow requirements for the next twelve months from cash generated from operations, existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, borrowings under the IMI and IME revolving credit facilities and other financings, which may include secured credit facilities, securitizations and mortgage or capital lease financings. We expect to meet our long term cash flow requirements using the same means described above, as well as the potential issuance of debt or equity securities as we deem appropriate. See Notes 4, 8 and 11 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Regulation S K Item 303(a)(4)(ii). Net Operating Loss Carryforwards At December 31, 2005, we had estimated net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $124 million for federal income tax purposes. As a result of such loss carryforwards, cash paid for income taxes has historically been substantially lower than the provision for income taxes. These net operating loss carryforwards do not include approximately $103 million of potential pre acquisition net operating loss 44 carryforwards of Arcus Group, Inc. Any tax benefit realized related to preacquisition net operating loss carryforwards will be recorded as a reduction of goodwill when, and if, realized. As a result of these loss carryforwards, we do not expect to pay any significant U.S. federal and state income taxes in 2006. Seasonality Historically, our businesses have not been subject to seasonality in any material respect. Inflation Certain of our expenses, such as wages and benefits, insurance, occupancy costs and equipment repair and replacement, are subject to normal inflationary pressures. Although to date we have been able to offset inflationary cost increases through increased operating efficiencies and the negotiation of favorable long term real estate leases, we can give no assurance that we will be able to offset any future inflationary cost increases through similar efficiencies, leases or increased storage or service charges. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Interest Rate Risk Given the recurring nature of our revenues and the long term nature of our asset base, we have the ability and the preference to use long term, fixed interest rate debt to finance our business, thereby helping to preserve our long term returns on invested capital. We target a range 80% to 85% of our debt portfolio to be fixed with respect to interest rates. Occasionally, we will use floating to fixed interest rate swaps as a tool to maintain our targeted level of fixed rate debt. As part of this strategy, in December 2000, May 2001, and April 2004 we and IME entered into a total of four derivative financial contracts, which are variable for fixed interest rate swaps consisting of (a) one contract for interest payments payable on the IMI term loan facility of an aggregate principal amount of $99.5 million that was reduced to an aggregate principal amount of $51.5 million as of December 31, 2005, (b) one contract based on interest payments previously payable on our real estate term loans of an aggregate principal amount of $97.0 million that have been subsequently repaid, and (c) two contracts for interest payments payable on IMEs term loan facility of an aggregate principal amount of 100.0 million British pounds sterling. See Note 3 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. After consideration of the swap contracts mentioned above, as of December 31, 2005, we had $517.0 million of variable rate debt outstanding with a weighted average variable interest rate of 5.6%, and $2,012.4 million of fixed rate debt outstanding. As of December 31, 2005, 80% of our total debt outstanding was fixed. If the weighted average variable interest rate on our variable rate debt had increased by 1%, our net income for the year ended December 31, 2005 would have been reduced by $2.3 million. See Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K for a discussion of our long term indebtedness, including the fair values of such indebtedness as of December 31, 2005. Currency Risk Our investments in IME, Iron Mountain Canada Corporation (IM Canada), Iron Mountain Mexico, SA de RL de CV, IMSA and other international investments may be subject to risks and uncertainties related to fluctuations in currency valuation. Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. However, our international revenues and expenses are generated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate, primarily the Euro, Canadian dollar and British pound sterling. The currencies of many Latin American countries, particularly the Argentine peso, have experienced substantial volatility and depreciation. Declines in the value of the local currencies in which we are paid relative to the U.S. dollar will cause revenues in U.S. dollar terms to decrease and dollar denominated liabilities to increase in local currency. 45 The impact on our earnings is mitigated somewhat by the fact that most operating and other expenses are also incurred and paid in the local currency. We also have several intercompany obligations between our foreign subsidiaries and Iron Mountain and our U.S. based subsidiaries and our foreign subsidiaries and IME. These intercompany obligations are primarily denominated in the local currency of the foreign subsidiary. We have adopted and implemented a number of strategies to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in currency valuations. One strategy is to finance our largest international subsidiaries with local debt that is denominated in local currencies, thereby providing a natural hedge. In determining the amount of any such financing, we take into account local tax strategies among other factors. Another strategy we utilize is to borrow in foreign currencies at the U.S. parent level to hedge our intercompany financing activities. Finally, on occasion, we enter into currency swaps to temporarily hedge an overseas investment, such as a major acquisition to lock in certain transaction economics, while we arrange permanent financing. We have implemented these strategies for our three foreign investments in the U.K., Canada and Asia Pacific. Specifically, through IME borrowing under the IME Credit Agreement and our 150 million British pounds sterling denominated 714% senior subordinated notes, we effectively hedge most of our outstanding intercompany loan with IME. IM Canada has financed their capital needs through direct borrowings in Canadian dollars under the IMI revolving credit facility. This creates a tax efficient natural currency hedge. To fund the acquisition of Pickfords in Australia and New Zealand, IMI borrowed Australian and New Zealand dollars under its multi currency revolving credit facility. These borrowings provide a tax efficient natural hedge against the intercompany loans created at the time of the acquisition. The impact of devaluation or depreciating currency on an entity depends on the residual effect on the local economy and the ability of an entity to raise prices and or reduce expenses. Due to our constantly changing currency exposure and the potential substantial volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange fluctuations on our business. The effect of a change in foreign exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the Accumulated Other Comprehensive Items component of stockholders equity. A 10% depreciation in year end 2005 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction in our stockholders equity of approximately $30 million. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Item 6. Selected Financial Data and the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto and the other financial and operating information included elsewhere in this filing. This discussion contains forward looking statements, as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and in other federal securities laws. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements on page ii of this filing and Item 1A. Risk Factors on page 13 of this filing. Overview Our revenues consist of storage revenues as well as service and storage material sales revenues. Storage revenues, both physical and digital, which are considered a key performance indicator for the information protection and storage services industry, consist of largely recurring periodic charges related to the storage of materials or data (generally on a per unit or per cubic foot of records basis), which are typically retained by customers for many years, and have accounted for over 56% of total consolidated revenues in each of the last five years. Our quarterly revenues from these fixed periodic storage fees have grown for 68 consecutive quarters. Service and storage material sales revenues are comprised of charges for related service activities and courier operations and the sale of software licenses and storage materials. Related core service revenues arise from: (a) the handling of records including the addition of new records, temporary removal of records from storage, refiling of removed records, destruction of records, and permanent withdrawls from storage; (b) courier operations, consisting primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request; (c) secure shredding of sensitive documents; and (d) other recurring services including maintenance and support contracts. Our complementary services revenues arise from special project work, including data restoration, providing fulfillment services, consulting services and product sales, including software licenses, specially designed storage containers, magnetic media including computer tapes and related supplies. Our consolidated revenues are subject to variations caused by the net effect of foreign currency translation on revenue derived from outside the U.S. For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004, and 2005, we derived approximately 19%, 27% and 28%, respectively, of our total revenues from outside the U.S. The increase in total revenues from 2003 to 2004 is primarily a result of our acquisition of Hays IMS. We recognize revenue when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Storage and service revenues are recognized in the month the respective storage or service is provided and customers are generally billed on a monthly basis on contractually agreed upon terms. Amounts related to future storage or prepaid service contracts, including maintenance and support contracts, for customers where storage fees or services are billed in advance are accounted for as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the applicable storage or service period or when the service is performed. Storage material sales are recognized when shipped to the customer and include software license sales (less than 1% of consolidated revenues in 2005). Sales of software licenses to 22 distributors are recognized at the time a distributor reports that the software has been licensed to an end user and all revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. Cost of sales (excluding depreciation) consists primarily of wages and benefits for field personnel, facility occupancy costs including rent and utilities, transportation expenses including vehicle leases and fuel, other product costs of sales and other equipment costs and supplies. Of these, wages and benefits and facility occupancy costs are the most significant. Trends in total wages and benefits dollars and as a percentage of total consolidated revenue are influenced by changes in headcount and compensation levels, achievement of incentive compensation targets, workforce productivity and variability in costs associated with medical insurance and workers compensation. Trends in facility occupancy costs are similarly impacted by the total number of facilities we occupy, the mix of properties we own versus properties we occupy under operating leases, fluctuations in per square foot occupancy costs, and the levels of utilization of these properties. The expansion of our European, secure shredding and digital services businesses has impacted the major cost of sales components. Our European and secure shredding operations are more labor intensive than our core physical businesses and therefore increase our labor costs as a percent of consolidated revenues. This trend is partially offset by our digital services businesses, which require significantly less direct labor. Our secure shredding operations incur less facility costs and higher transportation costs as a percent of revenues compared to our core physical businesses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits for management, administrative, information technology, sales, account management and marketing personnel, as well as expenses related to communications and data processing, travel, professional fees, bad debts, training, office equipment and supplies. Trends in total wages and benefits dollars and as a percentage of total consolidated revenue are influenced by changes in headcount and compensation levels, achievement of incentive compensation targets, workforce productivity and variability in costs associated with medical insurance. The overhead structure of our expanding European operations, as compared to our North American operations, is more labor intensive and has not achieved the same level of overhead leverage, which may result in an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of consolidated revenue, as our European operations become a more meaningful percentage of our consolidated results. Similarly, our digital services business requires a higher level of overhead, particularly in the area of information technology, than our core physical businesses. Our adoption of the measurement provisions of SFAS No. 123 as amended by SFAS No. 148 has resulted in increasing amounts of selling, general and administrative expenses. We began using the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation in our financial statements beginning January 1, 2003 using the prospective method. The prospective method involves recognizing expense for the fair value for all awards granted or modified in the year of adoption and thereafter with no expense recognition for previous awards. We expect to record approximately $0.9 million of additional stock compensation expense in 2006 associated with unvested stock option grants issued prior to January 1, 2003 associated with adopting SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment. Our depreciation and amortization charges result primarily from the capital intensive nature of our business. The principal components of depreciation relate to storage systems, which include racking, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and software, and buildings. Amortization relates primarily to customer relationships and acquisition costs and core technology and is impacted by the nature and timing of acquisitions. Our consolidated revenues and expenses are subject to variations caused by the net effect of foreign currency translation on revenues and expenses incurred by our entities outside the U.S. During 2005, we have seen increases in both revenues and expenses as a result of the strengthening of the British pound sterling, the Euro, and the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted 23 average rates for the comparable periods. It is difficult to predict how much foreign currency exchange rates will fluctuate in the future and how those fluctuations will impact individual balances reported in our consolidated statement of operations. Given the relative increase in our international operations, these fluctuations may become material on individual balances. However, because both the revenues and expenses are denominated in the local currency of the country in which they are derived or incurred, the impact of currency fluctuations on our operating income, operating margin and net income is mitigated. Non GAAP Measures Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization, or OIBDA OIBDA is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization expenses. OIBDA Margin is calculated by dividing OIBDA by total revenues. Our management uses these measures to evaluate the operating performance of our consolidated business. As such, we believe these measures provide relevant and useful information to our current and potential investors. We use OIBDA for planning purposes and multiples of current or projected OIBDA based calculations in conjunction with our discounted cash flow models to determine our overall enterprise valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets. We believe OIBDA and OIBDA Margin are useful measures to evaluate our ability to grow our revenues faster than our operating expenses and they are an integral part of our internal reporting system utilized by management to assess and evaluate the operating performance of our business. OIBDA does not include certain items, specifically (1) minority interest in earnings (losses) of subsidiaries, net, (2) other (income) expense, net, (3) income from discontinued operations and loss on sale of discontinued operations and (4) cumulative effect of change in accounting principle that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results. OIBDA also does not include interest expense, net and the provision for income taxes. These expenses are associated with our capitalization and tax structures, which management does not consider when evaluating the profitability of our core operations. Finally, OIBDA does not include depreciation and amortization expenses, in order to eliminate the impact of capital investments, which management evaluates by comparing capital expenditures to incremental revenue generated and as a percentage of total revenues. OIBDA and OIBDA Margin should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the Unites States of America, or GAAP, such as operating or net income or cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP). Reconciliation of OIBDA to Operating Income and Net Income (In Thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2003 2004 2005 OIBDA $ 435,811 $ 508,125 $ 573,706 Less: Depreciation and Amortization 130,918 163,629 186,922 Operating Income 304,893 344,496 386,784 Less: Interest Expense, Net 150,468 185,749 183,584 Other (Income) Expense, Net (2,564 ) (7,988 ) 6,182 Provision for Income Taxes 66,730 69,574 81,484 Minority Interests in Earnings of Subsidiaries 5,622 2,970 1,684 Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle (net of tax benefit) 2,751 Net Income $ 84,637 $ 94,191 $ 111,099 Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles 24 generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and for the period then ended. On an on going basis, we evaluate the estimates used, including those related to accounting for acquisitions, allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos, impairment of tangible and intangible assets, income taxes, stock based compensation and self insured liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience, actuarial estimates, current conditions and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Our critical accounting policies include the following, which are listed in no particular order: Accounting for Acquisitions Part of our growth strategy has included the acquisition of numerous businesses. The purchase price of these acquisitions has been determined after due diligence of the acquired business, market research, strategic planning, and the forecasting of expected future results and synergies. Estimated future results and expected synergies are subject to revisions as we integrate each acquisition and attempt to leverage resources. Each acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting as defined under the applicable accounting standards at the date of each acquisition, including, Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16, Accounting for Business Combinations, and more recently, SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations. Accounting for these acquisitions has resulted in the capitalization of the cost in excess of fair value of the net assets acquired in each of these acquisitions as goodwill. We estimated the fair values of the assets acquired in each acquisition as of the date of acquisition and these estimates are subject to adjustment. These estimates are subject to final assessments of the fair value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, operating leases and deferred income taxes. We complete these assessments within one year of the date of acquisition. We are not aware of any information that would indicate that the final purchase price allocations for acquisitions completed in 2005 would differ meaningfully from preliminary estimates. See Note 6 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In connection with each of our acquisitions, we have undertaken certain restructurings of the acquired businesses to realize efficiencies and potential cost savings. Our restructuring activities include the elimination of duplicate facilities, reductions in staffing levels, and other costs associated with exiting certain activities of the businesses we acquire. The estimated cost of these restructuring activities are included as costs of the acquisition and are recorded as goodwill consistent with the guidance of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 95 3, Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination. While we finalize our plans to restructure the businesses we acquire within one year of the date of acquisition, it may take more than one year to complete all activities related to the restructuring of an acquired business. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Credit Memos We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments and disputes regarding billing and service issues. When calculating the allowance, we consider our past loss experience, current and prior trends in our aged receivables and credit memo activity, current economic conditions, and specific circumstances of individual receivable balances. If the financial condition of our customers were to significantly change, resulting in a significant improvement or impairment of their ability to make payments, an adjustment of the allowance may be required. As of December 31, 2004 and 2005, our 25 allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos balance totaled $13.9 million and $14.5 million, respectively. Impairment of Tangible and Intangible Assets Assets subject to amortization: In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, we review long lived assets and all amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operation to which the assets relate to their carrying amount. The operations are generally distinguished by the business segment and geographic region in which they operate. If the operation is determined to be unable to recover the carrying amount of its assets, then intangible assets are written down first, followed by the other long lived assets of the operation, to fair value. Fair value is based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, depending upon the nature of the assets. Goodwill Assets not subject to amortization: We apply the provisions of SFAS No. 142 to goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives which are not amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives are amortized over their useful lives. We have selected October 1 as our annual goodwill impairment review date. We performed our annual goodwill impairment review as of October 1, 2003, 2004 and 2005 and noted no impairment of goodwill. In making this assessment, management relies on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and managements judgement in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. As of December 31, 2005, no factors were identified that would alter this assessment. Impairment adjustments recognized in the future, if any, will be recognized as operating expenses. Our operating segments at which level we perform our goodwill impairment analysis as of December 31, 2005 were as follows: Business Records Management, Data Protection, Fulfillment, Digital Archiving Services, Europe, South America, Mexico and Asia Pacific. When changes occur in the composition of one or more operating segments, the goodwill is reassigned to the segments affected based on their relative fair values. Goodwill valuations have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each operating segment. This approach incorporates many assumptions including future growth rates, discount factors, expected capital expenditures and income tax cash flows. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in a goodwill impairment in future periods. Accounting for Internal Use Software We develop various software applications for internal use. We account for those costs in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Position (SOP) 98 1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. SOP 98 1 requires computer software costs associated with internal use software to be expensed as incurred until certain capitalization criteria are met. SOP 98 1 also defines which types of costs should be capitalized and which should be expensed. Payroll and related costs for employees who are directly associated with, and who devote time to, the development of internal use computer software projects, to the extent time is spent directly on the project, are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the software. Capitalization begins when the design stage of the application has been completed and it is probable that the project will be completed and used to perform the function intended. Depreciation begins when the software is placed in service. Computer software costs that are capitalized are evaluated for impairment in accordance with SFAS No.144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. It may be necessary for us to write off amounts associated with the development of internal use software if the project cannot be completed as intended. Our expansion into new technology based service 26 offerings requires the development of internal use software that will be susceptible to rapid and significant changes in technology. We may be required to write off unamortized costs or shorten the estimated useful life if an internal use software program is replaced with an alternative tool prior to the end of the softwares estimated useful life. General uncertainties related to expansion into digital businesses, including the timing of introduction and market acceptance of our services, may adversely impact the recoverability of these assets. See Note 2(f) to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. During the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2005, we replaced internal use software programs, which resulted in the write off to loss on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of the remaining net book value of $0.7 million and $1.1 million, respectively. We did not have any such write offs during 2004. Income Taxes We have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. If actual results differ unfavorably from certain of our estimates used, we may not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred income tax assets and additional valuation allowances may be required. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that our estimates reflected in the tax provisions and accruals will equal our actual results. These differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. We are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. Although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in changes in our estimates. We have not provided deferred taxes on book basis differences related to certain foreign subsidiaries because such basis differences are not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future and we intend to reinvest indefinitely outside the U.S. These basis differences arose primarily through the undistributed book earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The basis differences could be reversed through a sale of the subsidiaries, the receipt of dividends from subsidiaries as well as certain other events or actions on our part, which would result in an increase in our provision for income taxes. Stock Based Compensation As of January 1, 2003, we adopted the measurement provisions of SFAS No. 123, as amended by SFAS No. 148. As a result we began using the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation in our financial statements beginning January 1, 2003 using the prospective method. The prospective method involves recognizing expense for the fair value for all awards granted or modified in the year of adoption and thereafter with no expense recognition for previous awards. We have applied the fair value recognition provisions to all stock based awards granted, modified or settled on or after January 1, 2003 and will continue to provide the required pro forma information for all awards previously granted, modified or settled before January 1, 2003 in our consolidated financial statements. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded $6.2 million of stock compensation expense in our consolidated statement of operations. Had we elected to recognize compensation cost based on the fair value of all options as of their grant dates as prescribed by SFAS No. 123 and No. 148, we would have recorded stock compensation expense (net of tax benefit) of $3.3 million, $5.4 million and $6.0 million in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. 27 In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment. SFAS No. 123R is a revision of SFAS No. 123 and supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB No. 25). Among other items, SFAS No. 123R eliminates the use of APB No. 25 and the intrinsic value method of accounting, and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, based on the grant date fair value of those awards, in the financial statements. The effective date of SFAS No. 123R is the first reporting period in the first fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005, which would be our first quarter of 2006. SFAS No. 123R permits companies to adopt its requirements using either a modified prospective method, or a modified retrospective method. Under the modified prospective method, compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date, based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123R for all share based payments granted after that date, and based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123 for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 123R. Under the modified retrospective method, the requirements are the same as under the modified prospective method, but this method also permits entities to restate financial statements of previous periods based on pro forma disclosures made in accordance with SFAS No. 123. SFAS No. 123R also requires that the benefits associated with the tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current rules. This requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after the effective date. We will adopt SFAS No. 123R effective January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective method of implementation. Based on outstanding stock options granted to employees prior to our prospective implementation of the measurement provisions of SFAS No. 123 and SFAS No. 148 on January 1, 2003, we expect to record approximately $0.9 million of additional stock compensation expense in 2006 associated with unvested stock option grants issued prior to January 1, 2003. Self Insured Liabilities We are self insured up to certain limits for costs associated with workers compensation claims, vehicle accidents, property and general business liabilities, and benefits paid under employee healthcare and long term disability programs. At December 31, 2004 and 2005 there were approximately $25.7 million, and $30.4 million, respectively, of self insurance accruals reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. The measurement of these costs requires the consideration of historical cost experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim. We account for these costs primarily through actuarial methods, which develop estimates of the undiscounted liability for claims incurred, including those claims incurred but not reported. These methods provide estimates of future ultimate claim costs based on claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. We believe the use of actuarial methods to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals. However, the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claims involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known. We believe our recorded obligations for these expenses are appropriate. Nevertheless, changes in healthcare costs, accident frequency and severity, and other factors can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities. 28 Results of Operations Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2005 to Year Ended December 31, 2004 and Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2004 to Year Ended December 31, 2003: Year Ended December 31, Dollar Percent 2004 2005 Change Change Revenues $ 1,817,589 $ 2,078,155 $ 260,566 14.3 % Operating Expenses 1,473,093 1,691,371 218,278 14.8 % Operating Income 344,496 386,784 42,288 12.3 % Other Expenses, Net 250,305 275,685 25,380 10.1 % Net Income $ 94,191 $ 111,099 $ 16,908 18.0 % OIBDA(1) $ 508,125 $ 573,706 $ 65,581 12.9 % OIBDA Margin(1) 28.0 % 27.6 % Year Ended December 31, Dollar Percent 2003 2004 Change Change Revenues $ 1,501,329 $ 1,817,589 $ 316,260 21.1 % Operating Expenses 1,196,436 1,473,093 276,657 23.1 % Operating Income 304,893 344,496 39,603 13.0 % Other Expenses, Net 220,256 250,305 30,049 13.6 % Net Income $ 84,637 $ 94,191 $ 9,554 11.3 % OIBDA(1) $ 435,811 $ 508,125 $ 72,314 16.6 % OIBDA Margin(1) 29.0 % 28.0 % (1) See Non GAAP Measures Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization, or OIBDA for definition, reconciliation and a discussion of why we believe these measures provide relevant and useful information to our current and potential investors. Revenue Our consolidated storage revenues increased $138.2 million, or 13.2%, to $1,181.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and $168.3 million, or 19.2%, to $1,043.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, in comparison to the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase is attributable to internal revenue growth (9% during both 2005 and 2004) resulting from net increases in records and other media stored by existing customers and sales to new customers, acquisitions (3% during 2005 and 8% during 2004), primarily consisting of $91.2 million from the operations of Hays IMS in 2004, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations (1% during 2005 and 3% during 2004). Consolidated service and storage material sales revenues increased $122.4 million, or 15.8%, to $896.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and $147.9 million, or 23.6%, to $774.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, in comparison to the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase is attributable to acquisitions (7% during 2005 and 14% during 2004), including revenue from the Hays IMS operations of $86.3 million in 2004, internal revenue growth (7% during 2005 and 6% during 2004) resulting from net increases in service and storage material sales to existing customers and sales to new customers, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations (1% during 2005 and 3% during 2004). For the reasons stated above, our consolidated revenues increased $260.6 million, or 14.3%, to $2,078.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and $316.3 million, or 21.1%, to $1,817.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, in comparison to the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, 29 respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that impacted our revenues were primarily due to the strengthening of the British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and Euro against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. Internal revenue growth was 6%, 8%, and 8% for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. We calculate internal revenue growth in local currency for our international operations.

Over the past eight quarters, the internal growth rate of our storage revenues has consistently ranged between 8% and 10%. In our North American paper business, net carton volume growth showed improvement and we benefited from a more positive pricing environment in 2005 compared to 2004. Strong growth rates in our digital services business more than offset the impact of reduced growth rates in Europe resulting from the inclusion of the slower growing Hays IMS business in our base revenues for internal growth calculation purposes. Net carton volume growth is a function of the rate new cartons are added by existing and new customers offset by the rate of carton destructions and other permanent removals. 30 The internal growth rate for service and storage material sales revenue is inherently more volatile than the storage revenue internal growth rate due to the more discretionary nature of the services we offer such as large special projects or data products and carton sales, as well as the price of recycled paper. These revenues are often event driven and impacted to a greater extent by economic downturns as customers defer or cancel the purchase of these services as a way to reduce their short term costs. As a commodity, recycled paper prices are subject to the volatility of that market. The internal growth rate for service and storage material sales revenues increased during 2005 compared to 2004. The internal growth rate for service and storage material sales revenues reflects the following: (1) strong data product sales; (2) a large data restoration project completed by our digital services business; (3) growth in North American storage related service revenue; (4) continued growth in our secure shredding business; and (5) improved growth rates in our data protection business. These positive factors were partially offset by: (1) lower special project revenues related to the public sector business in the UK; and (2) a large software license sale in the first quarter of 2004 that did not repeat in 2005.

We also experienced improvement in our ratio of labor costs to revenues in our European operations as a result of completing the integration of Hays IMS in 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, labor expense increased slightly as a percentage of revenue due primarily to our mix of services. Specifically, increases in labor expense were caused by (1) more labor intensive operations, primarily in Europe and in 31 our secure shredding operations, (2) higher incentive compensation expense in 2004 compared to 2003, and (3) higher allocations of labor costs associated with internal information technology personnel and consultants to revenue producing projects in our digital business. These increases were partially offset by improved labor management in our data protection operations. Facilities Facilities costs as a percentage of consolidated revenues decreased to 13.3% for the year ended December 31, 2005 from 13.6% for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease in facilities costs as a percentage of consolidated revenues was primarily a result of maintaining approximately the same overall base rent per square foot in our North American operations during 2004 and 2005 while consolidated revenues increased. The largest component of our facilities cost is rent expense, which increased $15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily as a result of properties under lease acquired through acquisitions in both Europe and North America. The expansion of our secure shredding business, which incurs lower facilities costs than our core physical businesses, also helped lower our facilities costs as a percentage of consolidated revenues. Facilities costs as a percentage of consolidated revenues decreased to 13.6% as of December 31, 2004 from 14.1% as of December 31, 2003. The decrease in facilities costs as a percentage of consolidated revenues was primarily a result of maintaining approximately the same overall base rent per square foot in our North American operations during 2003 and 2004 while consolidated revenues increased. Rent expense increased $21.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003 primarily as a result of increased rent in our European operations of $15.4 million attributable to new facilities and properties acquired through acquisitions, including our acquisition of Hays IMS. Other facilities expenses in our European operations for year ended December 31, 2004 increased $14.4 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2003 primarily due to the growth of operations and acquisitions. Aside from our European operations, the remaining facilities expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004 were consistent with the year ended December 31, 2003. Transportation Our transportation expenses, which increased 0.2% as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, are influenced by several variables including total number of vehicles, owned versus leased vehicles, use of subcontracted couriers, fuel expenses and maintenance. Higher fuel expenses during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 were primarily responsible for the increase in transportation expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues. Our transportation expenses increased 0.2% as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, are influenced by several variables including total number of vehicles, owned versus leased vehicles, use of subcontracted couriers, fuel expenses, and maintenance. In the year ended December 31, 2004, we experienced a $7.0 million increase in transportation expenses in our European operations as compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, which is primarily attributable to an increase in fleet size and vehicles under operating lease resulting from the acquisition of Hays IMS and growth of operations. An increased percentage of vehicles under operating lease, higher fuel expenses, and increased subcontracted courier expenses during the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003 also contributed to higher expenses. Product and Other Cost of Sales Product and other cost of sales are highly correlated to complementary revenue streams. Product and other cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 were higher than the year ended December 31, 32 2004 as a percentage of consolidated revenues due to increased sales of data products at lower margins in North America, increased royalty payments associated with our electronic vaulting revenues and increases in technology costs associated with these revenue producing activities. Product and other cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 were higher than the year ended December 31, 2003 as a percentage of consolidated revenues due to increased royalty payments associated with our electronic vaulting revenues and increased sales of lower margin data products in the second half of 2004. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses are comprised of the following expenses (in thousands): % of Consolidated Revenues Percent Change 2004 2005 Dollar Change Percent Change 2004 2005 (Favorable)/ Unfavorable General andAdministrative $ 259,209 $ 285,558 $ 26,349 10.2 % 14.3 % 13.7 % (0.6 )% Sales, Marketing & Account Management 150,419 180,558 30,139 20.0 % 8.3 % 8.7 % 0.4 % Information Technology 81,187 99,177 17,990 22.2 % 4.5 % 4.8 % 0.3 % Bad Debt Expense (4,569 ) 4,402 8,971 196.3 % (0.3 )% 0.2 % 0.5 % $ 486,246 $ 569,695 $ 83,449 17.2 % 26.8 % 27.4 % 0.6. % % of Consolidated Revenues Percent Change 2003 2004 Dollar Change Percent Change 2003 2004 Favorable)/ Unfavorable General and Administrative $ 206,293 $ 259,209 $ 52,916 25.7 % 13.7 % 14.3 % 0.6 % Sales, Marketing & Account Management 111,432 150,419 38,987 35.0 % 7.4 % 8.3 % 0.9 % Information Technology 68,208 81,187 12,979 19.0 % 4.5 % 4.5 % % Bad Debt Expense (2,292 ) (4,569 ) (2,277 ) (99.3 )% (0.2 )% (0.3 )% (0.1 )% $ 383,641 $ 486,246 $ 102,605 26.7 % 25.6 % 26.8 % 1.2 % General and Administrative The decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 is attributable to strong revenue growth and controls over overhead spending implemented in late 2004. These decreases were partially offset by increased incentive compensation expense and growth of our North American and European operations due to expansion and acquisitions. The increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003 is primarily attributable to a $31.0 million increase in general and administrative expenses in our European operations due to the growth of operations and acquisitions, including Hays IMS. In our North American operations, general and administrative expenses increased as a result of increased headcount and higher wages due to normal inflation and merit increases, increased stock compensation expense, increased travel, recruiting, and professional fees, including costs associated with compliance with the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. These increases were partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense. Sales, Marketing & Account Management The majority of our sales, marketing and account management costs are labor related and are primarily driven by the headcount in each of these departments. Increased headcount and related 33 compensation and commissions are the most significant contributors to the increase in sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. Throughout the year ended December 31, 2004 and during 2005, we have continued to invest in the expansion and improvement of our sales force and account management personnel. We have added sales and marketing employees and enlarged our account management force.The costs associated with these efforts have contributed to the increase in our sales, marketing and account management expenses. Our larger North American sales force generated a $3.0 million increase in sales commissions and an increase of $14.8 million of compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased $3.3 million due to the introduction of several new marketing and promotional efforts to continue to develop awareness in the marketplace of our entire portfolio of services, especially our digital services. During the year ended December 31, 2004 our North American sales force generated an increase in sales commissions of $10.3 million over the year ended December 31, 2003. In addition, costs associated with our European sales, marketing and account management teams increased by $8.1 million and $7.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, compared to the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, due to additions to our sales force through the hiring of new personnel and acquisitions. Information Technology Information technology expenses increased as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 due to increases in internal software development projects within our digital services business, the acquisitions of Connected and LiveVault and associated research and development activities, and increased information technology spending in our European operations. Higher utilization of existing information technology resources to revenue producing projects, which are charged to cost of goods sold, partially offset this increase. Information technology expenses remained flat as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. Higher utilization of existing information technology resources and increased allocations of information technology resources to revenue producing projects, which are charged to cost of goods sold, were offset by increases in internal software development projects within our digital services business, the acquisition of Connected, associated research and development activities and increased information technology spending in our European operations of $8.5 million. Bad Debt Expense Consolidated bad debt expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 reflects what we believe to be more normal levels of bad debt expense. The decrease in consolidated bad debt expense for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004 compared to prior years is primarily attributable to the success of our centralized collection efforts within the U.S. and Canada, which resulted in improved cash collections and an improved accounts receivable aging that allowed us to reduce our allowance for doubtful accounts during the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004. Depreciation, Amortization, and (Gain) and Loss on Disposal/Writedown of Property, Plant and Equipment, Net Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased $23.3 million to $187.0 million (9.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $163.6 million (9.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2004. Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased $32.7 million to $163.6 million (9.0% of consolidated revenues) for the 34 year ended December 31, 2004 from $130.9 million (8.7% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2003. Depreciation expense increased $18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 and increased $28.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, primarily due to the additional depreciation expense related to recent capital expenditures and acquisitions, including storage systems, which include racking, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and software, and buildings. Amortization expense increased $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 and increased $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, primarily due to amortization of intangible assets, such as customer relationship intangible assets and intellectual property acquired through business combinations, including the Connected acquisition in November 2004. We expect that amortization expense will continue to increase as we acquire new businesses and reflect the full year impact of recent acquisitions, including LiveVault and Pickfords. Consolidated gains on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, consisted primarily of a gain on the sale of a property in the U.K of $4.5 million offset primarily by software asset writedowns of $1.1 million. Consolidated gains on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, consisted primarily of a $1.2 million gain on the sale of a property in Florida during the second quarter of 2004 offset by disposals and asset writedowns. We recorded consolidated losses on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of $1.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2003 consisting of disposals and asset writedowns partially offset by $4.2 million of gains on the sale of properties in Texas, Florida and the U.K. Operating Income As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated operating income increased $42.3 million, or 12.3%, to $386.8 million (18.6% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $344.5 million (19.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2004. Consolidated operating income increased $39.6 million, or 13.0%, to $344.5 million (19.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $304.9 million (20.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2003. OIBDA As a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated OIBDA increased $65.6 million, or 12.9%, to $573.7 million (27.6% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $508.1 million (28.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2004. Consolidated OIBDA increased $72.3 million, or 16.6%, to $508.1 million (28.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $435.8 million (29.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2003. Interest Expense, Net Consolidated interest expense, net decreased $2.2 million to $183.6 million (8.8% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $185.7 million (10.2% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2004. The dollar decrease in interest expense, net was primarily due to the recording of interest expense totaling $21.5 million for the year ending December 31, 2004 compared to interest expense totaling $2.3 million for the year ending December 31, 2005 related to the net impact of 35 mark to market adjustments and cash payments on all of our interest rate swap contracts. This was offset by increased borrowings, primarily an additional $150.0 million of term loans borrowed in November 2004 as permitted under our IMI Credit Agreement and the full year effect of the March 2004 IME Credit Agreement. Consolidated interest expense, net increased $35.3 million to $185.7 million (10.2% of consolidated revenues) for year ended December 31, 2004 from $150.5 million (10.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2003. Increased borrowings, primarily from the issuance of our 714% GBP Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014, contributed to the dollar increase in interest expense. The increase of interest expense, net as a percentage of consolidated revenues was partially due to charges totaling $9.5 million (0.5% of consolidated revenues) related to recharacterization of interest rate swaps associated with real estate term loans we repaid in March and August 2004. These charges represent the fair market value of the swaps, which is a calculation of the net present value of the expected monthly cash payments over the remaining term of the swap based on current market conditions, as of the date the real estate term loans were repaid. We did not terminate the swaps and will continue to mark to market the fair market value of the derivative liability to expense, net and make our monthly cash payments as required under the swap contract for their remaining terms.

Foreign currency gains of $30.2 million and $8.9 million based on period end exchange rates were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004, respectively, primarily due to the strengthening of the British pound sterling, Euro, and the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar as these currencies relate to our inter company balances with and between our Canadian, U.K., and European subsidiaries, U.S. dollar denominated debt held by our Canadian subsidiary, borrowings denominated in foreign currencies under our revolving credit facility, British pounds sterling denominated debt held by our U.S. parent company, British pounds sterling currency held in the U.S. and our British pound sterling denominated cross currency swap, which was terminated in March 2004. During the three months ended March 31, 2004, we redeemed the remaining outstanding principal amount of the 818% Senior Notes due 2008 of our Canadian subsidiary (the Subsidiary notes), resulting 36 in a charge of $2.0 million, and we repaid a portion of our real estate term loans, which resulted in a charge of $0.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we redeemed the remaining outstanding principal amount of our 918% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2007, resulting in a charge of $1.8 million, the remaining outstanding principal amount of our 834% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2009, resulting in a charge of $13.8 million, and $115.0 million of the outstanding principal of our Subsidiary notes, resulting in a charge of $12.6 million. The charges consisted primarily of the call and tender premiums associated with the extinguished debt and the write off of unamortized deferred financing cost and discounts. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004, and 2005 were 42.5%, 41.7%, and 41.4%, respectively. The primary reconciling item between the statutory rate of 35% and our effective rate is state income taxes (net of federal benefit). We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. Although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in changes in our estimates. Minority Interest Minority interest in earnings of subsidiaries, net resulted in a charge to income of $5.6 million (0.4% of consolidated revenues), $3.0 million (0.2% of consolidated revenues) and $1.7 million (0.1% of consolidated revenues) for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004, and 2005, respectively. This represents our minority partners share of earnings in our majority owned international subsidiaries that are consolidated in our operating results. The decrease during 2005 is the result of our acquisition of various Latin American minority partner interests. The decrease during 2004 is a result of our acquisition of the remaining 49.9% equity interest in IME which was reflected for the first time during the second quarter of 2004. Increased profitability of our South American businesses in 2003 and 2004 contributed to the increase in minority interest in 2003 and offset the impact of acquiring the remaining 49.9% equity interest in IME in 2004. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations (FIN 47), an interpretation of SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS No. 143). FIN 47 clarifies that conditional asset retirement obligations meet the definition of liabilities and should be recognized when incurred if their fair values can be reasonably estimated. Uncertainty surrounding the timing and method of settlement that may be conditional on events occurring in the future are factored into the measurement of the liability rather than the existence of the liability. SFAS No. 143 established accounting and reporting standards for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets legally required by law, regulatory rule or contractual agreement and the associated asset retirement costs. SFAS No. 143 requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset, which is then depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The liability is increased over time through income as a component of depreciation expense, such that the liability will equate to the future cost to retire the long lived asset at the expected retirement date. Upon settlement of the liability, an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement. Our obligations are primarily the result of requirements under our facility lease agreements which generally have return to original condition clauses which would require us to remove or restore items such as 37 shred pits, vaults, demising walls and office build outs, among others. As of December 31, 2005, we have recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying FIN 47 as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle as prescribed in FIN 47, which resulted in a gross charge of $4.4 million ($2.8 million, net of tax). Net Income As a result of the foregoing factors, for the year ended December 31, 2005, consolidated net income increased $16.9 million, or 18.0%, to $111.1 million (5.3% of consolidated revenues) from net income of $94.2 million (5.2% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2004. As a result of the foregoing factors, for the year ended December 31, 2004, consolidated net income increased $9.6 million, or 11.3%, to $94.2 million (5.2% of consolidated revenues) from net income of $84.6 million (5.6% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2003.

During the year ended December 31, 2005, revenue in our business records management segment increased 8.9% primarily due to increasing storage internal growth rates resulting from higher net volume growth and a more positive pricing environment, increased service revenue growth rates, growth of our secure shredding operations and acquisitions. In addition, favorable currency fluctuations during the year ended December 31, 2005 in Canada increased revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, by $8.7 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue increased in the year ended December 31, 2005 due to strong revenue growth and the effectiveness of recent labor 38 and cost management initiatives, which were partially offset by increases in transportation, bad debt and facility related expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2004, revenue in our business records management segment increased 8.3% primarily due to increased storage revenues, growth of our secure shredding operations and acquisitions (including a full year of revenue from the U.S. operations of Hays IMS in 2004 which represents an increase of $8.6 million over the partial year of revenue recorded in 2003), and was impacted by slower growth in service and special project revenue. In addition, favorable currency fluctuations during the year ended December 31, 2004 in Canada increased revenue $7.8 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue decreased in the year ended December 31, 2004 due to higher transportation expenses and our increased investment in our sales and account management force, which were partially offset by reduced facility expenses.

During the year ended December 31, 2005, revenue in our data protection segment increased 16.3% primarily due to higher internal growth rates from our product sales and electronic vaulting services which were supported by improved internal growth rates in our core data protection business. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue increased primarily due to strong revenue growth, labor and cost management initiatives and was partially offset by increased product sales at lower margins and the growth of our sales and account management force, including higher sales commissions. During the year ended December 31, 2004, revenue in our data protection segment increased 11.1% primarily due to internal revenue growth from both existing and new customers. Higher revenue growth rates from our product sales, electronic vaulting, and intellectual property management services augmented the segments overall revenue growth rate. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue decreased primarily due to decreased product sales margins, increased royalty payments, and the growth of our sales and account management force including higher sales commissions. This decrease was partially offset by improved labor management and stable overhead costs. 39 International Segment Revenue Increase in Revenues Percentage Increase in Revenues For Years Ended December 31, 2003 December 31, 2004 December 31, 2005 December 31, 2004 December 31, 2005 December 31, 2004 December 31, 2005 $198,068 $ 380,033 $ 435,269 $ 181,965 $ 55,236 91.9 % 14.5 % Segment Contribution(1) Segment Contribution(1) as a Percentage of Segment Revenue For Years Ended December 31, 2003 December 31, 2004 December 31, 2005 December 31, 2003 December 31, 2004 December 31, 2005 $46,825 $ 89,751 $ 113,278 23.6 % 23.6 % 26.0 % Items Excluded from the Calculation of Segment Contribution(1) Depreciation and Amortization Foreign Currency (Gains) Losses, Net Loss (Gain) on Disposal/Writedown of Property, Plant and Equipment, Net For Years Ended December 31, 2003 December 31, 2004 December 31, 2005 December 31, 2003 December 31, 2004 December 31, 2005 December 31, 2003 December 31, 2004 December 31, 2005 $16,048 $ 33,234 $ 43,285 $ 507 $ 1,562 $ 6,347 $ (879 ) $ 176 $ (3,757 ) (1) See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for definition of Contribution and for the basis on which allocations are made and a reconciliation of Contribution to income before provision for income taxes and minority interest on a consolidated basis. Revenue in our international segment increased 14.5% during the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to acquisitions completed in Europe and in South America and strong internal growth in Latin America, offset by lower revenue in our U.K. public sector business. Favorable currency fluctuations during the year ended December 31, 2005 in Europe, Mexico and South America increased revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, by $13.8 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue increased primarily due to improvements in both cost of sales and overhead labor ratios as a result of completing the integration of Hays IMS in the second half of 2004 offset by increased compensation associated with additional sales, marketing, and account management personnel, several new marketing and promotional efforts, and increased bad debt expense. Revenue in our international segment increased 91.9% during the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to acquisitions completed in Europe, including a full year of revenue from the acquisition of Hays IMS in 2004 which represents an increase of $114.2 million over the partial year of revenue recorded in 2003, and in South America and strong internal growth in both Europe and Latin America. Favorable currency fluctuations during the year ended December 31, 2004 in Europe, Mexico and South America increased revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, by $35.7 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue remained flat primarily due to lower gross margins and increased overhead in our European operations attributable to our acquisition integration efforts and the establishment of a new shared service center offset by improved gross margins from our South American and Mexican operations. Corporate and Other The Corporate and Other segment is comprised of results from operations not discussed above, including our digital archiving services, PC/Desktop computing electronic vaulting services, consulting and fulfillment operations and costs associated with our corporate headquarters operations. Certain costs 40 incurred by our Corporate division were allocated to the other segments in the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, primarily to our Business Records Management and Data Protection segments. These allocations, which include rent, workers compensation, property, general liability, auto and other insurance, pension/medical costs, incentive compensation, real estate property taxes and provision for bad debts, are based on rates set at the beginning of each year. Revenue in our Corporate and Other segment increased $61.0 million to $112.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and $21.2 million to $51.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $29.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The 2005 dollar increases were due primarily to strong internal growth in our digital services business, including a large data restoration project and the acquisition of Connected in November 2004. Contribution decreased $7.9 million to $22.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and decreased $2.2 million to $30.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $32.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Items excluded from the calculation of Contribution include the following: (1) depreciation and amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004, and 2005 of $29.4 million, $32.6 million, and $42.3 million, respectively; (2) foreign currency (gains) loss of $(1.3) million, $(8.4) million, and $4.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004, and 2005, respectively; (3) debt extinguishment expense of $15.6 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004, respectively, and (4) losses on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of $0.7 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2005, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following is a summary of our cash balances and cash flows for the years ended 2003, 2004 and 2005 (in thousands). 2003 2004 2005 Cash flows provided by operating activities $ 288,693 $ 305,364 $ 377,176 Cash flows used in investing activities (586,634 ) (626,523 ) (436,175 ) Cash flows provided by financing activities 315,054 276,569 81,449 Cash and cash equivalents at the end of year 74,683 31,942 53,413 Net cash provided by operating activities was $305.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to $377.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in operating income and non cash items, such as depreciation and amortization and an improvement in working capital year over year. Due to the nature of our businesses, we make significant capital expenditures and additions to customer relationship and acquisition costs. Our capital expenditures are primarily related to growth and include investments in storage systems, information systems and discretionary investments in real estate. Cash paid for our capital expenditures and additions to customer relationship and acquisition costs during the year ended December 31, 2005 amounted to $272.1 million and $13.4 million, respectively. From time to time and in the normal course of business we sell certain fixed assets, primarily real estate. In the year ended December 31, 2005, we received $28.6 million of net proceeds from the sales of assets. For the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, capital expenditures, net and additions to customer relationship and acquisition costs were funded entirely with cash flows provided by operating activities. Excluding acquisitions, we expect our capital expenditures to be between $300 million and $355 million in the year ending December 31, 2006. In the year ended December 31, 2005, we paid net cash consideration of $178.2 million for acquisitions, which included approximately $86 million to purchase Pickfords and $36 million to purchase 41 LiveVault. Cash flows from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and net proceeds from other financing transactions funded these acquisitions. Net cash provided by financing activities was $81.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we had gross borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and term loan facilities of $568.7 million. We used the proceeds from these financing transactions and cash flows from operations to repay debt and term loans ($509.6) million, to repay debt financing from minority shareholders, net ($2.4) million and to fund acquisitions. We are highly leveraged and expect to continue to be highly leveraged for the foreseeable future. Our consolidated debt as of December 31, 2005 was comprised of the following (in thousands): IMI Revolving Credit Facility(1) $ 216,396 IMI Term Loan Facility(1) 345,500 IME Revolving Credit Facility 84,262 IME Term Loan Facility 177,450 814% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011(2) 149,760 858% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013(2) 481,032 714% GBP Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014(2) 258,120 734% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2015(2) 439,506 658% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016(2) 315,059 Real Estate Mortgages 4,707 Seller Notes 9,398 Other 48,241 Long term Debt 2,529,431 Less Current Portion (25,905 ) Long term Debt, Net of Current Portion $ 2,503,526 (1) All intercompany notes and the capital stock of most of our U.S. subsidiaries are pledged to secure these debt instruments. (2) These debt instruments are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior subordinated basis, by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries (the Guarantors). These guarantees are joint and several obligations of the Guarantors. The remainder of our subsidiaries do not guarantee the senior subordinated notes. Our indentures use OIBDA based calculations as primary measures of financial performance, including leverage ratios. Our key bond leverage ratio, as calculated per our bond indentures, was 5.0 as of December 31, 2004 and 2005. Noncompliance with this leverage ratio would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity. Our target for this ratio is generally in the range of 4.5 to 5.5 while the maximum ratio allowable under the bond indentures is 6.5. Our ability to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, working capital levels and capital structure, which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors which may be beyond our control. There can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future financings will be available on acceptable terms or in amounts sufficient to enable us to service or refinance our indebtedness, or to make necessary capital expenditures. In March 2004, IME and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement (the IME Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of European lenders. The IME Credit Agreement provides for maximum borrowing availability in the principal amount of 200 million British pounds sterling, including a 100 million British pounds sterling revolving credit facility (the IME revolving credit facility), which includes 42 the ability to borrow in certain other foreign currencies and a 100 million British pounds sterling term loan (the IME term loan facility). The IME revolving credit facility matures on March 5, 2009. The IME term loan facility is payable in three installments; two installments of 20 million British pounds sterling on March 5, 2007 and 2008, respectively, and the final payment of the remaining balance on March 5, 2009. The interest rate on borrowings under the IME Credit Agreement varies depending on IMEs choice of currency options and interest rate period, plus an applicable margin. The IME Credit Agreement includes various financial covenants applicable to the results of IME, which may restrict IMEs ability to incur indebtedness under the IME Credit Agreement and from third parties, as well as limit IMEs ability to pay dividends to us. Most of IMEs non dormant subsidiaries have either guaranteed the obligations or have their shares pledged to secure IMEs obligations under the IME Credit Agreement. We have not guaranteed or otherwise provided security for the IME Credit Agreement nor have any of our U.S., Canadian, Asia Pacific, Mexican or South American subsidiaries. In March 2004, IME borrowed approximately 147 million British pounds sterling under the IME Credit Agreement, including the full amount of the term loan. IME used those proceeds to repay us 135 million British pounds sterling related to our initial financing of the acquisition of the European operations of Hays IMS, to repay amounts outstanding under its prior term loan and revolving credit facility and to pay transaction costs associated with the IME Credit Agreement. We used the 135 million British pounds sterling received from IME to: (1) pay down approximately $104 million of real estate term loans, (2) settle all obligations totaling $27.7 million associated with terminating our two cross currency swaps used to hedge the foreign currency impact of our intercompany financing with IME related to the Hays IMS acquisition and (3) to pay down amounts outstanding under our prior credit agreement. Our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2005 included 147.5 million British pounds sterling ($261.7 million) of borrowings under the IME Credit Agreement. The remaining availability, based on its current level of external debt and the leverage ratio under the IME revolving credit facility on October 31, 2005, was approximately 61.4 million British pounds sterling ($109.0 million). The interest rate in effect under the IME revolving credit facility ranged from 3.3% to 6.2% as of December 31, 2005. On April 2, 2004 and subsequently on July 8, 2004, we entered into a new amended and restated credit facility and term loan facility (the IMI Credit Agreement) to replace our prior credit agreement and to reflect more favorable pricing of our term loans. The IMI Credit Agreement had an aggregate principal amount of $550.0 million and was comprised of a $350.0 million revolving credit facility (the IMI revolving credit facility), which included the ability to borrow in certain foreign currencies, and a $200.0 million term loan facility (the IMI term loan facility). The IMI revolving credit facility matures on April 2, 2009. With respect to the IMI term loan facility, quarterly loan payments of $0.5 million began in the third quarter of 2004 and will continue through maturity on April 2, 2011, at which time the remaining outstanding principal balance of the IMI term loan facility is due. In November 2004, we entered into an additional $150.0 million of term loans as permitted under our IMI Credit Agreement. The new term loans will mature at the same time as our current IMI term loan facility with quarterly loan payments of $0.4 million that began in the first quarter of 2005 and are priced at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.75%. On October 31, 2005, we entered into the second amendment to the IMI Credit Agreement increasing availability from $350.0 million to $400.0 million. As a result, the IMI Credit Agreement had an aggregate maximum principal amount of $750 million as of December 31, 2005. The interest rate on borrowings under the IMI Credit Agreement varies depending on our choice of interest rate and currency options, plus an applicable margin. All intercompany notes and the capital stock of most of our U.S. subsidiaries are pledged to secure the IMI Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2005, we had $216.4 million of borrowings under the IMI revolving credit facility, of which $9 million was denominated in U.S. dollars and the remaining balance was denominated in Canadian dollars (CAD 168.3 million) and in Australian dollars (AUD 86.3 million); we also had various outstanding letters of credit totaling $24.0 million. The remaining availability, based on IMIs current level of external debt and the leverage ratio under the IMI revolving 43 credit facility, on December 31, 2005 was $159.6 million. The interest rate in effect under the IMI revolving credit facility and IMI term loan facility was 5.8% and 6.2%, respectively, as of December 31, 2005. The IME Credit Agreement, IMI Credit Agreement and our indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to complete acquisitions, pay cash dividends, incur indebtedness, make investments, sell assets and take certain other corporate actions. The covenants do not contain a rating trigger. Therefore, a change in our debt rating would not trigger a default under the IME Credit Agreement, IMI Credit Agreement and our indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness. As of December 31, 2005, we were in compliance with all material debt covenants and agreements. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2005 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 Years Long term Debt (including Capital Lease Obligations) $ 2,526,201 $ 25,905 $ 95,574 $ 420,169 $ 1,984,553 Interest Payments(1) 1,090,003 141,961 267,885 260,307 419,850 Operating Lease Obligations 1,113,797 164,022 273,256 202,936 473,583 Purchase and Asset Retirement Obligations(2) 95,426 40,952 34,911 9,628 9,935 Total $ 4,825,427 $ 372,840 $ 671,626 $ 893,040 $ 2,887,921 (1) Amounts do not include variable rate interest payments; see Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the applicable interest rates. (2) In addition, in connection with some of our acquisitions, we have potential earn out obligations that may be payable in the event businesses we acquired meet certain operational objectives. These payments are based on the future results of these operations, and our estimate of the maximum contingent earn out payments we may be required to make under all such agreements as of December 31, 2005 is approximately $21.2 million. We expect to meet our cash flow requirements for the next twelve months from cash generated from operations, existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, borrowings under the IMI and IME revolving credit facilities and other financings, which may include secured credit facilities, securitizations and mortgage or capital lease financings. We expect to meet our long term cash flow requirements using the same means described above, as well as the potential issuance of debt or equity securities as we deem appropriate. See Notes 4, 8 and 11 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Regulation S K Item 303(a)(4)(ii). Net Operating Loss Carryforwards At December 31, 2005, we had estimated net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $124 million for federal income tax purposes. As a result of such loss carryforwards, cash paid for income taxes has historically been substantially lower than the provision for income taxes. These net operating loss carryforwards do not include approximately $103 million of potential pre acquisition net operating loss 44 carryforwards of Arcus Group, Inc. Any tax benefit realized related to preacquisition net operating loss carryforwards will be recorded as a reduction of goodwill when, and if, realized. As a result of these loss carryforwards, we do not expect to pay any significant U.S. federal and state income taxes in 2006. Seasonality Historically, our businesses have not been subject to seasonality in any material respect. Inflation Certain of our expenses, such as wages and benefits, insurance, occupancy costs and equipment repair and replacement, are subject to normal inflationary pressures. Although to date we have been able to offset inflationary cost increases through increased operating efficiencies and the negotiation of favorable long term real estate leases, we can give no assurance that we will be able to offset any future inflationary cost increases through similar efficiencies, leases or increased storage or service charges. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Interest Rate Risk Given the recurring nature of our revenues and the long term nature of our asset base, we have the ability and the preference to use long term, fixed interest rate debt to finance our business, thereby helping to preserve our long term returns on invested capital. We target a range 80% to 85% of our debt portfolio to be fixed with respect to interest rates. Occasionally, we will use floating to fixed interest rate swaps as a tool to maintain our targeted level of fixed rate debt. As part of this strategy, in December 2000, May 2001, and April 2004 we and IME entered into a total of four derivative financial contracts, which are variable for fixed interest rate swaps consisting of (a) one contract for interest payments payable on the IMI term loan facility of an aggregate principal amount of $99.5 million that was reduced to an aggregate principal amount of $51.5 million as of December 31, 2005, (b) one contract based on interest payments previously payable on our real estate term loans of an aggregate principal amount of $97.0 million that have been subsequently repaid, and (c) two contracts for interest payments payable on IMEs term loan facility of an aggregate principal amount of 100.0 million British pounds sterling. See Note 3 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. After consideration of the swap contracts mentioned above, as of December 31, 2005, we had $517.0 million of variable rate debt outstanding with a weighted average variable interest rate of 5.6%, and $2,012.4 million of fixed rate debt outstanding. As of December 31, 2005, 80% of our total debt outstanding was fixed. If the weighted average variable interest rate on our variable rate debt had increased by 1%, our net income for the year ended December 31, 2005 would have been reduced by $2.3 million. See Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K for a discussion of our long term indebtedness, including the fair values of such indebtedness as of December 31, 2005. Currency Risk Our investments in IME, Iron Mountain Canada Corporation (IM Canada), Iron Mountain Mexico, SA de RL de CV, IMSA and other international investments may be subject to risks and uncertainties related to fluctuations in currency valuation. Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. However, our international revenues and expenses are generated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate, primarily the Euro, Canadian dollar and British pound sterling. The currencies of many Latin American countries, particularly the Argentine peso, have experienced substantial volatility and depreciation. Declines in the value of the local currencies in which we are paid relative to the U.S. dollar will cause revenues in U.S. dollar terms to decrease and dollar denominated liabilities to increase in local currency. 45 The impact on our earnings is mitigated somewhat by the fact that most operating and other expenses are also incurred and paid in the local currency. We also have several intercompany obligations between our foreign subsidiaries and Iron Mountain and our U.S. based subsidiaries and our foreign subsidiaries and IME. These intercompany obligations are primarily denominated in the local currency of the foreign subsidiary. We have adopted and implemented a number of strategies to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in currency valuations. One strategy is to finance our largest international subsidiaries with local debt that is denominated in local currencies, thereby providing a natural hedge. In determining the amount of any such financing, we take into account local tax strategies among other factors. Another strategy we utilize is to borrow in foreign currencies at the U.S. parent level to hedge our intercompany financing activities. Finally, on occasion, we enter into currency swaps to temporarily hedge an overseas investment, such as a major acquisition to lock in certain transaction economics, while we arrange permanent financing. We have implemented these strategies for our three foreign investments in the U.K., Canada and Asia Pacific. Specifically, through IME borrowing under the IME Credit Agreement and our 150 million British pounds sterling denominated 714% senior subordinated notes, we effectively hedge most of our outstanding intercompany loan with IME. IM Canada has financed their capital needs through direct borrowings in Canadian dollars under the IMI revolving credit facility. This creates a tax efficient natural currency hedge. To fund the acquisition of Pickfords in Australia and New Zealand, IMI borrowed Australian and New Zealand dollars under its multi currency revolving credit facility. These borrowings provide a tax efficient natural hedge against the intercompany loans created at the time of the acquisition. The impact of devaluation or depreciating currency on an entity depends on the residual effect on the local economy and the ability of an entity to raise prices and or reduce expenses. Due to our constantly changing currency exposure and the potential substantial volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange fluctuations on our business. The effect of a change in foreign exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the Accumulated Other Comprehensive Items component of stockholders equity. A 10% depreciation in year end 2005 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction in our stockholders equity of approximately $30 million.
