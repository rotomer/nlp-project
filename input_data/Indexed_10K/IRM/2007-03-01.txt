(2) Effective January 1, 2003, we began using the fair value method of accounting in our financial statements using the prospective method in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. As a result, we recorded $1,664, $3,857, $6,189 and $12,387 for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively, associated with such stock compensation expenses. We adopted SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment. effective January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective method, as permitted under SFAS No. 123R. We record stock based compensation expense for the cost of stock options, restricted stock and shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123R beginning January 1, 2006. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the incremental stock based compensation expense due to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R caused income before provision for income taxes and minority interest to decrease by $894, and net income to decrease by $539, and had no impact on basic and diluted earnings per share. (3) OIBDA is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization expenses. OIBDA Margin is calculated by dividing OIBDA by total revenues. For a more detailed definition and 23 reconciliation of OIBDA and a discussion of why we believe these measures provide relevant and useful information to our current and potential investors, see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Non GAAP Measures. (4) In connection with the sale of Arcus Staffing Resources, Inc., which was accounted for as a discontinued operation, we recorded income from discontinued operations of $1,116 (net of tax of $768) in 2002 related to the reversal of remaining liabilities associated with certain contingencies which have been resolved. (5) Effective January 1, 2002, we reviewed goodwill for impairment consistent with the guidelines of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and other Intangible Assets, using a discounted future cash flow approach to approximate fair value. The result of testing our goodwill for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 142, as of January 1, 2002, was a non cash charge of $6,396 (net of minority interest of $8,487) related to the impairment of goodwill associated with our investment in South America due primarily to the deterioration of the economy and the devaluation of the currency in Argentina. (6) Effective December 31, 2005, we adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143. As a result, a non cash charge of $2,751 net of tax benefit was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005 as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. See Note 2(f) to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Item 6. Selected Financial Data and the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto and the other financial and operating information included elsewhere in this filing. This discussion contains forward looking statements, as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and in other federal securities laws. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements on page ii of this filing and Item 1A. Risk Factors beginning on page 14 of this filing. Overview Our revenues consist of storage revenues as well as service and storage material sales revenues. Storage revenues, both physical and digital, which are considered a key performance indicator for the information protection and storage services industry, consist of largely recurring periodic charges related to the storage of materials or data (generally on a per unit or per cubic foot of records basis), which are typically retained by customers for many years, and have accounted for over 56% of total consolidated revenues in each of the last five years. Our quarterly revenues from these fixed periodic storage fees have grown for 72 consecutive quarters. Service and storage material sales revenues are comprised of charges for related service activities and courier operations and the sale of software licenses and storage materials. Included in service and storage materials sales are related core service revenues arising from: (1) the handling of records including the addition of new records, temporary removal of records from storage, refiling of removed records, destruction of records, and permanent withdrawals from storage; (2) courier operations, consisting primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request; (3) secure shredding of sensitive documents; and (4) other recurring services including maintenance and support contracts. Our complementary services revenues arise from special project work, including data restoration, providing fulfillment services, consulting services and product sales, including software licenses, specially designed storage containers, magnetic media (including computer tapes) and related supplies. Our consolidated revenues are subject to variations caused by the net effect of foreign currency 24 translation on revenue derived from outside the U.S. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, we derived approximately 27%, 28% and 30%, respectively, of our total revenues from outside the U.S. We recognize revenue when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Storage and service revenues are recognized in the month the respective storage or service is provided and customers are generally billed on a monthly basis on contractually agreed upon terms. Amounts related to future storage or prepaid service contracts, including maintenance and support contracts, for customers where storage fees or services are billed in advance are accounted for as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the applicable storage or service period or when the service is performed. Storage material sales are recognized when shipped to the customer and include software license sales (less than 1% of consolidated revenues in 2006). Sales of software licenses to distributors are recognized at the time a distributor reports that the software has been licensed to an end user and all revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. Cost of sales (excluding depreciation) consists primarily of wages and benefits for field personnel, facility occupancy costs (including rent and utilities), transportation expenses (including vehicle leases and fuel), other product cost of sales and other equipment costs and supplies. Of these, wages and benefits and facility occupancy costs are the most significant. Trends in total wages and benefits dollars and as a percentage of total consolidated revenue are influenced by changes in headcount and compensation levels, achievement of incentive compensation targets, workforce productivity and variability in costs associated with medical insurance and workers compensation. Trends in facility occupancy costs are similarly impacted by the total number of facilities we occupy, the mix of properties we own versus properties we occupy under operating leases, fluctuations in per square foot occupancy costs, and the levels of utilization of these properties. The expansion of our European, secure shredding and digital services businesses has impacted the major cost of sales components. Our European and secure shredding operations are more labor intensive than our core physical businesses and therefore increase our labor costs as a percent of consolidated revenues. This trend is partially offset by our digital services businesses, which require significantly less direct labor. Our secure shredding operations incur less facility costs and higher transportation costs as a percent of revenues compared to our core physical businesses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits for management, administrative, information technology, sales, account management and marketing personnel, as well as expenses related to communications and data processing, travel, professional fees, bad debts, training, office equipment and supplies. Trends in total wages and benefits dollars and as a percentage of total consolidated revenue are influenced by changes in headcount and compensation levels, achievement of incentive compensation targets, workforce productivity and variability in costs associated with medical insurance. The overhead structure of our expanding European operations, as compared to our North American operations, is more labor intensive and has not achieved the same level of overhead leverage, which may result in an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of consolidated revenue, as our European operations become a more meaningful percentage of our consolidated results. Similarly, our digital services business requires a higher level of overhead, particularly in the area of information technology, than our core physical businesses. 25 Our adoption of the measurement provisions of SFAS No. 123 as amended by SFAS No. 148 has resulted in increasing amounts of selling, general and administrative expenses. We began using the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation in our financial statements beginning January 1, 2003 using the prospective method. The prospective method involves recognizing expense for the fair value for all awards granted or modified in the year of adoption and thereafter with no expense recognition for previous awards. We adopted SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment effective January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective method, as permitted under SFAS No. 123R. We record stock based compensation expense for the cost of stock options, restricted stock and shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123R beginning January 1, 2006. We recorded approximately $0.9 million of additional stock compensation expense in 2006 associated with unvested stock option grants issued prior to January 1, 2003 associated with adopting SFAS No. 123R. Our depreciation and amortization charges result primarily from the capital intensive nature of our business. The principal components of depreciation relate to storage systems, which include racking, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and software, and buildings. Amortization relates primarily to customer relationships and acquisition costs and core technology and is impacted by the nature and timing of acquisitions. Our consolidated revenues and expenses are subject to variations caused by the net effect of foreign currency translation on revenues and expenses incurred by our entities outside the U.S. During 2006, we have seen increases in both revenues and expenses as a result of the strengthening of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar, and decreases in both revenues and expenses as a result of the weakening of the British pound sterling and the Euro, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. It is difficult to predict how much foreign currency exchange rates will fluctuate in the future and how those fluctuations will impact individual balances reported in our consolidated statement of operations. Given the relative increase in our international operations, these fluctuations may become material on individual balances. However, because both the revenues and expenses are denominated in the local currency of the country in which they are derived or incurred, the impact of currency fluctuations on our operating income, operating margin and net income is mitigated. Non GAAP Measures Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization, or OIBDA OIBDA is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization expenses. OIBDA Margin is calculated by dividing OIBDA by total revenues. We use these measures to evaluate the operating performance of our consolidated business. As such, we believe these measures provide relevant and useful information to our current and potential investors. We use OIBDA for planning purposes and multiples of current or projected OIBDA based calculations in conjunction with our discounted cash flow models to determine our overall enterprise valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets. We believe OIBDA and OIBDA Margin are useful measures to evaluate our ability to grow our revenues faster than our operating expenses and they are an integral part of the internal reporting system we use to assess and evaluate the operating performance of our business. OIBDA does not include certain items, specifically (1) minority interest in earnings (losses) of subsidiaries, net; (2) other (income) expense, net; (3) income from discontinued operations and loss on sale of discontinued operations; and (4) cumulative effect of change in accounting principle that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results. OIBDA also does not include interest expense, net and the provision for income taxes. These expenses are associated with our capitalization and tax structures, which we do not consider when evaluating the operating profitability of our core operations. Finally, OIBDA does not include depreciation and amortization expenses, in order to eliminate the impact of capital investments, which we evaluate by comparing capital expenditures to incremental revenue generated and as a percentage of total revenues. OIBDA and OIBDA Margin should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial 26 performance reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the Unites States of America, or GAAP, such as operating or net income or cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP). Reconciliation of OIBDA to Operating Income and Net Income (In Thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2004 2005 2006 OIBDA $ 508,125 $ 573,706 $ 615,560 Less: Depreciation and Amortization 163,629 186,922 208,373 Operating Income 344,496 386,784 407,187 Less: Interest Expense, Net 185,749 183,584 194,958 Other (Income) Expense, Net (7,988 ) 6,182 (11,989 ) Provision for Income Taxes 69,574 81,484 93,795 Minority Interests in Earnings of Subsidiaries 2,970 1,684 1,560 Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle (net of tax benefit) 2,751 Net Income $ 94,191 $ 111,099 $ 128,863 Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and for the period then ended. On an on going basis, we evaluate the estimates used, including those related to accounting for acquisitions, allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos, impairment of tangible and intangible assets, income taxes, stock based compensation and self insured liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience, actuarial estimates, current conditions and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Our critical accounting policies include the following, which are listed in no particular order: Accounting for Acquisitions Part of our growth strategy has included the acquisition of numerous businesses. The purchase price of these acquisitions has been determined after due diligence of the acquired business, market research, strategic planning, and the forecasting of expected future results and synergies. Estimated future results and expected synergies are subject to revisions as we integrate each acquisition and attempt to leverage resources. Each acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting as defined under the applicable accounting standards at the date of each acquisition, including, Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16, Accounting for Business Combinations, and SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations. Accounting for these acquisitions has resulted in the capitalization of the cost in excess of fair value of the net assets acquired in each of these acquisitions as goodwill. We estimated the fair values of the assets acquired in each acquisition as of the date of acquisition and these estimates are subject to adjustment. These estimates are subject to final assessments of the fair value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, operating leases and deferred income taxes. We complete these assessments within one year of the date of acquisition. We are not aware of any information that would indicate that the final 27 purchase price allocations for acquisitions completed in 2006 would differ meaningfully from preliminary estimates. See Note 6 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In connection with each of our acquisitions, we have undertaken certain restructurings of the acquired businesses to realize efficiencies and potential cost savings. Our restructuring activities include the elimination of duplicate facilities, reductions in staffing levels, and other costs associated with exiting certain activities of the businesses we acquire. The estimated cost of these restructuring activities are included as costs of the acquisition and are recorded as goodwill consistent with the guidance of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 95 3, Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination. While we finalize our plans to restructure the businesses we acquire within one year of the date of acquisition, it may take more than one year to complete all activities related to the restructuring of an acquired business. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Credit Memos We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments and disputes regarding billing and service issues. When calculating the allowance, we consider our past loss experience, current and prior trends in our aged receivables and credit memo activity, current economic conditions, and specific circumstances of individual receivable balances. If the financial condition of our customers were to significantly change, resulting in a significant improvement or impairment of their ability to make payments, an adjustment of the allowance may be required. As of December 31, 2005 and 2006, our allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos balance totaled $14.5 million and $15.2 million, respectively. Impairment of Tangible and Intangible Assets Assets subject to amortization: In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, we review long lived assets and all amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operation to which the assets relate to their carrying amount. The operations are generally distinguished by the business segment and geographic region in which they operate. If the operation is determined to be unable to recover the carrying amount of its assets, then intangible assets are written down first, followed by the other long lived assets of the operation, to fair value. Fair value is based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, depending upon the nature of the assets. Goodwill Assets not subject to amortization: We apply the provisions of SFAS No. 142 to goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives which are not amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives are amortized over their useful lives. We have selected October 1 as our annual goodwill impairment review date. We performed our annual goodwill impairment review as of October 1, 2004, 2005 and 2006 and noted no impairment of goodwill. In making this assessment, we rely on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. As of December 31, 2006, no factors were identified that would alter this assessment. When changes occur in the composition of one or more reporting units, the goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units affected based on their relative fair values. Our reporting units at which level we performed our goodwill impairment analysis as of October 31, 2006 were as follows: North America excluding Fulfillment; Fulfillment; U.K.; Continental Europe; Worldwide Digital Business excluding Iron Mountain Intellectual Property Management, Inc. (IPM); IPM; South America; Mexico and Asia Pacific. Goodwill valuations have been calculated using an income 28 approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. This approach incorporates many assumptions including future growth rates, discount factors, expected capital expenditures and income tax cash flows. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in a goodwill impairment in future periods. Accounting for Internal Use Software We develop various software applications for internal use. We account for those costs in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Position (SOP) 98 1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. SOP 98 1 requires computer software costs associated with internal use software to be expensed as incurred until certain capitalization criteria are met. SOP 98 1 also defines which types of costs should be capitalized and which should be expensed. Payroll and related costs for employees who are directly associated with, and who devote time to, the development of internal use computer software projects, to the extent time is spent directly on the project, are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the software. Capitalization begins when the design stage of the application has been completed and it is probable that the project will be completed and used to perform the function intended. Depreciation begins when the software is placed in service. Computer software costs that are capitalized are evaluated for impairment in accordance with SFAS No.144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. It may be necessary for us to write off amounts associated with the development of internal use software if the project cannot be completed as intended. Our expansion into new technology based service offerings requires the development of internal use software that will be susceptible to rapid and significant changes in technology. We may be required to write off unamortized costs or shorten the estimated useful life if an internal use software program is replaced with an alternative tool prior to the end of the softwares estimated useful life. General uncertainties related to expansion into digital businesses, including the timing of introduction and market acceptance of our services, may adversely impact the recoverability of these assets. See Note 2(f) to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we wrote off $6.3 million of previously deferred costs, primarily internal labor costs, associated with internal use software development projects that were discontinued, and such costs are included as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we replaced internal use software programs, which resulted in the write off to loss on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of the remaining net book value of $1.1 million. We did not have any such write offs during 2004. Income Taxes We have recorded a valuation allowance, amounting to $27.3 million as of December 31, 2006, to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. If actual results differ unfavorably from certain of our estimates used, we may not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred income tax assets and additional valuation allowances may be required. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that our estimates reflected in the tax provisions and accruals will equal our actual results. These differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. We are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately $62 million of reserves related to uncertain tax positions. Although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the final 29 determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in favorable or unfavorable changes in our estimates. We have not provided deferred taxes on book basis differences related to certain foreign subsidiaries because such basis differences are not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future and we intend to reinvest indefinitely outside the U.S. These basis differences arose primarily through the undistributed book earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The basis differences could be reversed through a sale of the subsidiaries, the receipt of dividends from subsidiaries as well as certain other events or actions on our part, which would result in an increase in our provision for income taxes. Stock Based Compensation As of January 1, 2003, we adopted the measurement provisions of SFAS No. 123, as amended by SFAS No. 148. As a result we began using the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation in our financial statements beginning January 1, 2003 using the prospective method. The prospective method involves recognizing expense for the fair value for all awards granted or modified in the year of adoption and thereafter with no expense recognition for previous awards. We have applied the fair value recognition provisions to all stock based awards granted, modified or settled on or after January 1, 2003 and provided the required pro forma information for all awards previously granted, modified or settled before January 1, 2003 in our consolidated financial statements. In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment. SFAS No. 123R is a revision of SFAS No. 123 and supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. We adopted SFAS No. 123R effective January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective method, as permitted under SFAS No. 123R. We record stock based compensation expense for the cost of stock options, restricted stock and shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123R beginning January 1, 2006. Stock based compensation expense, included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $12.4 million ($9.2 million after tax or $0.05 per basic and diluted share). For the year ended December 31, 2006, the incremental stock based compensation expense due to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R caused income before provision for income taxes and minority interest to decrease by $0.9 million, and net income to decrease by $0.5 million, and had no impact on basic and diluted earnings per share. SFAS No. 123R also requires that the benefits associated with the tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow, reducing net operating cash flows and increasing net financing cash flows in future periods. The fair values of option, employee stock purchase and restricted stock grants are estimated on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model. Expected volatility and the expected term are the input factors to that model which require the most significant management judgment. Expected volatility is calculated utilizing daily historical volatility over a period that equates to the expected life of the option. The expected life (estimated period of time outstanding) is estimated using the historical exercise behavior of employees. Self Insured Liabilities We are self insured up to certain limits for costs associated with workers compensation claims, vehicle accidents, property and general business liabilities, and benefits paid under employee healthcare and long term disability programs. At December 31, 2005 and 2006 there were approximately $30.4 million and $28.2 million, respectively, of self insurance accruals reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. The measurement of these costs requires the consideration of historical cost experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim. We account for these costs primarily through actuarial 30 methods, which develop estimates of the undiscounted liability for claims incurred, including those claims incurred but not reported. These methods provide estimates of future ultimate claim costs based on claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. We believe the use of actuarial methods to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals. However, the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claims involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known. We believe our recorded obligations for these expenses are appropriate. Nevertheless, changes in healthcare costs, accident frequency and severity, and other factors can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN 48 also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position in accordance with FIN 48 is a two step process. The first step is a recognition process whereby the company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The second step is a measurement process whereby a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is calculated to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective January 1, 2007. The provisions of FIN 48 are to be applied to all tax positions upon initial adoption of this standard. Only tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized or continue to be recognized upon adoption of FIN 48. The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of FIN 48 should be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for that fiscal year. We are in the process of evaluating the effect of FIN 48 on our consolidated results of operations and financial position. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements, and is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 157 to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108 (SAB 108), Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements When Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements, which provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement. SAB 108 is effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006. We have completed our analysis related to the implementation of SAB 108 and have concluded it has no effect on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS No. 159). SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair 31 value. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are in the process of evaluating the effect of SFAS No. 159 on our consolidated results of operations and financial position.

Revenue Our consolidated storage revenues increased $145.6 million, or 12.3%, to $1,327.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 and $138.2 million, or 13.2%, to $1,181.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, in comparison to the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase is attributable to internal revenue growth (10% during 2006 and 9% during 2005) resulting from net increases in records and other media stored by existing customers, sales to new customers and the net result of pricing actions, acquisitions (2% during 2006 and 3% during 2005), and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations (0% during 2006 and 1% during 2005). Consolidated service and storage material sales revenues increased $126.6 million, or 14.1%, to $1,023.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 and $122.4 million, or 15.8%, to $896.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, in comparison to the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase is attributable to acquisitions (7% during 2006 and 7% during 2005), internal revenue growth (7% during 2006 and 7% during 2005) resulting from net increases in service and storage material sales to existing customers and sales to new customers, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations (0% during 2006 and 1% during 2005). 32 For the reasons stated above, our consolidated revenues increased $272.2 million, or 13.1%, to $2,350.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 and $260.6 million, or 14.3%, to $2,078.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, in comparison to the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2005, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that impacted our revenues were primarily due to the strengthening of the British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and Euro against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. For the year ended December 31, 2006, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that impacted our revenues were primarily due to the weakening of the British pound sterling and Euro, net of the strengthening of the Canadian dollar, against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. Internal revenue growth was 8%, 8% and 9% for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. We calculate internal revenue growth in local currency for our international operations. Internal Growth Eight Quarter Trend 2005 2006 First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Storage Revenue 8 % 9 % 9 % 10 % 10 % 11 % 11 % 10 % Service and Storage Material Sales Revenue 3 % 6 % 12 % 9 % 8 % 8 % 3 % 10 % Total Revenue 6 % 8 % 10 % 9 % 10 % 9 % 7 % 10 % Our internal revenue growth rate represents the weighted average year over year growth rate of our revenues after removing the effects of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the impact of the fire in our London, England facility. Over the past eight quarters, the internal growth rate of our storage revenues has increased from a range of 8% to 9% to a range of 10% to 11%. In our North American Physical Business, net carton volume growth remained stable and we benefited from an increasingly positive pricing environment in 2005 and 2006. Strong growth rates in our digital services business more than offset the impact of reduced growth rates in Europe in 2005 resulting from the inclusion of the slower growing Hays IMS business in our base revenues for internal growth calculation purposes. In 2006, our European business posted improved storage internal revenue growth rates. Net carton volume growth is a function of the rate new cartons are added by existing and new customers offset by the rate of carton destructions and other permanent removals. The internal growth rate for service and storage material sales revenue is inherently more volatile than the storage revenue internal growth rate due to the more discretionary nature of the services we offer such as large special projects or data products and carton sales, as well as the price of recycled paper. These revenues are often event driven and impacted to a greater extent by economic downturns as customers defer or cancel the purchase of these services as a way to reduce their short term costs. As a commodity, recycled paper prices are subject to the volatility of that market. The internal growth rate for service and storage material sales revenues reflects the following: (1) stronger data product sales in 2005; (2) a large data restoration project completed by our digital services business in the third quarter of 2005; (3) improved growth rates in our data protection and fulfillment businesses; (4) continued growth in our secure shredding operations; and (5) growth in North American storage related service revenues. These positive factors were partially offset by lower special project revenues related to the public sector business in the U.K. in 2005. 33 Cost of Sales Consolidated cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization) is comprised of the following expenses (in thousands): % of Consolidated Revenues Percent Change 2005 2006 Dollar Change Percent Change 2005 2006 (Favorable)/ Unfavorable Labor $ 447,600 $ 523,401 $ 75,801 16.9 % 21.5 % 22.3 % 0.8 % Facilities 275,987 321,268 45,281 16.4 % 13.3 % 13.7 % 0.4 % Transportation 97,997 111,086 13,089 13.4 % 4.7 % 4.7 % 0.0 % Product Cost of Sales 51,254 49,853 (1,401 ) (2.7 )% 2.5 % 2.1 % (0.4 )% Other 65,401 68,660 3,259 5.0 % 3.1 % 2.9 % (0.2 )% $ 938,239 $ 1,074,268 $ 136,029 14.5 % 45.1 % 45.7 % 0.6 % % of Consolidated Revenues Percent Change 2004 2005 Dollar Change Percent Change 2004 2005 (Favorable)/ Unfavorable Labor $ 419,345 $ 447,600 $ 28,255 6.7 % 23.1 % 21.5 % (1.6 )% Facilities 246,325 275,987 29,662 12.0 % 13.6 % 13.3 % (0.3 )% Transportation 81,976 97,997 16,021 19.5 % 4.5 % 4.7 % 0.2 % Product Cost of Sales 35,908 51,254 15,346 42.7 % 2.0 % 2.5 % 0.5 % Other 40,345 65,401 25,056 62.1 % 2.2 % 3.1 % 0.9 % $ 823,899 $ 938,239 $ 114,340 13.9 % 45.3 % 45.1 % (0.2 )% Labor For the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, labor expense as a percentage of consolidated revenue increased as a result of higher labor costs resulting from our Australia/New Zealand acquisition and our recent shredding acquisitions in Europe, which have a higher service revenue component and are therefore more labor intensive. Our digital business had higher costs of labor associated with internal information technology personnel and consultants dedicated to revenue producing projects. For the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, labor expense as a percentage of consolidated revenue decreased as a result of strong revenue growth, an increasing proportion of revenue from less labor intensive digital services and product sales. We also experienced improvement in our ratio of labor costs to revenues in our European operations as a result of completing the integration of Hays IMS in 2004. Facilities Facilities costs as a percentage of consolidated revenues increased to 13.7% for the year ended December 31, 2006 from 13.3% for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in facilities costs as a percentage of consolidated revenues was primarily a result of increases in utilities and maintenance costs, as well as, increased insurance deductibles and security costs associated with protecting our assets, as a response to the fires in Ottawa, Canada and London, England. Rent expense decreased slightly as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 as a result of a decrease in overall base rent per square foot in our North American operations when comparing 2005 to 2006. The largest component of our facilities cost is rent expense, which increased in dollar terms by $17.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Given current property insurance market conditions, especially in relation 34 to catastrophe exposures of earthquake, flood and wind, we expect our insurance costs associated with our real estate portfolio to rise in 2007 when compared to 2006. Facilities costs as a percentage of consolidated revenues decreased to 13.3% for the year ended December 31, 2005 from 13.6% for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease in facilities costs as a percentage of consolidated revenues was primarily a result of maintaining approximately the same overall base rent per square foot in our North American operations during 2004 and 2005 while consolidated revenues increased. The largest component of our facilities cost is rent expense, which increased $15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily as a result of properties under lease acquired through acquisitions in both Europe and North America. The expansion of our secure shredding business, which incurs lower facilities costs than our core physical businesses, also helped lower our facilities costs as a percentage of consolidated revenues. Transportation Our transportation expenses, which remained consistent as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, are influenced by several variables including total number of vehicles, owned versus leased vehicles, use of subcontracted couriers, fuel expenses and maintenance. Higher fuel costs, increased maintenance expenses resulting from the accelerated implementation of a fleet wide maintenance program in North America and vehicle leasing expenses were primarily responsible for the dollar increase in transportation expenses. Our transportation expenses, which increased 0.2% as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, are influenced by several variables including total number of vehicles, owned versus leased vehicles, use of subcontracted couriers, fuel expenses and maintenance. Higher fuel expenses during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 were primarily responsible for the increase in transportation expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues. Product and Other Cost of Sales Product and other cost of sales are highly correlated to complementary revenue streams. Product cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased due to a corresponding reduction in product sales in the comparable periods. Product and other cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 were higher than the year ended December 31, 2004 as a percentage of consolidated revenues due to increased sales of data products at lower margins in North America, increased royalty payments associated with our electronic vaulting revenues and increases in technology costs associated with these revenue producing activities. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses are comprised of the following expenses (in thousands): % of Consolidated Revenues Percent Change 2005 2006 Dollar Change Percent Change 2005 2006 (Favorable)/ Unfavorable General and Administrative $ 285,558 $ 331,021 $ 45,463 15.9 % 13.7 % 14.1 % 0.4 % Sales, Marketing & Account Management 180,558 214,007 33,449 18.5 % 8.7 % 9.1 % 0.4 % Information Technology 99,177 122,211 23,034 23.2 % 4.8 % 5.2 % 0.4 % Bad Debt Expense 4,402 2,835 (1,567 ) (35.6 )% 0.2 % 0.1 % (0.1 )% $ 569,695 $ 670,074 $ 100,379 17.6 % 27.4 % 28.5 % 1.1 % 35 % of Consolidated Revenues Percent Change 2004 2005 Dollar Change Percent Change 2004 2005 (Favorable)/ Unfavorable General and Administrative $ 259,209 $ 285,558 $ 26,349 10.2 % 14.3 % 13.7 % (0.6 )% Sales, Marketing & Account Management 150,419 180,558 30,139 20.0 % 8.3 % 8.7 % 0.4 % Information Technology 81,187 99,177 17,990 22.2 % 4.5 % 4.8 % 0.3 % Bad Debt Expense (4,569 ) 4,402 8,971 196.3 % (0.3 )% 0.2 % 0.5 % $ 486,246 $ 569,695 $ 83,449 17.2 % 26.8 % 27.4 % 0.6. % General and Administrative The increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 is mainly attributable to (a) increased compensation expense due to expansion through acquisitions, (b) costs associated with our North American reorganization which added a new level of field management, and (c) costs associated with a North American field operations meeting held in 2006 that was not held in 2005. The decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 is attributable to strong revenue growth and controls over overhead spending implemented in late 2004. These decreases were partially offset by increased incentive compensation expense and growth of our North American and European operations due to expansion and acquisitions. Sales, Marketing & Account Management The majority of our sales, marketing and account management costs are labor related and are primarily driven by the headcount in each of these departments. Increased headcount and related compensation and commissions are the most significant contributors to the increase in sales, marketing expenses and account management for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. Throughout the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and into 2006, we invested in the expansion and improvement of our sales, marketing and account management functions. During 2006 in North America, while our sales force headcount increased at a slower rate than revenue growth, the shift to higher end resources drove an increase in the level of spending due to higher costs per sales person and the additional support required. We have significantly increased the size of our digital sales force through our acquisition of LiveVault and the hiring of new sales employees, particularly in Europe. Additionally, costs associated with an enterprise wide sales meeting held in 2006 and not held in 2005 also contributed to this increase. Our larger North American sales force generated a $6.3 million increase in sales commissions and an increase of $13.6 million of compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Our North American sales force generated a $3.0 million increase in sales commissions and an increase of $14.8 million of compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased $3.3 million due to the introduction of several new marketing and promotional efforts to continue to develop awareness in the marketplace of our entire portfolio of services, especially our digital services. Information Technology Information technology expenses increased as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 due to increases in technology 36 development activities within our digital services business, including the acquisition of LiveVault and associated research and development activities and increased spending to support our growing digital archiving business. Additionally, during 2006, we wrote off $5.9 million of previously deferred costs, primarily internal labor costs, associated with internal use software development projects that were discontinued. Higher utilization of existing information technology resources to revenue producing projects, which are charged to costs of goods sold and decreased information technology spending in our European operations, partially offset this increase. Information technology expenses increased as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 due to increases in internal software development projects within our digital services business, the acquisitions of Connected and LiveVault and associated research and development activities, and increased information technology spending in our European operations. Higher utilization of existing information technology resources to revenue producing projects, which are charged to cost of goods sold, partially offset this increase. Bad Debt Expense Consolidated bad debt expense for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006 reflects what we believe to be more normal levels of bad debt expense compared to 2004. The decrease in consolidated bad debt expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 is primarily attributable to the success of our centralized collection efforts within the U.S. and Canada, which resulted in improved cash collections and an improved accounts receivable aging that allowed us to reduce our allowance for doubtful accounts. Depreciation, Amortization, and (Gain) and Loss on Disposal/Writedown of Property, Plant and Equipment, Net Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased $21.5 million to $208.4 million (8.9% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $187.0 million (9.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2005. Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased $23.3 million to $187.0 million (9.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $163.6 million (9.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2004. Depreciation expense increased $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 and increased $18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, primarily due to the additional depreciation expense related to recent capital expenditures and acquisitions, including storage systems, which include racking, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and software, and buildings. Amortization expense increased $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 and increased $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, primarily due to amortization of intangible assets, such as customer relationship intangible assets and intellectual property acquired through business combinations. We expect that amortization expense will continue to increase as we acquire new businesses and reflect the full year impact of our 2006 acquisitions. Consolidated gains on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, consisted primarily of a gain on the sale of a property in the U.K. of $10.5 million offset by disposals and writedowns. Consolidated gains on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, consisted primarily of a gain on the sale of a property in the U.K. of $4.5 million offset primarily by software asset writedowns of $1.1 million. Consolidated gains on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of 37 $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, consisted primarily of a $1.2 million gain on the sale of a property in Florida during the second quarter of 2004 offset by disposals and asset writedowns. Operating Income As a result of all the foregoing factors, consolidated operating income increased $20.4 million, or 5.3%, to $407.2 million (17.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $386.8 million (18.6% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2005. Consolidated operating income increased $42.3 million, or 12.3%, to $386.8 million (18.6% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $344.5 million (19.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2004. OIBDA As a result of all the foregoing factors, consolidated OIBDA increased $41.9 million, or 7.3%, to $615.6 million (26.2% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $573.7 million (27.6% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2005. Consolidated OIBDA increased $65.6 million, or 12.9%, to $573.7 million (27.6% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $508.1 million (28.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2004. Interest Expense, Net Consolidated interest expense, net increased $11.4 million to $195.0 million (8.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $183.6 million (8.8% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2005. The change is primarily due to increased borrowings to fund our 2005 and 2006 acquisitions, particularly LiveVault and Pickfords Records Management (Pickfords). Consolidated interest expense, net decreased $2.2 million to $183.6 million (8.8% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $185.7 million (10.2% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2004. The dollar decrease in interest expense, net was primarily due to the recording of interest expense totaling $21.5 million for the year ending December 31, 2004 compared to interest expense totaling $2.3 million for the year ending December 31, 2005 related to the net impact of mark to market adjustments and cash payments on all of our interest rate swap contracts. This was offset by increased borrowings, primarily an additional $150.0 million of term loans borrowed in November 2004 as permitted under our IMI Credit Agreement and the full year effect of the March 2004 IME Credit Agreement.

Foreign currency losses of $7.2 million based on period end exchange rates were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to the weakening of the British pound sterling, and Euro, net of the strengthening of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar as these currencies relate to our inter company balances with and between our Canadian, U.K. and European subsidiaries, borrowings denominated in foreign currencies under our revolving credit facility and British pounds sterling denominated debt held by our U.S. parent company. Foreign currency gains $8.9 million based on period end exchange rates were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2004, primarily due to the strengthening of the British pound sterling, Euro, and the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar as these currencies relate to our inter company balances with and between our Canadian, U.K., and European subsidiaries, U.S. dollar denominated debt held by our Canadian subsidiary, borrowings denominated in foreign currencies under our revolving credit facility, British pounds sterling denominated debt held by our U.S. parent company, British pounds sterling currency held in the U.S. and our British pound sterling denominated cross currency swap, which was terminated in March 2004. During 2006, we redeemed or purchased a portion of our outstanding 814% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011 and 858% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013 resulting in a charge of $2.8 million, which consists of tender premiums and transaction costs, deferred financing costs, as well as original issue discounts and premiums. During 2004, we redeemed the remaining outstanding principal amount of the 818% Senior Notes due 2008 of our Canadian subsidiary, resulting in a charge of $2.0 million, and we repaid a portion of our real estate term loans, which resulted in a charge of $0.4 million. The charges consisted primarily of the call and tender premiums associated with the extinguished debt and the write off of unamortized deferred financing cost and discounts. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005, and 2006 were 41.7%, 41.4% and 41.8%, respectively. The primary reconciling items between the statutory rate of 35% and our effective rate are state income taxes (net of federal benefit) and differences in the rates of tax at which our foreign earnings are subject. During 2006, we recorded a reduction in income tax expense as a result of a new Texas law changing the way state income tax is calculated in that state. As a result of this change, we have reversed a deferred tax liability of $1.7 million, net of federal tax benefit, related to our Texas state taxes. We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. Although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in changes in our estimates. 39 Minority Interest Minority interest in earnings of subsidiaries, net resulted in a charge to income of $3.0 million (0.2% of consolidated revenues), $1.7 million (0.1% of consolidated revenues) and $1.6 million (0.1% of consolidated revenues) for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005, and 2006, respectively. This represents our minority partners share of earnings in our majority owned international subsidiaries that are consolidated in our operating results. The decrease during 2005 is the result of our acquisition of various Latin American minority partner interests. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations (FIN 47), an interpretation of SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS No. 143). FIN 47 clarifies that conditional asset retirement obligations meet the definition of liabilities and should be recognized when incurred if their fair values can be reasonably estimated. Uncertainty surrounding the timing and method of settlement that may be conditional on events occurring in the future are factored into the measurement of the liability rather than the existence of the liability. SFAS No. 143 established accounting and reporting standards for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets legally required by law, regulatory rule or contractual agreement and the associated asset retirement costs. SFAS No. 143 requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset, which is then depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The liability is increased over time through income as a component of depreciation expense, such that the liability will equate to the future cost to retire the long lived asset at the expected retirement date. Upon settlement of the liability, an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement. Our obligations are primarily the result of requirements under our facility lease agreements which generally have return to original condition clauses which would require us to remove or restore items such as shred pits, vaults, demising walls and office build outs, among others. As of December 31, 2005, we have recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying FIN 47 as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle as prescribed in FIN 47, which resulted in a gross charge of $4.4 million ($2.8 million, net of tax). Net Income As a result of all the foregoing factors, for the year ended December 31, 2006, consolidated net income increased $17.8 million, or 16.0%, to $128.9 million (5.5% of consolidated revenues) from net income of $111.1 million (5.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2005. As a result of all the foregoing factors, for the year ended December 31, 2005, consolidated net income increased $16.9 million, or 18.0%, to $111.1 million (5.3% of consolidated revenues) from net income of $94.2 million (5.2% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2004. Segment Analysis (in thousands) The results of our various operating segments are discussed below. Beginning January 1, 2006, we changed our reportable segments as a result of certain management and organizational changes within our North American business. Therefore, the presentation of all historical segment reporting has been changed to conform to our new management reporting. Our reportable segments are now North American Physical Business, International Physical Business and Worldwide Digital Business. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our North American Physical Business, which consists of the United States and Canada, offers the storage of paper documents, as well as all other non electronic media such as microfilm and microfiche, master audio and videotapes, film, X rays and blueprints, including healthcare 40 information services, vital records services, service and courier operations, and the collection, handling and disposal of sensitive documents for corporate customers (Hard Copy); the storage and rotation of backup computer media as part of corporate disaster recovery plans, including service and courier operations (Data Protection); secure shredding services (Shredding); and the storage, assembly, and detailed reporting of customer marketing literature and delivery to sales offices, trade shows and prospective customers sites based on current and prospective customer orders, which we refer to as the Fulfillment business. Our International Physical Business segment offers information protection and storage services throughout Europe, South America, Mexico and Asia Pacific, including Hard Copy, Data Protection and Shredding. Our Worldwide Digital Business offers information protection and storage services for electronic records conveyed via telecommunication lines and the Internet, including online backup and recovery solutions for server data and personal computers, as well as email archiving and third party technology escrow services that protect intellectual property assets such as software source code.

During the year ended December 31, 2006, revenue in our North American Physical Business segment increased 9.2% primarily due to increasing storage internal growth rates resulting from stable net volume growth and an increasingly positive pricing environment, increasing service revenue growth rates particularly in data protection and fulfillment, growth of our secure shredding operations, and acquisitions. In addition, favorable currency fluctuations during the year ended December 31, 2006 in Canada increased revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, by $9.8 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue decreased in the year ended December 31, 2006 due mainly to (a) higher transportation costs, primarily fuel and rental costs associated with a larger fleet of leased vehicles, and the accelerated implementation of a fleet wide maintenance program in North America, (b) increased facility costs, primarily utilities, maintenance and insurance, (c) increased investment in sales, marketing and account management primarily related to a shift in hiring more experienced personnel at a higher cost, (d) costs associated with the North American reorganization, including a new level of field management, and (e) costs associated with our enterprise wide sales meeting and a field operations meeting, both held in 2006 but not in 2005. During the year ended December 31, 2005, revenue in our North American Physical Business segment increased 10.2% primarily due to increasing storage internal growth rates resulting from higher net volume growth and a more positive pricing environment, increasing service revenue growth rates, growth of our secure shredding operations, higher internal growth rates from product sales and acquisitions. In addition, 41 favorable currency fluctuations during the year ended December 31, 2005 in Canada increased revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, by $8.7 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue decreased in the year ended December 31, 2005 due to our (a) increased investment in sales, marketing and account management, including higher sales commissions and compensation due to increased headcount, (b) increased bad debt expense, (c) increased incentive compensation expense, (d) higher transportation costs, primarily fuel, and (e) product sales at lower margins, offset by strong revenue growth, reduced facility expenses and the effectiveness of recent labor and cost management initiatives, including controls over overhead spending implemented in late 2004. The expansion of our secure shredding business, which incurs lower facilities costs than our core physical business, also lowers our facilities costs as a percentage of revenues. Included in our North American Physical Business segment are certain costs related to staff functions, including finance, human resources and information technology, which benefit the enterprise as a whole. These costs are primarily related to the general management of these functions on a corporate level and the design and development of programs, policies and procedures that are then implemented in the individual segments, with each segment bearing its own cost of implementation. Management has decided to allocate these costs to the North American segment as further allocation is impracticable. International Physical Business Segment Revenue Increase in Revenues Percentage Increase in Revenues For Years Ended December 31, 2004 December 31, 2005 December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 December 31, 2006 $380,033 $435,106 $539,335 $55,073 $104,229 14.5% 24.0% Segment Contribution(1) Segment Contribution(1) as a Percentage of Segment Revenue For Years Ended December 31, 2004 December 31, 2005 December 31, 2006 December 31, 2004 December 31, 2005 December 31, 2006 $89,751 $113,417 $117,568 23.6% 26.1% 21.8% Items Excluded from the Calculation of Segment Contribution(1) Depreciation and Amortization December 31, 2004 December 31, 2005 December 31, 2006 $33,234 $43,285 $54,803 (1) See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for definition of Contribution and for the basis on which allocations are made and a reconciliation of Contribution to income before provision for income taxes and minority interest on a consolidated basis. Revenue in our International Physical Business segment increased 24.0% during the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to acquisitions, which contributed $92.0 million or 18.6%. This was partially offset by net unfavorable currency fluctuations in Europe and Latin America of $6.3 million or 1.5% during the year ended December 31, 2006. The balance of the increase in revenue represents internal growth. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue decreased primarily due to the acquisition of two shredding businesses in the U.K. that operate at lower margins, the acquisition of Pickfords, which is in the process of rationalizing its real estate portfolio, and costs associated with the facility fire in London, England. Revenue in our International Physical Business segment increased 14.5% during the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to acquisitions completed in Europe and in South America and strong internal growth in Latin America, offset by lower revenue in our U.K. public sector business. Favorable currency fluctuations during the year ended December 31, 2005 in Europe, Mexico and South America increased revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, by $13.8 million compared to the year ended December 31, 42 2004. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue increased primarily due to improvements in both cost of sales and overhead labor ratios as a result of completing the integration of Hays IMS in the second half of 2004 offset by increased compensation associated with additional sales, marketing, and account management personnel, several new marketing and promotional efforts, and increased bad debt expense. Worldwide Digital Business Segment Revenue Increase in Revenues Percentage Increase in Revenues For Years Ended December 31, 2004 December 31, 2005 December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 December 31, 2006 $49,579 $113,437 $139,998 $63,858 $26,561 128.8% 23.4% Segment Contribution(1) Segment Contribution(1) as a Percentage of Segment Revenue For Years Ended December 31, 2004 December 31, 2005 December 31, 2006 December 31, 2004 December 31, 2005 December 31, 2006 $(9,886) $12,461 $9,779 (19.9)% 11.0% 7.0% Items Excluded from the Calculation of Segment Contribution(1) Depreciation and Amortization December 31, 2004 December 31, 2005 December 31, 2006 $14,420 $25,144 $ 26,008 (1) See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for definition of Contribution and for the basis on which allocations are made and a reconciliation of Contribution to income before provision for income taxes and minority interest on a consolidated basis. During the year ended December 31, 2006, revenue in our Worldwide Digital Business segment increased 23.4% primarily due to internal growth of 16%, primarily attributable to growth in digital storage revenue and our online backup service offerings for both personal computer and server data. The internal growth rate of our digital business was offset by a large data restoration project in the third quarter of 2005, which was not repeated in 2006 but drove the increase in the digital storage growth rate beginning in the fourth quarter of 2005. The acquisition of LiveVault in December 2005 contributed approximately $12 million in revenue during the year ended December 31, 2006. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue decreased primarily due to the acquisition of LiveVault, increased investment in the European sales force, increases in information technology costs, including the write off of $5.9 million of previously deferred costs, primarily internal labor costs, associated with internal use software development projects that were discontinued, and the benefit of a large data restoration project in the third quarter of 2005. This decrease was offset by higher absorption of fixed costs as a result of increased revenues and a reduction in royalty payments. During the year ended December 31, 2005, revenue in our Worldwide Digital Business segment increased 128.8% primarily due to the acquisition of Connected in November 2004, which represents an increase of $33.7 million over the partial year of revenue recorded in 2004 and strong internal growth of 41%, including the impact of a large data restoration project completed in 2005. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue increased primarily due to strong revenue growth and improved overhead leverage, partially offset by increases in information technology costs, the acquisitions of Connected and LiveVault and associated research and development activities and the growth of our sales and account management force, including higher sales commissions. 43 Liquidity and Capital Resources The following is a summary of our cash balances and cash flows for the years ended 2004, 2005 and 2006 (in thousands). 2004 2005 2006 Cash flows provided by operating activities $ 305,364 $ 377,176 $ 374,282 Cash flows used in investing activities (626,523 ) (436,175 ) (466,714 ) Cash flows provided by financing activities 276,569 81,449 82,734 Cash and cash equivalents at the end of year 31,942 53,413 45,369 Net cash provided by operating activities was $377.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $374.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease resulted primarily from an increase in operating income and non cash items, such as depreciation offset by gain on foreign currency, and further offset by the net change in working capital. The net change in working capital is primarily associated with the timing of accounts payable payments. Due to the nature of our businesses, we make significant capital expenditures and additions to customer acquisition costs. Our capital expenditures are primarily related to growth and include investments in storage systems, information systems and discretionary investments in real estate. Cash paid for our capital expenditures and additions to customer acquisition costs during the year ended December 31, 2006 amounted to $382.0 million and $14.3 million, respectively. From time to time and in the normal course of business we sell certain fixed assets, primarily real estate. In the year ended December 31, 2006, we received $17.8 million of net proceeds from the sales of assets. For the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2006, capital expenditures, net and additions to customer acquisition costs were funded primarily with cash flows provided by operating activities. Excluding acquisitions, we expect our capital expenditures to be between $390 million and $420 million in the year ending December 31, 2007. Included in our estimated capital expenditures for 2007 is $50 million to $60 million of opportunity driven real estate purchases. In the year ended December 31, 2006, we paid net cash consideration of $81.2 million for acquisitions, primarily related to the acquisition of two shredding businesses in the U.K., the buyout of minority partners in France and Mexico and contingent payments associated with a shredding acquisition in the U.S. and another acquisition in Europe. Cash flows provided from operating activities, borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, the proceeds from the sale of senior subordinated notes, and cash equivalents on hand funded these acquisitions. Net cash provided by financing activities was $82.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we had gross borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and term loan facilities of $543.9 million, $282.0 million of net proceeds from the sale of Senior Subordinated Notes and $22.2 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plan. We used the proceeds from these financing transactions to repay debt and term loans ($655.0 million), repurchase $78.1 million of our 814% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011 and repurchase $33.0 million of our 858% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013, repay debt financing from minority stockholders, net ($1.8 million) and to fund acquisitions. 44 We are highly leveraged and expect to continue to be highly leveraged for the foreseeable future. Our consolidated debt as of December 31, 2006 was comprised of the following (in thousands): IMI Revolving Credit Facility(1) $ 170,472 IMI Term Loan Facility(1) 312,000 IME Revolving Credit Facility(2) 77,819 IME Term Loan Facility(2) 189,005 814% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011(3) 71,789 858% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013(3) 448,001 714% GBP Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014(3) 293,865 734% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2015(3) 438,594 658% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016(3) 315,553 834% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018(3) 200,000 8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018(3) 49,663 634% Euro Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018(3) 39,429 Real Estate Mortgages 4,081 Seller Notes 8,757 Other 49,788 Long term Debt 2,668,816 Less Current Portion (63,105 ) Long term Debt, Net of Current Portion $ 2,605,711 (1) All intercompany notes and the capital stock of most of our U.S. subsidiaries are pledged to secure these debt instruments. (2) Most of IMEs non dormant subsidiaries have either guaranteed this indebtedness or their shares of capital stock and intercompany indebtedness have been pledged to secure this indebtedness. Iron Mountain has not guaranteed or otherwise provided security for this indebtedness nor have any of Iron Mountains U.S., Canadian, Asia Pacific, Mexican or South American subsidiaries. (3) These debt instruments are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior subordinated basis, by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries (the Guarantors). These guarantees are joint and several obligations of the Guarantors. The remainder of our subsidiaries do not guarantee these debt instruments. Our indentures use OIBDA based calculations as primary measures of financial performance, including leverage ratios. Our key bond leverage ratio, as calculated per our bond indentures, was 5.0 as of December 31, 2005 and 4.6 as of December 31, 2006. Noncompliance with this leverage ratio would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity. Our target for this ratio is generally in the range of 4.5 to 5.5 while the maximum ratio allowable under the bond indentures is 6.5. Our ability to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, working capital levels and capital structure, which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors which may be beyond our control. There can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future financings will be available on acceptable terms or in amounts sufficient to enable us to service or refinance our indebtedness, or to make necessary capital expenditures. 45 In March 2004, IME and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement (the IME Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of European lenders. The IME Credit Agreement provides for maximum borrowing availability in the principal amount of 200 million British pounds sterling, including a 100 million British pounds sterling revolving credit facility (the IME revolving credit facility), which includes the ability to borrow in certain other foreign currencies and a 100 million British pounds sterling term loan (the IME term loan facility). The IME revolving credit facility matures on March 5, 2009. The IME term loan facility is payable in three installments; two installments of 20 million British pounds sterling on March 5, 2007 and 2008, respectively, and the final payment of the remaining balance on March 5, 2009. The interest rate on borrowings under the IME Credit Agreement varies depending on IMEs choice of currency options and interest rate period, plus an applicable margin. The IME Credit Agreement includes various financial covenants applicable to the results of IME, which may restrict IMEs ability to incur indebtedness under the IME Credit Agreement and from third parties, as well as limit IMEs ability to pay dividends to us. Most of IMEs non dormant subsidiaries have either guaranteed the obligations or have their shares pledged to secure IMEs obligations under the IME Credit Agreement. We have not guaranteed or otherwise provided security for the IME Credit Agreement nor have any of our U.S., Canadian, Asia Pacific, Mexican or South American subsidiaries. Our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2006 includes 77 million British pounds sterling and 94.7 million Euro of borrowings (totaling $266.8 million) under the IME Credit Agreement; we also had various outstanding letters of credit totaling 1.7 million British pounds sterling ($3.2 million). The remaining availability, based on IMEs current leverage ratio which is calculated based on current earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and current external debt, under the IME revolving credit facility on October 31, 2006, was approximately 59.0 million British pounds sterling ($112.1 million). The interest rate in effect under the IME revolving credit facility ranged from 4.4% to 6.2% as of October 31, 2006. On April 2, 2004 and subsequently on July 8, 2004, we entered into a new amended and restated revolving credit facility and term loan facility (the IMI Credit Agreement) to replace our prior credit agreement and to reflect more favorable pricing of our term loans. The IMI Credit Agreement had an aggregate principal amount of $550 million and was comprised of a $350 million revolving credit facility (the IMI revolving credit facility), which included the ability to borrow in certain foreign currencies, and a $200 million term loan facility (the IMI term loan facility). The IMI revolving credit facility matures on April 2, 2009. With respect to the IMI term loan facility, quarterly loan payments of $0.5 million began in the third quarter of 2004 and will continue through maturity on April 2, 2011, at which time the remaining outstanding principal balance of the IMI term loan facility is due. In November 2004, we entered into an additional $150 million of term loans as permitted under our IMI Credit Agreement. The new term loans will mature at the same time as our current IMI term loan facility with quarterly loan payments of $0.4 million that began in the first quarter of 2005 and are priced at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.75%. On October 31, 2005, we entered into the second amendment to the IMI Credit Agreement, increasing availability under the revolving credit facility from $350 million to $400 million. As a result, the IMI Credit Agreement had an aggregate maximum principal amount of $750 million as of December 31, 2006. The interest rate on borrowings under the IMI Credit Agreement varies depending on our choice of interest rate and currency options, plus an applicable margin. All intercompany notes and the capital stock of most of our U.S. subsidiaries are pledged to secure the IMI Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2006, we had $170.5 million of borrowings under our IMI revolving credit facility, of which $4 million was denominated in U.S. dollars and the remaining balance was denominated in Canadian dollars (CAD) (CAD 194 million); we also had various outstanding letters of credit totaling $27.0 million. The remaining availability, based on Iron Mountains current leverage ratio which is calculated based on current EBITDA and current external debt, under the IMI revolving credit facility on December 31, 2006, was $113.8 million. The interest rate in effect under the IMI revolving credit facility and IMI term loan facility ranged from 6.0% to 9.0% and 7.0% to 7.2%, respectively, as of December 31, 2006. 46 In July 2006, we completed an underwritten public offering of $200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 834% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018, which were issued at par. Our net proceeds of $196.6 million, after paying the underwriters discounts, commissions and transaction fees, were used to (a) fund our offer to purchase and consent solicitation of $78.1 million in aggregate principle amount of our outstanding 814% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011, (b) fund our purchase in the open market of $33.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 858% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013 and (c) repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility. As a result, we recorded a charge to other expense (income), net of $2.8 million in the third quarter of 2006 related to the early extinguishment of the 814% and 858% Senior Subordinated Notes, which consists of tender premiums and transaction costs, deferred financing costs, as well as, original issue discounts and premiums related to the 814% and 858% Senior Subordinated Notes. In July 2006, we experienced a significant fire in a records and information management facility in London, England that resulted in the complete destruction of the leased facility. London fire authorities recently issued a report in which it was concluded that the fire resulted from a deliberate act of arson; the report also stated that the actions of a guard employed by a third party security service contractor resulted in the disabling of the automatic sprinkler system in the building. We believe we carry adequate property and liability insurance and are in the process of assessing the cause of, and other circumstances involved with, the fire. We do not expect that this event will have a material impact to our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Revenues from this facility represent less than 1% of our consolidated enterprise revenues. As of December 31, 2006, we have approximately $9.6 million recorded as an insurance receivable which is included in prepaid expenses and other in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet which primarily represents the net book value of the property, plant and equipment associated with this facility at the time of the incident, net of $1.8 million of property insurance proceeds received through IMEs October 31, 2006 fiscal year end. Subsequent to IMEs October 31, 2006 fiscal year end, IME received payment from our insurance carrier of approximately 8.6 million British pounds sterling ($16.9 million). We expect to utilize cash received from our insurance carriers to fund capital expenditures and for general working capital needs. Such amount represents a portion of our business personal property, business interruption, and expense claims with our insurance carrier. We will record approximately $8.8 million to other (income) expense, net in the first quarter of 2007 related to recoveries associated with our business interruption portion of our insurance claim to date. We expect to settle the remaining property portion of our insurance claim with our insurance carriers within the next twelve months and have, therefore, classified the remaining insurance receivable as a current asset. We expect to receive recoveries related to our property claim with our insurance carriers that will exceed the carrying value of such assets. We, therefore, expect to record gains on the disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net in our statement of operations in future periods when the cash received to date exceeds the remaining carrying value of the related property, plant and equipment, net. Recoveries from the insurance carriers related to business personal property claims are reflected in our statement of cash flows under proceeds from sales of property and equipment and other, net included in investing activities section when received. Recoveries from the insurance carriers related to business interruption claims are reflected in our statement of cash flows as a component of net income included in the operating activities section when received. In October 2006, we issued, in a private placement, $50 million in aggregate principal amount of our 8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018, which were issued at a price of 99.3% of par; and 30 million Euro in aggregate principal amount of our 634% Euro Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018, which were issued at a price of 99.5% of par. Our net proceeds of $85.5 million, after sales commission, were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under the IMI term loan and IME revolving credit facilities. The IME Credit Agreement, IMI Credit Agreement, our indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants, including covenants that 47 restrict our ability to complete acquisitions, pay cash dividends, incur indebtedness, make investments, sell assets and take certain other corporate actions. The covenants do not contain a rating trigger. Therefore, a change in our debt rating would not trigger a default under the IME Credit Agreement, IMI Credit Agreement and our indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness. We were in compliance with all debt covenants in material agreements as of December 31, 2006. In January 2007, we completed an offering of 225.0 million Euro in aggregate principal amount of our 634% Euro Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018, which were issued at a price of 98.99% of par and priced to yield 6.875%. Our net proceeds of 219.2 million Euro ($283.8 million), after paying the underwriters discounts and commissions and estimated expenses (excluding accrued interest payable by purchasers of the notes from October 17, 2006). These net proceeds were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under the IMI term loan and revolving credit facilities. We recorded a charge to other (income) expense, net of $0.5 million in the first quarter of 2007 related to the early retirement of the IMI term loans, representing the write off of a portion of our deferred financing costs. In addition, in January 2007, we entered into forward contracts to exchange U.S. dollars for 96 million Euros and 194 million CAD for 127.5 million Euros to hedge our intercompany exposures with Canada and our subsidiaries whose functional currency is the Euro. These forward contracts settle on a monthly basis, at which time we enter into new forward contracts for the same underlying amounts, to continue to hedge movements in CAD and Euros against the U.S. dollar. At the time of settlement, we either pay or receive the net settlement amount from the forward contract. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 Years Capital Lease Obligations $ 41,384 $ 8,829 $ 6,622 $ 2,157 $ 23,776 Long Term Debt Obligations (excluding Capital Lease Obligations) 2,625,023 54,276 412,232 374,350 1,784,165 Interest Payments(1) 1,567,691 212,794 401,893 342,429 610,575 Operating Lease Obligations 2,871,269 176,842 322,327 302,457 2,069,643 Purchase and Asset Retirement Obligations(2) 62,881 26,555 22,407 6,620 7,299 Total $ 7,168,248 $ 479,296 $ 1,165,481 $ 1,028,013 $ 4,495,458 (1) Amounts include variable rate interest payments, which are calculated utilizing the applicable interest rates as of December 31, 2006; see Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (2) In addition, in connection with some of our acquisitions, we have potential earn out obligations that may be payable in the event businesses we acquired meet certain operational objectives. These payments are based on the future results of these operations, and our estimate of the maximum contingent earn out payments we may be required to make under all such agreements as of December 31, 2006 is approximately $6.6 million. We expect to meet our cash flow requirements for the next twelve months from cash generated from operations, existing cash, cash equivalents, borrowings under the IMI and IME revolving credit facilities and other financings, which may include secured credit facilities, securitizations and mortgage or capital lease financings. We expect to meet our long term cash flow requirements using the same means described 48 above, as well as the potential issuance of debt or equity securities as we deem appropriate. See Notes 4, 7 and 10 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Regulation S K Item 303(a)(4)(ii). Net Operating Loss Carryforwards We have federal net operating loss carryforwards which begin to expire in 2018 through 2021 of $172.7 million at December 31, 2006 to reduce future federal taxable income, if any. We also have an asset for state net operating loss of $18.2 million (net of federal tax benefit), which begins to expire in 2007 through 2024, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 98%. As a result of these loss carryforwards, we do not expect to pay any significant U.S. federal and state income taxes in 2007. Inflation Certain of our expenses, such as wages and benefits, insurance, occupancy costs and equipment repair and replacement, are subject to normal inflationary pressures. Although to date we have been able to offset inflationary cost increases through increased operating efficiencies and the negotiation of favorable long term real estate leases, we can give no assurance that we will be able to offset any future inflationary cost increases through similar efficiencies, leases or increased storage or service charges. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Interest Rate Risk Given the recurring nature of our revenues and the long term nature of our asset base, we have the ability and the preference to use long term, fixed interest rate debt to finance our business, thereby helping to preserve our long term returns on invested capital. We target a range 80% to 85% of our debt portfolio to be fixed with respect to interest rates. Occasionally, we will use floating to fixed interest rate swaps as a tool to maintain our targeted level of fixed rate debt. As part of this strategy, in May 2001 and June 2006 we and IME entered into a total of two derivative financial contracts, which are variable for fixed interest rate swaps consisting of (a) one contract based on interest payments previously payable on our real estate term loans of an aggregate principal amount of $97.0 million that have been subsequently repaid, and (b) one contract for interest payments payable on IMEs term loan facility of an aggregate principal amount of 75.0 million British pounds sterling. See Note 3 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. After consideration of the swap contracts mentioned above, as of December 31, 2006, we had $517.9 million of variable rate debt outstanding with a weighted average variable interest rate of 6.4%, and $2,150.9 million of fixed rate debt outstanding. As of December 31, 2006, 80.6% of our total debt outstanding was fixed. If the weighted average variable interest rate on our variable rate debt had increased by 1%, our net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 would have been reduced by $2.9 million. See Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K for a discussion of our long term indebtedness, including the fair values of such indebtedness as of December 31, 2006. Currency Risk Our investments in IME, Iron Mountain Canada Corporation (IM Canada), Iron Mountain Mexico, SA de RL de CV, IMSA and other international investments may be subject to risks and uncertainties related to fluctuations in currency valuation. Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. However, our international revenues and expenses are generated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate, 49 primarily the Euro, Canadian dollar and British pound sterling. The currencies of many Latin American countries, particularly the Argentine peso, have experienced substantial volatility and depreciation. Declines in the value of the local currencies in which we are paid relative to the U.S. dollar will cause revenues in U.S. dollar terms to decrease and dollar denominated liabilities to increase in local currency. The impact on our earnings is mitigated somewhat by the fact that most operating and other expenses are also incurred and paid in the local currency. We also have several intercompany obligations between our foreign subsidiaries and Iron Mountain and our U.S. based subsidiaries and our foreign subsidiaries and IME. These intercompany obligations are primarily denominated in the local currency of the foreign subsidiary. We have adopted and implemented a number of strategies to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in currency valuations. One strategy is to finance our largest international subsidiaries with local debt that is denominated in local currencies, thereby providing a natural hedge. In determining the amount of any such financing, we take into account local tax strategies among other factors. Another strategy we utilize is to borrow in foreign currencies at the U.S. parent level to hedge our intercompany financing activities. Finally, on occasion, we enter into currency swaps to temporarily or permanently hedge an overseas investment, such as a major acquisition to lock in certain transaction economics. We have implemented these strategies for our three foreign investments in the U.K., Canada and Asia Pacific. Specifically, through IME borrowing under the IME Credit Agreement and our 150 million British pounds sterling denominated 714% Senior Subordinated Notes, we effectively hedge most of our outstanding intercompany loan with IME. IM Canada has financed their capital needs through direct borrowings in Canadian dollars under the IMI revolving credit facility. This creates a tax efficient natural currency hedge. To fund the acquisition of Pickfords in Australia and New Zealand, Iron Mountain borrowed Australian and New Zealand dollars under its multi currency revolving credit facility. These borrowings provided a tax efficient natural hedge against the intercompany loans created at the time of the acquisition. Subsequently, we repaid such borrowings under our multi currency revolving credit facility and contemporaneously in September 2006, we entered into forward contracts to exchange U.S. dollars for 55 million in Australian dollars (AUD) and 20.2 million in New Zealand dollars (NZD) to hedge our intercompany exposure in these countries. In addition, in January, 2007 we entered into forward contracts to exchange U.S. dollars for 96 million Euros and 194 million CAD for 127.5 million Euros to hedge our intercompany exposures with Canada and our subsidiaries whose functional currency is the Euro. These forward contracts settle on a monthly basis, at which time we enter into new forward contracts for the same underlying amounts, to continue to hedge movements in AUD, NZD, CAD and Euros against the U.S. dollar. At the time of settlement, we either pay or receive the net settlement amount from the forward contract. As of December 31, 2006, except as noted above, our currency exposures to intercompany balances are unhedged. The impact of devaluation or depreciating currency on an entity depends on the residual effect on the local economy and the ability of an entity to raise prices and or reduce expenses. Due to our constantly changing currency exposure and the potential substantial volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange fluctuations on our business. The effect of a change in foreign exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the Accumulated Other Comprehensive Items, net component of stockholders equity. A 10% depreciation in year end 2006 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction in our stockholders equity of approximately $41.1 million. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Item 6. Selected Financial Data and the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto and the other financial and operating information included elsewhere in this filing. This discussion contains forward looking statements, as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and in other federal securities laws. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements on page ii of this filing and Item 1A. Risk Factors beginning on page 14 of this filing. Overview Our revenues consist of storage revenues as well as service and storage material sales revenues. Storage revenues, both physical and digital, which are considered a key performance indicator for the information protection and storage services industry, consist of largely recurring periodic charges related to the storage of materials or data (generally on a per unit or per cubic foot of records basis), which are typically retained by customers for many years, and have accounted for over 56% of total consolidated revenues in each of the last five years. Our quarterly revenues from these fixed periodic storage fees have grown for 72 consecutive quarters. Service and storage material sales revenues are comprised of charges for related service activities and courier operations and the sale of software licenses and storage materials. Included in service and storage materials sales are related core service revenues arising from: (1) the handling of records including the addition of new records, temporary removal of records from storage, refiling of removed records, destruction of records, and permanent withdrawals from storage; (2) courier operations, consisting primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request; (3) secure shredding of sensitive documents; and (4) other recurring services including maintenance and support contracts. Our complementary services revenues arise from special project work, including data restoration, providing fulfillment services, consulting services and product sales, including software licenses, specially designed storage containers, magnetic media (including computer tapes) and related supplies. Our consolidated revenues are subject to variations caused by the net effect of foreign currency 24 translation on revenue derived from outside the U.S. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, we derived approximately 27%, 28% and 30%, respectively, of our total revenues from outside the U.S. We recognize revenue when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Storage and service revenues are recognized in the month the respective storage or service is provided and customers are generally billed on a monthly basis on contractually agreed upon terms. Amounts related to future storage or prepaid service contracts, including maintenance and support contracts, for customers where storage fees or services are billed in advance are accounted for as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the applicable storage or service period or when the service is performed. Storage material sales are recognized when shipped to the customer and include software license sales (less than 1% of consolidated revenues in 2006). Sales of software licenses to distributors are recognized at the time a distributor reports that the software has been licensed to an end user and all revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. Cost of sales (excluding depreciation) consists primarily of wages and benefits for field personnel, facility occupancy costs (including rent and utilities), transportation expenses (including vehicle leases and fuel), other product cost of sales and other equipment costs and supplies. Of these, wages and benefits and facility occupancy costs are the most significant. Trends in total wages and benefits dollars and as a percentage of total consolidated revenue are influenced by changes in headcount and compensation levels, achievement of incentive compensation targets, workforce productivity and variability in costs associated with medical insurance and workers compensation. Trends in facility occupancy costs are similarly impacted by the total number of facilities we occupy, the mix of properties we own versus properties we occupy under operating leases, fluctuations in per square foot occupancy costs, and the levels of utilization of these properties. The expansion of our European, secure shredding and digital services businesses has impacted the major cost of sales components. Our European and secure shredding operations are more labor intensive than our core physical businesses and therefore increase our labor costs as a percent of consolidated revenues. This trend is partially offset by our digital services businesses, which require significantly less direct labor. Our secure shredding operations incur less facility costs and higher transportation costs as a percent of revenues compared to our core physical businesses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits for management, administrative, information technology, sales, account management and marketing personnel, as well as expenses related to communications and data processing, travel, professional fees, bad debts, training, office equipment and supplies. Trends in total wages and benefits dollars and as a percentage of total consolidated revenue are influenced by changes in headcount and compensation levels, achievement of incentive compensation targets, workforce productivity and variability in costs associated with medical insurance. The overhead structure of our expanding European operations, as compared to our North American operations, is more labor intensive and has not achieved the same level of overhead leverage, which may result in an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of consolidated revenue, as our European operations become a more meaningful percentage of our consolidated results. Similarly, our digital services business requires a higher level of overhead, particularly in the area of information technology, than our core physical businesses. 25 Our adoption of the measurement provisions of SFAS No. 123 as amended by SFAS No. 148 has resulted in increasing amounts of selling, general and administrative expenses. We began using the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation in our financial statements beginning January 1, 2003 using the prospective method. The prospective method involves recognizing expense for the fair value for all awards granted or modified in the year of adoption and thereafter with no expense recognition for previous awards. We adopted SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment effective January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective method, as permitted under SFAS No. 123R. We record stock based compensation expense for the cost of stock options, restricted stock and shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123R beginning January 1, 2006. We recorded approximately $0.9 million of additional stock compensation expense in 2006 associated with unvested stock option grants issued prior to January 1, 2003 associated with adopting SFAS No. 123R. Our depreciation and amortization charges result primarily from the capital intensive nature of our business. The principal components of depreciation relate to storage systems, which include racking, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and software, and buildings. Amortization relates primarily to customer relationships and acquisition costs and core technology and is impacted by the nature and timing of acquisitions. Our consolidated revenues and expenses are subject to variations caused by the net effect of foreign currency translation on revenues and expenses incurred by our entities outside the U.S. During 2006, we have seen increases in both revenues and expenses as a result of the strengthening of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar, and decreases in both revenues and expenses as a result of the weakening of the British pound sterling and the Euro, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. It is difficult to predict how much foreign currency exchange rates will fluctuate in the future and how those fluctuations will impact individual balances reported in our consolidated statement of operations. Given the relative increase in our international operations, these fluctuations may become material on individual balances. However, because both the revenues and expenses are denominated in the local currency of the country in which they are derived or incurred, the impact of currency fluctuations on our operating income, operating margin and net income is mitigated. Non GAAP Measures Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization, or OIBDA OIBDA is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization expenses. OIBDA Margin is calculated by dividing OIBDA by total revenues. We use these measures to evaluate the operating performance of our consolidated business. As such, we believe these measures provide relevant and useful information to our current and potential investors. We use OIBDA for planning purposes and multiples of current or projected OIBDA based calculations in conjunction with our discounted cash flow models to determine our overall enterprise valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets. We believe OIBDA and OIBDA Margin are useful measures to evaluate our ability to grow our revenues faster than our operating expenses and they are an integral part of the internal reporting system we use to assess and evaluate the operating performance of our business. OIBDA does not include certain items, specifically (1) minority interest in earnings (losses) of subsidiaries, net; (2) other (income) expense, net; (3) income from discontinued operations and loss on sale of discontinued operations; and (4) cumulative effect of change in accounting principle that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results. OIBDA also does not include interest expense, net and the provision for income taxes. These expenses are associated with our capitalization and tax structures, which we do not consider when evaluating the operating profitability of our core operations. Finally, OIBDA does not include depreciation and amortization expenses, in order to eliminate the impact of capital investments, which we evaluate by comparing capital expenditures to incremental revenue generated and as a percentage of total revenues. OIBDA and OIBDA Margin should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial 26 performance reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the Unites States of America, or GAAP, such as operating or net income or cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP). Reconciliation of OIBDA to Operating Income and Net Income (In Thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2004 2005 2006 OIBDA $ 508,125 $ 573,706 $ 615,560 Less: Depreciation and Amortization 163,629 186,922 208,373 Operating Income 344,496 386,784 407,187 Less: Interest Expense, Net 185,749 183,584 194,958 Other (Income) Expense, Net (7,988 ) 6,182 (11,989 ) Provision for Income Taxes 69,574 81,484 93,795 Minority Interests in Earnings of Subsidiaries 2,970 1,684 1,560 Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle (net of tax benefit) 2,751 Net Income $ 94,191 $ 111,099 $ 128,863 Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and for the period then ended. On an on going basis, we evaluate the estimates used, including those related to accounting for acquisitions, allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos, impairment of tangible and intangible assets, income taxes, stock based compensation and self insured liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience, actuarial estimates, current conditions and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Our critical accounting policies include the following, which are listed in no particular order: Accounting for Acquisitions Part of our growth strategy has included the acquisition of numerous businesses. The purchase price of these acquisitions has been determined after due diligence of the acquired business, market research, strategic planning, and the forecasting of expected future results and synergies. Estimated future results and expected synergies are subject to revisions as we integrate each acquisition and attempt to leverage resources. Each acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting as defined under the applicable accounting standards at the date of each acquisition, including, Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16, Accounting for Business Combinations, and SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations. Accounting for these acquisitions has resulted in the capitalization of the cost in excess of fair value of the net assets acquired in each of these acquisitions as goodwill. We estimated the fair values of the assets acquired in each acquisition as of the date of acquisition and these estimates are subject to adjustment. These estimates are subject to final assessments of the fair value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, operating leases and deferred income taxes. We complete these assessments within one year of the date of acquisition. We are not aware of any information that would indicate that the final 27 purchase price allocations for acquisitions completed in 2006 would differ meaningfully from preliminary estimates. See Note 6 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In connection with each of our acquisitions, we have undertaken certain restructurings of the acquired businesses to realize efficiencies and potential cost savings. Our restructuring activities include the elimination of duplicate facilities, reductions in staffing levels, and other costs associated with exiting certain activities of the businesses we acquire. The estimated cost of these restructuring activities are included as costs of the acquisition and are recorded as goodwill consistent with the guidance of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 95 3, Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination. While we finalize our plans to restructure the businesses we acquire within one year of the date of acquisition, it may take more than one year to complete all activities related to the restructuring of an acquired business. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Credit Memos We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments and disputes regarding billing and service issues. When calculating the allowance, we consider our past loss experience, current and prior trends in our aged receivables and credit memo activity, current economic conditions, and specific circumstances of individual receivable balances. If the financial condition of our customers were to significantly change, resulting in a significant improvement or impairment of their ability to make payments, an adjustment of the allowance may be required. As of December 31, 2005 and 2006, our allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos balance totaled $14.5 million and $15.2 million, respectively. Impairment of Tangible and Intangible Assets Assets subject to amortization: In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, we review long lived assets and all amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operation to which the assets relate to their carrying amount. The operations are generally distinguished by the business segment and geographic region in which they operate. If the operation is determined to be unable to recover the carrying amount of its assets, then intangible assets are written down first, followed by the other long lived assets of the operation, to fair value. Fair value is based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, depending upon the nature of the assets. Goodwill Assets not subject to amortization: We apply the provisions of SFAS No. 142 to goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives which are not amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives are amortized over their useful lives. We have selected October 1 as our annual goodwill impairment review date. We performed our annual goodwill impairment review as of October 1, 2004, 2005 and 2006 and noted no impairment of goodwill. In making this assessment, we rely on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. As of December 31, 2006, no factors were identified that would alter this assessment. When changes occur in the composition of one or more reporting units, the goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units affected based on their relative fair values. Our reporting units at which level we performed our goodwill impairment analysis as of October 31, 2006 were as follows: North America excluding Fulfillment; Fulfillment; U.K.; Continental Europe; Worldwide Digital Business excluding Iron Mountain Intellectual Property Management, Inc. (IPM); IPM; South America; Mexico and Asia Pacific. Goodwill valuations have been calculated using an income 28 approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. This approach incorporates many assumptions including future growth rates, discount factors, expected capital expenditures and income tax cash flows. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in a goodwill impairment in future periods. Accounting for Internal Use Software We develop various software applications for internal use. We account for those costs in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Position (SOP) 98 1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. SOP 98 1 requires computer software costs associated with internal use software to be expensed as incurred until certain capitalization criteria are met. SOP 98 1 also defines which types of costs should be capitalized and which should be expensed. Payroll and related costs for employees who are directly associated with, and who devote time to, the development of internal use computer software projects, to the extent time is spent directly on the project, are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the software. Capitalization begins when the design stage of the application has been completed and it is probable that the project will be completed and used to perform the function intended. Depreciation begins when the software is placed in service. Computer software costs that are capitalized are evaluated for impairment in accordance with SFAS No.144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. It may be necessary for us to write off amounts associated with the development of internal use software if the project cannot be completed as intended. Our expansion into new technology based service offerings requires the development of internal use software that will be susceptible to rapid and significant changes in technology. We may be required to write off unamortized costs or shorten the estimated useful life if an internal use software program is replaced with an alternative tool prior to the end of the softwares estimated useful life. General uncertainties related to expansion into digital businesses, including the timing of introduction and market acceptance of our services, may adversely impact the recoverability of these assets. See Note 2(f) to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we wrote off $6.3 million of previously deferred costs, primarily internal labor costs, associated with internal use software development projects that were discontinued, and such costs are included as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we replaced internal use software programs, which resulted in the write off to loss on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of the remaining net book value of $1.1 million. We did not have any such write offs during 2004. Income Taxes We have recorded a valuation allowance, amounting to $27.3 million as of December 31, 2006, to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. If actual results differ unfavorably from certain of our estimates used, we may not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred income tax assets and additional valuation allowances may be required. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that our estimates reflected in the tax provisions and accruals will equal our actual results. These differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. We are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately $62 million of reserves related to uncertain tax positions. Although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the final 29 determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in favorable or unfavorable changes in our estimates. We have not provided deferred taxes on book basis differences related to certain foreign subsidiaries because such basis differences are not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future and we intend to reinvest indefinitely outside the U.S. These basis differences arose primarily through the undistributed book earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The basis differences could be reversed through a sale of the subsidiaries, the receipt of dividends from subsidiaries as well as certain other events or actions on our part, which would result in an increase in our provision for income taxes. Stock Based Compensation As of January 1, 2003, we adopted the measurement provisions of SFAS No. 123, as amended by SFAS No. 148. As a result we began using the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation in our financial statements beginning January 1, 2003 using the prospective method. The prospective method involves recognizing expense for the fair value for all awards granted or modified in the year of adoption and thereafter with no expense recognition for previous awards. We have applied the fair value recognition provisions to all stock based awards granted, modified or settled on or after January 1, 2003 and provided the required pro forma information for all awards previously granted, modified or settled before January 1, 2003 in our consolidated financial statements. In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment. SFAS No. 123R is a revision of SFAS No. 123 and supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. We adopted SFAS No. 123R effective January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective method, as permitted under SFAS No. 123R. We record stock based compensation expense for the cost of stock options, restricted stock and shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123R beginning January 1, 2006. Stock based compensation expense, included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $12.4 million ($9.2 million after tax or $0.05 per basic and diluted share). For the year ended December 31, 2006, the incremental stock based compensation expense due to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R caused income before provision for income taxes and minority interest to decrease by $0.9 million, and net income to decrease by $0.5 million, and had no impact on basic and diluted earnings per share. SFAS No. 123R also requires that the benefits associated with the tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow, reducing net operating cash flows and increasing net financing cash flows in future periods. The fair values of option, employee stock purchase and restricted stock grants are estimated on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model. Expected volatility and the expected term are the input factors to that model which require the most significant management judgment. Expected volatility is calculated utilizing daily historical volatility over a period that equates to the expected life of the option. The expected life (estimated period of time outstanding) is estimated using the historical exercise behavior of employees. Self Insured Liabilities We are self insured up to certain limits for costs associated with workers compensation claims, vehicle accidents, property and general business liabilities, and benefits paid under employee healthcare and long term disability programs. At December 31, 2005 and 2006 there were approximately $30.4 million and $28.2 million, respectively, of self insurance accruals reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. The measurement of these costs requires the consideration of historical cost experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim. We account for these costs primarily through actuarial 30 methods, which develop estimates of the undiscounted liability for claims incurred, including those claims incurred but not reported. These methods provide estimates of future ultimate claim costs based on claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. We believe the use of actuarial methods to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals. However, the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claims involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known. We believe our recorded obligations for these expenses are appropriate. Nevertheless, changes in healthcare costs, accident frequency and severity, and other factors can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN 48 also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position in accordance with FIN 48 is a two step process. The first step is a recognition process whereby the company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The second step is a measurement process whereby a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is calculated to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective January 1, 2007. The provisions of FIN 48 are to be applied to all tax positions upon initial adoption of this standard. Only tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized or continue to be recognized upon adoption of FIN 48. The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of FIN 48 should be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for that fiscal year. We are in the process of evaluating the effect of FIN 48 on our consolidated results of operations and financial position. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements, and is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 157 to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108 (SAB 108), Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements When Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements, which provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement. SAB 108 is effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006. We have completed our analysis related to the implementation of SAB 108 and have concluded it has no effect on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS No. 159). SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair 31 value. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are in the process of evaluating the effect of SFAS No. 159 on our consolidated results of operations and financial position.

Revenue Our consolidated storage revenues increased $145.6 million, or 12.3%, to $1,327.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 and $138.2 million, or 13.2%, to $1,181.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, in comparison to the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase is attributable to internal revenue growth (10% during 2006 and 9% during 2005) resulting from net increases in records and other media stored by existing customers, sales to new customers and the net result of pricing actions, acquisitions (2% during 2006 and 3% during 2005), and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations (0% during 2006 and 1% during 2005). Consolidated service and storage material sales revenues increased $126.6 million, or 14.1%, to $1,023.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 and $122.4 million, or 15.8%, to $896.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, in comparison to the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase is attributable to acquisitions (7% during 2006 and 7% during 2005), internal revenue growth (7% during 2006 and 7% during 2005) resulting from net increases in service and storage material sales to existing customers and sales to new customers, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations (0% during 2006 and 1% during 2005). 32 For the reasons stated above, our consolidated revenues increased $272.2 million, or 13.1%, to $2,350.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 and $260.6 million, or 14.3%, to $2,078.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, in comparison to the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2005, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that impacted our revenues were primarily due to the strengthening of the British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and Euro against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. For the year ended December 31, 2006, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that impacted our revenues were primarily due to the weakening of the British pound sterling and Euro, net of the strengthening of the Canadian dollar, against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. Internal revenue growth was 8%, 8% and 9% for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. We calculate internal revenue growth in local currency for our international operations. Internal Growth Eight Quarter Trend 2005 2006 First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Storage Revenue 8 % 9 % 9 % 10 % 10 % 11 % 11 % 10 % Service and Storage Material Sales Revenue 3 % 6 % 12 % 9 % 8 % 8 % 3 % 10 % Total Revenue 6 % 8 % 10 % 9 % 10 % 9 % 7 % 10 % Our internal revenue growth rate represents the weighted average year over year growth rate of our revenues after removing the effects of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the impact of the fire in our London, England facility. Over the past eight quarters, the internal growth rate of our storage revenues has increased from a range of 8% to 9% to a range of 10% to 11%. In our North American Physical Business, net carton volume growth remained stable and we benefited from an increasingly positive pricing environment in 2005 and 2006. Strong growth rates in our digital services business more than offset the impact of reduced growth rates in Europe in 2005 resulting from the inclusion of the slower growing Hays IMS business in our base revenues for internal growth calculation purposes. In 2006, our European business posted improved storage internal revenue growth rates. Net carton volume growth is a function of the rate new cartons are added by existing and new customers offset by the rate of carton destructions and other permanent removals. The internal growth rate for service and storage material sales revenue is inherently more volatile than the storage revenue internal growth rate due to the more discretionary nature of the services we offer such as large special projects or data products and carton sales, as well as the price of recycled paper. These revenues are often event driven and impacted to a greater extent by economic downturns as customers defer or cancel the purchase of these services as a way to reduce their short term costs. As a commodity, recycled paper prices are subject to the volatility of that market. The internal growth rate for service and storage material sales revenues reflects the following: (1) stronger data product sales in 2005; (2) a large data restoration project completed by our digital services business in the third quarter of 2005; (3) improved growth rates in our data protection and fulfillment businesses; (4) continued growth in our secure shredding operations; and (5) growth in North American storage related service revenues. These positive factors were partially offset by lower special project revenues related to the public sector business in the U.K. in 2005. 33 Cost of Sales Consolidated cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization) is comprised of the following expenses (in thousands): % of Consolidated Revenues Percent Change 2005 2006 Dollar Change Percent Change 2005 2006 (Favorable)/ Unfavorable Labor $ 447,600 $ 523,401 $ 75,801 16.9 % 21.5 % 22.3 % 0.8 % Facilities 275,987 321,268 45,281 16.4 % 13.3 % 13.7 % 0.4 % Transportation 97,997 111,086 13,089 13.4 % 4.7 % 4.7 % 0.0 % Product Cost of Sales 51,254 49,853 (1,401 ) (2.7 )% 2.5 % 2.1 % (0.4 )% Other 65,401 68,660 3,259 5.0 % 3.1 % 2.9 % (0.2 )% $ 938,239 $ 1,074,268 $ 136,029 14.5 % 45.1 % 45.7 % 0.6 % % of Consolidated Revenues Percent Change 2004 2005 Dollar Change Percent Change 2004 2005 (Favorable)/ Unfavorable Labor $ 419,345 $ 447,600 $ 28,255 6.7 % 23.1 % 21.5 % (1.6 )% Facilities 246,325 275,987 29,662 12.0 % 13.6 % 13.3 % (0.3 )% Transportation 81,976 97,997 16,021 19.5 % 4.5 % 4.7 % 0.2 % Product Cost of Sales 35,908 51,254 15,346 42.7 % 2.0 % 2.5 % 0.5 % Other 40,345 65,401 25,056 62.1 % 2.2 % 3.1 % 0.9 % $ 823,899 $ 938,239 $ 114,340 13.9 % 45.3 % 45.1 % (0.2 )% Labor For the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, labor expense as a percentage of consolidated revenue increased as a result of higher labor costs resulting from our Australia/New Zealand acquisition and our recent shredding acquisitions in Europe, which have a higher service revenue component and are therefore more labor intensive. Our digital business had higher costs of labor associated with internal information technology personnel and consultants dedicated to revenue producing projects. For the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, labor expense as a percentage of consolidated revenue decreased as a result of strong revenue growth, an increasing proportion of revenue from less labor intensive digital services and product sales. We also experienced improvement in our ratio of labor costs to revenues in our European operations as a result of completing the integration of Hays IMS in 2004. Facilities Facilities costs as a percentage of consolidated revenues increased to 13.7% for the year ended December 31, 2006 from 13.3% for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in facilities costs as a percentage of consolidated revenues was primarily a result of increases in utilities and maintenance costs, as well as, increased insurance deductibles and security costs associated with protecting our assets, as a response to the fires in Ottawa, Canada and London, England. Rent expense decreased slightly as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 as a result of a decrease in overall base rent per square foot in our North American operations when comparing 2005 to 2006. The largest component of our facilities cost is rent expense, which increased in dollar terms by $17.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Given current property insurance market conditions, especially in relation 34 to catastrophe exposures of earthquake, flood and wind, we expect our insurance costs associated with our real estate portfolio to rise in 2007 when compared to 2006. Facilities costs as a percentage of consolidated revenues decreased to 13.3% for the year ended December 31, 2005 from 13.6% for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease in facilities costs as a percentage of consolidated revenues was primarily a result of maintaining approximately the same overall base rent per square foot in our North American operations during 2004 and 2005 while consolidated revenues increased. The largest component of our facilities cost is rent expense, which increased $15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily as a result of properties under lease acquired through acquisitions in both Europe and North America. The expansion of our secure shredding business, which incurs lower facilities costs than our core physical businesses, also helped lower our facilities costs as a percentage of consolidated revenues. Transportation Our transportation expenses, which remained consistent as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, are influenced by several variables including total number of vehicles, owned versus leased vehicles, use of subcontracted couriers, fuel expenses and maintenance. Higher fuel costs, increased maintenance expenses resulting from the accelerated implementation of a fleet wide maintenance program in North America and vehicle leasing expenses were primarily responsible for the dollar increase in transportation expenses. Our transportation expenses, which increased 0.2% as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, are influenced by several variables including total number of vehicles, owned versus leased vehicles, use of subcontracted couriers, fuel expenses and maintenance. Higher fuel expenses during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 were primarily responsible for the increase in transportation expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues. Product and Other Cost of Sales Product and other cost of sales are highly correlated to complementary revenue streams. Product cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased due to a corresponding reduction in product sales in the comparable periods. Product and other cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 were higher than the year ended December 31, 2004 as a percentage of consolidated revenues due to increased sales of data products at lower margins in North America, increased royalty payments associated with our electronic vaulting revenues and increases in technology costs associated with these revenue producing activities. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses are comprised of the following expenses (in thousands): % of Consolidated Revenues Percent Change 2005 2006 Dollar Change Percent Change 2005 2006 (Favorable)/ Unfavorable General and Administrative $ 285,558 $ 331,021 $ 45,463 15.9 % 13.7 % 14.1 % 0.4 % Sales, Marketing & Account Management 180,558 214,007 33,449 18.5 % 8.7 % 9.1 % 0.4 % Information Technology 99,177 122,211 23,034 23.2 % 4.8 % 5.2 % 0.4 % Bad Debt Expense 4,402 2,835 (1,567 ) (35.6 )% 0.2 % 0.1 % (0.1 )% $ 569,695 $ 670,074 $ 100,379 17.6 % 27.4 % 28.5 % 1.1 % 35 % of Consolidated Revenues Percent Change 2004 2005 Dollar Change Percent Change 2004 2005 (Favorable)/ Unfavorable General and Administrative $ 259,209 $ 285,558 $ 26,349 10.2 % 14.3 % 13.7 % (0.6 )% Sales, Marketing & Account Management 150,419 180,558 30,139 20.0 % 8.3 % 8.7 % 0.4 % Information Technology 81,187 99,177 17,990 22.2 % 4.5 % 4.8 % 0.3 % Bad Debt Expense (4,569 ) 4,402 8,971 196.3 % (0.3 )% 0.2 % 0.5 % $ 486,246 $ 569,695 $ 83,449 17.2 % 26.8 % 27.4 % 0.6. % General and Administrative The increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 is mainly attributable to (a) increased compensation expense due to expansion through acquisitions, (b) costs associated with our North American reorganization which added a new level of field management, and (c) costs associated with a North American field operations meeting held in 2006 that was not held in 2005. The decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 is attributable to strong revenue growth and controls over overhead spending implemented in late 2004. These decreases were partially offset by increased incentive compensation expense and growth of our North American and European operations due to expansion and acquisitions. Sales, Marketing & Account Management The majority of our sales, marketing and account management costs are labor related and are primarily driven by the headcount in each of these departments. Increased headcount and related compensation and commissions are the most significant contributors to the increase in sales, marketing expenses and account management for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. Throughout the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and into 2006, we invested in the expansion and improvement of our sales, marketing and account management functions. During 2006 in North America, while our sales force headcount increased at a slower rate than revenue growth, the shift to higher end resources drove an increase in the level of spending due to higher costs per sales person and the additional support required. We have significantly increased the size of our digital sales force through our acquisition of LiveVault and the hiring of new sales employees, particularly in Europe. Additionally, costs associated with an enterprise wide sales meeting held in 2006 and not held in 2005 also contributed to this increase. Our larger North American sales force generated a $6.3 million increase in sales commissions and an increase of $13.6 million of compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Our North American sales force generated a $3.0 million increase in sales commissions and an increase of $14.8 million of compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased $3.3 million due to the introduction of several new marketing and promotional efforts to continue to develop awareness in the marketplace of our entire portfolio of services, especially our digital services. Information Technology Information technology expenses increased as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 due to increases in technology 36 development activities within our digital services business, including the acquisition of LiveVault and associated research and development activities and increased spending to support our growing digital archiving business. Additionally, during 2006, we wrote off $5.9 million of previously deferred costs, primarily internal labor costs, associated with internal use software development projects that were discontinued. Higher utilization of existing information technology resources to revenue producing projects, which are charged to costs of goods sold and decreased information technology spending in our European operations, partially offset this increase. Information technology expenses increased as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 due to increases in internal software development projects within our digital services business, the acquisitions of Connected and LiveVault and associated research and development activities, and increased information technology spending in our European operations. Higher utilization of existing information technology resources to revenue producing projects, which are charged to cost of goods sold, partially offset this increase. Bad Debt Expense Consolidated bad debt expense for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006 reflects what we believe to be more normal levels of bad debt expense compared to 2004. The decrease in consolidated bad debt expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 is primarily attributable to the success of our centralized collection efforts within the U.S. and Canada, which resulted in improved cash collections and an improved accounts receivable aging that allowed us to reduce our allowance for doubtful accounts. Depreciation, Amortization, and (Gain) and Loss on Disposal/Writedown of Property, Plant and Equipment, Net Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased $21.5 million to $208.4 million (8.9% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $187.0 million (9.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2005. Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased $23.3 million to $187.0 million (9.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $163.6 million (9.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2004. Depreciation expense increased $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 and increased $18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, primarily due to the additional depreciation expense related to recent capital expenditures and acquisitions, including storage systems, which include racking, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and software, and buildings. Amortization expense increased $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 and increased $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, primarily due to amortization of intangible assets, such as customer relationship intangible assets and intellectual property acquired through business combinations. We expect that amortization expense will continue to increase as we acquire new businesses and reflect the full year impact of our 2006 acquisitions. Consolidated gains on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, consisted primarily of a gain on the sale of a property in the U.K. of $10.5 million offset by disposals and writedowns. Consolidated gains on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, consisted primarily of a gain on the sale of a property in the U.K. of $4.5 million offset primarily by software asset writedowns of $1.1 million. Consolidated gains on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of 37 $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, consisted primarily of a $1.2 million gain on the sale of a property in Florida during the second quarter of 2004 offset by disposals and asset writedowns. Operating Income As a result of all the foregoing factors, consolidated operating income increased $20.4 million, or 5.3%, to $407.2 million (17.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $386.8 million (18.6% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2005. Consolidated operating income increased $42.3 million, or 12.3%, to $386.8 million (18.6% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $344.5 million (19.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2004. OIBDA As a result of all the foregoing factors, consolidated OIBDA increased $41.9 million, or 7.3%, to $615.6 million (26.2% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $573.7 million (27.6% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2005. Consolidated OIBDA increased $65.6 million, or 12.9%, to $573.7 million (27.6% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $508.1 million (28.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2004. Interest Expense, Net Consolidated interest expense, net increased $11.4 million to $195.0 million (8.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $183.6 million (8.8% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2005. The change is primarily due to increased borrowings to fund our 2005 and 2006 acquisitions, particularly LiveVault and Pickfords Records Management (Pickfords). Consolidated interest expense, net decreased $2.2 million to $183.6 million (8.8% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $185.7 million (10.2% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2004. The dollar decrease in interest expense, net was primarily due to the recording of interest expense totaling $21.5 million for the year ending December 31, 2004 compared to interest expense totaling $2.3 million for the year ending December 31, 2005 related to the net impact of mark to market adjustments and cash payments on all of our interest rate swap contracts. This was offset by increased borrowings, primarily an additional $150.0 million of term loans borrowed in November 2004 as permitted under our IMI Credit Agreement and the full year effect of the March 2004 IME Credit Agreement.

Foreign currency losses of $7.2 million based on period end exchange rates were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to the weakening of the British pound sterling, and Euro, net of the strengthening of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar as these currencies relate to our inter company balances with and between our Canadian, U.K. and European subsidiaries, borrowings denominated in foreign currencies under our revolving credit facility and British pounds sterling denominated debt held by our U.S. parent company. Foreign currency gains $8.9 million based on period end exchange rates were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2004, primarily due to the strengthening of the British pound sterling, Euro, and the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar as these currencies relate to our inter company balances with and between our Canadian, U.K., and European subsidiaries, U.S. dollar denominated debt held by our Canadian subsidiary, borrowings denominated in foreign currencies under our revolving credit facility, British pounds sterling denominated debt held by our U.S. parent company, British pounds sterling currency held in the U.S. and our British pound sterling denominated cross currency swap, which was terminated in March 2004. During 2006, we redeemed or purchased a portion of our outstanding 814% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011 and 858% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013 resulting in a charge of $2.8 million, which consists of tender premiums and transaction costs, deferred financing costs, as well as original issue discounts and premiums. During 2004, we redeemed the remaining outstanding principal amount of the 818% Senior Notes due 2008 of our Canadian subsidiary, resulting in a charge of $2.0 million, and we repaid a portion of our real estate term loans, which resulted in a charge of $0.4 million. The charges consisted primarily of the call and tender premiums associated with the extinguished debt and the write off of unamortized deferred financing cost and discounts. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005, and 2006 were 41.7%, 41.4% and 41.8%, respectively. The primary reconciling items between the statutory rate of 35% and our effective rate are state income taxes (net of federal benefit) and differences in the rates of tax at which our foreign earnings are subject. During 2006, we recorded a reduction in income tax expense as a result of a new Texas law changing the way state income tax is calculated in that state. As a result of this change, we have reversed a deferred tax liability of $1.7 million, net of federal tax benefit, related to our Texas state taxes. We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. Although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in changes in our estimates. 39 Minority Interest Minority interest in earnings of subsidiaries, net resulted in a charge to income of $3.0 million (0.2% of consolidated revenues), $1.7 million (0.1% of consolidated revenues) and $1.6 million (0.1% of consolidated revenues) for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005, and 2006, respectively. This represents our minority partners share of earnings in our majority owned international subsidiaries that are consolidated in our operating results. The decrease during 2005 is the result of our acquisition of various Latin American minority partner interests. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations (FIN 47), an interpretation of SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS No. 143). FIN 47 clarifies that conditional asset retirement obligations meet the definition of liabilities and should be recognized when incurred if their fair values can be reasonably estimated. Uncertainty surrounding the timing and method of settlement that may be conditional on events occurring in the future are factored into the measurement of the liability rather than the existence of the liability. SFAS No. 143 established accounting and reporting standards for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets legally required by law, regulatory rule or contractual agreement and the associated asset retirement costs. SFAS No. 143 requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset, which is then depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The liability is increased over time through income as a component of depreciation expense, such that the liability will equate to the future cost to retire the long lived asset at the expected retirement date. Upon settlement of the liability, an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement. Our obligations are primarily the result of requirements under our facility lease agreements which generally have return to original condition clauses which would require us to remove or restore items such as shred pits, vaults, demising walls and office build outs, among others. As of December 31, 2005, we have recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying FIN 47 as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle as prescribed in FIN 47, which resulted in a gross charge of $4.4 million ($2.8 million, net of tax). Net Income As a result of all the foregoing factors, for the year ended December 31, 2006, consolidated net income increased $17.8 million, or 16.0%, to $128.9 million (5.5% of consolidated revenues) from net income of $111.1 million (5.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2005. As a result of all the foregoing factors, for the year ended December 31, 2005, consolidated net income increased $16.9 million, or 18.0%, to $111.1 million (5.3% of consolidated revenues) from net income of $94.2 million (5.2% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2004. Segment Analysis (in thousands) The results of our various operating segments are discussed below. Beginning January 1, 2006, we changed our reportable segments as a result of certain management and organizational changes within our North American business. Therefore, the presentation of all historical segment reporting has been changed to conform to our new management reporting. Our reportable segments are now North American Physical Business, International Physical Business and Worldwide Digital Business. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our North American Physical Business, which consists of the United States and Canada, offers the storage of paper documents, as well as all other non electronic media such as microfilm and microfiche, master audio and videotapes, film, X rays and blueprints, including healthcare 40 information services, vital records services, service and courier operations, and the collection, handling and disposal of sensitive documents for corporate customers (Hard Copy); the storage and rotation of backup computer media as part of corporate disaster recovery plans, including service and courier operations (Data Protection); secure shredding services (Shredding); and the storage, assembly, and detailed reporting of customer marketing literature and delivery to sales offices, trade shows and prospective customers sites based on current and prospective customer orders, which we refer to as the Fulfillment business. Our International Physical Business segment offers information protection and storage services throughout Europe, South America, Mexico and Asia Pacific, including Hard Copy, Data Protection and Shredding. Our Worldwide Digital Business offers information protection and storage services for electronic records conveyed via telecommunication lines and the Internet, including online backup and recovery solutions for server data and personal computers, as well as email archiving and third party technology escrow services that protect intellectual property assets such as software source code.

During the year ended December 31, 2006, revenue in our North American Physical Business segment increased 9.2% primarily due to increasing storage internal growth rates resulting from stable net volume growth and an increasingly positive pricing environment, increasing service revenue growth rates particularly in data protection and fulfillment, growth of our secure shredding operations, and acquisitions. In addition, favorable currency fluctuations during the year ended December 31, 2006 in Canada increased revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, by $9.8 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue decreased in the year ended December 31, 2006 due mainly to (a) higher transportation costs, primarily fuel and rental costs associated with a larger fleet of leased vehicles, and the accelerated implementation of a fleet wide maintenance program in North America, (b) increased facility costs, primarily utilities, maintenance and insurance, (c) increased investment in sales, marketing and account management primarily related to a shift in hiring more experienced personnel at a higher cost, (d) costs associated with the North American reorganization, including a new level of field management, and (e) costs associated with our enterprise wide sales meeting and a field operations meeting, both held in 2006 but not in 2005. During the year ended December 31, 2005, revenue in our North American Physical Business segment increased 10.2% primarily due to increasing storage internal growth rates resulting from higher net volume growth and a more positive pricing environment, increasing service revenue growth rates, growth of our secure shredding operations, higher internal growth rates from product sales and acquisitions. In addition, 41 favorable currency fluctuations during the year ended December 31, 2005 in Canada increased revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, by $8.7 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue decreased in the year ended December 31, 2005 due to our (a) increased investment in sales, marketing and account management, including higher sales commissions and compensation due to increased headcount, (b) increased bad debt expense, (c) increased incentive compensation expense, (d) higher transportation costs, primarily fuel, and (e) product sales at lower margins, offset by strong revenue growth, reduced facility expenses and the effectiveness of recent labor and cost management initiatives, including controls over overhead spending implemented in late 2004. The expansion of our secure shredding business, which incurs lower facilities costs than our core physical business, also lowers our facilities costs as a percentage of revenues. Included in our North American Physical Business segment are certain costs related to staff functions, including finance, human resources and information technology, which benefit the enterprise as a whole. These costs are primarily related to the general management of these functions on a corporate level and the design and development of programs, policies and procedures that are then implemented in the individual segments, with each segment bearing its own cost of implementation. Management has decided to allocate these costs to the North American segment as further allocation is impracticable. International Physical Business Segment Revenue Increase in Revenues Percentage Increase in Revenues For Years Ended December 31, 2004 December 31, 2005 December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 December 31, 2006 $380,033 $435,106 $539,335 $55,073 $104,229 14.5% 24.0% Segment Contribution(1) Segment Contribution(1) as a Percentage of Segment Revenue For Years Ended December 31, 2004 December 31, 2005 December 31, 2006 December 31, 2004 December 31, 2005 December 31, 2006 $89,751 $113,417 $117,568 23.6% 26.1% 21.8% Items Excluded from the Calculation of Segment Contribution(1) Depreciation and Amortization December 31, 2004 December 31, 2005 December 31, 2006 $33,234 $43,285 $54,803 (1) See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for definition of Contribution and for the basis on which allocations are made and a reconciliation of Contribution to income before provision for income taxes and minority interest on a consolidated basis. Revenue in our International Physical Business segment increased 24.0% during the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to acquisitions, which contributed $92.0 million or 18.6%. This was partially offset by net unfavorable currency fluctuations in Europe and Latin America of $6.3 million or 1.5% during the year ended December 31, 2006. The balance of the increase in revenue represents internal growth. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue decreased primarily due to the acquisition of two shredding businesses in the U.K. that operate at lower margins, the acquisition of Pickfords, which is in the process of rationalizing its real estate portfolio, and costs associated with the facility fire in London, England. Revenue in our International Physical Business segment increased 14.5% during the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to acquisitions completed in Europe and in South America and strong internal growth in Latin America, offset by lower revenue in our U.K. public sector business. Favorable currency fluctuations during the year ended December 31, 2005 in Europe, Mexico and South America increased revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, by $13.8 million compared to the year ended December 31, 42 2004. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue increased primarily due to improvements in both cost of sales and overhead labor ratios as a result of completing the integration of Hays IMS in the second half of 2004 offset by increased compensation associated with additional sales, marketing, and account management personnel, several new marketing and promotional efforts, and increased bad debt expense. Worldwide Digital Business Segment Revenue Increase in Revenues Percentage Increase in Revenues For Years Ended December 31, 2004 December 31, 2005 December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 December 31, 2006 $49,579 $113,437 $139,998 $63,858 $26,561 128.8% 23.4% Segment Contribution(1) Segment Contribution(1) as a Percentage of Segment Revenue For Years Ended December 31, 2004 December 31, 2005 December 31, 2006 December 31, 2004 December 31, 2005 December 31, 2006 $(9,886) $12,461 $9,779 (19.9)% 11.0% 7.0% Items Excluded from the Calculation of Segment Contribution(1) Depreciation and Amortization December 31, 2004 December 31, 2005 December 31, 2006 $14,420 $25,144 $ 26,008 (1) See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for definition of Contribution and for the basis on which allocations are made and a reconciliation of Contribution to income before provision for income taxes and minority interest on a consolidated basis. During the year ended December 31, 2006, revenue in our Worldwide Digital Business segment increased 23.4% primarily due to internal growth of 16%, primarily attributable to growth in digital storage revenue and our online backup service offerings for both personal computer and server data. The internal growth rate of our digital business was offset by a large data restoration project in the third quarter of 2005, which was not repeated in 2006 but drove the increase in the digital storage growth rate beginning in the fourth quarter of 2005. The acquisition of LiveVault in December 2005 contributed approximately $12 million in revenue during the year ended December 31, 2006. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue decreased primarily due to the acquisition of LiveVault, increased investment in the European sales force, increases in information technology costs, including the write off of $5.9 million of previously deferred costs, primarily internal labor costs, associated with internal use software development projects that were discontinued, and the benefit of a large data restoration project in the third quarter of 2005. This decrease was offset by higher absorption of fixed costs as a result of increased revenues and a reduction in royalty payments. During the year ended December 31, 2005, revenue in our Worldwide Digital Business segment increased 128.8% primarily due to the acquisition of Connected in November 2004, which represents an increase of $33.7 million over the partial year of revenue recorded in 2004 and strong internal growth of 41%, including the impact of a large data restoration project completed in 2005. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue increased primarily due to strong revenue growth and improved overhead leverage, partially offset by increases in information technology costs, the acquisitions of Connected and LiveVault and associated research and development activities and the growth of our sales and account management force, including higher sales commissions. 43 Liquidity and Capital Resources The following is a summary of our cash balances and cash flows for the years ended 2004, 2005 and 2006 (in thousands). 2004 2005 2006 Cash flows provided by operating activities $ 305,364 $ 377,176 $ 374,282 Cash flows used in investing activities (626,523 ) (436,175 ) (466,714 ) Cash flows provided by financing activities 276,569 81,449 82,734 Cash and cash equivalents at the end of year 31,942 53,413 45,369 Net cash provided by operating activities was $377.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $374.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease resulted primarily from an increase in operating income and non cash items, such as depreciation offset by gain on foreign currency, and further offset by the net change in working capital. The net change in working capital is primarily associated with the timing of accounts payable payments. Due to the nature of our businesses, we make significant capital expenditures and additions to customer acquisition costs. Our capital expenditures are primarily related to growth and include investments in storage systems, information systems and discretionary investments in real estate. Cash paid for our capital expenditures and additions to customer acquisition costs during the year ended December 31, 2006 amounted to $382.0 million and $14.3 million, respectively. From time to time and in the normal course of business we sell certain fixed assets, primarily real estate. In the year ended December 31, 2006, we received $17.8 million of net proceeds from the sales of assets. For the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2006, capital expenditures, net and additions to customer acquisition costs were funded primarily with cash flows provided by operating activities. Excluding acquisitions, we expect our capital expenditures to be between $390 million and $420 million in the year ending December 31, 2007. Included in our estimated capital expenditures for 2007 is $50 million to $60 million of opportunity driven real estate purchases. In the year ended December 31, 2006, we paid net cash consideration of $81.2 million for acquisitions, primarily related to the acquisition of two shredding businesses in the U.K., the buyout of minority partners in France and Mexico and contingent payments associated with a shredding acquisition in the U.S. and another acquisition in Europe. Cash flows provided from operating activities, borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, the proceeds from the sale of senior subordinated notes, and cash equivalents on hand funded these acquisitions. Net cash provided by financing activities was $82.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we had gross borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and term loan facilities of $543.9 million, $282.0 million of net proceeds from the sale of Senior Subordinated Notes and $22.2 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plan. We used the proceeds from these financing transactions to repay debt and term loans ($655.0 million), repurchase $78.1 million of our 814% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011 and repurchase $33.0 million of our 858% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013, repay debt financing from minority stockholders, net ($1.8 million) and to fund acquisitions. 44 We are highly leveraged and expect to continue to be highly leveraged for the foreseeable future. Our consolidated debt as of December 31, 2006 was comprised of the following (in thousands): IMI Revolving Credit Facility(1) $ 170,472 IMI Term Loan Facility(1) 312,000 IME Revolving Credit Facility(2) 77,819 IME Term Loan Facility(2) 189,005 814% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011(3) 71,789 858% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013(3) 448,001 714% GBP Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014(3) 293,865 734% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2015(3) 438,594 658% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016(3) 315,553 834% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018(3) 200,000 8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018(3) 49,663 634% Euro Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018(3) 39,429 Real Estate Mortgages 4,081 Seller Notes 8,757 Other 49,788 Long term Debt 2,668,816 Less Current Portion (63,105 ) Long term Debt, Net of Current Portion $ 2,605,711 (1) All intercompany notes and the capital stock of most of our U.S. subsidiaries are pledged to secure these debt instruments. (2) Most of IMEs non dormant subsidiaries have either guaranteed this indebtedness or their shares of capital stock and intercompany indebtedness have been pledged to secure this indebtedness. Iron Mountain has not guaranteed or otherwise provided security for this indebtedness nor have any of Iron Mountains U.S., Canadian, Asia Pacific, Mexican or South American subsidiaries. (3) These debt instruments are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior subordinated basis, by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries (the Guarantors). These guarantees are joint and several obligations of the Guarantors. The remainder of our subsidiaries do not guarantee these debt instruments. Our indentures use OIBDA based calculations as primary measures of financial performance, including leverage ratios. Our key bond leverage ratio, as calculated per our bond indentures, was 5.0 as of December 31, 2005 and 4.6 as of December 31, 2006. Noncompliance with this leverage ratio would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity. Our target for this ratio is generally in the range of 4.5 to 5.5 while the maximum ratio allowable under the bond indentures is 6.5. Our ability to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, working capital levels and capital structure, which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors which may be beyond our control. There can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future financings will be available on acceptable terms or in amounts sufficient to enable us to service or refinance our indebtedness, or to make necessary capital expenditures. 45 In March 2004, IME and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement (the IME Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of European lenders. The IME Credit Agreement provides for maximum borrowing availability in the principal amount of 200 million British pounds sterling, including a 100 million British pounds sterling revolving credit facility (the IME revolving credit facility), which includes the ability to borrow in certain other foreign currencies and a 100 million British pounds sterling term loan (the IME term loan facility). The IME revolving credit facility matures on March 5, 2009. The IME term loan facility is payable in three installments; two installments of 20 million British pounds sterling on March 5, 2007 and 2008, respectively, and the final payment of the remaining balance on March 5, 2009. The interest rate on borrowings under the IME Credit Agreement varies depending on IMEs choice of currency options and interest rate period, plus an applicable margin. The IME Credit Agreement includes various financial covenants applicable to the results of IME, which may restrict IMEs ability to incur indebtedness under the IME Credit Agreement and from third parties, as well as limit IMEs ability to pay dividends to us. Most of IMEs non dormant subsidiaries have either guaranteed the obligations or have their shares pledged to secure IMEs obligations under the IME Credit Agreement. We have not guaranteed or otherwise provided security for the IME Credit Agreement nor have any of our U.S., Canadian, Asia Pacific, Mexican or South American subsidiaries. Our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2006 includes 77 million British pounds sterling and 94.7 million Euro of borrowings (totaling $266.8 million) under the IME Credit Agreement; we also had various outstanding letters of credit totaling 1.7 million British pounds sterling ($3.2 million). The remaining availability, based on IMEs current leverage ratio which is calculated based on current earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and current external debt, under the IME revolving credit facility on October 31, 2006, was approximately 59.0 million British pounds sterling ($112.1 million). The interest rate in effect under the IME revolving credit facility ranged from 4.4% to 6.2% as of October 31, 2006. On April 2, 2004 and subsequently on July 8, 2004, we entered into a new amended and restated revolving credit facility and term loan facility (the IMI Credit Agreement) to replace our prior credit agreement and to reflect more favorable pricing of our term loans. The IMI Credit Agreement had an aggregate principal amount of $550 million and was comprised of a $350 million revolving credit facility (the IMI revolving credit facility), which included the ability to borrow in certain foreign currencies, and a $200 million term loan facility (the IMI term loan facility). The IMI revolving credit facility matures on April 2, 2009. With respect to the IMI term loan facility, quarterly loan payments of $0.5 million began in the third quarter of 2004 and will continue through maturity on April 2, 2011, at which time the remaining outstanding principal balance of the IMI term loan facility is due. In November 2004, we entered into an additional $150 million of term loans as permitted under our IMI Credit Agreement. The new term loans will mature at the same time as our current IMI term loan facility with quarterly loan payments of $0.4 million that began in the first quarter of 2005 and are priced at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.75%. On October 31, 2005, we entered into the second amendment to the IMI Credit Agreement, increasing availability under the revolving credit facility from $350 million to $400 million. As a result, the IMI Credit Agreement had an aggregate maximum principal amount of $750 million as of December 31, 2006. The interest rate on borrowings under the IMI Credit Agreement varies depending on our choice of interest rate and currency options, plus an applicable margin. All intercompany notes and the capital stock of most of our U.S. subsidiaries are pledged to secure the IMI Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2006, we had $170.5 million of borrowings under our IMI revolving credit facility, of which $4 million was denominated in U.S. dollars and the remaining balance was denominated in Canadian dollars (CAD) (CAD 194 million); we also had various outstanding letters of credit totaling $27.0 million. The remaining availability, based on Iron Mountains current leverage ratio which is calculated based on current EBITDA and current external debt, under the IMI revolving credit facility on December 31, 2006, was $113.8 million. The interest rate in effect under the IMI revolving credit facility and IMI term loan facility ranged from 6.0% to 9.0% and 7.0% to 7.2%, respectively, as of December 31, 2006. 46 In July 2006, we completed an underwritten public offering of $200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 834% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018, which were issued at par. Our net proceeds of $196.6 million, after paying the underwriters discounts, commissions and transaction fees, were used to (a) fund our offer to purchase and consent solicitation of $78.1 million in aggregate principle amount of our outstanding 814% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011, (b) fund our purchase in the open market of $33.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 858% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013 and (c) repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility. As a result, we recorded a charge to other expense (income), net of $2.8 million in the third quarter of 2006 related to the early extinguishment of the 814% and 858% Senior Subordinated Notes, which consists of tender premiums and transaction costs, deferred financing costs, as well as, original issue discounts and premiums related to the 814% and 858% Senior Subordinated Notes. In July 2006, we experienced a significant fire in a records and information management facility in London, England that resulted in the complete destruction of the leased facility. London fire authorities recently issued a report in which it was concluded that the fire resulted from a deliberate act of arson; the report also stated that the actions of a guard employed by a third party security service contractor resulted in the disabling of the automatic sprinkler system in the building. We believe we carry adequate property and liability insurance and are in the process of assessing the cause of, and other circumstances involved with, the fire. We do not expect that this event will have a material impact to our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Revenues from this facility represent less than 1% of our consolidated enterprise revenues. As of December 31, 2006, we have approximately $9.6 million recorded as an insurance receivable which is included in prepaid expenses and other in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet which primarily represents the net book value of the property, plant and equipment associated with this facility at the time of the incident, net of $1.8 million of property insurance proceeds received through IMEs October 31, 2006 fiscal year end. Subsequent to IMEs October 31, 2006 fiscal year end, IME received payment from our insurance carrier of approximately 8.6 million British pounds sterling ($16.9 million). We expect to utilize cash received from our insurance carriers to fund capital expenditures and for general working capital needs. Such amount represents a portion of our business personal property, business interruption, and expense claims with our insurance carrier. We will record approximately $8.8 million to other (income) expense, net in the first quarter of 2007 related to recoveries associated with our business interruption portion of our insurance claim to date. We expect to settle the remaining property portion of our insurance claim with our insurance carriers within the next twelve months and have, therefore, classified the remaining insurance receivable as a current asset. We expect to receive recoveries related to our property claim with our insurance carriers that will exceed the carrying value of such assets. We, therefore, expect to record gains on the disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net in our statement of operations in future periods when the cash received to date exceeds the remaining carrying value of the related property, plant and equipment, net. Recoveries from the insurance carriers related to business personal property claims are reflected in our statement of cash flows under proceeds from sales of property and equipment and other, net included in investing activities section when received. Recoveries from the insurance carriers related to business interruption claims are reflected in our statement of cash flows as a component of net income included in the operating activities section when received. In October 2006, we issued, in a private placement, $50 million in aggregate principal amount of our 8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018, which were issued at a price of 99.3% of par; and 30 million Euro in aggregate principal amount of our 634% Euro Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018, which were issued at a price of 99.5% of par. Our net proceeds of $85.5 million, after sales commission, were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under the IMI term loan and IME revolving credit facilities. The IME Credit Agreement, IMI Credit Agreement, our indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants, including covenants that 47 restrict our ability to complete acquisitions, pay cash dividends, incur indebtedness, make investments, sell assets and take certain other corporate actions. The covenants do not contain a rating trigger. Therefore, a change in our debt rating would not trigger a default under the IME Credit Agreement, IMI Credit Agreement and our indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness. We were in compliance with all debt covenants in material agreements as of December 31, 2006. In January 2007, we completed an offering of 225.0 million Euro in aggregate principal amount of our 634% Euro Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018, which were issued at a price of 98.99% of par and priced to yield 6.875%. Our net proceeds of 219.2 million Euro ($283.8 million), after paying the underwriters discounts and commissions and estimated expenses (excluding accrued interest payable by purchasers of the notes from October 17, 2006). These net proceeds were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under the IMI term loan and revolving credit facilities. We recorded a charge to other (income) expense, net of $0.5 million in the first quarter of 2007 related to the early retirement of the IMI term loans, representing the write off of a portion of our deferred financing costs. In addition, in January 2007, we entered into forward contracts to exchange U.S. dollars for 96 million Euros and 194 million CAD for 127.5 million Euros to hedge our intercompany exposures with Canada and our subsidiaries whose functional currency is the Euro. These forward contracts settle on a monthly basis, at which time we enter into new forward contracts for the same underlying amounts, to continue to hedge movements in CAD and Euros against the U.S. dollar. At the time of settlement, we either pay or receive the net settlement amount from the forward contract. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 Years Capital Lease Obligations $ 41,384 $ 8,829 $ 6,622 $ 2,157 $ 23,776 Long Term Debt Obligations (excluding Capital Lease Obligations) 2,625,023 54,276 412,232 374,350 1,784,165 Interest Payments(1) 1,567,691 212,794 401,893 342,429 610,575 Operating Lease Obligations 2,871,269 176,842 322,327 302,457 2,069,643 Purchase and Asset Retirement Obligations(2) 62,881 26,555 22,407 6,620 7,299 Total $ 7,168,248 $ 479,296 $ 1,165,481 $ 1,028,013 $ 4,495,458 (1) Amounts include variable rate interest payments, which are calculated utilizing the applicable interest rates as of December 31, 2006; see Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (2) In addition, in connection with some of our acquisitions, we have potential earn out obligations that may be payable in the event businesses we acquired meet certain operational objectives. These payments are based on the future results of these operations, and our estimate of the maximum contingent earn out payments we may be required to make under all such agreements as of December 31, 2006 is approximately $6.6 million. We expect to meet our cash flow requirements for the next twelve months from cash generated from operations, existing cash, cash equivalents, borrowings under the IMI and IME revolving credit facilities and other financings, which may include secured credit facilities, securitizations and mortgage or capital lease financings. We expect to meet our long term cash flow requirements using the same means described 48 above, as well as the potential issuance of debt or equity securities as we deem appropriate. See Notes 4, 7 and 10 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Regulation S K Item 303(a)(4)(ii). Net Operating Loss Carryforwards We have federal net operating loss carryforwards which begin to expire in 2018 through 2021 of $172.7 million at December 31, 2006 to reduce future federal taxable income, if any. We also have an asset for state net operating loss of $18.2 million (net of federal tax benefit), which begins to expire in 2007 through 2024, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 98%. As a result of these loss carryforwards, we do not expect to pay any significant U.S. federal and state income taxes in 2007. Inflation Certain of our expenses, such as wages and benefits, insurance, occupancy costs and equipment repair and replacement, are subject to normal inflationary pressures. Although to date we have been able to offset inflationary cost increases through increased operating efficiencies and the negotiation of favorable long term real estate leases, we can give no assurance that we will be able to offset any future inflationary cost increases through similar efficiencies, leases or increased storage or service charges. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Interest Rate Risk Given the recurring nature of our revenues and the long term nature of our asset base, we have the ability and the preference to use long term, fixed interest rate debt to finance our business, thereby helping to preserve our long term returns on invested capital. We target a range 80% to 85% of our debt portfolio to be fixed with respect to interest rates. Occasionally, we will use floating to fixed interest rate swaps as a tool to maintain our targeted level of fixed rate debt. As part of this strategy, in May 2001 and June 2006 we and IME entered into a total of two derivative financial contracts, which are variable for fixed interest rate swaps consisting of (a) one contract based on interest payments previously payable on our real estate term loans of an aggregate principal amount of $97.0 million that have been subsequently repaid, and (b) one contract for interest payments payable on IMEs term loan facility of an aggregate principal amount of 75.0 million British pounds sterling. See Note 3 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. After consideration of the swap contracts mentioned above, as of December 31, 2006, we had $517.9 million of variable rate debt outstanding with a weighted average variable interest rate of 6.4%, and $2,150.9 million of fixed rate debt outstanding. As of December 31, 2006, 80.6% of our total debt outstanding was fixed. If the weighted average variable interest rate on our variable rate debt had increased by 1%, our net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 would have been reduced by $2.9 million. See Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K for a discussion of our long term indebtedness, including the fair values of such indebtedness as of December 31, 2006. Currency Risk Our investments in IME, Iron Mountain Canada Corporation (IM Canada), Iron Mountain Mexico, SA de RL de CV, IMSA and other international investments may be subject to risks and uncertainties related to fluctuations in currency valuation. Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. However, our international revenues and expenses are generated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate, 49 primarily the Euro, Canadian dollar and British pound sterling. The currencies of many Latin American countries, particularly the Argentine peso, have experienced substantial volatility and depreciation. Declines in the value of the local currencies in which we are paid relative to the U.S. dollar will cause revenues in U.S. dollar terms to decrease and dollar denominated liabilities to increase in local currency. The impact on our earnings is mitigated somewhat by the fact that most operating and other expenses are also incurred and paid in the local currency. We also have several intercompany obligations between our foreign subsidiaries and Iron Mountain and our U.S. based subsidiaries and our foreign subsidiaries and IME. These intercompany obligations are primarily denominated in the local currency of the foreign subsidiary. We have adopted and implemented a number of strategies to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in currency valuations. One strategy is to finance our largest international subsidiaries with local debt that is denominated in local currencies, thereby providing a natural hedge. In determining the amount of any such financing, we take into account local tax strategies among other factors. Another strategy we utilize is to borrow in foreign currencies at the U.S. parent level to hedge our intercompany financing activities. Finally, on occasion, we enter into currency swaps to temporarily or permanently hedge an overseas investment, such as a major acquisition to lock in certain transaction economics. We have implemented these strategies for our three foreign investments in the U.K., Canada and Asia Pacific. Specifically, through IME borrowing under the IME Credit Agreement and our 150 million British pounds sterling denominated 714% Senior Subordinated Notes, we effectively hedge most of our outstanding intercompany loan with IME. IM Canada has financed their capital needs through direct borrowings in Canadian dollars under the IMI revolving credit facility. This creates a tax efficient natural currency hedge. To fund the acquisition of Pickfords in Australia and New Zealand, Iron Mountain borrowed Australian and New Zealand dollars under its multi currency revolving credit facility. These borrowings provided a tax efficient natural hedge against the intercompany loans created at the time of the acquisition. Subsequently, we repaid such borrowings under our multi currency revolving credit facility and contemporaneously in September 2006, we entered into forward contracts to exchange U.S. dollars for 55 million in Australian dollars (AUD) and 20.2 million in New Zealand dollars (NZD) to hedge our intercompany exposure in these countries. In addition, in January, 2007 we entered into forward contracts to exchange U.S. dollars for 96 million Euros and 194 million CAD for 127.5 million Euros to hedge our intercompany exposures with Canada and our subsidiaries whose functional currency is the Euro. These forward contracts settle on a monthly basis, at which time we enter into new forward contracts for the same underlying amounts, to continue to hedge movements in AUD, NZD, CAD and Euros against the U.S. dollar. At the time of settlement, we either pay or receive the net settlement amount from the forward contract. As of December 31, 2006, except as noted above, our currency exposures to intercompany balances are unhedged. The impact of devaluation or depreciating currency on an entity depends on the residual effect on the local economy and the ability of an entity to raise prices and or reduce expenses. Due to our constantly changing currency exposure and the potential substantial volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange fluctuations on our business. The effect of a change in foreign exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the Accumulated Other Comprehensive Items, net component of stockholders equity. A 10% depreciation in year end 2006 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction in our stockholders equity of approximately $41.1 million.
