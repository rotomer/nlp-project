Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with "Item 6. Selected Financial Data" and the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto and the other financial and operating information included elsewhere in this filing. This discussion contains "forward looking statements," as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and in other federal securities laws. See "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements" on page ii of this filing and "Item 1A. Risk Factors" beginning on page 14 of this filing. Overview Our revenues consist of storage revenues as well as service and storage material sales revenues. Storage revenues, both physical and digital, which are considered a key performance indicator for the information protection and storage services industry, consist of largely recurring periodic charges related to the storage of materials or data (generally on a per unit basis), which are typically retained by customers for many years, and have accounted for over 54% of total consolidated revenues in each of the last five years. Our quarterly revenues from these fixed periodic storage fees have grown for 76 consecutive quarters. Service and storage material sales revenues are comprised of charges for related 26 service activities and courier operations and the sale of software licenses and storage materials. Included in service and storage materials sales are related core service revenues arising from: (1) the handling of records including the addition of new records, temporary removal of records from storage, refiling of removed records, destruction of records, and permanent withdrawals from storage; (2) courier operations, consisting primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request; (3) secure shredding of sensitive documents; and (4) other recurring services including maintenance and support contracts. Our complementary services revenues, included in service and storage material sales, arise from special project work, including data restoration, providing fulfillment services, consulting services and product sales, including software licenses, specially designed storage containers, magnetic media (including computer tapes) and related supplies. Our secure shredding revenues include the sale of recycled paper, the price of which can fluctuate from period to period, adding to the volatility and reducing the predictability of that revenue stream. As service and storage material sales and complementary services have grown at a faster pace then our storage revenues, storage revenues as a percent of consolidated revenues has declined. Our consolidated revenues are also subject to variations caused by the net effect of foreign currency translation on revenue derived from outside the U.S. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007, we derived approximately 28%, 30% and 32%, respectively, of our total revenues from outside the U.S. We recognize revenue when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Storage and service revenues are recognized in the month the respective storage or service is provided and customers are generally billed on a monthly basis on contractually agreed upon terms. Amounts related to future storage or prepaid service contracts, including maintenance and support contracts, for customers where storage fees or services are billed in advance, are accounted for as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the applicable storage or service period or when the service is performed. Storage material sales are recognized when shipped to the customer and title has passed to the customer and include software license sales. Sales of software licenses to distributors are recognized at the time a distributor reports that the software has been licensed to an end user and all revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. Cost of sales (excluding depreciation) consists primarily of wages and benefits for field personnel, facility occupancy costs (including rent and utilities), transportation expenses (including vehicle leases and fuel), other product cost of sales and other equipment costs and supplies. Of these, wages and benefits and facility occupancy costs are the most significant. Trends in total wages and benefits dollars and as a percentage of total consolidated revenue are influenced by changes in headcount and compensation levels, achievement of incentive compensation targets, workforce productivity and variability in costs associated with medical insurance and workers compensation. Trends in facility occupancy costs are similarly impacted by the total number of facilities we occupy, the mix of properties we own versus properties we occupy under operating leases, fluctuations in per square foot occupancy costs, and the levels of utilization of these properties. The expansion of our European, secure shredding and digital services businesses has impacted the major cost of sales components. Our European and secure shredding operations are more labor intensive than our core U.S. physical businesses and therefore increase our labor costs as a percent of consolidated revenues. This trend is partially offset by our digital services businesses, which require significantly less direct labor. Our secure shredding operations incur less facility costs and higher transportation costs as a percent of revenues compared to our core physical businesses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits for management, administrative, information technology, sales, account management and marketing personnel, as well as expenses related to communications and data processing, travel, professional fees, bad debts, training, office equipment and supplies. Trends in total wages and benefits dollars and as a percentage of total consolidated revenue are influenced by changes in headcount and compensation 27 levels, achievement of incentive compensation targets, workforce productivity and variability in costs associated with medical insurance. The overhead structure of our expanding European and Asian operations, as compared to our North American operations, is more labor intensive and has not achieved the same level of overhead leverage, which may result in an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of consolidated revenue, as our European and Asian operations become a more meaningful percentage of our consolidated results. Similarly, our digital services business requires a higher level of overhead, particularly in the area of information technology, than our core physical businesses. Our adoption of the measurement provisions of SFAS No. 123 as amended by SFAS No. 148 has resulted in increasing amounts of selling, general and administrative expenses. We began using the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation in our financial statements beginning January 1, 2003 using the prospective method. The prospective method involves recognizing expense for the fair value for all awards granted or modified in the year of adoption and thereafter with no expense recognition for previous awards. We adopted SFAS No. 123R, "Share Based Payment" effective January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective method, as permitted under SFAS No. 123R. We record stock based compensation expense for the cost of stock options, restricted stock and shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123R beginning January 1, 2006. Our depreciation and amortization charges result primarily from the capital intensive nature of our business. The principal components of depreciation relate to storage systems, which include racking, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and software, and buildings. Amortization relates primarily to customer relationships and acquisition costs and core technology and is impacted by the nature and timing of acquisitions. Our consolidated revenues and expenses are subject to variations caused by the net effect of foreign currency translation on revenues and expenses incurred by our entities outside the U.S. In 2006, we saw increases in both revenues and expenses as a result of the strengthening of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar, and decreases in both revenues and expenses as a result of the weakening of the British pound sterling and the Euro, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. During 2007, we have seen increases in both revenues and expenses as a result of the strengthening of the Canadian dollar, Euro and British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. It is difficult to predict how much foreign currency exchange rates will fluctuate in the future and how those fluctuations will impact individual balances reported in our consolidated statement of operations. Given the relative increase in our international operations, these fluctuations may become material on individual balances. However, because both the revenues and expenses are denominated in the local currency of the country in which they are derived or incurred, the impact of currency fluctuations on our operating income, operating margin and net income is mitigated. Non GAAP Measures Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization, or OIBDA OIBDA is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization expenses. OIBDA Margin is calculated by dividing OIBDA by total revenues. We use these measures to evaluate the operating performance of our consolidated business. As such, we believe these measures provide relevant and useful information to our current and potential investors. We use OIBDA for planning purposes and multiples of current or projected OIBDA based calculations in conjunction with our discounted cash flow models to determine our overall enterprise valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets. We believe OIBDA and OIBDA Margin are useful measures to evaluate our ability to grow our revenues faster than our operating expenses and they are an integral part of the internal reporting 28 system we use to assess and evaluate the operating performance of our business. OIBDA does not include certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results, specifically: (1) minority interest in earnings (losses) of subsidiaries, net (2) other (income) expense, net (3) income from discontinued operations and loss on sale of discontinued operations and (4) cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. OIBDA also does not include interest expense, net and the provision for income taxes. These expenses are associated with our capitalization and tax structures, which we do not consider when evaluating the operating profitability of our core operations. Finally, OIBDA does not include depreciation and amortization expenses, in order to eliminate the impact of capital investments, which we evaluate by comparing capital expenditures to incremental revenue generated and as a percentage of total revenues. OIBDA and OIBDA Margin should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the Unites States of America, or GAAP, such as operating or net income or cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP). Reconciliation of OIBDA to Operating Income and Net Income (In Thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2005 2006 2007 OIBDA $ 573,706 $ 615,560 $ 704,012 Less: Depreciation and Amortization 186,922 208,373 249,294 Operating Income 386,784 407,187 454,718 Less: Interest Expense, Net 183,584 194,958 228,593 Other (Income) Expense, Net 6,182 (11,989 ) 3,101 Provision for Income Taxes 81,484 93,795 69,010 Minority Interests in Earnings of Subsidiaries 1,684 1,560 920 Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle (net of tax benefit) 2,751 Net Income $ 111,099 $ 128,863 $ 153,094 Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and for the period then ended. On an on going basis, we evaluate the estimates used, including those related to accounting for acquisitions, allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos, impairment of tangible and intangible assets, income taxes, stock based compensation and self insured liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience, actuarial estimates, current conditions and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Our critical accounting policies include the following, which are listed in no particular order: Accounting for Acquisitions Part of our growth strategy has included the acquisition of numerous businesses. The purchase price of these acquisitions has been determined after due diligence of the acquired business, market research, strategic planning, and the forecasting of expected future results and synergies. Estimated 29 future results and expected synergies are subject to revisions as we integrate each acquisition and attempt to leverage resources. Each acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting as defined under the applicable accounting standards at the date of each acquisition, including, Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16, "Accounting for Business Combinations," and SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations." Accounting for these acquisitions has resulted in the capitalization of the cost in excess of fair value of the net assets acquired in each of these acquisitions as goodwill. We estimated the fair values of the assets acquired in each acquisition as of the date of acquisition and these estimates are subject to adjustment. These estimates are subject to final assessments of the fair value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, operating leases and deferred income taxes. We complete these assessments within one year of the date of acquisition. We are not aware of any information that would indicate that the final purchase price allocations for acquisitions completed in 2007 would differ meaningfully from preliminary estimates. See Note 6 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In connection with each of our acquisitions, we have undertaken certain restructurings of the acquired businesses to realize efficiencies and potential cost savings. Our restructuring activities include the elimination of duplicate facilities, reductions in staffing levels, and other costs associated with exiting certain activities of the businesses we acquire. The estimated cost of these restructuring activities are included as costs of the acquisition and are recorded as goodwill consistent with the guidance of Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 95 3, "Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination." While we finalize our plans to restructure the businesses we acquire within one year of the date of acquisition, it may take more than one year to complete all activities related to the restructuring of an acquired business. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Credit Memos We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments and disputes regarding billing and service issues. When calculating the allowance, we consider our past loss experience, current and prior trends in our aged receivables and credit memo activity, current economic conditions, and specific circumstances of individual receivable balances. If the financial condition of our customers were to significantly change, resulting in a significant improvement or impairment of their ability to make payments, an adjustment of the allowance may be required. We consider accounts receivable to be delinquent after such time as reasonable means of collection have been exhausted. We charge off uncollectible balances as circumstances warrant, generally, no later than one year past due. As of December 31, 2006 and 2007, our allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos balance totaled $15.2 million and $19.2 million, respectively. Impairment of Tangible and Intangible Assets Assets subject to amortization: In accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets," we review long lived assets and all amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operation to which the assets relate to their carrying amount. The operations are generally distinguished by the business segment and geographic region in which they operate. If the operation is determined to be unable to recover the carrying amount of its assets, then intangible assets are written down first, followed by the other long lived assets of the operation, to fair value. Fair value is based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, depending upon the nature of the assets. 30 Goodwill Assets not subject to amortization: We apply the provisions of SFAS No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" to goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives which are not amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. We have selected October 1 as our annual goodwill impairment review date. We performed our annual goodwill impairment review as of October 1, 2005, 2006 and 2007 and noted no impairment of goodwill. In making this assessment, we rely on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. As of December 31, 2007, no factors were identified that would alter this assessment. When changes occur in the composition of one or more reporting units, the goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units affected based on their relative fair values. Goodwill valuations have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. This approach incorporates many assumptions including future growth rates, discount factors, expected capital expenditures and income tax cash flows. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in a goodwill impairment in future periods. Our reporting units at which level we performed our goodwill impairment analysis as of October 31, 2007 were as follows: North America excluding Fulfillment; Fulfillment; U.K.; Continental Europe; Worldwide Digital Business excluding Iron Mountain Intellectual Property Management, Inc. ("IPM"); IPM; South America; Mexico and Asia Pacific. Asia Pacific is primarily composed of recent acquisitions. It is still in the development stage and accordingly its fair value does not exceed its carrying value by a significant margin at this point in time. Accounting for Internal Use Software We develop various software applications for internal use. We account for those costs in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Position ("SOP") 98 1, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use." SOP 98 1 requires computer software costs associated with internal use software to be expensed as incurred until certain capitalization criteria are met. SOP 98 1 also defines which types of costs should be capitalized and which should be expensed. Payroll and related costs for employees who are directly associated with, and who devote time to, the development of internal use computer software projects, to the extent time is spent directly on the project, are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the software. Capitalization begins when the design stage of the project has been completed and it is probable that the application will be completed and used to perform the function intended. Depreciation begins when the software is placed in service. Computer software costs that are capitalized are evaluated for impairment in accordance with SFAS No.144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." It may be necessary for us to write off amounts associated with the development of internal use software if the project cannot be completed as intended. Our expansion into new technology based service offerings requires the development of internal use software that will be susceptible to rapid and significant changes in technology. We may be required to write off unamortized costs or shorten the estimated useful life if an internal use software program is replaced with an alternative tool prior to the end of the softwares estimated useful life. General uncertainties related to expansion into digital businesses, including the timing of introduction and market acceptance of our services, may adversely impact the recoverability of these assets. As of December 31, 2006 and 2007, capitalized labor net of accumulated depreciation was $38.4 million and $47.5 million, respectively. See Note 2(f) to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we discontinued after implementation a product and wrote off $1.3 million of previously deferred software costs to loss on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we wrote off $6.3 million of 31 previously deferred costs, primarily internal labor costs, associated with internal use software development projects that were discontinued prior to being implemented, and such costs are included as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we replaced internal use software programs, which resulted in the write off to loss on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of the remaining net book value of $1.1 million. Income Taxes We have recorded a valuation allowance, amounting to $43.4 million as of December 31, 2007, to reduce our deferred tax assets, primarily associated with certain state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards, to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Additionally, we have federal alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of $11.8 million, which have no expiration date and are available to reduce future income taxes, if any, and foreign tax credits of $56.1 million, which begin to expire in 2016. Based on current expectations and plans, we expect to fully utilize our foreign tax credit carryforwards prior to their expiration. If actual results differ unfavorably from certain of our estimates used, we may not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred income tax assets and foreign tax credit carryforwards and additional valuation allowances may be required. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that our estimates reflected in the tax provisions and accruals will equal our actual results. These differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes" ("FIN 48"), an interpretation of SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("SFAS No. 109"), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN 48 also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position in accordance with FIN 48 is a two step process. The first step is a recognition process whereby the company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The second step is a measurement process whereby a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is calculated to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The provisions of FIN 48 are to be applied to all tax positions upon initial adoption of this standard. Only tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized or continue to be recognized upon adoption of FIN 48. The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of FIN 48 should be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for that fiscal year. We adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007 and, as a result, we recognized a $16.6 million increase in the reserve related to uncertain tax positions, which was accounted for as a reduction to the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings. Additionally, we grossed up deferred tax assets and the reserve related to uncertain tax positions in the amount of $7.9 million related to the federal tax benefit associated with certain state reserves. As of January 1, 2007, our reserve related to uncertain tax positions, which is included in other long term liabilities, amounted to $84.0 million. Of this amount, approximately $35.4 million, if settled favorably, would reduce our recorded goodwill balance, with the remainder being recognized as a reduction of income tax expense. We are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax 32 authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately $72.9 million of reserves related to uncertain tax positions. Of this amount, approximately $27.0 million, if settled favorably, would reduce our recorded goodwill balance, with the remainder being recognized as a reduction of income tax expense. Although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in favorable or unfavorable changes in our estimates. We have elected to recognize interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as a component of the provision for income taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. We recorded $0.2 million, $0.9 million and $1.2 million for interest and penalties for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. We have $4.3 million and $3.6 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties as of January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2007, respectively. We have not provided deferred taxes on book basis differences related to certain foreign subsidiaries because such basis differences are not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future and we intend to reinvest indefinitely outside the U.S. These basis differences arose primarily through the undistributed book earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The basis differences could be reversed through a sale of the subsidiaries, the receipt of dividends from subsidiaries as well as certain other events or actions on our part, which would result in an increase in our provision for income taxes. Stock Based Compensation As of January 1, 2003, we adopted the measurement provisions of SFAS No. 123, as amended by SFAS No. 148. As a result we began using the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation in our financial statements beginning January 1, 2003 using the prospective method. We adopted SFAS No. 123R effective January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective method. We record stock based compensation expense for the cost of stock options, restricted stock and shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123R. Stock based compensation expense, included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007 was $6.2 million ($4.8 million after tax or $0.02 per basic and diluted share), $12.4 million ($9.2 million after tax or $0.05 per basic and diluted share) and $13.9 million ($10.2 million after tax or $0.05 per basic and diluted shares), respectively. SFAS No. 123R also requires that the benefits associated with the tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow, reducing net operating cash flows and increasing net financing cash flows in future periods. The fair values of option, employee stock purchase and restricted stock grants are estimated on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model. Expected volatility and the expected term are the input factors to that model which require the most significant management judgment. Expected volatility is calculated utilizing daily historical volatility over a period that equates to the expected life of the option. The expected life (estimated period of time outstanding) is estimated using the historical exercise behavior of employees. Self Insured Liabilities We are self insured up to certain limits for costs associated with workers compensation claims, vehicle accidents, property and general business liabilities, and benefits paid under employee healthcare and short term disability programs. At December 31, 2006 and 2007 there were approximately $28.2 million and $33.5 million, respectively, of self insurance accruals reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. The measurement of these costs requires the consideration of historical cost experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim. We account for these costs 33 primarily through actuarial methods, which develop estimates of the undiscounted liability for claims incurred, including those claims incurred but not reported. These methods provide estimates of future ultimate claim costs based on claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. We believe the use of actuarial methods to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals. However, the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claims involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known. We believe our recorded obligations for these expenses are appropriate. Nevertheless, changes in healthcare costs, accident frequency and severity, and other factors can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("SFAS No. 157"). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements, and is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 157 to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In February 2008, the FASB delayed the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for all nonrecurring fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities until fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115" ("SFAS No. 159"). SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 159 to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), "Business Combinations" ("SFAS No. 141R"), and SFAS No. 160, "Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statement an amendment to ARB No. 51" ("SFAS No. 160"). SFAS No. 141R and No. 160 will require (a) more of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at fair value as of the acquisition date, (b) liabilities related to contingent consideration to be remeasured at fair value in each subsequent period, (c) an acquirer to expense as incurred acquisition related costs, such as transaction fees for attorneys, accountants and investment bankers, as well as, costs associated with restructuring the activities of the acquired company, and (d) noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries initially to be measured at fair value and classified as a separate component of equity. SFAS No. 141R is effective and provided for prospective application for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. SFAS No. 160 is required to apply retrospectively in comparative financial statements for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The impact of SFAS No. 141R and SFAS No. 160 is dependent upon the level of future acquisitions; however, they will generally result in (1) increased operating costs associated with the expensing of transaction and restructuring costs, as incurred, (2) increased volatility in earnings related to the fair valuing of contingent consideration through earnings in subsequent periods, and (3) increased depreciation, amortization and equity balances associated with the fair valuing of noncontrolling interests and their classification as a separate component of consolidated stockholders equity. 34  Results of Operations Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2007 to Year Ended December 31, 2006 and Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2006 to Year Ended December 31, 2005: Year Ended December 31, Dollar Change Percent Change 2006 2007 Revenues $ 2,350,342 $ 2,730,035 $ 379,693 16.2% Operating Expenses 1,943,155 2,275,317 332,162 17.1% Operating Income 407,187 454,718 47,531 11.7% Other Expenses, Net 278,324 301,624 23,300 8.4% Net Income $ 128,863 $ 153,094 $ 24,231 18.8% OIBDA(1) $ 615,560 $ 704,012 $ 88,452 14.4% OIBDA Margin(1) 26.2% 25.8% Year Ended December 31, Dollar Change Percent Change 2005 2006 Revenues $ 2,078,155 $ 2,350,342 $ 272,187 13.1% Operating Expenses 1,691,371 1,943,155 251,784 14.9% Operating Income 386,784 407,187 20,403 5.3% Other Expenses, Net 275,685 278,324 2,639 1.0% Net Income $ 111,099 $ 128,863 $ 17,764 16.0% OIBDA(1) $ 573,706 $ 615,560 $ 41,854 7.3% OIBDA Margin(1) 27.6% 26.2% (1)See "Non GAAP Measures Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization, or OIBDA" for definition, reconciliation and a discussion of why we believe these measures provide relevant and useful information to our current and potential investors. REVENUE Our consolidated storage revenues increased $171.9 million, or 13.0%, to $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 and $145.6 million, or 12.3%, to $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006, in comparison to the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase is attributable to internal revenue growth (8% during 2007 and 10% during 2006) resulting from solid net carton volume growth and the net result of pricing actions, acquisitions (2% during both 2007 and 2006), and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations (2% during 2007 and 0% during 2006). Consolidated service and storage material sales revenues increased $207.8 million, or 20.3%, to $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 and $126.6 million, or 14.1%, to $1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006, in comparison to the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase is attributable to internal revenue growth (12% during 2007 and 7% during 2006), which was driven primarily by strong project revenue growth in North America and Europe, strong growth of recycled paper revenues, and solid storage related services revenue growth, acquisitions (5% during 2007 and 7% during 2006), and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations (3% during 2007 and 0% during 2006). 35 For the reasons stated above, our consolidated revenues increased $379.7 million, or 16.2%, to $2.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 and $272.2 million, or 13.1%, to $2.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006, in comparison to the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Internal revenue growth was 8%, 9% and 10% for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. We calculate internal revenue growth in local currency for our international operations. Acquisitions contributed 5%, 4% and 3% for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2005, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that impacted our revenues were 1% and were primarily due to the strengthening of the British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and Euro against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. For the year ended December 31, 2006, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that impacted our revenues were less than 1% and were primarily due to the weakening of the British pound sterling and Euro, net of the strengthening of the Canadian dollar, against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. For the year ended December 31, 2007, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that impacted our revenues were 3% and were primarily due to the strengthening of the British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and Euro against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. Internal Growth Eight Quarter Trend 2006 2007 First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Storage Revenue 10% 11% 11% 10% 9% 9% 8% 8% Service and Storage Material Sales Revenue 8% 8% 3% 10% 10% 11% 16% 12% Total Revenue 10% 9% 7% 10% 9% 10% 12% 10% Our internal revenue growth rate represents the weighted average year over year growth rate of our revenues after removing the effects of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the impact of the fire in one of our London, England facilities. Over the past eight quarters, the internal growth rate of our storage revenues has decreased from the high end of our targeted range of 10% to 11% to the low end of our targeted range of 8% to 9%. Storage growth in our North American Physical Business remained within our targeted range and we continued to benefit from a positive pricing environment. Storage growth in our U.K. business was slightly below our targeted range due primarily to increased levels of destructions and permanent withdrawals. Strong growth rates in Latin America, Asia Pacific and in our digital services business further supported consolidated internal growth. Net carton volume growth is a function of the rate at which new cartons are added by existing and new customers, offset by the rate of carton destructions and other permanent removals. The internal growth rate for service and storage material sales revenue is inherently more volatile than the storage revenue internal growth rate due to the more discretionary nature of the services we offer, such as large special projects, data products and carton sales, and the price of recycled paper. These revenues are often event driven and impacted to a greater extent by economic downturns as customers defer or cancel the purchase of these services as a way to reduce their short term costs, and may often be difficult to replicate in future periods. As a commodity, recycled paper prices are subject to the volatility of that market. The internal growth rate for service and storage material sales revenues reflects the following: (1) growth in North American storage related service revenues, increased special project revenues and higher recycled paper revenues; (2) two large public sector contracts in Europe, one that was completed in the third quarter of 2007 and one that will be completed in 2008; (3) continued growth in 36 our secure shredding operations; and (4) a large data restoration project completed by our digital services business in the third quarter of 2005, which created a difficult comparable for the third quarter of 2006 growth rate. OPERATING EXPENSES Cost of Sales Consolidated cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization) is comprised of the following expenses (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, % of Consolidated Revenues Percent Change (Favorable)/ Unfavorable Dollar Change Percent Change 2006 2007 2006 2007 Labor $ 523,401 $ 615,059 $ 91,658 17.5% 22.3% 22.5% 0.2% Facilities 321,268 374,529 53,261 16.6% 13.7% 13.7% 0.0% Transportation 111,086 134,882 23,796 21.4% 4.7% 4.9% 0.2% Product Cost of Sales 49,853 54,483 4,630 9.3% 2.1% 2.0% (0.1)% Other 68,660 81,167 12,507 18.2% 2.9% 3.0% 0.1% $ 1,074,268 $ 1,260,120 $ 185,852 17.3% 45.7% 46.1% 0.4% Year Ended December 31, % of Consolidated Revenues Percent Change (Favorable)/ Unfavorable Dollar Change Percent Change 2005 2006 2005 2006 Labor $ 447,600 $ 523,401 $ 75,801 16.9% 21.5% 22.3% 0.8% Facilities 275,987 321,268 45,281 16.4% 13.3% 13.7% 0.4% Transportation 97,997 111,086 13,089 13.4% 4.7% 4.7% 0.0% Product Cost of Sales 51,254 49,853 (1,401 ) (2.7)% 2.5% 2.1% (0.4)% Other 65,401 68,660 3,259 5.0% 3.1% 2.9% (0.2)% $ 938,239 $ 1,074,268 $ 136,029 14.5% 45.1% 45.7% 0.6% Labor For the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, labor expense as a percentage of consolidated revenues increased. This is mainly a result of our recent shredding and DMS acquisitions in Europe and Latin America, which have a higher service revenue component and are therefore more labor intensive, offset by Asia Pacific labor decreasing as a percentage of revenue, as that business begins to scale, as well as the impact of an increasing percentage of revenue from our digital business which requires significantly less direct labor as a percentage of revenue compared to our larger physical businesses. For the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, labor expense as a percentage of consolidated revenue increased as a result of higher labor costs resulting from our Australia/New Zealand acquisition and our shredding acquisitions in Europe, which have a higher service revenue component and are therefore more labor intensive. Our digital business had higher costs of labor associated with internal information technology personnel and consultants dedicated to revenue producing projects. 37 Facilities Facilities costs as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, remained unchanged at 13.7%. The largest component of our facilities cost is rent expense, which increased in dollar terms by $26.2 million while staying unchanged as a percentage of consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in rent is mainly driven by the timing of new real estate, which may include duplicative rent and the use of temporary space related to moving out of substandard facilities obtained through acquisitions. Facilities costs as a percentage of consolidated revenues was also affected by increases in maintenance, property taxes and insurance, offset by decreases in utilities and security costs. The expansion of our secure shredding operations, which incurs lower facilities costs than our core physical business, helps to lower our facilities costs as a percentage of consolidated revenues. Facilities costs as a percentage of consolidated revenues increased to 13.7% for the year ended December 31, 2006 from 13.3% for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in facilities costs as a percentage of consolidated revenues was primarily a result of increases in utilities and maintenance costs, as well as, increased insurance deductibles and security costs associated with protecting our assets, as a response to the fires in Ottawa, Canada and London, England. Rent expense decreased slightly as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 as a result of a decrease in overall base rent per square foot in our North American operations when comparing 2005 to 2006. Rent expense increased in dollar terms by $17.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Transportation Our transportation expenses, which are influenced by several variables including total number of vehicles, owned versus leased vehicles, use of subcontracted couriers, fuel expenses, maintenance and insurance, increased as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. The use of couriers and leased vehicles, rising gas prices, as well as shredding revenue growing at a faster rate than storage revenue, contributed to this increase. Our transportation expenses remained consistent as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Higher fuel costs, increased maintenance expenses resulting from the accelerated implementation of a fleet wide maintenance program in North America and vehicle leasing expenses were primarily responsible for the dollar increase in transportation expenses. Product Cost of Sales and Other Product and other cost of sales, which includes cartons, media and other service and storage costs, are highly correlated to complementary revenue streams, and as a result remained largely unchanged as a percentage of consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Product cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 were slightly higher in dollar terms compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 due to a corresponding increase in related carton, media and services revenues. Product cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 due to a corresponding reduction in revenues. 38 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses are comprised of the following expenses (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, % of Consolidated Revenues Percent Change (Favorable)/ Unfavorable Dollar Change Percent Change 2006 2007 2006 2007 General and Administrative $ 331,021 $ 382,727 $ 51,706 15.6% 14.1% 14.0% (0.1)% Sales, Marketing & Account Management 214,007 249,966 35,959 16.8% 9.1% 9.2% 0.1% Information Technology 122,211 135,788 13,577 11.1% 5.2% 5.0% (0.2)% Bad Debt Expense 2,835 2,894 59 2.1% 0.1% 0.1% 0.0% $ 670,074 $ 771,375 $ 101,301 15.1% 28.5% 28.3% (0.2)% Year Ended December 31, % of Consolidated Revenues Percent Change (Favorable)/ Unfavorable Dollar Change Percent Change 2005 2006 2005 2006 General and Administrative $ 285,558 $ 331,021 $ 45,463 15.9% 13.7% 14.1% 0.4% Sales, Marketing & Account Management 180,558 214,007 33,449 18.5% 8.7% 9.1% 0.4% Information Technology 99,177 122,211 23,034 23.2% 4.8% 5.2% 0.4% Bad Debt Expense 4,402 2,835 (1,567 ) (35.6)% 0.2% 0.1% (0.1)% $ 569,695 $ 670,074 $ 100,379 17.6% 27.4% 28.5% 1.1% General and Administrative The slight decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 is mainly attributable to overhead leverage, which offset increased incentive compensation expense and start up costs related to certain international joint ventures. The increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 is mainly attributable to (a) increased compensation expense due to expansion through acquisitions, (b) costs associated with our North American reorganization which added a new level of field management, and (c) costs associated with a North American field operations meeting held in 2006 that was not held in 2005. Sales, Marketing & Account Management The majority of our sales, marketing and account management costs are labor related and are primarily driven by the headcount in each of these departments. Compensation and commissions are the most significant components of sales, marketing and account management expenses. Our average sales force headcount increased during 2007 as compared to 2006. In addition, we increased discretionary training and marketing during that period. Offsetting those increases in expenditures were changes to commission based compensation plans, which resulted in lower costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Increased headcount and related compensation and commissions are the most significant contributors to the increase in sales, marketing expenses and account management for the years ended 39 December 31, 2006 and 2005. Throughout the years ended December 31, 2005 and into 2006, we invested in the expansion and improvement of our sales, marketing and account management functions. During 2006 in North America, while our sales force headcount increased at a slower rate than revenue growth, the shift to higher end resources drove an increase in the level of spending due to higher costs per sales person and the additional support required. We have significantly increased the size of our digital sales force through our acquisition of LiveVault and the hiring of new sales employees, particularly in Europe. Additionally, costs associated with an enterprise wide sales meeting held in 2006 and not held in 2005 also contributed to this increase. Our larger North American sales force generated a $6.3 million increase in sales commissions and an increase of $13.6 million of compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Information Technology Information technology expenses decreased as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to a write off of $5.9 million of previously deferred costs, primarily internal labor costs, associated with internal use software development projects that were discontinued prior to being implemented in 2006 and did not repeat in 2007. The dollar increase in information technology expenses is due to compensation expense, consulting fees and communication costs which are correlated to our increase in revenues. Information technology expenses increased as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 due to increases in technology development activities within our digital services business, including the acquisition of LiveVault and associated research and development activities and increased spending to support our growing digital archiving business. Additionally, during 2006, we wrote off $5.9 million of previously deferred costs, primarily internal labor costs, associated with internal use software development projects that were discontinued prior to being implemented. Higher utilization of existing information technology resources to revenue producing projects, which are charged to costs of goods sold and decreased information technology spending in our European operations, partially offset this increase. Depreciation, Amortization, and (Gain) and Loss on Disposal/Writedown of Property, Plant and Equipment, Net Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased $40.9 million to $249.3 million (9.1% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $208.4 million (8.9% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2006. Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased $21.5 million to $208.4 million (8.9% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $187.0 million (9.0% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2005. Depreciation expense increased $34.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, and increased $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily due to the additional depreciation expense related to recent capital expenditures and acquisitions, including storage systems, which include racking, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and software, and buildings, as well as accelerated depreciation on buildings we have chosen to exit. Amortization expense increased $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, and increased $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily due to amortization of intangible assets, such as customer relationship intangible assets and intellectual property acquired through business combinations. We expect that amortization expense will continue to increase as we acquire new businesses and reflect the full year impact of our 2007 acquisitions. 40 Consolidated gain on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, consisted primarily of a gain related to insurance proceeds from our property claim of $7.7 million associated with the July 2006 fire in one of our London, England facilities, net of a $1.3 million write off of previously deferred software costs in our North American Physical Business associated with a discontinued product after implementation. Consolidated gain on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, consisted primarily of a gain on the sale of a property in the U.K. of $10.5 million offset by disposals and writedowns. Consolidated gain on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, consisted primarily of a gain on the sale of a property in the U.K. of $4.5 million offset primarily by software asset writedowns of $1.1 million. OPERATING INCOME As a result of all the foregoing factors, consolidated operating income increased $47.5 million, or 11.7%, to $454.7 million (16.7% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $407.2 million (17.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2006. Consolidated operating income increased $20.4 million, or 5.3%, to $407.2 million (17.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $386.8 million (18.6% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2005. OIBDA As a result of all the foregoing factors, consolidated OIBDA increased $88.5 million, or 14.4%, to $704.0 million (25.8% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $615.6 million (26.2% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2006. Consolidated OIBDA increased $41.9 million, or 7.3%, to $615.6 million (26.2% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $573.7 million (27.6% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2005. OTHER EXPENSES, NET Interest Expense, Net Consolidated interest expense, net increased $33.6 million to $228.6 million (8.4% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $195.0 million (8.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2006 due to increased borrowings to fund acquisitions, offset by a decrease in our weighted average interest rate from 7.5% as of December 31, 2006 to 7.4% as of December 31, 2007. In addition, as a result of the repayment of IMEs revolving credit facility and term loans with borrowings in the U.S., we had an increase of approximately $4.1 million in consolidated interest expense in the second quarter of 2007. This is a result of the difference in our calendar reporting period and that of IME which is two months in arrears, and had no impact on cash flows. Consolidated interest expense, net increased $11.4 million to $195.0 million (8.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $183.6 million (8.8% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2005. The change is primarily due to increased borrowings to fund out 2005 and 2006 acquisitions, particularly LiveVault and Pickfords Records Management ("Pickfords"). 41 Other (Income) Expense, Net (in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2006 2007 Change Foreign currency transaction (gains) losses, net $ (12,534 ) $ 11,311 $ 23,845 Debt extinguishment expense 2,972 5,703 2,731 Other, net (2,427 ) (13,913 ) (11,486 ) $ (11,989 ) $ 3,101 $ 15,090 Year Ended December 31, 2005 2006 Change Foreign currency transaction (gains) losses, net $ 7,201 $ (12,534 ) $ (19,735 ) Debt extinguishment expense 2,972 2,972 Other, net (1,019 ) (2,427 ) (1,408 ) $ 6,182 $ (11,989 ) $ (18,171 ) Foreign currency transaction losses, net of $11.3 million based on period end exchange rates were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily due to the strengthening of the Euro and Canadian dollar, offset by the strengthening of the British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar compared to December 31, 2006, as these currencies relate to our intercompany balances with and between our Canadian and European subsidiaries, and British pounds sterling and Euro denominated debt held by our U.S. parent company. Foreign currency gains of $12.5 million based on period end exchange rates were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to the strengthening of the British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar compared to December 31, 2005, as these currencies relate to our intercompany balances with our U.K. subsidiaries, borrowings denominated in certain foreign currencies under our revolving credit facility and British pounds sterling denominated debt held by our U.S. parent company. Foreign currency losses of $7.2 million based on period end exchange rates were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily due to the weakening of the British pound sterling and Euro, net of the strengthening of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar compared to December 31, 2004, as these currencies relate to our intercompany balances with and between our Canadian, U.K. and European subsidiaries, borrowings denominated in foreign currencies under our revolving credit facility and British pounds sterling denominated debt held by our U.S. parent company. Other, net increased by $11.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2007 over the same period in 2006 primarily as a result of business interruption insurance proceeds of $12.9 million pertaining to the July 2006 fire in one of our London, England facilities. During 2007, we wrote off $5.7 million of deferred financing costs related to the early extinguishment of U.S. and U.K. term loans and revolving credit facilities. During 2006, we redeemed or purchased a portion of our outstanding 81/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011 and 85/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013 resulting in a charge of $2.8 million, which consists of tender premiums and transaction costs, deferred financing costs, as well as original issue discounts and premiums. 42 Provision for Income Taxes Our effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006, and 2007 were 41.4%, 41.8% and 30.9%, respectively. The primary reconciling items between the statutory rate of 35% and our effective rate are state income taxes (net of federal benefit) and differences in the rates of tax to which our foreign earnings are subject. Our 2007 effective tax rate reflects the positive impact of our recent global treasury program of approximately 8.2%. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2007, our effective tax rate was reduced by approximately 2.7% as a result of foreign currency gains and losses, which were incurred in different tax jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate is subject to future variability due to, among other items: (a) changes in the mix of income from foreign jurisdictions; (b) tax law changes; (c) volatility in foreign exchange gains and (losses); and (d) the timing of the establishment and reversal of tax reserves. We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. Although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in changes in our estimates. Minority Interest Minority interest in earnings of subsidiaries, net resulted in a charge to income of $1.7 million (0.1% of consolidated revenues), $1.6 million (0.1% of consolidated revenues) and $0.9 million (less than 0.1% of consolidated revenues) for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006, and 2007, respectively. This represents our minority partners share of earnings in our majority owned international subsidiaries that are consolidated in our operating results. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations" ("FIN 47"), an interpretation of SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" ("SFAS No. 143"). FIN 47 clarifies that conditional asset retirement obligations meet the definition of liabilities and should be recognized when incurred if their fair values can be reasonably estimated. Uncertainty surrounding the timing and method of settlement that may be conditional on events occurring in the future are factored into the measurement of the liability rather than the existence of the liability. SFAS No. 143 established accounting and reporting standards for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets legally required by law, regulatory rule or contractual agreement and the associated asset retirement costs. SFAS No. 143 requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset, which is then depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. The liability is increased over time through income as a component of depreciation expense, such that the liability will equate to the future cost to retire the long lived asset at the expected retirement date. Upon settlement of the liability, an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement. Our obligations are primarily the result of requirements under our facility lease agreements which generally have "return to original condition" clauses which would require us to remove or restore items such as shred pits, vaults, demising walls and office build outs, among others. As of December 31, 2005, we have recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying FIN 47 as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle as prescribed in FIN 47, which resulted in a gross charge of $4.4 million ($2.8 million, net of tax) in 2005. 43 NET INCOME As a result of all the foregoing factors, for the year ended December 31, 2007, consolidated net income increased $24.2 million, or 18.8%, to $153.1 million (5.6% of consolidated revenues) from net income of $128.9 million (5.5% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2006. For the year ended December 31, 2006, consolidated net income increased $17.8 million, or 16.0%, to $128.9 million (5.5% of consolidated revenues) from net income of $111.1 million (5.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2005.

North American Physical Business Years Ended Dollar Increase Percentage Increase December 31, 2005 December 31, 2006 December 31, 2007 from 2005 to 2006 from 2006 to 2007 from 2005 to 2006 from 2006 to 2007 Segment Revenue $ 1,529,612 $ 1,671,009 $ 1,890,068 $ 141,397 $ 219,059 9.2 % 13.1 % Segment Contribution(1) $ 444,343 $ 478,653 $ 539,027 $ 34,310 $ 60,374 7.7 % 12.6 % Segment Contribution(1) as a Percentage of Revenue 29.0% 28.6% 28.5% Depreciation and Amortization excluded from the Calculation of Segment Contribution(1) $ 118,493 $ 127,562 $ 154,898 (1)See Note 9 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for definition of Contribution and for the basis on which allocations are made and a reconciliation of Contribution to income before provision for income taxes and minority interest on a consolidated basis. During the year ended December 31, 2007, revenue in our North American Physical Business segment increased 13.1%, primarily due to stable storage internal growth rates, continued strength in special projects, higher recycled paper revenues, and acquisitions, primarily ArchivesOne, which contributed $32.0 million or approximately 2%. In addition, favorable currency fluctuations during the year ended December 31, 2007 in Canada resulted in increased revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, of 44 0.6% when compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue decreased slightly in the year ended December 31, 2007 due mainly to increased occupancy costs such as insurance and maintenance, and higher costs associated with the acquisition of new real estate and moving out of substandard facilities obtained through acquisitions, offset by strong service revenue growth and overhead leverage. During the year ended December 31, 2006, revenue in our North American Physical Business segment increased 9.2% primarily due to increasing storage internal growth rates resulting from stable net volume growth and an increasingly positive pricing environment, increasing service revenue growth rates particularly in data protection and fulfillment, growth of our secure shredding operations, and acquisitions. In addition, favorable currency fluctuations during the year ended December 31, 2006 in Canada increased revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, by $9.8 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue decreased in the year ended December 31, 2006 due mainly to (a) higher transportation costs, primarily fuel and rental costs associated with a larger fleet of leased vehicles, and the accelerated implementation of a fleet wide maintenance program in North America, (b) increased facility costs, primarily utilities, maintenance and insurance, (c) increased investment in sales, marketing and account management primarily related to a shift in hiring more experienced personnel at a higher cost, (d) costs associated with the North American reorganization, including a new level of field management, and (e) costs associated with our enterprise wide sales meeting and a field operations meeting, both held in 2006 but not in 2005. Included in our North American Physical Business segment are certain costs related to staff functions, including finance, human resources and information technology, which benefit the enterprise as a whole. These costs are primarily related to the general management of these functions on a corporate level and the design and development of programs, policies and procedures that are then implemented in the individual segments, with each segment bearing its own cost of implementation. Management has decided to allocate these costs to the North American segment as further allocation is impracticable. International Physical Business Years Ended Dollar Increase Percentage Increase December 31, 2005 December 31, 2006 December 31, 2007 from 2005 to 2006 from 2006 to 2007 from 2005 to 2006 from 2006 to 2007 Segment Revenue $ 435,106 $ 539,335 $ 676,749 $ 104,229 $ 137,414 24.0% 25.5% Segment Contribution(1) $ 113,417 $ 117,568 $ 135,714 $ 4,151 $ 18,146 3.7% 15.4% Segment Contribution(1) as a Percentage of Revenue 26.1% 21.8% 20.1% Depreciation and Amortization excluded from the Calculation of Segment Contribution(1) $ 43,285 $ 54,803 $ 67,135 (1)See Note 9 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for definition of Contribution and for the basis on which allocations are made and a reconciliation of Contribution to income before provision for income taxes and minority interest on a consolidated basis. Revenue in our International Physical Business segment increased 25.5% during the year ended December 31, 2007, due to internal growth of 12%, and acquisitions in Europe and Latin America. Further, favorable currency fluctuations during the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily in Europe, resulted in increased revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, of approximately 10% compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue decreased in the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily due to the acquisition of lower margin shredding and document management solutions businesses in Europe and Latin America, 45 the impact of start up costs in certain international joint ventures and the loss of gross margin associated with the July, 2006 fire in one of our London, England facilities. Offsetting these decreases in contribution as a percent of segment revenue were higher margin special projects, in particular two large public sector contracts in Europe, one that was completed in the third quarter of 2007 and one that will be completed in 2008. Revenue in our International Physical Business segment increased 24.0% during the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to acquisitions, which contributed $92.0 million or 18.6%. This was partially offset by net unfavorable currency fluctuations in Europe and Latin America of $6.3 million or 1.5% during the year ended December 31, 2006. The balance of the increase in revenue represents internal growth. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue decreased primarily due to the acquisition of two shredding businesses in the U.K. that operate at lower margins, the acquisition of Pickfords, and costs associated with the fire in one of our London, England facilities. Worldwide Digital Business Years Ended Dollar Increase Percentage Increase December 31, 2005 December 31, 2006 December 31, 2007 from 2005 to 2006 from 2006 to 2007 from 2005 to 2006 from 2006 to 2007 Segment Revenue $ 113,437 $ 139,998 $ 163,218 $ 26,561 $ 23,220 23.4% 16.6% Segment Contribution(1) $ 12,461 $ 9,779 $ 23,799 $ (2,682 ) $ 14,020 (21.5)% 143.4% Segment Contribution(1) as a Percentage of Revenue 11.0% 7.0% 14.6% Depreciation and Amortization excluded from the Calculation of Segment Contribution(1) $ 25,144 $ 26,008 $ 27,261 (1)See Note 9 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for definition of Contribution and for the basis on which allocations are made and a reconciliation of Contribution to income before provision for income taxes and minority interest on a consolidated basis. During the year ended December 31, 2007, revenue in our Worldwide Digital Business segment increased 16.6%, due primarily to strong internal growth of 14% and the acquisition of Stratify in December 2007. The increase is primarily attributable to growth in digital storage revenue from our online backup service offerings for both personal computers and remote servers, and growth in storage of email archiving. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue increased due to the full benefit of the integration of the LiveVault acquisition and the write off of $5.9 million of previously deferred costs, primarily internal labor costs, associated with internal use software development projects that were discontinued prior to being implemented in 2006 and did not repeat in 2007, which offset the impact of increases in engineering headcount. During the year ended December 31, 2006, revenue in our Worldwide Digital Business segment increased 23.4% primarily due to internal growth of 16%, primarily attributable to growth in digital storage revenue and our online backup service offerings for both personal computer and server data. The internal growth rate of our digital business was offset by a large data restoration project in the third quarter of 2005, which was not repeated in 2006 but drove the increase in the digital storage growth rate beginning in the fourth quarter of 2005. The acquisition of LiveVault in December 2005 contributed approximately $12 million in revenue during the year ended December 31, 2006. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue decreased primarily due to the acquisition of LiveVault, increased investment in the European sales force, increases in information technology costs, including the write off of $5.9 million of previously deferred costs, primarily internal labor costs, associated with internal use software development projects that were discontinued, and the benefit of a large data 46 restoration project in the third quarter of 2005. This decrease was offset by higher absorption of fixed costs as a result of increased revenues and a reduction in royalty payments. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following is a summary of our cash balances and cash flows (in thousands) as of and for the years ended December 31, 2005 2006 2007 Cash flows provided by operating activities $ 377,176 $ 374,282 $ 484,644 Cash flows used in investing activities (436,175 ) (466,714 ) (866,635 ) Cash flows provided by financing activities 81,449 82,734 457,005 Cash and cash equivalents at the end of year 53,413 45,369 125,607 Net cash provided by operating activities was $484.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $374.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in operating income, including $12.9 million of business interruption insurance income related to the fire in one of our London, England facilities, and non cash items, such as depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, early extinguishment of debt, and foreign currency gains and losses, and the net change in operating assets and liabilities, exclusive of acquisitions. Due to the nature of our businesses, we make significant capital expenditures and additions to customer acquisition costs. Our capital expenditures are primarily related to growth and include investments in storage systems, information systems and discretionary investments in real estate. Cash paid for our capital expenditures and additions to customer acquisition costs during the year ended December 31, 2007 amounted to $386.4 million and $16.4 million, respectively. From time to time and in the normal course of business we sell certain fixed assets, primarily real estate. In the year ended December 31, 2007, we received $19.6 million of net proceeds from the sales of assets, including proceeds associated with our property claim from our insurer related to the fire in one of our London, England facilities of $17.8 million. For the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2007, capital expenditures, net and additions to customer acquisition costs were funded primarily with cash flows provided by operating activities. Excluding acquisitions, we expect our capital expenditures to be between $440 million and $480 million in the year ending December 31, 2008. Included in our estimated capital expenditures for 2008 is $40 million to $50 million of opportunity driven real estate purchases. In the year ended December 31, 2007, we paid net cash consideration of $481.5 million for acquisitions, most notably the ArchivesOne and RMS acquisitions in our U.S. records and information management business and Stratify in our digital business. We also acquired a number of small records management and shredding businesses in North America and Europe. Cash flows provided from operating activities, borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, the proceeds from the sale of senior subordinated notes, and cash equivalents on hand funded these acquisitions. Net cash provided by financing activities was $457.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we had gross borrowings under our revolving credit and term loan facilities and other debt of $2.3 billion, $435.8 million of proceeds from the sale of senior subordinated notes, $21.8 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plan, $6.8 million of excess tax benefits from stock based compensation, and $2.5 million investment by a minority partner in one of our joint ventures. We used the proceeds from these financing transactions to repay revolving credit and term loan facilities and other debt ($2.3 billion), to repay debt financing from minority stockholders, net ($0.5 million), for payment of deferred financing costs of ($8.1 million) and to fund acquisitions. 47 We are highly leveraged and expect to continue to be highly leveraged for the foreseeable future. Our consolidated debt as of December 31, 2007 was comprised of the following (in thousands): Revolving Credit Facility(1) $ 394,156 Term Loan Facility(1) 408,500 81/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011(2) 71,809 85/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013(2) 447,981 71/4% GBP Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014(2) 299,595 73/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2015(2) 437,680 65/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016(2) 316,047 71/2% CAD Senior Subordinated Notes due 2017 (the "Subsidiary Notes")(3) 178,395 83/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018(2) 200,000 8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018(2) 49,692 63/4% Euro Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018(2) 372,719 Real Estate Mortgages, Seller Notes and Other 89,714 Total Long term Debt 3,266,288 Less Current Portion (33,440 ) Long term Debt, Net of Current Portion $ 3,232,848 (1)The capital stock or other equity interests of most of our U.S. subsidiaries, and up to 66% of the capital stock or other equity interests of our first tier foreign subsidiaries, are pledged to secure these debt instruments, together with all intercompany obligations of foreign subsidiaries owed to us or to one of our U.S. subsidiary guarantors. (2)Collectively referred to as the Parent Notes. Iron Mountain Incorporated ("IMI") is the direct obligor on the Parent Notes, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior subordinated basis, by substantially all of its direct and indirect wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries (the "Guarantors"). These guarantees are joint and several obligations of the Guarantors. Iron Mountain Canada Corporation ("Canada Company") and the remainder of our subsidiaries do not guarantee the Parent Notes. (3)Canada Company is the direct obligor on the Subsidiary Notes, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior subordinated basis, by IMI and the Guarantors. These guarantees are joint and several obligations of IMI and the Guarantors. Our revolving credit and term loan facilities, as well as our indentures, use earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") based calculations as primary measures of financial performance, including leverage ratios. IMIs revolving credit and term leverage ratio was 4.4 and 4.5 as of December 31, 2006 and 2007, respectively, compared to a maximum allowable ratio of 5.5. Similarly, our bond leverage ratio, per the indentures, was 4.6 and 5.1 as of December 31, 2006 and 2007, respectively, compared to a maximum allowable ratio of 6.5. Noncompliance with these leverage ratios would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity. Our bond leverage ratio decreased from 5.7 as of September 30, 2007 to 5.1 as of December 31, 2007 due to the designation as Excluded Restricted Subsidiaries, as defined in the indentures, of our subsidiaries that own our assets and conduct our operations in the United Kingdom. As a result of such designation, these subsidiaries are now subject to substantially all of the covenants of the indentures, except that they are not required to provide a guarantee, and the EBITDA of these subsidiaries is included for purposes of calculating the leverage ratio. Our ability to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, working capital levels and capital structure, which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors which may be beyond our control. There 48 can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future financings will be available on acceptable terms or in amounts sufficient to enable us to service or refinance our indebtedness, or to make necessary capital expenditures. In January 2007, we completed an underwritten public offering of 225 million Euro in aggregate principal amount of our 63/4% Euro Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018, which were issued at a price of 98.99% of par and priced to yield 6.875%. Our net proceeds were 219.2 million Euro ($289.1 million), after paying the underwriters discounts and commissions and estimated expenses (excluding accrued interest payable by purchasers of the notes from October 17, 2006). These net proceeds were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under our old IMI term loan and revolving credit facilities. In March 2007, one of our Canadian subsidiaries, Iron Mountain Nova Scotia Funding Company, which was subsequently party to an amalgamation under which Canada Company was the continuing company, issued, in a private placement, 175 million CAD in aggregate principal amount of the Subsidiary Notes, which were issued at par and subsequently exchanged for publicly registered notes in the U.S., on July 27, 2007. The net proceeds of $146.8 million, after sales commissions, were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under our old IMI term loan facility. On April 16, 2007, we entered into a new credit agreement (the "New Credit Agreement") to replace both the IMI revolving credit and term loan facilities of $750 million and the IME revolving credit and term loan facilities of 200 million British pounds sterling. On November 9, 2007, we increased the aggregate amount available to be borrowed under the New Credit Agreement from $900 million to $1.2 billion. The New Credit Agreement consists of revolving credit facilities where we can borrow, subject to certain limitations as defined in the New Credit Agreement, up to an aggregate amount of $790 million (including Canadian dollar and multi currency revolving credit facilities) (the "new revolving credit facility"), and a $410 million term loan facility (the "new term loan facility"). Our subsidiaries, Canada Company and Iron Mountain Switzerland GmbH, may borrow directly under the Canadian revolving credit and multi currency revolving credit facilities, respectively. Additional subsidiary borrowers may be added under the multi currency revolving credit facility. The new revolving credit facility terminates on April 16, 2012. With respect to the new term loan facility, quarterly loan payments of approximately $1.0 million are required through maturity on April 16, 2014, at which time the remaining outstanding principal balance of the new term loan facility is due. The interest rate on borrowings under the New Credit Agreement varies depending on our choice of interest rate and currency options, plus an applicable margin. IMI guarantees the obligations of each of the subsidiary borrowers under the New Credit Agreement, and substantially all of our U.S. subsidiaries guarantee the obligations of IMI and the subsidiary borrowers. The capital stock or other equity interests of most of our U.S. subsidiaries, and up to 66% of the capital stock or other equity interests of our first tier foreign subsidiaries, are pledged to secure the New Credit Agreement, together with all intercompany obligations of foreign subsidiaries owed to us or to one of our U.S. subsidiary guarantors. We recorded a charge to other expense (income), net of approximately $5.7 million in 2007 related to the early retirement of the old IMI and IME revolving credit facilities and term loans, representing the write off of deferred financing costs. As of December 31, 2007, we had $394.2 million of outstanding borrowings under the new revolving credit facility, of which $149.5 million was denominated in U.S. dollars and the remaining balance was denominated in Canadian dollars (CAD 240.0 million); we also had various outstanding letters of credit totaling $34.5 million. The remaining availability, based on IMIs leverage ratio, which is calculated based on the last 12 months earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, other adjustments as defined in the New Credit Agreement and current external debt, under the new revolving credit facility on December 31, 2007, was $361.3 million. The interest rate in effect under the new revolving credit facility and new term loan facility ranged from 6.8% to 8.3% and 6.2% to 7.1%, respectively, as of December 31, 2007. 49 The New Credit Agreement, our indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to complete acquisitions, pay cash dividends, incur indebtedness, make investments, sell assets and take certain other corporate actions. The covenants do not contain a rating trigger. Therefore, a change in our debt rating would not trigger a default under the New Credit Agreement and our indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness. We were in compliance with all debt covenants in material agreements as of December 31, 2007. In the second quarter of 2007, we completed the acquisition of ArchivesOne, a leading provider of records and information management services in the United States. ArchivesOne has 31 facilities located in 17 major metropolitan markets in 10 states and the District of Columbia. The purchase price for ArchivesOne was $200.3 million. We funded this acquisition with cash and cash equivalents on hand and borrowings under the New Credit Agreement. In September 2007, we acquired RMS for $45.4 million in cash. RMS, a leading provider of outsourced file room services, offers hospitals comprehensive, next generation file room and film library management solutions. In December 2007, we acquired Stratify for $130.0 million in cash (net of cash acquired) and $22.8 million in fair value of options issued to augment our suite of eDiscovery services, providing businesses with a complete, end to end eDiscovery solution. Stratify, a leader in advanced electronic discovery services for the legal market, offers in depth discovery and data investigation solutions for AmLaw 200 law firms and leading Fortune 500 corporations. Stratify is based in Mountain View, California. We funded this acquisition with cash and cash equivalents on hand and borrowings under the New Credit Agreement. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2007 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 Years Capital Lease Obligations $ 53,689 $ 6,491 $ 5,020 $ 14,119 $ 28,059 Long Term Debt Obligations (excluding Capital Lease Obligations) 3,213,272 26,948 14,016 477,657 2,694,651 Interest Payments(1) 1,684,347 235,179 469,546 441,457 538,165 Operating Lease Obligations 3,058,482 209,091 389,871 366,877 2,092,643 Purchase and Asset Retirement Obligations(2) 76,028 25,385 34,869 7,854 7,920 Total(3) $ 8,085,818 $ 503,094 $ 913,322 $ 1,307,964 $ 5,361,438 (1)Amounts include variable rate interest payments, which are calculated utilizing the applicable interest rates as of December 31, 2007; see Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (2)In addition, in connection with some of our acquisitions, we have potential earn out obligations that may be payable in the event businesses we acquired meet certain operational objectives. These payments are based on the future results of these operations, and our estimate of the maximum contingent earn out payments we may be required to make under all such agreements as of December 31, 2007 is approximately $24.3 million. 50 (3)The table above excludes $72.9 million in uncertain tax positions as we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities. We expect to meet our cash flow requirements for the next twelve months from cash generated from operations, existing cash, cash equivalents, borrowings under the New Credit Agreement and other financings, which may include secured credit facilities, securitizations and mortgage or capital lease financings. We expect to meet our long term cash flow requirements using the same means described above, as well as the potential issuance of debt or equity securities as we deem appropriate. See Note 4, 7, and 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Regulation S K Item 303(a)(4)(ii). Net Operating Loss, Alternative Minimum Tax and Foreign Tax Credit Carryforwards We have federal net operating loss carryforwards which begin to expire in 2019 through 2022 of $78.9 million at December 31, 2007 to reduce future federal taxable income, if any. We also have an asset for state net operating loss of $24.7 million (net of federal tax benefit), which begins to expire in 2008 through 2025, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 98%. Additionally, we have federal alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of $11.8 million, which have no expiration date and are available to reduce future income taxes, if any, and foreign tax credits of $56.1 million, which begin to expire in 2016. Inflation Certain of our expenses, such as wages and benefits, insurance, occupancy costs and equipment repair and replacement, are subject to normal inflationary pressures. Although to date we have been able to offset inflationary cost increases through increased operating efficiencies and the negotiation of favorable long term real estate leases, we can give no assurance that we will be able to offset any future inflationary cost increases through similar efficiencies, leases or increased storage or service charges. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Interest Rate Risk Given the recurring nature of our revenues and the long term nature of our asset base, we have the ability and the preference to use long term, fixed interest rate debt to finance our business, thereby helping to preserve our long term returns on invested capital. We target approximately 75% of our debt portfolio to be fixed with respect to interest rates. Occasionally, we will use interest rate swaps as a tool to maintain our targeted level of fixed rate debt. See Notes 3 and 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2007, we had $829.8 million of variable rate debt outstanding with a weighted average variable interest rate of 6.8%, and $2,436.5 million of fixed rate debt outstanding. As of December 31, 2007, 75% of our total debt outstanding was fixed. If the weighted average variable interest rate on our variable rate debt had increased by 1%, our net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 would have been reduced by $5.4 million. See Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K for a discussion of our long term indebtedness, including the fair values of such indebtedness as of December 31, 2007. 51 Currency Risk Our investments in IME, Canada Company, Iron Mountain Mexico, SA de RL de CV, Iron Mountain South America, Ltd., Iron Mountain Australia Pty Ltd., Iron Mountain New Zealand Ltd. and our other international investments may be subject to risks and uncertainties related to fluctuations in currency valuation. Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. However, our international revenues and expenses are generated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate, primarily the Euro, Canadian dollar and British pound sterling. Declines in the value of the local currencies in which we are paid relative to the U.S. dollar will cause revenues in U.S. dollar terms to decrease and dollar denominated liabilities to increase in local currency. The impact on our earnings is mitigated significantly by the fact that most operating and other expenses are also incurred and paid in the local currency. We also have several intercompany obligations between our foreign subsidiaries and IMI and our U.S. based subsidiaries. In addition Iron Mountain Switzerland GmbH and our foreign subsidiaries and IME also have intercompany obligations between them. These intercompany obligations are primarily denominated in the local currency of the foreign subsidiary. We have adopted and implemented a number of strategies to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in currency valuations. One strategy is to finance our largest international subsidiaries with local debt that is denominated in local currencies, thereby providing a natural hedge. In determining the amount of any such financing, we take into account local tax strategies among other factors. Another strategy we utilize is for IMI to borrow in foreign currencies to hedge our intercompany financing activities. Finally, on occasion, we enter into currency swaps to temporarily or permanently hedge an overseas investment, such as a major acquisition to lock in certain transaction economics. We have implemented these strategies for our four foreign investments in the U.K., Continental Europe, Canada and Asia Pacific. Specifically, through our 150 million British pounds sterling denominated 71/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 and our 255 million 63/4% Euro Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018, we effectively hedge most of our outstanding intercompany loans denominated in British pounds sterling and Euros. Canada Company has financed its capital needs through direct borrowings in Canadian dollars under the New Credit Agreement and its 175 million CAD denominated 71/2% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2017. This creates a tax efficient natural currency hedge. To fund the acquisition of Pickfords in Australia and New Zealand in December 2005, IMI borrowed Australian and New Zealand dollars under its multi currency revolving credit facility. These borrowings provided a natural hedge against the intercompany loans created at the time of the acquisition. Subsequently, we repaid such borrowings under our multi currency revolving credit facility and, contemporaneously in September 2006, we entered into forward contracts to exchange U.S. dollars for 55 million in Australian dollars ("AUD") and 20.2 million in New Zealand dollars ("NZD") to hedge our intercompany exposure in these countries. In addition, in January, 2007 we entered into forward contracts to exchange 124.4 million U.S. dollars for 96 million Euros and 194 million CAD for 127.5 million Euros to hedge our intercompany exposures with Canada and our subsidiaries whose functional currency is the Euro. In March 2007, in conjunction with the issuance of CAD denominated senior subordinated notes, the CAD for Euro swap was not renewed and was replaced with additional U.S. for Euro swaps. These forward contracts were not renewed in the third quarter of 2007. In the third quarter of 2007, we designated a portion of our 63/4% Euro Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018 issued by IMI as a hedge of net investment of certain of our Euro denominated subsidiaries. As a result, we recorded $6.1 million ($3.9 million, net of tax) of foreign exchange losses related to the "marking to market" of such debt to currency translation adjustments which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive items, net included in stockholders equity for the year ended December 31, 2007. In May 2007, we entered into forward contracts to exchange 146.1 million U.S. dollars for 73.6 million in British pounds sterling to hedge our intercompany exposures with IME. These forward contracts settle on a monthly basis, at which time we may enter into new forward 52 contracts for the same underlying amounts to continue to hedge movements in the underlying currencies. At the time of settlement, we either pay or receive the net settlement amount from the forward contract and recognize this amount in other expense (income), net in the accompanying statement of operations as a realized foreign exchange gain or loss. We have not designated these forward contracts as hedges. We recorded a realized gain in connection with these forward contracts of $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. At the end of each month, we mark the outstanding forward contracts to market and record an unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss for the mark to market valuation. As of December 31, 2007, we recorded an unrealized foreign exchange gain of $0.9 million in other expense (income), net in the accompanying statement of operations. As of December 31, 2007, except as noted above, our currency exposures to intercompany balances are unhedged. The impact of devaluation or depreciating currency on an entity depends on the residual effect on the local economy and the ability of an entity to raise prices and or reduce expenses. Due to our constantly changing currency exposure and the potential substantial volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange fluctuations on our business. The effect of a change in foreign exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the "Accumulated Other Comprehensive Items, net" component of stockholders equity. A 10% depreciation in year end 2007 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction in our stockholders equity of approximately $69.8 million.
