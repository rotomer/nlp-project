Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with "Item 6. Selected Financial Data" and the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto and the other financial and operating information included elsewhere in this filing. This discussion contains "forward looking statements," as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and in other federal securities laws. See "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements" on page ii of this filing and "Item 1A. Risk Factors" beginning on page 15 of this filing. Overview Our revenues consist of storage revenues as well as service revenues. Storage revenues, both physical and digital, which are considered a key performance indicator for the information protection and storage services industry, consist of largely recurring periodic charges related to the storage of materials or data (generally on a per unit basis), which are typically retained by customers for many years, and have accounted for over 54% of total consolidated revenues in each of the last five years. Our annual revenues from these fixed periodic storage fees have grown for 20 consecutive years. Service revenues are comprised of charges for related core service activities and a wide array of complementary products and services. Included in core service revenues are: (1) the handling of records including the addition of new records, temporary removal of records from storage, refiling of removed records, destruction of records, and permanent withdrawals from storage; (2) courier operations, consisting primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request; (3) secure shredding of sensitive documents; and (4) other recurring services including maintenance and support contracts. Our complementary services revenues include special project work, data restoration projects, fulfillment services, consulting services and product sales (including software licenses, specially designed storage containers and related supplies). Our secure shredding revenues include the sale of recycled paper (included in complementary services), the price of which can fluctuate from period to period, adding to the volatility and reducing the predictability of that revenue stream. As service revenues have grown at a faster pace than our storage revenues, storage revenues as a percent of consolidated revenues has declined. Our consolidated revenues are also subject to variations caused by the net effect of foreign currency translation on revenue derived from outside the U.S. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008, we derived approximately 30%, 32% and 32%, respectively, of our total revenues from outside the U.S. We recognize revenue when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Storage and service revenues are recognized in the month the respective storage or service is provided and customers are generally billed on a monthly basis on contractually agreed upon terms. Amounts related to future storage or prepaid service contracts, including maintenance and support contracts, for customers where storage fees or services are billed in advance, are accounted for as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the applicable storage or service period or when the service is performed. Revenue from the sales of products is recognized when shipped to the customer and title has passed to the customer. Cost of sales (excluding depreciation) consists primarily of wages and benefits for field personnel, facility occupancy costs (including rent and utilities), transportation expenses (including vehicle leases and fuel), other product cost of sales and other equipment costs and supplies. Of these, wages and benefits and facility occupancy costs are the most significant. Trends in total wages and benefits dollars and as a percentage of total consolidated revenue are influenced by changes in headcount and compensation levels, achievement of incentive compensation targets, workforce productivity and variability in costs associated with medical insurance and workers compensation. Trends in facility 27 Table of Contents occupancy costs are similarly impacted by the total number of facilities we occupy, the mix of properties we own versus properties we occupy under operating leases, fluctuations in per square foot occupancy costs, and the levels of utilization of these properties. Due to the declining economic environment in 2008, the current fair market values of vans, trucks and mobile shredding units within our vehicle fleet portfolio, which we lease, have declined. As a result, certain vehicle leases that previously met the requirements to be considered operating leases will be classified as capital leases upon renewal. The impact of this change on our future operating results will be to lower vehicle rent expense (a component of transportation costs within cost of sales) by approximately $21.0 million, offset by an increased amount of combined depreciation (by approximately $19.5 million) and interest expense (by approximately $3.1 million) for the year ending December 31, 2009. The expansion of our European, secure shredding and digital services businesses has impacted the major cost of sales components. Our European and secure shredding operations are more labor intensive than our core U.S. physical businesses and therefore increase our labor costs as a percentage of consolidated revenues. This trend is partially offset by our digital services businesses, which require significantly less direct labor. Our secure shredding operations incur less facility costs and higher transportation costs as a percentage of revenues compared to our core physical businesses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits for management, administrative, information technology, sales, account management and marketing personnel, as well as expenses related to communications and data processing, travel, professional fees, bad debts, training, office equipment and supplies. Trends in total wages and benefits dollars and as a percentage of total consolidated revenue are influenced by changes in headcount and compensation levels, achievement of incentive compensation targets, workforce productivity and variability in costs associated with medical insurance. The overhead structure of our expanding European and Asian operations, as compared to our North American operations, is more labor intensive and has not achieved the same level of overhead leverage, which may result in an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of consolidated revenue, as our European and Asian operations become a more meaningful percentage of our consolidated results. Similarly, our digital services businesses require a higher level of overhead, particularly in the area of information technology, than our core physical businesses. Our depreciation and amortization charges result primarily from the capital intensive nature of our business. The principal components of depreciation relate to storage systems, which include racking, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and software, and buildings. Amortization relates primarily to customer relationships and acquisition costs and core technology and is impacted by the nature and timing of acquisitions. Our consolidated revenues and expenses are subject to variations caused by the net effect of foreign currency translation on revenues and expenses incurred by our entities outside the U.S. In 2006, we saw increases in both revenues and expenses as a result of the strengthening of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar, and decreases in both revenues and expenses as a result of the weakening of the British pound sterling and the Euro against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. In 2007, we saw increases in both revenues and expenses as a result of the strengthening of the Canadian dollar, Euro and British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar. During 2008, we saw net increases in both revenues and expenses as a result of the strengthening of the Euro, the Brazilian real and the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar, offset by the weakening of the British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. In the third quarter of 2008, we saw a dramatic strengthening of the U.S. dollar in comparison to all the major foreign currencies of our most significant international markets, which lead to a decrease in reported revenue and expenses in the fourth quarter of 2008. It is difficult to predict how much 28 Table of Contents foreign currency exchange rates will fluctuate in the future and how those fluctuations will impact individual balances reported in our consolidated statement of operations. Given the relative increase in our international operations, these fluctuations may become material on individual balances. If exchange rates remain at these levels throughout 2009, we expect a further decline in revenues and expenses as reported in U.S. dollars when comparing 2009 full year results to full year 2008 results included in our consolidated statement of operations. However, because both the revenues and expenses are denominated in the local currency of the country in which they are derived or incurred, the impact of currency fluctuations on our operating income, operating margin and net income is mitigated. Non GAAP Measures Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization, or OIBDA OIBDA is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization expenses. OIBDA Margin is calculated by dividing OIBDA by total revenues. We use multiples of current or projected OIBDA in conjunction with our discounted cash flow models to determine our overall enterprise valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets. We believe OIBDA and OIBDA Margin provide current and potential investors with relevant and useful information regarding our ability to generate cash flow to support business investment and our ability to grow revenues faster than operating expenses. These measures are an integral part of the internal reporting system we use to assess and evaluate the operating performance of our business. OIBDA does not include certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results, specifically: (1) minority interest in earnings (losses) of subsidiaries, net; (2) other (income) expense, net; (3) income from discontinued operations and loss on sale of discontinued operations; and (4) cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. OIBDA also does not include interest expense, net and the provision for income taxes. These expenses are associated with our capitalization and tax structures, which we do not consider when evaluating the operating profitability of our core operations. Finally, OIBDA does not include depreciation and amortization expenses, in order to eliminate the impact of capital investments, which we evaluate by comparing capital expenditures to incremental revenue generated and as a percentage of total revenues. OIBDA and OIBDA Margin should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the Unites States of America ("GAAP"), such as operating or net income or cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP). Reconciliation of OIBDA to Operating Income and Net Income (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2006 2007 2008 OIBDA $ 615,560 $ 704,012 $ 783,268 Less: Depreciation and Amortization 208,373 249,294 290,738 Operating Income 407,187 454,718 492,530 Less: Interest Expense, Net 194,958 228,593 236,635 Other (Income) Expense, Net (11,989 ) 3,101 31,028 Provision for Income Taxes 93,795 69,010 142,924 Minority Interest in Earnings (Losses) of Subsidiaries 1,560 920 (94 ) Net Income $ 128,863 $ 153,094 $ 82,037 29 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and for the period then ended. On an on going basis, we evaluate the estimates used, including those related to accounting for acquisitions, allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos, impairment of tangible and intangible assets, income taxes, stock based compensation and self insured liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience, actuarial estimates, current conditions and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Our critical accounting policies include the following, which are listed in no particular order: Revenue Recognition Our revenues consist of storage revenues as well as service revenues and are reflected net of sales and value added taxes. Storage revenues, both physical and digital, which are considered a key performance indicator for the information protection and storage services industry, consist of largely recurring periodic charges related to the storage of materials or data (generally on a per unit basis). Service revenues are comprised of charges for related core service activities and a wide array of complementary products and services. Included in core service revenues are: (1) the handling of records including addition of new records, temporary removal of records from storage, refilling of removed records, destruction of records, and permanent withdrawals from storage; (2) courier operations, consisting primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request; (3) secure shredding of sensitive documents; and (4) other recurring services including maintenance and support contracts. Our complementary services revenues include special project work, data restoration projects, fulfillment services, consulting services and product sales (including software licenses, specially designed storage containers and related supplies). Our secure shredding revenues include the sale of recycled paper (included in complementary services), the price of which can fluctuate from period to period, adding to the volatility and reducing the predictability of that revenue stream. We recognize revenue when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Storage and service revenues are recognized in the month the respective storage or service is provided and customers are generally billed on a monthly basis on contractually agreed upon terms. Amounts related to future storage or prepaid service contracts, including maintenance and support contracts, for customers where storage fees or services are billed in advance are accounted for as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the applicable storage or service period or when the service is performed. Revenue from the sales of products is recognized when shipped to the customer and title has passed to the customer. Sales of software licenses are recognized at the time of product delivery to our customer or reseller and maintenance and support agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement. Software license sales and maintenance and support accounted for less than 1% of our 2008 consolidated results. Within our Worldwide Digital Business segment, in certain instances, we process and host data for customers. In these instances, the processing fees are deferred and recognized over the estimated service period. Accounting for Acquisitions Part of our growth strategy has included the acquisition of numerous businesses. The purchase price of these acquisitions has been determined after due diligence of the acquired business, market 30 Table of Contents research, strategic planning, and the forecasting of expected future results and synergies. Estimated future results and expected synergies are subject to revisions as we integrate each acquisition and attempt to leverage resources. Each acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting as defined under the applicable accounting standards at the date of each acquisition, including Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16, "Accounting for Business Combinations," and SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations." Accounting for these acquisitions has resulted in the capitalization of the cost in excess of fair value of the net assets acquired in each of these acquisitions as goodwill. We estimated the fair values of the assets acquired in each acquisition as of the date of acquisition and these estimates are subject to adjustment. These estimates are subject to final assessments of the fair value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, operating leases and deferred income taxes. We complete these assessments within one year of the date of acquisition. We are not aware of any information that would indicate that the final purchase price allocations for acquisitions completed in 2008 would differ meaningfully from preliminary estimates. See Note 6 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In connection with each of our acquisitions, we have undertaken certain restructurings of the acquired businesses to realize efficiencies and potential cost savings. Our restructuring activities include the elimination of duplicate facilities, reductions in staffing levels, and other costs associated with exiting certain activities of the businesses we acquire. The estimated cost of these restructuring activities are included as costs of the acquisition and are recorded as goodwill consistent with the guidance of Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 95 3, "Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination." While we finalize our plans to restructure the businesses we acquire within one year of the date of acquisition, it may take more than one year to complete all activities related to the restructuring of an acquired business. See Recent Accounting Pronouncements on page 35. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Credit Memos We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments and disputes regarding billing and service issues. When calculating the allowance, we consider our past loss experience, current and prior trends in our aged receivables and credit memo activity, current economic conditions, and specific circumstances of individual receivable balances. If the financial condition of our customers were to significantly change, resulting in a significant improvement or impairment of their ability to make payments, an adjustment of the allowance may be required. We consider accounts receivable to be delinquent after such time as reasonable means of collection have been exhausted. We charge off uncollectible balances as circumstances warrant, generally no later than one year past due. As of December 31, 2007 and 2008, our allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos balance totaled $19.2 million and $19.6 million, respectively. Impairment of Tangible and Intangible Assets Assets subject to amortization: In accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets," we review long lived assets and all amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operation to which the assets relate to their carrying amount. The operations are generally distinguished by the business segment and geographic region in which they operate. If the operation is determined to be unable to recover the carrying amount of its assets, then intangible assets are written down first, followed by the other long lived assets of the operation, to fair 31 Table of Contents value. Fair value is based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, depending upon the nature of the assets. Goodwill Assets not subject to amortization: We apply the provisions of SFAS No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" to goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives which are not amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. We have selected October 1 as our annual goodwill impairment review date. We performed our annual goodwill impairment review as of October 1, 2006, 2007 and 2008 and noted no impairment of goodwill. In making this assessment, we rely on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and marketplace data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. As of December 31, 2008, no factors were identified that would alter this assessment. When changes occur in the composition of one or more reporting units, the goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units affected based on their relative fair values. Reporting unit valuations have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit or a combined approach based on the present value of future cash flows and market and transaction multiples of revenues. The income approach incorporates many assumptions including future growth rates, discount factors, expected capital expenditures and income tax cash flows. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in a goodwill impairment in future periods. Our reporting units at which level we performed our goodwill impairment analysis as of October 1, 2008 were as follows: North America (excluding Fulfillment); Fulfillment; Europe; Worldwide Digital Business (excluding Stratify); Stratify; Latin America; and Asia Pacific. Asia Pacific is primarily composed of recent acquisitions (carrying value of goodwill, net amounts to $46.3 million as of December 31, 2008). It is still in the investment stage and accordingly its fair value does not exceed its carrying value by a significant margin at this point in time. A deterioration of the Asia Pacific business or the business not achieving the forecasted results could lead to an impairment in future periods. In conjunction with our annual goodwill impairment reviews, we reconcile the sum of the valuations of all of our reporting units to our market capitalization as of such dates. Accounting for Internal Use Software We develop various software applications for internal use. We account for those costs in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Position ("SOP") 98 1, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use." SOP 98 1 requires computer software costs associated with internal use software to be expensed as incurred until certain capitalization criteria are met. SOP 98 1 also defines which types of costs should be capitalized and which should be expensed. Payroll and related costs for employees who are directly associated with, and who devote time to, the development of internal use computer software projects, to the extent time is spent directly on the project, are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the software. Capitalization begins when the design stage of the project has been completed and it is probable that the application will be completed and used to perform the function intended. Depreciation begins when the software is placed in service. Computer software costs that are capitalized are evaluated for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." It may be necessary for us to write off amounts associated with the development of internal use software if the project cannot be completed as intended. Our expansion into new technology based service offerings requires the development of internal use software that will be susceptible to rapid and significant changes in technology. We may be required to write off unamortized costs or shorten the estimated useful life if an internal use software program is replaced with an alternative tool prior to the end of the softwares estimated useful life. General uncertainties related to expansion into digital 32 Table of Contents businesses, including the timing of introduction and market acceptance of our services, may adversely impact the recoverability of these assets. As of December 31, 2007 and 2008, capitalized labor net of accumulated depreciation was $47.5 million and $45.6 million, respectively. See Note 2(f) to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. During the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2008, we wrote off $1.3 million and $0.6 million, respectively, of previously deferred software costs in our North American Physical Business, primarily internal labor costs, associated with internal use software development projects that were discontinued after implementation, which resulted in a loss on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we wrote off $6.3 million of previously deferred costs, primarily internal labor costs, associated with internal use software development projects that were discontinued prior to being implemented, of which $5.9 million was included in information technology and $0.4 million was included in general and administrative costs, which are both included as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Income Taxes We have recorded a valuation allowance, amounting to $44.8 million as of December 31, 2008, to reduce our deferred tax assets, primarily associated with certain state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards, to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We have an asset for state net operating losses of $23.3 million (net of federal tax benefit), which begins to expire in 2009 through 2025, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 99%. We have assets for foreign net operating losses of $22.9 million, with various expiration dates, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 95%. Additionally, we have federal alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of $1.6 million, which have no expiration date and are available to reduce future income taxes, federal research credits of $1.7 million which begin to expire in 2010, and foreign tax credits of $54.7 million, which begin to expire in 2014 through 2018. Based on current expectations and plans, we expect to fully utilize our foreign tax credit carryforwards prior to their expiration. If actual results differ unfavorably from certain of our estimates used, we may not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred income tax assets and foreign tax credit carryforwards and additional valuation allowances may be required. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that our estimates reflected in the tax provisions and accruals will equal our actual results. These differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes" ("FIN 48"), an interpretation of SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("SFAS No. 109"), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN 48 also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position in accordance with FIN 48 is a two step process. The first step is a recognition process whereby the company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The second step is a measurement process whereby a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is calculated to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The provisions of FIN 48 are to be applied to all tax positions upon initial adoption of this standard. Only tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective 33 Table of Contents date may be recognized or continue to be recognized upon adoption of FIN 48. The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of FIN 48 should be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for that fiscal year. We adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007 and, as a result, we recognized a $16.6 million increase in the reserve related to uncertain tax positions, which was accounted for as a reduction to the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings. Additionally, we grossed up deferred tax assets and the reserve related to uncertain tax positions in the amount of $7.9 million related to the federal tax benefit associated with certain state reserves. As of January 1, 2007, our reserve related to uncertain tax positions, which is included in other long term liabilities, amounted to $84.0 million. We are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. As of December 31, 2007 and 2008, we had approximately $72.9 million and $84.6 million, respectively, of reserves related to uncertain tax positions. Approximately $37.5 million of the 2008 reserve is related to pre acquisition net operating loss carryforwards and other acquisition related items. If these tax positions are sustained, the reversal of these reserves will be recorded as a reduction of goodwill. Beginning with our adoption of SFAS No. 141(R), "Business Combinations" ("SFAS No. 141R"), effective January 1, 2009, the reversal of all of these reserves of $84.6 million ($78.2 million net of federal tax benefit) as of December 31, 2008 will be recorded as a reduction of our income tax provision if sustained. Although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in favorable or unfavorable changes in our estimates. We have elected to recognize interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as a component of the provision for income taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. We recorded $0.9 million, $1.2 million and $4.5 million for gross interest and penalties for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively. We had $3.6 million and $8.1 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties as of December 31, 2007 and 2008, respectively. We have not provided deferred taxes on book basis differences related to certain foreign subsidiaries because such basis differences are not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future and we intend to reinvest indefinitely outside the U.S. These basis differences arose primarily through the undistributed book earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The basis differences could be reversed through a sale of the subsidiaries, the receipt of dividends from subsidiaries as well as certain other events or actions on our part, which would result in an increase in our provision for income taxes. It is not practicable to calculate the amount of such basis differences. Stock Based Compensation As of January 1, 2003, we adopted the measurement provisions of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation," as amended by SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123". As a result we began using the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation in our financial statements beginning January 1, 2003 using the prospective method. We adopted SFAS No. 123R, "Share Based Payment," ("SFAS No. 123R") effective January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective method. We record stock based compensation expense for the cost of stock options, restricted stock and shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123R. Stock based compensation expense, included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008 was $12.4 million ($9.2 million after tax or $0.05 per basic and diluted share), $13.9 million ($10.2 million after tax or $0.05 per basic and 34 Table of Contents diluted share) and $19.0 million ($15.0 million after tax or $0.07 per basic and diluted shares), respectively. SFAS No. 123R also requires that the benefits associated with the tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow, reducing net operating cash flows and increasing net financing cash flows in future periods. The fair values of option and restricted stock grants are estimated on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model. Expected volatility and the expected term are the input factors to that model which require the most significant management judgment. Expected volatility is calculated utilizing daily historical volatility over a period that equates to the expected life of the option. The expected life (estimated period of time outstanding) is estimated using the historical exercise behavior of employees. Self Insured Liabilities We are self insured up to certain limits for costs associated with workers compensation claims, vehicle accidents, property and general business liabilities, and benefits paid under employee healthcare and short term disability programs. At December 31, 2007 and 2008 there were approximately $33.5 million and $39.6 million, respectively, of self insurance accruals reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. The measurement of these costs requires the consideration of historical cost experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim. We account for these costs primarily through actuarial methods, which develop estimates of the undiscounted liability for claims incurred, including those claims incurred but not reported. These methods provide estimates of future ultimate claim costs based on claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. We believe the use of actuarial methods to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals. However, the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claims involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known. We believe our recorded obligations for these expenses are appropriate. Nevertheless, changes in healthcare costs, severity, and other factors can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R and SFAS No. 160, "Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statement an amendment to ARB No. 51" ("SFAS No. 160"). SFAS No. 141R and SFAS No. 160 will require (a) more of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at fair value as of the acquisition date, (b) liabilities related to contingent consideration to be remeasured at fair value in each subsequent period, (c) an acquirer to expense as incurred acquisition related costs, such as transaction fees for attorneys, accountants and investment bankers, as well as costs associated with restructuring the activities of the acquired company, and (d) noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries initially to be measured at fair value and classified as a separate component of equity. SFAS No. 141R is effective and provided for prospective application for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. SFAS No. 160 is required to apply in comparative financial statements for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The impact of SFAS No. 141R and SFAS No. 160 is dependent upon the level of future acquisitions; however, they will generally result in (1) increased operating costs associated with the expensing of transaction and restructuring costs, as incurred, (2) increased volatility in earnings related to the fair valuing of contingent consideration through earnings in subsequent periods, and (3) increased depreciation, amortization and equity balances associated with the fair valuing of noncontrolling interests and their classification as a separate component of consolidated stockholders equity. 35 Table of Contents In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, "Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an amendment of SFAS No. 133" ("SFAS No. 161"). SFAS No. 161 enhances required disclosures regarding derivatives and hedging activities, including enhanced disclosures regarding how: (a) an entity uses derivative instruments; (b) derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities"; and (c) derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. Specifically, SFAS No. 161 requires: Disclosure of the objectives for using derivative instruments in terms of underlying risk and accounting designation; Disclosure of the fair values of derivative instruments and their gains and losses in a tabular format; Disclosure of information about credit risk related contingent features; and Cross reference from the derivative footnote to other footnotes in which derivative related information is disclosed. SFAS No. 161 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008 and early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 161 to have a material impact on our disclosures. In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, "The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles" ("SFAS No. 162"). SFAS No. 162 identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with GAAP (the "GAAP hierarchy"). SFAS No. 162 makes the GAAP hierarchy explicitly and directly applicable to preparers of financial statements, a step that recognizes preparers responsibilities for selecting the accounting principles for their financial statements, and sets the stage for making the framework of the FASB Concept Statements fully authoritative. The effective date for SFAS No. 162 is November 15, 2008. The adoption of SFAS No. 162 did not have a material impact on our financial statements and results of operations. 36 Table of Contents Results of Operations Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2008 to Year Ended December 31, 2007 and Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2007 to Year Ended December 31, 2006 (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, Dollar Change Percentage Change 2007 2008 Revenues $ 2,730,035 $ 3,055,134 $ 325,099 11.9 % Operating Expenses 2,275,317 2,562,604 287,287 12.6 % Operating Income 454,718 492,530 37,812 8.3 % Other Expenses, Net 301,624 410,493 108,869 36.1 % Net Income $ 153,094 $ 82,037 $ (71,057 ) (46.4 )% OIBDA(1) $ 704,012 $ 783,268 $ 79,256 11.3 % OIBDA Margin(1) 25.8 % 25.6 % Year Ended December 31, Dollar Change Percentage Change 2006 2007 Revenues $ 2,350,342 $ 2,730,035 $ 379,693 16.2 % Operating Expenses 1,943,155 2,275,317 332,162 17.1 % Operating Income 407,187 454,718 47,531 11.7 % Other Expenses, Net 278,324 301,624 23,300 8.4 % Net Income $ 128,863 $ 153,094 $ 24,231 18.8 % OIBDA(1) $ 615,560 $ 704,012 $ 88,452 14.4 % OIBDA Margin(1) 26.2 % 25.8 % (1)See "Non GAAP Measures Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization, or OIBDA" for definition, reconciliation and a discussion of why we believe these measures provide relevant and useful information to our current and potential investors. REVENUE Our consolidated storage revenues increased $158.8 million, or 10.6%, to $1.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 and $171.9 million, or 13.0%, to $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007, in comparison to the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase is attributable to internal revenue growth (8% during both 2008 and 2007) resulting from strength across all of our segments, acquisitions (2% during both 2008 and 2007), and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations (1% during 2008 and 2% during 2007). Consolidated service revenues increased $166.3 million, or 13.5%, to $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 and $207.8 million, or 20.3%, to $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007, in comparison to the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase is attributable to internal revenue growth (8% during 2008 and 12% during 2007), supported by strong growth in data protection and secure shredding revenues, increased recycled paper revenues driven by higher volumes and a year over year increase in the average prices for recycled paper, and fuel surcharges. Acquisitions (5% during both 2008 and 2007), and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations (1% during 2008 and 3% during 2007) also added to total growth. For the reasons stated above, our consolidated revenues increased $325.1 million, or 11.9%, to $3.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 and $379.7 million, or 16.2%, to $2.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007, in comparison to the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, 37 Table of Contents respectively. Internal revenue growth was 9%, 10% and 8% for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively. We calculate internal revenue growth in local currency for our international operations. Acquisitions contributed 4%, 3% and 3% for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2006, net favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that impacted our revenues were less than 1% and were primarily due to the weakening of the British pound sterling and Euro, net of the strengthening of the Canadian dollar, against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. For the year ended December 31, 2007, net favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that impacted our revenues were 3% and were primarily due to the strengthening of the British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and Euro against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. For the year ended December 31, 2008, net favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that impacted our revenues were 1% and were primarily due to the strengthening of the Euro, the Brazilian real and the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar, offset by the weakening of the British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. Internal Growth Eight Quarter Trend 2007 2008 First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Storage Revenue 9 % 9 % 8 % 8 % 8 % 8 % 8 % 8 % Service Revenue 10 % 11 % 16 % 12 % 10 % 9 % 9 % 5 % Total Revenue 9 % 10 % 12 % 10 % 9 % 9 % 8 % 7 % Our internal revenue growth rate represents the weighted average year over year growth rate of our revenues after removing the effects of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Since the beginning of 2007, the internal growth rate of our storage revenues has been consistently between 8% and 9% supported by solid growth rates in our North American Physical Business segment. Strong growth rates in our North American secure shredding and data protection businesses, as well as our Latin American and digital services businesses, further supported consolidated internal growth. The internal growth rate for service revenue is inherently more volatile than the storage revenue internal growth rate due to the more discretionary nature of the services we offer, such as large special projects, software licenses, and the price for recycled paper. These revenues are often event driven and impacted to a greater extent by economic downturns as customers defer or cancel the purchase of these services as a way to reduce their short term costs, and may often be difficult to replicate in future periods. As a commodity, recycled paper prices are subject to the volatility of that market. For the year ended December 31, 2008, our revenue associated with the resale of recycled paper amounted to over $90.0 million. For the first three quarters of 2008, the average price of recycled paper exceeded $200 per ton and, in the fourth quarter of 2008, the price of recycled paper decreased significantly to slightly greater than $100 per ton on average. At current rates, we expect that commodity price changes, including lower recycled paper prices and fuel surcharges, will lower our revenue growth by approximately 2% in 2009 as compared to 2008, with a more pronounced effect in the first three quarters of 2009. We expect our consolidated internal revenue growth for 2009 to be between 5% to 7%. The internal growth rate for service revenues reflects the following: (1) growth in North American storage related service revenues, increased special project revenues and higher recycled paper revenues; (2) two large public sector contracts in Europe, one that was completed in the third quarter of 2007 and one that was completed in the third quarter of 2008; and (3) continued growth in our secure shredding operations; which were partially offset by slower growth in fulfillment services and software license sales. Service revenue internal growth in the fourth quarter of 2008 was impacted by declines in commodity prices for recycled paper and fuel and the expected softness in our complementary service revenues. 38  Table of Contents OPERATING EXPENSES Cost of Sales Consolidated cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization) is comprised of the following expenses (in thousands): % of Consolidated Revenues Year Ended December 31, Percentage Change (Favorable)/ Unfavorable Dollar Change Percentage Change 2007 2008 2007 2008 Labor $ 615,059 $ 674,466 $ 59,407 9.7 % 22.5 % 22.1 % (0.4 )% Facilities 374,529 413,968 39,439 10.5 % 13.7 % 13.5 % (0.2 )% Transportation 134,882 151,891 17,009 12.6 % 4.9 % 5.0 % 0.1 % Product Cost of Sales 54,483 44,557 (9,926 ) (18.2 )% 2.0 % 1.5 % (0.5 )% Other 81,167 97,137 15,970 19.7 % 3.0 % 3.2 % 0.2 % $ 1,260,120 $ 1,382,019 $ 121,899 9.7 % 46.1 % 45.2 % (0.9 )% % of Consolidated Revenues Year Ended December 31, Percentage Change (Favorable)/ Unfavorable Dollar Change Percentage Change 2006 2007 2006 2007 Labor $ 523,401 $ 615,059 $ 91,658 17.5 % 22.3 % 22.5 % 0.2 % Facilities 321,268 374,529 53,261 16.6 % 13.7 % 13.7 % 0.0 % Transportation 111,086 134,882 23,796 21.4 % 4.7 % 4.9 % 0.2 % Product Cost of Sales 49,853 54,483 4,630 9.3 % 2.1 % 2.0 % (0.1 )% Other 68,660 81,167 12,507 18.2 % 2.9 % 3.0 % 0.1 % $ 1,074,268 $ 1,260,120 $ 185,852 17.3 % 45.7 % 46.1 % 0.4 % Labor For the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, labor expense decreased as a percentage of consolidated revenue, mainly as a result of higher recycled paper revenue and strong growth in our digital services revenues, which have lower labor costs, and labor efficiencies in our North American business. These benefits were partially offset by the impact of revenue mix, as labor intensive services such as secure shredding and DMS continue to grow at a faster rate than our storage revenues, and the dilutive impact of more labor intensive acquisitions. For the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, labor expense as a percentage of consolidated revenues increased. This is mainly a result of our shredding and DMS acquisitions in Europe and Latin America, which have a higher service revenue component and are therefore more labor intensive, offset by Asia Pacific labor decreasing as a percentage of revenue, as that business begins to scale, as well as the impact of an increasing percentage of revenue from our digital business which requires significantly less direct labor as a percentage of revenue compared to our larger physical businesses. Facilities Facilities costs as a percentage of consolidated revenues decreased slightly to 13.5% for the year ended December 31, 2008 from 13.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007. The largest component of our facilities cost is rent expense, which increased in dollar terms by $29.4 million over 2007 and increased as a percentage of consolidated storage revenues from 12.6% for 2007 to 13.2% for 2008. The increase in rent is mainly driven by the timing of new real estate as we continue to expand our 39 Table of Contents storage business, as well as an incremental rental charge in 2008 of $3.3 million related to our decision to exit a leased facility in the U.K., partially offset by the expansion of our secure shredding and other service businesses, which incur lower rent and facilities costs than our core physical business, coupled with increased utilization levels. Other facilities costs increased in dollar terms in 2008 from 2007 due to increased costs of utilities of $8.1 million and common area charges of $1.4 million related to rising costs and an increased number of facilities. Facilities costs as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, remained unchanged at 13.7%. The largest component of our facilities cost is rent expense, which increased in dollar terms in 2007 over 2006 by $26.2 million while staying unchanged as a percentage of consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in rent is mainly driven by the timing of new real estate, which may include duplicative rent and the use of temporary space related to moving out of substandard facilities obtained through acquisitions. Facilities costs as a percentage of consolidated revenues was also affected by increases in maintenance, property taxes and insurance, offset by decreases in utilities and security costs. The expansion of our secure shredding operations, which incurs lower facilities costs than our core physical business, helps to lower our facilities costs as a percentage of consolidated revenues. Transportation Our transportation expenses (which are influenced by several variables including total number of vehicles, owned versus leased vehicles, use of subcontracted couriers, fuel expenses, maintenance and insurance) increased slightly as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The expansion of our secure shredding operations, which incurs higher transportation costs than our core physical business, contributed to the increase in dollar terms, as well as rising fuel costs, which contributed $10.4 million of the increase, and the increased use of leased vehicles which contributed $5.7 million, some of which were offset, as a percentage of revenue, by incremental fuel surcharges. In 2008 and in the future, certain vehicle leases related to vans, trucks and mobile shredding units in our vehicle lease portfolio previously classified as operating leases will be classified as capital leases upon renewal. As a result, we will have lower vehicle rent expense, which we estimate to be approximately $21.0 million, offset by an increased amount of combined depreciation (by approximately $19.5 million) and interest expense (by approximately $3.1 million) for the year ending December 31, 2009. Our transportation expenses increased from 4.7% to 4.9% as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. The use of couriers and leased vehicles, rising gas prices, as well as shredding revenue growing at a faster rate than storage revenue, contributed to this increase. Product Cost of Sales and Other Product and other cost of sales, which includes cartons, media and other service, storage and supply costs, are highly correlated to complementary revenue streams. The decrease of $9.9 million in product cost of sales in dollar terms for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily reflects the impact of the sale of our North American commodity product sales line, which consisted of the sale of data storage media, imaging products and data center furniture to our physical data protection and recovery services customers. Product cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 remained largely unchanged as a percentage of consolidated revenue but were slightly higher in dollar terms compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 due to a corresponding increase in related carton, media and services revenues. 40 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses are comprised of the following expenses (in thousands): % of Consolidated Revenues Year Ended December 31, Percentage Change (Favorable)/ Unfavorable Dollar Change Percentage Change 2007 2008 2007 2008 General and Administrative $ 382,727 $ 442,852 $ 60,125 15.7 % 14.0 % 14.5 % 0.5 % Sales, Marketing & Account Management 249,966 276,697 26,731 10.7 % 9.2 % 9.1 % (0.1 )% Information Technology 135,788 152,113 16,325 12.0 % 5.0 % 5.0 % 0.0 % Bad Debt Expense 2,894 10,702 7,808 269.8 % 0.1 % 0.3 % 0.2 % $ 771,375 $ 882,364 $ 110,989 14.4 % 28.3 % 28.9 % 0.6 % % of Consolidated Revenues Year Ended December 31, Percentage Change (Favorable)/ Unfavorable Dollar Change Percentage Change 2006 2007 2006 2007 General and Administrative $ 331,021 $ 382,727 $ 51,706 15.6 % 14.1 % 14.0 % (0.1 )% Sales, Marketing & Account Management 214,007 249,966 35,959 16.8 % 9.1 % 9.2 % 0.1 % Information Technology 122,211 135,788 13,577 11.1 % 5.2 % 5.0 % (0.2 )% Bad Debt Expense 2,835 2,894 59 2.1 % 0.1 % 0.1 % 0.0 % $ 670,074 $ 771,375 $ 101,301 15.1 % 28.5 % 28.3 % (0.2 )% General and Administrative The increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 is mainly attributable to increased compensation expense of $34.4 million, reflecting increased headcount due to acquisitions and general business expansion, as well as increases in related office occupancy costs of $6.3 million, professional fees of $8.4 million and other overhead of $11.0 million, including such items as insurance, postage and supplies and telephone costs. Included in compensation expense is stock option expense, which increased by $3.1 million in 2008 compared to 2007 due to an increase in the number of stock option grants and the fair value of such grants in 2007. The slight decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 is mainly attributable to overhead leverage, which offset increased incentive compensation expense and start up costs related to certain international joint ventures. Sales, Marketing & Account Management The majority of our sales, marketing and account management costs are labor related and are comprised mainly of compensation and commissions. These costs are primarily driven by the headcount in each of these departments, which, on average, was higher throughout 2008 compared to 2007. Compensation expense and commissions increased $19.9 million and $6.6 million, respectively, in 2008 compared to 2007. Our average sales force headcount increased during 2007 as compared to 2006. In addition, we increased discretionary training and marketing during that period. Offsetting those increases in 41 Table of Contents expenditures were changes to commission based compensation plans, which resulted in lower costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Information Technology Information technology expenses remained flat as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The dollar increase in 2008 in information technology expenses is primarily related to a $14.0 million increase in compensation expense, and represents an investment in infrastructure and product development. Information technology expenses decreased as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to a write off of $5.9 million of previously deferred costs, primarily internal labor costs, associated with internal use software development projects that were discontinued prior to being implemented in 2006 and did not repeat in 2007. The dollar increase in information technology expenses is due to compensation expense, consulting fees and communication costs which are correlated to our increase in revenues. Bad Debt Expense Consolidated bad debt expense increased $7.8 million to $10.7 million (0.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $2.9 million (0.1% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2007, and increased $0.1 million to $2.9 million (0.1% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $2.8 million (0.1% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2006. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos that is calculated based on our past loss experience, current and prior trends in our aged receivables and credit memo activity, current economic conditions, and specific circumstances of individual receivable balances. The increase in bad debt expense in 2008 from 2007 is attributable to the worsening economic climate and the resultant deterioration in the aging of our accounts receivable. We continue to monitor our customers payment activity and make adjustments based on their financial condition and in light of historical and expected trends. Depreciation, Amortization, and (Gain) Loss on Disposal/Writedown of Property, Plant and Equipment, Net Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased $41.4 million to $290.7 million (9.5% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $249.3 million (9.1% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2007. Consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased $40.9 million to $249.3 million (9.1% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $208.4 million (8.9% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2006. Depreciation expense increased $32.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, and increased $34.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily due to the additional depreciation expense related to capital expenditures and acquisitions, including storage systems, which include racking, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and software, and buildings. As discussed previously, we expect depreciation expense to increase in 2009 over 2008 by approximately $19.5 million as a result of certain vehicle leases being classified as capital leases upon renewal on a prospective basis as opposed to operating. Amortization expense increased $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, and increased $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily due to amortization of intangible assets, such as customer relationship intangible assets and intellectual property acquired through business 42 Table of Contents combinations. We expect that amortization expense will continue to increase as we acquire new businesses and reflect the full year impact of our 2008 acquisitions. Consolidated loss on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, consisted primarily of a $2.3 million impairment of an owned storage facility in North America which we decided to exit in the first quarter of 2008, a $1.3 million impairment of an owned storage facility in North America which we decided to exit in the third quarter of 2008, a $0.5 million write down for an owned storage facility in North America that we have vacated and have classified as available for sale, a $1.9 million write down of two owned storage facilities in North America and related assets which we decided to exit in the fourth quarter of 2008, as well as a $0.6 million write off of previously deferred software costs in the North American Physical Business associated with discontinued products after implementation and other disposal and asset write downs. We continue to rationalize our lease portfolio to the extent such decisions are net present value cash flow positive. Consolidated gain on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, consisted primarily of a gain related to insurance proceeds from our property claim of $7.7 million associated with the July 2006 fire in one of our London, England facilities, net of a $1.3 million write off of previously deferred software costs in our North American Physical Business associated with a discontinued product after implementation. Consolidated gain on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, consisted primarily of a gain on the sale of a property in the U.K. of $10.5 million offset by disposals and writedowns. OPERATING INCOME As a result of all the foregoing factors, consolidated operating income increased $37.8 million, or 8.3%, to $492.5 million (16.1% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $454.7 million (16.7% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2007. Consolidated operating income increased $47.5 million, or 11.7%, to $454.7 million (16.7% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $407.2 million (17.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2006. OIBDA As a result of all the foregoing factors, consolidated OIBDA increased $79.3 million, or 11.3%, to $783.3 million (25.6% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $704.0 million (25.8% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2007. Consolidated OIBDA increased $88.5 million, or 14.4%, to $704.0 million (25.8% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $615.6 million (26.2% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2006. OTHER EXPENSES, NET Interest Expense, Net Consolidated interest expense, net increased $8.0 million to $236.6 million (7.7% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $228.6 million (8.4% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily due to the full year impact of borrowings to fund acquisitions completed in 2007, offset by a decrease in our weighted average interest rate to 7.0% as of December 31, 2008 from 7.4% as of December 31, 2007. In addition, as a result of the repayment of IMEs revolving credit facility and term loans with borrowings in the U.S., we had higher than normal interest expense of approximately $4.1 million in the second quarter of 2007. This was a result of the difference in our calendar reporting period and that of IME which is two months in arrears, and had 43 Table of Contents no impact on cash flows. As discussed previously, we expect interest expense to increase in 2009 over 2008 by approximately $3.1 million as a result of certain vehicle leases being classified as capital leases upon renewal on a prospective basis as opposed to operating. Consolidated interest expense, net increased $33.6 million to $228.6 million (8.4% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $195.0 million (8.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2006 due to increased borrowings to fund acquisitions, offset by a decrease in our weighted average interest rate from 7.5% as of December 31, 2006 to 7.4% as of December 31, 2007. In addition, as a result of the repayment of IMEs revolving credit facility and term loans with borrowings in the U.S., we had an increase of approximately $4.1 million in consolidated interest expense in the second quarter of 2007. This is a result of the difference in our calendar reporting period and that of IME which is two months in arrears, and had no impact on cash flows.

Foreign currency transaction losses, net of $11.3 million based on period end exchange rates were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily due to losses as a result of the Euro and Canadian dollar, offset by gains as a result of the British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar compared to December 31, 2006, as these currencies relate to our intercompany balances with and between our Canadian and European subsidiaries. Additionaly, the U.S. parent company incurred losses as a result of primarily marking to market British pounds sterling and Euro denominated debt, offset by gains on Euro for U.S. dollar foreign currency swaps. Foreign currency transaction gains of $12.5 million based on period end exchange rates were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to gains as a result of the British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar compared to December 31, 2005, as these currencies relate to our intercompany balances with our U.K. subsidiaries, offset by losses as a result of British pounds sterling denominated debt held by our U.S. parent company. 44 Table of Contents During 2008, we redeemed the remaining outstanding portion of our 81/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011 (the "81/4% notes") and in connection with the reduction in our revolving credit facility availability due to a bankruptcy of one of our lenders, we wrote off $0.4 million in deferred financing costs. During 2007, we wrote off $5.7 million of deferred financing costs related to the early extinguishment of U.S. and U.K. term loans and revolving credit facilities. During 2006, we redeemed or purchased a portion of our outstanding 81/4% notes and 85/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013 resulting in a charge of $2.8 million, which consists of tender premiums and transaction costs, deferred financing costs, as well as original issue discounts and premiums. Other, net in the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily consists of $1.8 million of write downs related to certain trading marketable securities held in a trust for the benefit of employees included in a deferred compensation plan we sponsor. Other, net in the year ended December 31, 2007 consisted of $12.9 million of business interruption insurance proceeds pertaining to the July 2006 fire in one of our London, England facilities. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008 were 41.8%, 30.9% and 63.6%, respectively. The primary reconciling items between the statutory rate of 35% and our effective rate are state income taxes (net of federal benefit) and differences in the rates of tax to which our foreign earnings are subject. The increase in our effective tax rate in 2008 is primarily due to significant foreign exchange gains and losses in different jurisdictions with different tax rates. For 2008, foreign currency gains were recorded in higher tax jurisdictions associated with our marking to market of debt and derivative instruments while foreign currency losses were recorded in lower tax jurisdictions associated with the marking to market of intercompany loan positions, which contributed 22.5% to the 2008 effective tax rate. Meanwhile, for 2007 the opposite occurred, foreign currency losses were recorded in higher tax jurisdictions associated with our marking to market of debt and derivative instruments while foreign currency gains were recorded in lower tax jurisdictions associated with marking to market intercompany loan positions. For the year ended December 31, 2007, our effective tax rate also benefited from additional foreign tax rate differentials. Our effective tax rate is subject to future variability due to, among other items: (a) changes in the mix of income from foreign jurisdictions; (b) tax law changes; (c) volatility in foreign exchange gains and (losses); and (d) the timing of the establishment and reversal of tax reserves. We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. Although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in changes in our estimates. Minority Interest Minority interest in earnings of subsidiaries, net resulted in a charge to income of $1.6 million (0.1% of consolidated revenues), $0.9 million (less than 0.1% of consolidated revenues) and a credit to income of $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively. This represents our minority partners share of earnings/losses in our majority owned international subsidiaries that are consolidated in our operating results. NET INCOME As a result of all the foregoing factors, for the year ended December 31, 2008, consolidated net income decreased $71.1 million, or 46.4%, to $82.0 million (2.7% of consolidated revenues) from net income of $153.1 million (5.6% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2007. For 45 Table of Contents the year ended December 31, 2007, consolidated net income increased $24.2 million, or 18.8%, to $153.1 million (5.6% of consolidated revenues) from net income of $128.9 million (5.5% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2006. Segment Analysis (in thousands) The results of our various operating segments are discussed below. Our reportable segments are North American Physical Business, International Physical Business and Worldwide Digital Business. See Note 9 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our North American Physical Business, which consists of the United States and Canada, offers the storage of paper documents, as well as all other non electronic media such as microfilm and microfiche, master audio and videotapes, film, X rays and blueprints, including healthcare information services, vital records services, service and courier operations, and the collection, handling and disposal of sensitive documents for corporate customers ("Hard Copy"); the storage and rotation of backup computer media as part of corporate disaster recovery plans, including service and courier operations ("Data Protection"); information destruction services ("Destruction"); and the storage, assembly, and detailed reporting of customer marketing literature and delivery to sales offices, trade shows and prospective customers sites based on current and prospective customer orders, which we refer to as the "Fulfillment" business. Our International Physical Business segment offers information protection and storage services throughout Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific, including Hard Copy, Data Protection and Destruction. Our Worldwide Digital Business offers information protection and storage services for electronic records conveyed via telecommunication lines and the Internet, including online backup and recovery solutions for server data and personal computers, as well as email archiving, third party technology escrow services that protect intellectual property assets such as software source code, and electronic discovery services for the legal market that offers in depth discovery and data investigation solutions. North American Physical Business Dollar Change Percentage Change Year Ended December 31, from 2006 to 2007 from 2007 to 2008 from 2006 to 2007 from 2007 to 2008 2006 2007 2008 Segment Revenue $ 1,671,009 $ 1,890,068 $ 2,067,316 $ 219,059 $ 177,248 13.1% 9.4% Segment Contribution(1) $ 478,653 $ 539,027 $ 615,587 $ 60,374 $ 76,560 12.6% 14.2% Segment Contribution(1) as a Percentage of Revenue 28.6 % 28.5 % 29.8 % (1)See Note 9 to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for definition of Contribution and for the basis on which allocations are made and a reconciliation of Contribution to income before provision for income taxes and minority interest on a consolidated basis. During the year ended December 31, 2008, revenue in our North American Physical Business segment increased 9.4% over 2007, primarily due to solid internal growth supported by increased destruction and data protection revenues, higher recycled paper revenues, and the growing impact of our 2007 acquisitions, primarily ArchivesOne, which contributed $15.3 million, or approximately 0.8%. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue increased in 2008 due mainly to higher recycled paper revenues, fuel surcharges, as well as labor efficiencies, expense management, and facility utilization, offset by increased transportation expenses, such as rising fuel costs, and selling, general and administrative expenses, as discussed above. During the year ended December 31, 2007, revenue in our North American Physical Business segment increased 13.1%, primarily due to stable storage internal growth rates, continued strength in special projects, higher recycled paper revenues, and acquisitions, primarily ArchivesOne, which contributed $32.0 million, or approximately 2%. In addition, favorable currency fluctuations during the 46 Table of Contents year ended December 31, 2007 in Canada resulted in increased revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, of 0.6% when compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue decreased slightly in the year ended December 31, 2007 due mainly to increased occupancy costs such as insurance and maintenance, and higher costs associated with the acquisition of new real estate and moving out of substandard facilities obtained through acquisitions, offset by strong service revenue growth and overhead leverage. Included in our North American Physical Business segment are certain costs related to staff functions, including finance, human resources and information technology, which benefit the enterprise as a whole. These costs are primarily related to the general management of these functions on a corporate level and the design and development of programs, policies and procedures that are then implemented in the individual segments, with each segment bearing its own cost of implementation. Management has decided to allocate these costs to the North American segment as further allocation is impracticable. International Physical Business Dollar Change Percentage Change Year Ended December 31, from 2006 to 2007 from 2007 to 2008 from 2006 to 2007 from 2007 to 2008 2006 2007 2008 Segment Revenue $ 539,335 $ 676,749 $ 764,812 $ 137,414 $ 88,063 25.5% 13.0% Segment Contribution(1) $ 117,568 $ 135,714 $ 138,501 $ 18,146 $ 2,787 15.4% 2.1% Segment Contribution(1) as a Percentage of Revenue 21.8 % 20.1 % 18.1 % (1)See Note 9 to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for definition of Contribution and for the basis on which allocations are made and a reconciliation of Contribution to income before provision for income taxes and minority interest on a consolidated basis. Revenue in our International Physical Business segment increased 13.0% during the year ended December 31, 2008 over 2007, primarily due to internal growth of 7% and the growing impact of our acquisitions in Europe and Asia Pacific, which combined contributed 4% to revenue growth year over year. Further, favorable currency fluctuations during 2008, primarily in Europe, resulted in increased revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, of approximately 2% compared to 2007. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue decreased in 2008 primarily due to special project revenue in Europe in 2007 that did not repeat in 2008, increased compensation expense due to incentives associated with certain acquisitions, and incremental rental charges related to our decision to exit a leased facility in the U.K. Revenue in our International Physical Business segment increased 25.5% during the year ended December 31, 2007, due to internal growth of 12%, and acquisitions in Europe and Latin America. Further, favorable currency fluctuations during the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily in Europe, resulted in increased revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, of approximately 10% compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue decreased in the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily due to the acquisition of lower margin shredding and document management solutions businesses in Europe and Latin America, the impact of start up costs in certain international joint ventures and the loss of gross margin associated with the July, 2006 fire in one of our London, England facilities. Offsetting these decreases in contribution as a percent of segment revenue were higher margin special projects, in particular two large public sector contracts in Europe, one that was completed in the third quarter of 2007 and one completed in 2008. 47 Table of Contents Worldwide Digital Business Dollar Change Percentage Change Year Ended December 31, from 2006 to 2007 from 2007 to 2008 from 2006 to 2007 from 2007 to 2008 2006 2007 2008 Segment Revenue $ 139,998 $ 163,218 $ 223,006 $ 23,220 $ 59,788 16.6% 36.6% Segment Contribution(1) $ 9,779 $ 23,799 $ 36,663 $ 14,020 $ 12,864 143.4% 54.1% Segment Contribution(1) as a Percentage of Revenue 7.0 % 14.6 % 16.4 % (1)See Note 9 to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for definition of Contribution and for the basis on which allocations are made and a reconciliation of Contribution to income before provision for income taxes and minority interest on a consolidated basis. During the year ended December 31, 2008, revenue in our Worldwide Digital Business segment increased 36.6% over 2007, due to the acquisition of Stratify in December 2007 and strong internal growth of 12%. The increase in internal growth is primarily attributable to growth in digital storage revenue from our online backup service offerings, offset by a large license sale that occurred in 2007 and did not repeat in 2008. Contribution in the Worldwide Digital Business segment increased in dollar terms due to our significant year over year revenue gains. During the year ended December 31, 2007, revenue in our Worldwide Digital Business segment increased 16.6%, due primarily to strong internal growth of 14% and the acquisition of Stratify in December 2007. The increase is primarily attributable to growth in digital storage revenue from our online backup service offerings for both personal computers and remote servers, and growth in storage of email archiving. Contribution as a percent of segment revenue increased due to the full benefit of the integration of the LiveVault acquisition and the write off of $5.9 million of previously deferred costs, primarily internal labor costs, associated with internal use software development projects that were discontinued prior to being implemented in 2006 and did not repeat in 2007, which offset the impact of increases in engineering headcount. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following is a summary of our cash balances and cash flows (in thousands) as of and for the years ended December 31, 2006 2007 2008 Cash flows provided by operating activities $ 374,282 $ 484,644 $ 537,029 Cash flows used in investing activities (466,714 ) (866,635 ) (459,594 ) Cash flows provided by financing activities 82,734 457,005 87,368 Cash and cash equivalents at the end of year 45,369 125,607 278,370 Net cash provided by operating activities was $537.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $484.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in non cash charges of $151.3 million offset by a decrease in net income of $71.1 million and an increase in the use of working capital of $27.8 million over the prior year. Operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased as a result of a $24.1 million cash gain on the settlement of a British pound sterling foreign currency forward contract. Due to the nature of our businesses, we make significant capital expenditures and additions to customer acquisition costs. Our capital expenditures are primarily related to growth and include investments in storage systems, information systems and discretionary investments in real estate. Cash paid for our capital expenditures and additions to customer acquisition costs during the year ended 48 Table of Contents December 31, 2008 amounted to $386.7 million and $14.2 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2008, capital expenditures, net and additions to customer acquisition costs were funded primarily with cash flows provided by operating activities, borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and cash equivalents on hand. Excluding acquisitions, we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately $420 million in the year ending December 31, 2009. Included in our estimated capital expenditures for 2009 is approximately $55 million of opportunity driven real estate purchases. Net cash provided by financing activities was $87.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we had gross borrowings under our revolving credit and term loan facilities and other debt of $800.0 million, $295.5 million of proceeds from the sale of senior subordinated notes, $16.1 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plan and $5.1 million of excess tax benefits from stock based compensation. We used the proceeds from these financing transactions to repay revolving credit and term loan facilities and other debt ($957.5 million), $71.9 million for the early retirement of our 81/4% Notes, and to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures. Due to the declining economic environment in 2008, the current fair market values of vans, trucks and mobile shredding units within our vehicle fleet portfolio, which we lease, have declined. As a result, certain vehicle leases that previously met the requirements to be considered operating leases will be classified as capital leases upon renewal. The impact of this change on our consolidated cash flow statement in 2009 will be that approximately $18 million of payments related to these leases previously reflected as a use of cash within the operating activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows will be reflected as a use of cash within the financing activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows. During 2008, the stability of the global financial system came into question. Several banks, some of them members of our syndicated revolving credit facility, went bankrupt or were forced to merge with stronger institutions. Banks stopped lending to each other, thereby freezing credit globally. In September 2008, in response to this global credit crisis, we elected to increase our borrowings under our revolving credit facility by $150.0 million to ensure access to these funds. We subsequently repaid $100.0 million of these borrowings in the fourth quarter. As of December 31, 2008, we had sufficient cash on hand to repay all of the borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility, which is supported by a group of 24 banks and or financial institutions. Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, money market funds and time deposits. As of December 31, 2008, we had significant concentrations of credit risk with four global banks and four "Triple A" rated money market funds which we consider to be large, highly rated investment grade institutions. As of December 31, 2008, our cash and cash equivalent balance was $278.4 million, which included money market funds and time deposits amounting to $203.3 million. A substantial portion of these money market funds are invested in U.S. treasuries. 49 Table of Contents We are highly leveraged and expect to continue to be highly leveraged for the foreseeable future. Our consolidated debt as of December 31, 2008 was comprised of the following (in thousands): Revolving Credit Facility(1) $ 219,388 Term Loan Facility(1) 404,400 85/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013 (the "85/8% notes")(2) 447,961 71/4% GBP Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 (the "71/4% notes")(2) 217,185 73/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2015 (the "73/4% notes")(2) 436,768 65/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016 (the "65/8% notes")(2) 316,541 71/2% CAD Senior Subordinated Notes due 2017(the "Subsidiary Notes")(3) 143,203 83/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018 (the "83/4% notes")(2) 200,000 8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018 (the "8% notes")(2) 49,720 63/4% Euro Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018 (the "63/4% notes")(2) 356,875 8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020 (the "8% notes due 2020")(2) 300,000 Real Estate Mortgages, Seller Notes and Other 151,174 Total Long term Debt 3,243,215 Less Current Portion (35,751 ) Long term Debt, Net of Current Portion $ 3,207,464 (1)The capital stock or other equity interests of most of our U.S. subsidiaries, and up to 66% of the capital stock or other equity interests of our first tier foreign subsidiaries, are pledged to secure these debt instruments, together with all intercompany obligations of foreign subsidiaries owed to us or to one of our U.S. subsidiary guarantors. (2)Collectively referred to as the Parent Notes. Iron Mountain Incorporated ("IMI") is the direct obligor on the Parent Notes, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior subordinated basis, by substantially all of its direct and indirect wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries (the "Guarantors"). These guarantees are joint and several obligations of the Guarantors. Iron Mountain Canada Corporation ("Canada Company") and the remainder of our subsidiaries do not guarantee the Parent Notes. (3)Canada Company is the direct obligor on the Subsidiary Notes, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior subordinated basis, by IMI and the Guarantors. These guarantees are joint and several obligations of IMI and the Guarantors. Our revolving credit and term loan facilities, as well as our indentures, use earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") based calculations as primary measures of financial performance, including leverage ratios. IMIs revolving credit and term leverage ratio was 4.5 and 3.8 as of December 31, 2007 and 2008, respectively, compared to a maximum allowable ratio of 5.5. Similarly, our bond leverage ratio, per the indentures, was 5.1 and 4.5 as of December 31, 2007 and 2008, respectively, compared to a maximum allowable ratio of 6.5. Noncompliance with these leverage ratios would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we designated as Excluded Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the indentures), certain of our subsidiaries that own our assets and conduct operations in the United Kingdom. As a result of such designation, these subsidiaries are now subject to substantially all of the covenants of the indentures, except that they are not required to provide a guarantee, and the EBITDA and debt of these subsidiaries is included for purposes of calculating the leverage ratio. Our ability to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, working capital levels and capital structure, which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors which may be beyond our control. There can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future 50 Table of Contents financings will be available on acceptable terms or in amounts sufficient to enable us to service or refinance our indebtedness, or to make necessary capital expenditures. In June 2008, we completed an underwritten public offering of $300 million in aggregate principal amount of our 8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020, which were issued at par. Our net proceeds of $295.5 million, after paying the underwriters discounts and commissions, was used to (a) redeem the remaining $71.9 million of aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 81/4% notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, all of which were called for redemption in June 2008 and paid off in July 2008, (b) repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and (c) for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and investments. We recorded a charge to other expense (income), net of $0.3 million in the second quarter of 2008 related to the early extinguishment of the 81/4% notes, which consists of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts related to the 81/4% notes. On April 16, 2007, we entered into a new credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") to replace the existing IMI revolving credit and term loan facilities of $750 million and the existing IME revolving credit and term loan facilities of 200 million British pounds sterling. On November 9, 2007, we increased the aggregate amount available to be borrowed under the Credit Agreement from $900 million to $1.2 billion. The Credit Agreement consists of revolving credit facilities where we can borrow, subject to certain limitations as defined in the Credit Agreement, up to an aggregate amount of $790 million (including Canadian dollar and multi currency revolving credit facilities), and a $410 million term loan facility. In the third quarter of 2008, the capacity under our revolving credit facility was decreased from an aggregate amount of $790 million to an aggregate amount of $765 million due to the bankruptcy of one of our lenders. Our revolving credit facility is supported by a group of 24 banks. Our subsidiaries, Canada Company and Iron Mountain Switzerland GmbH, may borrow directly under the Canadian revolving credit and multi currency revolving credit facilities, respectively. Additional subsidiary borrowers may be added under the multi currency revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility terminates on April 16, 2012. With respect to the term loan facility, quarterly loan payments of approximately $1.0 million are required through maturity on April 16, 2014, at which time the remaining outstanding principal balance of the term loan facility is due. The interest rate on borrowings under the Credit Agreement varies depending on our choice of interest rate and currency options, plus an applicable margin. IMI guarantees the obligations of each of the subsidiary borrowers under the Credit Agreement, and substantially all of our U.S. subsidiaries guarantee the obligations of IMI and the subsidiary borrowers. The capital stock or other equity interests of most of our U.S. subsidiaries, and up to 66% of the capital stock or other equity interests of our first tier foreign subsidiaries, are pledged to secure the Credit Agreement, together with all intercompany obligations of foreign subsidiaries owed to us or to one of our U.S. subsidiary guarantors. We recorded a charge to other expense (income), net of approximately $5.7 million in 2007 related to the early retirement of the old IMI and IME revolving credit facilities and term loans, representing the write off of deferred financing costs. As of December 31, 2008, we had $219.4 million of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility, of which $50.0 million was denominated in U.S. dollars and the remaining balance was denominated in Canadian dollars (CAD 207.0 million); we also had various outstanding letters of credit totaling $39.2 million. The remaining availability, based on IMIs leverage ratio, which is calculated based on the last 12 months EBITDA as defined in the Credit Agreement and current external debt, under the revolving credit facility on December 31, 2008, was $506.4 million. The interest rate in effect under the revolving credit facility ranged from 3.5% to 3.8% and term loan facility was 3.7%, respectively, as of December 31, 2008. The Credit Agreement, our indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to complete acquisitions, pay cash dividends, incur indebtedness, make investments, sell assets and take certain other corporate actions. The covenants do not contain a rating trigger. Therefore, a change in 51 Table of Contents our debt rating would not trigger a default under the Credit Agreement and our indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness. We were in compliance with all debt covenants in material agreements as of December 31, 2008. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2008 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 13 Years 35 Years More than 5 Years Capital Lease Obligations $ 131,687 $ 21,042 $ 34,262 $ 26,093 $ 50,290 Long Term Debt Obligations (excluding Capital Lease Obligations) 3,112,266 14,709 11,858 677,570 2,408,129 Interest Payments(1) 1,595,476 220,988 438,387 392,234 543,867 Operating Lease Obligations 3,082,950 221,949 389,833 365,621 2,105,547 Purchase and Asset Retirement Obligations(2) 91,409 36,483 41,408 4,169 9,349 Total(3) $ 8,013,788 $ 515,171 $ 915,748 $ 1,465,687 $ 5,117,182 (1)Amounts include variable rate interest payments, which are calculated utilizing the applicable interest rates as of December 31, 2008; see Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (2)In connection with some of our acquisitions, we have potential earn out obligations that may be payable in the event businesses we acquired meet certain financial objectives. These payments are based on the future results of these operations, and our estimate of the maximum contingent earn out payments we may be required to make under all such agreements as of December 31, 2008 is approximately $26.1 million. (3)The table above excludes $84.6 million in uncertain tax positions as we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities. We expect to meet our cash flow requirements for the next twelve months from cash generated from operations, existing cash, cash equivalents, borrowings under the Credit Agreement and other financings, which may include secured credit facilities, securitizations and mortgage or capital lease financings. We expect to meet our long term cash flow requirements using the same means described above, as well as the potential issuance of debt or equity securities as we deem appropriate. See Note 4, 7, and 10 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Regulation S K Item 303(a)(4)(ii). Net Operating Loss, Alternative Minimum Tax and Foreign Tax Credit Carryforwards We have federal net operating loss carryforwards which begin to expire in 2018 through 2024 of $48.4 million at December 31, 2008 to reduce future federal taxable income. We have an asset for state net operating losses of $23.3 million (net of federal tax benefit), which begins to expire in 2009 through 2025, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 99%. We have assets for foreign net operating losses of $22.9 million, with various expiration dates, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 95%. Additionally, we have federal alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of $1.6 million, which 52 Table of Contents have no expiration date and are available to reduce future income taxes, federal research credits of $1.7 million which begin to expire in 2010, and foreign tax credits of $54.7 million, which begin to expire in 2014 through 2018. Inflation Certain of our expenses, such as wages and benefits, insurance, occupancy costs and equipment repair and replacement, are subject to normal inflationary pressures. Although to date we have been able to offset inflationary cost increases through increased operating efficiencies and the negotiation of favorable long term real estate leases, we can give no assurance that we will be able to offset any future inflationary cost increases through similar efficiencies, leases or increased storage or service charges.  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, money market funds and time deposits. As of December 31, 2008, we had significant concentration of credit risk with four global banks and four "Triple A" rated money market funds which we consider to be large, highly rated investment grade institutions. As of December 31, 2008, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $278.4 million, which included money market funds and time deposits amounting to $203.3 million. A substantial portion of these money market funds are invested in U.S. treasuries. Interest Rate Risk Given the recurring nature of our revenues and the long term nature of our asset base, we have the ability and the preference to use long term, fixed interest rate debt to finance our business, thereby helping to preserve our long term returns on invested capital. We target approximately 75% of our debt portfolio to be fixed with respect to interest rates. Occasionally, we will use interest rate swaps as a tool to maintain our targeted level of fixed rate debt. See Notes 3 and 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2008, we had $640.4 million of variable rate debt outstanding with a weighted average variable interest rate of 4.1%, and $2,602.8 million of fixed rate debt outstanding. As of December 31, 2008, 80.3% of our total debt outstanding was fixed. If the weighted average variable interest rate on our variable rate debt had increased by 1%, our net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 would have been reduced by $4.0 million. See Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K for a discussion of our long term indebtedness, including the fair values of such indebtedness as of December 31, 2008. Currency Risk Our investments in IME, Canada Company, Iron Mountain Mexico, SA de RL de CV, Iron Mountain South America, Ltd., Iron Mountain Australia Pty Ltd., Iron Mountain New Zealand Ltd. and our other international investments may be subject to risks and uncertainties related to fluctuations in currency valuation. Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. However, our international revenues and expenses are generated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate, primarily the Euro, Canadian dollar and British pound sterling. Declines in the value of the local currencies in which we are paid relative to the U.S. dollar will cause revenues in U.S. dollar terms to decrease and dollar denominated liabilities to increase in local currency. The impact of currency fluctuations on our earnings is mitigated significantly by the fact that most operating and other expenses are also incurred and paid in the local currency. We also have several 53 Table of Contents intercompany obligations between our foreign subsidiaries and IMI and our U.S. based subsidiaries. In addition Iron Mountain Switzerland GmbH and our foreign subsidiaries and IME also have intercompany obligations between them. These intercompany obligations are primarily denominated in the local currency of the foreign subsidiary. We have adopted and implemented a number of strategies to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in currency valuations. One strategy is to finance certain of our international subsidiaries with debt that is denominated in local currencies, thereby providing a natural hedge. In determining the amount of any such financing, we take into account local tax strategies among other factors. Another strategy we utilize is for IMI to borrow in foreign currencies to hedge our intercompany financing activities. Finally, on occasion, we enter into currency swaps to temporarily or permanently hedge an overseas investment, such as a major acquisition to lock in certain transaction economics. We have implemented these strategies for our four foreign investments in the U.K., Continental Europe and Canada. Specifically, through our 150 million British pounds sterling denominated 71/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 and our 255 million 63/4% Euro Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018, we effectively hedge most of our outstanding intercompany loans denominated in British pounds sterling and Euros. Canada Company has financed its capital needs through direct borrowings in Canadian dollars under the Credit Agreement and its 175 million CAD denominated 71/2% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2017. This creates a tax efficient natural currency hedge. In the third quarter of 2007, we designated a portion of our 63/4% Euro Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018 issued by IMI as a hedge of net investment of certain of our Euro denominated subsidiaries. As a result, we recorded $10.5 million ($6.3 million, net of tax) of foreign exchange gains related to the "marking to market" of such debt to currency translation adjustments which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive items, net included in stockholders equity for the year ended December 31, 2008. In May 2007, we entered into forward contracts to exchange $146.1 million U.S. dollars for 73.6 million in British pounds sterling to hedge our intercompany exposures with IME. These forward contracts typically settle on no more than a quarterly basis, at which time we may enter into new forward contracts for the same underlying amounts to continue to hedge movements in the underlying currencies. At the time of settlement, we either pay or receive the net settlement amount from the forward contract and recognize this amount in other expense (income), net in the accompanying statement of operations as a realized foreign exchange gain or loss. We have not designated these forward contracts as hedges. We recorded a realized gain in connection with these forward contracts of $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. At the end of each month, we mark the outstanding forward contracts to market and record an unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss for the mark to market valuation. As of December 31, 2008, we recorded an unrealized foreign exchange gain of $13.7 million in other expense (income), net in the accompanying statement of operations. As of December 31, 2008, except as noted above, our currency exposures to intercompany balances are unhedged. The impact of devaluation or depreciating currency on an entity depends on the residual effect on the local economy and the ability of an entity to raise prices and or reduce expenses. Due to our constantly changing currency exposure and the potential substantial volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange fluctuations on our business. The effect of a change in foreign exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the "Accumulated Other Comprehensive Items, net" component of stockholders equity. A 10% depreciation in year end 2008 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction in our stockholders equity of approximately $59.9 million.
