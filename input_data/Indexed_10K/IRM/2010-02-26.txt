Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with "Item 6. Selected Financial Data" and the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto and the other financial and operating information included elsewhere in this filing. This discussion contains "forward looking statements," as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and in other federal securities laws. See "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements" on page ii of this filing and "Item 1A. Risk Factors" beginning on page 14 of this filing. Overview Our revenues consist of storage revenues as well as service revenues. Storage revenues, both physical and digital, which are considered a key performance indicator for the information management services industry, consist of largely recurring periodic charges related to the storage of materials or data (generally on a per unit basis), which are typically retained by customers for many years, and have accounted for over 54% of total consolidated revenues in each of the last five years. Our annual revenues from these fixed periodic storage fees have grown for 21 consecutive years. Service revenues are comprised of charges for related core service activities and a wide array of complementary products and services. Included in core service revenues are: (1) the handling of records including the addition of new records, temporary removal of records from storage, refiling of removed records, destruction of records, and permanent withdrawals from storage; (2) courier operations, consisting primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request; (3) secure shredding of sensitive documents; and (4) other recurring services including maintenance and support contracts. Our complementary services revenues include special project work, data restoration projects, fulfillment services, consulting services and product sales (including software licenses, specially designed storage containers and related supplies). Our secure shredding business generates the sale of recycled paper (included in complementary services revenues), the price of which can fluctuate from period to period, adding to the volatility and reducing the predictability of that revenue stream. Over time our service revenues have grown at a faster pace than our storage revenues, as a result, storage revenues as a percent of consolidated revenues has declined. Our consolidated revenues are also subject to variations caused by the net effect of foreign currency translation on revenue derived from outside the U.S. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009, we derived approximately 32%, 32% and 30%, respectively, of our total revenues from outside the U.S. We recognize revenue when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Storage and service revenues are recognized in the month the respective storage or service is provided and customers are generally billed on a monthly basis on contractually agreed upon terms. Amounts related to future storage or prepaid service contracts, including maintenance and support contracts, for customers where storage fees or services are billed in advance, are accounted for as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the applicable storage or service period or when the service is performed. Revenue from the sales of products is recognized when shipped to the customer and title has passed to the customer. Cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization) consists primarily of wages and benefits for field personnel, facility occupancy costs (including rent and utilities), transportation expenses (including vehicle leases and fuel), other product cost of sales and other equipment costs and supplies. Of these, wages and benefits and facility occupancy costs are the most significant. Trends in total wages and benefits dollars and as a percentage of total consolidated revenue are influenced by changes in headcount and compensation levels, achievement of incentive compensation targets, workforce productivity and variability in costs associated with medical insurance and workers compensation. 26 Table of Contents Trends in facility occupancy costs are impacted by the total number of facilities we occupy, the mix of properties we own versus properties we occupy under operating leases, fluctuations in per square foot occupancy costs, and the levels of utilization of these properties. Due to the declining economic environment in 2008, the current fair market values of vans, trucks and mobile shredding units within our vehicle fleet portfolio, which we lease, declined. As a result, certain vehicle leases that previously met the requirements to be considered operating leases are now classified as capital leases upon renewal, or at lease inception, for new leases. The impact of this change with respect to these leases has been to lower vehicle rent expense (a component of transportation costs within cost of sales) by approximately $22.4 million, offset by an increased amount of combined depreciation (by approximately $20.2 million) and interest expense (by approximately $3.3 million) for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. The expansion of our European, secure shredding and digital services businesses has impacted the major cost of sales components. Our European and secure shredding operations are more labor intensive than our core U.S. physical businesses and therefore increase our labor costs as a percentage of consolidated revenues. This trend is partially offset by our digital services businesses, which require significantly less direct labor. Our secure shredding operations incur less facility costs and higher transportation costs as a percentage of revenues compared to our core physical businesses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits for management, administrative, information technology, sales, account management and marketing personnel, as well as expenses related to communications and data processing, travel, professional fees, bad debts, training, office equipment and supplies. Trends in total wages and benefits dollars and as a percentage of total consolidated revenue are influenced by changes in headcount and compensation levels, achievement of incentive compensation targets, workforce productivity and variability in costs associated with medical insurance. The overhead structure of our expanding European and Asian operations, as compared to our North American operations, is more labor intensive and has not achieved the same level of overhead leverage, which may result in an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of consolidated revenue, as our European and Asian operations become a more meaningful percentage of our consolidated results. Similarly, our digital services businesses require a higher level of overhead, particularly in the area of information technology, than our core physical businesses. Our depreciation and amortization charges result primarily from the capital intensive nature of our business. The principal components of depreciation relate to storage systems, which include racking, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and software, and buildings. Amortization relates primarily to customer relationships and acquisition costs and core technology and is impacted by the nature and timing of acquisitions. Our consolidated revenues and expenses are subject to variations caused by the net effect of foreign currency translation on revenues and expenses incurred by our entities outside the U.S. In 2007, we saw increases in both revenues and expenses as a result of the strengthening of the Canadian dollar, Euro and British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar. During 2008, we saw net increases in both revenues and expenses as a result of the strengthening of the Euro, the Brazilian real and the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar, offset by the weakening of the British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. In the third quarter of 2008, we saw a dramatic strengthening of the U.S. dollar in comparison to all the major foreign currencies of our most significant international markets, which lead to a decrease in reported revenue and expenses in the fourth quarter of 2008. In 2009, we saw decreases in both revenues and expenses as a result of the weakening of the British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and Euro against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. It is difficult to predict how much foreign currency exchange rates will fluctuate in the future and how those fluctuations will impact our consolidated statement of operations. Due to the expansion of our 27 Table of Contents international operations, these fluctuations have become material on individual balances. However, because both the revenues and expenses are denominated in the local currency of the country in which they are derived or incurred, the impact of currency fluctuations on our operating income and operating margin is mitigated. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we compare the percentage change in the results from one period to another period in this report using constant currency disclosure. The constant currency growth rates are calculated by translating the 2007 results at the 2008 average exchange rates and the 2008 results at the 2009 average exchange rates. The following table is a comparison of underlying average exchange rates of the foreign currencies that had the most significant impact on our U.S. dollar reported revenues and expenses: Average Exchange Rates for the Year Ended December 31, Percentage (Strengthening)/ Weakening of the U.S. dollar 2008 2009 British pound sterling* $ 1.944 $ 1.544 (20.6 )% Canadian dollar $ 0.944 $ 0.880 (6.8 )% Euro* $ 1.497 $ 1.366 (8.8 )% Average Exchange Rates for the Year Ended December 31, Percentage (Strengthening)/ Weakening of the U.S. dollar 2007 2008 British pound sterling* $ 1.983 $ 1.944 (2.0 )% Canadian dollar $ 0.935 $ 0.944 1.0 % Euro* $ 1.344 $ 1.497 11.4 % *Corresponding to the appropriate periods based on Iron Mountain Europe Limiteds fiscal year ended October 31. Non GAAP Measures Adjusted Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization, or Adjusted OIBDA Adjusted OIBDA is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization expenses, excluding (gain) loss on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net. Adjusted OIBDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted OIBDA by total revenues. We use multiples of current or projected Adjusted OIBDA in conjunction with our discounted cash flow models to determine our overall enterprise valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets. We believe Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA Margin provide current and potential investors with relevant and useful information regarding our ability to generate cash flow to support business investment. These measures are an integral part of the internal reporting system we use to assess and evaluate the operating performance of our business. Adjusted OIBDA does not include certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results, specifically: (1) gains and losses on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net, (2) other (income) expense, net, (3) cumulative effect of change in accounting principle and (4) net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. Adjusted OIBDA also does not include interest expense, net and the provision for income taxes. These expenses are associated with our capitalization and tax structures, which we do not consider when evaluating the operating profitability of our core operations. Finally, Adjusted OIBDA does not include depreciation and amortization expenses, in order to eliminate the impact of capital investments, which we evaluate by comparing capital expenditures to incremental revenue generated and as a 28 Table of Contents percentage of total revenues. Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA Margin should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), such as operating or net income or cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP). Reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA to Operating Income and Net Income (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2007 2008 2009 Adjusted OIBDA $ 698,540 $ 790,751 $ 868,022 Less: Depreciation and Amortization 249,294 290,738 319,072 (Gain) Loss on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net (5,472 ) 7,483 406 Operating Income 454,718 492,530 548,544 Less: Interest Expense, Net 228,593 236,635 227,790 Other Expense (Income), Net 3,101 31,028 (12,079 ) Provision for Income Taxes 69,010 142,924 110,527 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling interests 920 (94 ) 1,429 Net Income Attributable to Iron Mountain Incorporated $ 153,094 $ 82,037 $ 220,877 Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and for the period then ended. On an on going basis, we evaluate the estimates used. We base our estimates on historical experience, actuarial estimates, current conditions and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Our critical accounting policies include the following, which are listed in no particular order: Revenue Recognition Our revenues consist of storage revenues as well as service revenues and are reflected net of sales and value added taxes. Storage revenues, both physical and digital, which are considered a key performance indicator for the information management services industry, consist of largely recurring periodic charges related to the storage of materials or data (generally on a per unit basis). Service revenues are comprised of charges for related core service activities and a wide array of complementary products and services. Included in core service revenues are: (1) the handling of records including addition of new records, temporary removal of records from storage, refilling of removed records, destruction of records, and permanent withdrawals from storage; (2) courier operations, consisting primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request; (3) secure shredding of sensitive documents; and (4) other recurring services including maintenance and support contracts. Our complementary services revenues include special project work, data restoration projects, fulfillment services, consulting services and product sales (including software licenses, specially designed storage 29 Table of Contents containers and related supplies). Our secure shredding revenues include the sale of recycled paper (included in complementary services), the price of which can fluctuate from period to period, adding to the volatility and reducing the predictability of that revenue stream. We recognize revenue when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Storage and service revenues are recognized in the month the respective storage or service is provided and customers are generally billed on a monthly basis on contractually agreed upon terms. Amounts related to future storage or prepaid service contracts, including maintenance and support contracts, for customers where storage fees or services are billed in advance are accounted for as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the applicable storage or service period or when the service is performed. Revenue from the sales of products is recognized when shipped to the customer and title has passed to the customer. Sales of software licenses are recognized at the time of product delivery to our customer or reseller and maintenance and support agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement. Software license sales and maintenance and support accounted for less than 1% of our 2009 consolidated revenues. Within our Worldwide Digital Business segment, in certain instances, we process and host data for customers. In these instances, the processing fees are deferred and recognized over the estimated service period. Accounting for Acquisitions Part of our growth strategy has included the acquisition of numerous businesses. The purchase price of these acquisitions has been determined after due diligence of the acquired business, market research, strategic planning, and the forecasting of expected future results and synergies. Estimated future results and expected synergies are subject to revisions as we integrate each acquisition and attempt to leverage resources. Each acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting as defined under the applicable accounting standards at the date of each acquisition. Accounting for these acquisitions has resulted in the capitalization of the cost in excess of fair value of the net assets acquired in each of these acquisitions as goodwill. We estimated the fair values of the assets acquired in each acquisition as of the date of acquisition and these estimates are subject to adjustment. These estimates are subject to final assessments of the fair value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, operating leases and deferred income taxes. We complete these assessments within one year of the date of acquisition. See Note 6 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In connection with each of our acquisitions, we have undertaken certain restructurings of the acquired businesses to realize efficiencies and potential cost savings. Our restructuring activities include the elimination of duplicate facilities, reductions in staffing levels, and other costs associated with exiting certain activities of the businesses we acquire. Our acquisitions after January 1, 2009 will be accounted for under newly promulgated accounting guidance. While many of the fundamentals described above have not changed, several have. In particular, all acquisition costs and restructuring activity will be charged to operations rather than being capitalized as part of the purchase price. In addition, while in the past we only recorded contingent consideration when paid, we now must estimate it at the time of acquisition and account for that as part of the initial purchase price allocation. Any subsequent changes in this estimate will directly impact the consolidated statement of operations. While we finalize our plans to restructure the businesses we acquire within one year of the date of acquisition, it may take more than one year to complete all activities related to the restructuring of an acquired business. 30 Table of Contents Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Credit Memos We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments and disputes regarding billing and service issues. When calculating the allowance, we consider our past loss experience, current and prior trends in our aged receivables and credit memo activity, current economic conditions, and specific circumstances of individual receivable balances. If the financial condition of our customers were to significantly change, resulting in a significant improvement or impairment of their ability to make payments, an adjustment of the allowance may be required. We consider accounts receivable to be delinquent after such time as reasonable means of collection have been exhausted. We charge off uncollectible balances as circumstances warrant, generally no later than one year past due. As of December 31, 2008 and 2009, our allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos balance totaled $19.6 million and $25.5 million, respectively. Impairment of Tangible and Intangible Assets Assets subject to amortization: We review long lived assets and all amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operation to which the assets relate to their carrying amount. The operations are generally distinguished by the business segment and geographic region in which they operate. If the operation is determined to be unable to recover the carrying amount of its assets, then intangible assets are written down first, followed by the other long lived assets of the operation, to fair value. Fair value is based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, depending upon the nature of the assets. Goodwill Assets not subject to amortization: Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. We have selected October 1 as our annual goodwill impairment review date. We performed our annual goodwill impairment review as of October 1, 2007, 2008 and 2009 and noted no impairment of goodwill. In making this assessment, we rely on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, anticipated future cash flows, transactions and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. As of December 31, 2009, no factors were identified that would alter this assessment. When changes occur in the composition of one or more reporting units, the goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units affected based on their relative fair values. Reporting unit valuations have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit or a combined approach based on the present value of future cash flows and market and transaction multiples of revenues and earnings. The income approach incorporates many assumptions including future growth rates, discount factors, expected capital expenditures and income tax cash flows. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in a goodwill impairment in future periods. In conjunction with our annual goodwill impairment reviews, we reconcile the sum of the valuations of all of our reporting units to our market capitalization as of such dates. Our reporting units at which level we performed our goodwill impairment analysis as of October 1, 2009 were as follows: North America (excluding Fulfillment); Fulfillment; Europe; Worldwide Digital Business (excluding Stratify); Stratify; Latin America; and Asia Pacific. As of December 31, 2009, the carrying value of goodwill, net amounted to $1.7 billion, $1.3 million, $470.9 million, $124.0 million, $130.0 million, $28.4 million and $60.9 million for North America (excluding Fulfillment), Fulfillment, Europe, Worldwide Digital Business (excluding Stratify), Stratify, Latin America and Asia Pacific, respectively. Our North America (excluding Fulfillment); Fulfillment; Europe; Worldwide Digital Business (excluding Stratify); Stratify and Latin America reporting units have fair values as of October 1, 2009 31 Table of Contents that significantly exceed their carrying values. Our Asia Pacific reporting unit has a fair value that exceeds its carrying value by 9% as of October 1, 2009. Asia Pacific is still in the investment stage and accordingly its fair value does not exceed its carrying value by a significant margin at this point in time. A deterioration of the Asia Pacific business or the business not achieving the forecasted results could lead to an impairment in future periods. Accounting for Internal Use Software We develop various software applications for internal use. Computer software costs associated with internal use software are expensed as incurred until certain capitalization criteria are met. Payroll and related costs for employees who are directly associated with, and who devote time to, the development of internal use computer software projects (to the extent time is spent directly on the project) are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the software. Capitalization begins when the design stage of the project has been completed and it is probable that the application will be completed and used to perform the function intended. Depreciation begins when the software is placed in service. Computer software costs that are capitalized are periodically evaluated for impairment. It may be necessary for us to write off amounts associated with the development of internal use software if the project cannot be completed as intended. Our expansion into new technology based service offerings requires the development of internal use software that will be susceptible to rapid and significant changes in technology. We may be required to write off unamortized costs or shorten the estimated useful life if an internal use software program is replaced with an alternative tool prior to the end of the softwares estimated useful life. General uncertainties related to expansion into digital businesses, including the timing of introduction and market acceptance of our services, may adversely impact the recoverability of these assets. As of December 31, 2008 and 2009, capitalized labor net of accumulated depreciation was $45.6 million and $41.4 million, respectively. See Note 2(f) to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009, we wrote off $1.3 million, $0.6 million and $0.6 million, respectively, of previously deferred software costs in Corporate, primarily internal labor costs, associated with internal use software development projects that were discontinued after implementation, which resulted in a loss on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net. Income Taxes We have recorded a valuation allowance, amounting to $42.1 million as of December 31, 2009, to reduce our deferred tax assets, primarily associated with certain state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards, to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We have federal net operating loss carryforwards which begin to expire in 2019 through 2025 of $38.6 million ($13.5 million, tax effected) at December 31, 2009 to reduce future federal taxable income. We have an asset for state net operating losses of $16.1 million (net of federal tax benefit), which begins to expire in 2010 through 2025, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 99%. We have assets for foreign net operating losses of $29.7 million, with various expiration dates, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 81%. Additionally, we have federal research credits of $0.9 million which begin to expire in 2010, and foreign tax credits of $59.3 million, which begin to expire in 2014 through 2019. Based on current expectations and plans, we expect to fully utilize our foreign tax credit carryforwards prior to their expiration. If actual results differ unfavorably from certain of our estimates used, we may not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred income tax assets and foreign tax credit carryforwards and additional valuation allowances may be required. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that our estimates reflected in the tax provisions and accruals will equal our actual results. These differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. 32 Table of Contents The evaluation of an uncertain tax position is a two step process. The first step is a recognition process whereby the company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The second step is a measurement process whereby a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is calculated to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We recognized a $16.6 million increase in the reserve related to uncertain tax positions, which was accounted for as a reduction to the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings in conjunction with the adoption of a new accounting standard related to uncertain tax positions. We are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. As of December 31, 2008 and 2009, we had approximately $84.6 million and $88.2 million, respectively, of reserves related to uncertain tax positions. The reversal of these reserves will be recorded as a reduction of our income tax provision if sustained. Although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in favorable or unfavorable changes in our estimates. We have elected to recognize interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as a component of the provision for income taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. We recorded $1.2 million, $4.5 million and $4.7 million for gross interest and penalties for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively. We had $8.1 million and $12.9 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties as of December 31, 2008 and 2009, respectively. We have not provided deferred taxes on book basis differences related to certain foreign subsidiaries because such basis differences are not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future and we intend to reinvest indefinitely outside the U.S. These basis differences arose primarily through the undistributed book earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The basis differences could be reversed through a sale of the subsidiaries, the receipt of dividends from subsidiaries as well as certain other events or actions on our part, which would result in an increase in our provision for income taxes. It is not practicable to calculate the amount of such basis differences. Stock Based Compensation We record stock based compensation expense, utilizing the straight line method, for the cost of stock options, restricted stock and shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan. Stock based compensation expense, included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009 was $13.9 million ($10.2 million after tax or $0.05 per basic and diluted share), $19.0 million ($15.7 million after tax or $0.08 per basic and diluted share) and $18.7 million ($14.7 million after tax or $0.07 per basic and diluted shares), respectively. The fair values of option grants are estimated on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model. Expected volatility and the expected term are the input factors to that model which require the most significant management judgment. Expected volatility is calculated utilizing daily historical volatility over a period that equates to the expected life of the option. The expected life (estimated period of time outstanding) is estimated using the historical exercise behavior of employees. Self Insured Liabilities We are self insured up to certain limits for costs associated with workers compensation claims, vehicle accidents, property and general business liabilities, and benefits paid under employee healthcare 33 Table of Contents and short term disability programs. At December 31, 2008 and 2009 there were approximately $39.6 million and $41.1 million, respectively, of self insurance accruals reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. The measurement of these costs requires the consideration of historical cost experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim. We account for these costs primarily through actuarial methods, which develop estimates of the undiscounted liability for claims incurred, including those claims incurred but not reported. These methods provide estimates of future ultimate claim costs based on claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. We believe the use of actuarial methods to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals. However, the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claims involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known. We believe our recorded obligations for these expenses are appropriate. Nevertheless, changes in healthcare costs, severity, and other factors can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Effective January 1, 2009, GAAP for noncontrolling interests changed. The presentation and disclosure requirements of noncontrolling interests have been applied to all of our financial statements, notes and other financial data retrospectively for all periods presented. In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") established the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (the "Codification") to become the source of authoritative U.S. GAAP recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities. Rules and interpretive releases of the SEC under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative U.S. GAAP for SEC registrants. The Codification was effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009. The Codification superseded all then existing non SEC accounting and reporting standards on July 1, 2009, and all other non grandfathered non SEC accounting literature not included in the Codification became nonauthoritative. The adoption of the Codification did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and results of operations. Effective at the start of a reporting entitys first fiscal year beginning after November 15, 2009, or January 1, 2010, for a calendar year end entity, the Codification will require more information about transfers of financial assets, including securitization transactions, and transactions where entities have continuing exposure to the risks related to transferred financial assets. The Codification eliminates the concept of a "qualifying special purpose entity," changes the requirements for derecognizing financial assets, and requires additional disclosures about an entitys involvement with variable interest entities and any significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement. A reporting entity will be required to disclose how its involvement with a variable interest entity affects the reporting entitys financial statements. We do not expect the adoption of these Codification updates to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and results of operations. In October 2009, the FASB issued amended guidance on multiple deliverable revenue arrangements and software revenue recognition. The multiple deliverable revenue arrangements updates to the Codification applies to all deliverables in contractual arrangements in all industries in which a vendor will perform multiple revenue generating activities. The change to the Codification creates a selling price hierarchy that an entity must use as evidence of fair value in separately accounting for all deliverables on a relative selling price basis which qualify for separation. The selling price hierarchy includes: (1) vendor specific objective evidence; (2) third party evidence and (3) estimated selling price. Broadly speaking, this update to the Codification will result in the possibility for some entities to recognize revenue earlier and more closely align with the economics of certain revenue arrangements if the other criteria for separation (e.g. standalone value to the customer) are 34 Table of Contents met. The software revenue recognition guidance was issued to address factors that entities should consider when determining whether the software and non software components function together to deliver the products essential functionality. The software revenue recognition updates to the Codification will allow revenue arrangements in which the software and non software components deliver together the products essential functionality to follow the multiple deliverable revenue recognition criteria as opposed to the criteria applicable to software revenue recognition. Both updates are effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010 and apply prospectively to new or materially modified revenue arrangements after its effective date. Early adoption is permitted; however, we do not anticipate early adopting. We are currently evaluating the impact of these Codification updates to our consolidated financial statements and results of operations. In January 2010, the FASB issued amended guidance improving disclosures about fair value measurements to add new requirements for disclosures about transfers into and out of Levels 1 and 2 and separate disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements relating to Level 3 measurements. The new guidance also clarifies existing fair value disclosures about the level of disaggregation and about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The Codification requires an entity, in determining the appropriate classes of assets and liabilities, to consider the nature and risks of the assets and liabilities as well as their placement in the fair value hierarchy (Level 1, 2 or 3). The Codification is effective for the first reporting period, including interim periods, beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the requirement to provide the Level 3 activity of purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a gross basis, which will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010.

(2)Our internal revenue growth rate represents the weighted average year over year growth rate of our revenues after removing the effects of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Our consolidated storage revenues increased $38.5 million, or 2.3%, to $1,696.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 and $158.8 million, or 10.6%, to $1,657.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, in comparison to the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase in 2009 is attributable to internal revenue growth of 6% resulting from strength in our North American Physical and International Physical operating segments, offset by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations of (4)%. Current economic factors have led to a moderation in our storage growth rate, as a result of longer new sales cycles in our digital business and lower new sales and higher destruction rates in our physical business. The increase in 2008 is attributable to internal revenue growth of 8% resulting from strength across all of our segments, as well as acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which had positive impacts of 2% and 1%, respectively. Consolidated service revenues decreased $80.0 million, or (5.7)%, to $1,317.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 from $1,397.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Service revenue internal growth was negative 1% as a result of complementary service revenue internal growth of negative 9% in 2009, partially offset by core services revenue internal growth of 4% over 2008. As expected, complementary service revenues decreased on a year over year basis primarily due to the completion of a large special project in Europe in the third quarter of 2008 and $34.4 million less revenue from the sale of recycled paper revenues resulting from a steep decline in recycled paper pricing. We also experienced softness in 2009 in the more discretionary revenues such as project revenues and fulfillment services. Core service revenue growth was also constrained by current economic trends and pressures on activity based service revenues related to the handling and transportation of items in storage and secure shredding. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations reduced reported service revenues by 5% for 2009 compared to 2008. Consolidated service revenues increased $166.3 million, or 13.5%, to $1,397.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 37 Table of Contents from $1,231.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase is attributable to internal growth of 8% (comprised of core services revenue internal growth of 10% and complementary service revenue internal growth of 4%), supported by strong growth in data protection and secure shredding revenues, increased recycled paper revenues driven by higher volumes and a year over year increase in the average prices for recycled paper, and fuel surcharges. Acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations also added 5% and 1%, respectively, to total growth in 2008 over 2007. For the reasons stated above, our consolidated revenues decreased $41.5 million, or (1.4)%, to $3,013.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 from $3,055.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Internal revenue growth was 3% for 2009. We calculate internal revenue growth in local currency for our international operations. For the year ended December 31, 2009, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations negatively impacted our reported revenues by 4% primarily due to the weakening of the British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and Euro against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. Our consolidated revenues increased $325.1 million, or 11.9%, to $3,055.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $2,730.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Internal revenue growth was 8% and 10% in 2008 and 2007, respectively, and acquisitions contributed 3% in both 2008 and 2007. For the year ended December 31, 2008, net favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that impacted our revenues were 1% and were primarily due to the strengthening of the Euro, the Brazilian real and the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar, offset by the weakening of the British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. For the year ended December 31, 2007, net favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that impacted our revenues were 3% and were primarily due to the strengthening of the British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and Euro against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. Internal Growth Eight Quarter Trend 2008 2009 First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Storage Revenue 8 % 8 % 8 % 8 % 7 % 6 % 7 % 5 % Service Revenue 10 % 9 % 9 % 5 % 0 % 1 % (4 )% 0 % Total Revenue 9 % 9 % 8 % 7 % 4 % 4 % 2 % 3 % During the past eight quarters our storage internal growth rate has ranged between 5% and 8%. The internal growth rate for service revenue is inherently more volatile than the storage revenue internal growth rate due to the more discretionary nature of certain complementary services we offer, such as large special projects, software licenses, and the volatility of prices for recycled paper. These revenues are often event driven and impacted to a greater extent by economic downturns as customers defer or cancel the purchase of certain services as a way to reduce their short term costs, and may be difficult to replicate in future periods. As a commodity, recycled paper prices are subject to the volatility of that market. We expect our consolidated internal revenue growth for 2010 to be between 4% and 6%. The internal growth rate for service revenues reflects the following: (1) growth in North American storage related service revenues, increased special project revenues and higher recycled paper revenues through the third quarter of 2008; (2) a large public sector contract in Europe that was completed in the third quarter of 2008; (3) declines in commodity prices for recycled paper and fuel, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008; (4) the expected softness in our complementary service revenues, such as project revenues and fulfillment services, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008; and (5) pressures on activity based service revenues related to the handling and transportation of items in storage and secure shredding. 38  Table of Contents OPERATING EXPENSES Cost of Sales Consolidated cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization) is comprised of the following expenses (in thousands): Percentage Change % of Consolidated Revenues Year Ended December 31, Percentage Change (Favorable)/ Unfavorable Dollar Change Constant Currency 2008 2009 Actual 2008 2009 Labor $ 674,466 $ 626,751 $ (47,715 ) (7.1 )% (2.5 )% 22.1 % 20.8 % (1.3 )% Facilities 413,968 408,836 (5,132 ) (1.2 )% 3.6 % 13.5 % 13.6 % 0.1 % Transportation 151,891 110,220 (41,671 ) (27.4 )% (23.8 )% 5.0 % 3.7 % (1.3 )% Product Cost of Sales and Other 141,694 125,407 (16,287 ) (11.5 )% (7.5 )% 4.6 % 4.2 % (0.4 )% $ 1,382,019 $ 1,271,214 $ (110,805 ) (8.0 )% (3.5 )% 45.2 % 42.2 % (3.0 )% Percentage Change % of Consolidated Revenues Year Ended December 31, Percentage Change (Favorable)/ Unfavorable Dollar Change Constant Currency 2007 2008 Actual 2007 2008 Labor $ 615,059 $ 674,466 $ 59,407 9.7 % 8.8 % 22.5 % 22.1 % (0.4 )% Facilities 374,529 413,968 39,439 10.5 % 9.7 % 13.7 % 13.5 % (0.2 )% Transportation 134,882 151,891 17,009 12.6 % 12.3 % 4.9 % 5.0 % 0.1 % Product Cost of Sales and Other 135,650 141,694 6,044 4.5 % 4.1 % 5.0 % 4.6 % (0.4 )% $ 1,260,120 $ 1,382,019 $ 121,899 9.7 % 8.9 % 46.2 % 45.2 % (1.0 )% Labor For the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, labor expense was favorably impacted by 5 percentage points of currency variations. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, labor expense decreased by 2.5% in 2009 due primarily to productivity gains in our North American Physical Business, which is reflected in the approximate year over year decline of 8% in employee headcount, offset by merit increases. For the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, labor expense was unfavorably impacted by 1 percentage point of currency variations. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, labor expense increased by 8.8%, but decreased as a percentage of consolidated revenue, mainly as a result of higher recycled paper revenue and strong growth in our digital services revenues, which have lower labor costs, and labor efficiencies in our North American business. These benefits were partially offset by the impact of revenue mix, as labor intensive services such as secure shredding and DMS continue to grow at a faster rate than our storage revenues, and the dilutive impact of more labor intensive acquisitions. Facilities Facilities costs were favorably impacted by 5 percentage points of currency variations during the year ended December 31, 2009. The largest component of our facilities cost is rent expense, which, in constant currency terms, increased by $2.9 million for 2009 over 2008, but decreased from 13.2% of consolidated storage revenues for 2008 to 12.5% of consolidated storage revenues for 2009, mainly as a result of the impact of revenue mix and due to incremental rent charges incurred in the latter half of 39 Table of Contents 2008 related to our U.K. operations. Other facilities costs for 2009 increased in constant currency terms due to increased common area charges of $8.5 million, property taxes and insurance of $2.4 million, and utilities of $0.3 million related to rising costs. Facilities costs were unfavorably impacted by 1 percentage point of currency variations, and as a percentage of consolidated revenues decreased slightly to 13.5% for the year ended December 31, 2008 from 13.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007. The largest component of our facilities cost is rent expense, which, in constant currency terms, increased by $27.0 million over 2007 and increased as a percentage of consolidated storage revenues from 12.6% for 2007 to 13.2% for 2008. The increase in rent is mainly driven by the timing of new real estate as we continue to expand our storage business, as well as an incremental rental charge in 2008 of $3.3 million related to our decision to exit a leased facility in the U.K., partially offset by the expansion of our secure shredding and other service businesses, which incur lower rent and facilities costs than our core physical business, coupled with increased utilization levels. Other facilities costs increased in constant currency terms in 2008 from 2007 due to increased costs of utilities of $7.7 million and common area charges of $1.3 million related to rising costs and an increased number of facilities. Transportation Transportation expenses were favorably impacted by 4 percentage points of currency variations during the year ended December 31, 2009. Certain vehicle leases related to vans, trucks and mobile shredding units in our vehicle lease portfolio previously classified as operating leases are now classified as capital leases upon renewal or at inception for new leases. As a result, for 2009 we had lower vehicle rent expense in our North American Physical segment of approximately $22.4 million (offset by an increased amount of combined depreciation of approximately $20.2 million and interest expense of approximately $3.3 million). In addition, fuel costs have decreased by $14.1 million during 2009 as compared to 2008. The lower fuel costs are primarily due to lower commodity prices and to a lesser extent, the benefit of productivity gains from ongoing transportation improvement initiatives, as well as, $1.8 million related to foreign currency variations. Our transportation expenses (which are influenced by several variables including total number of vehicles, owned versus leased vehicles, use of subcontracted couriers, fuel expenses, maintenance and insurance) were not materially impacted by currency variations, but increased slightly as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The expansion of our secure shredding operations, which incurs higher transportation costs than our core physical business, contributed to the increase in dollar terms, as well as rising fuel costs, which contributed $10.5 million of the increase in constant currency terms, and the increased use of leased vehicles which contributed $5.6 million in constant currency terms, some of which were offset, as a percentage of revenue, by incremental fuel surcharges. Product Cost of Sales and Other Product cost of sales and other, which includes cartons, media and other service, storage and supply costs, is highly correlated to complementary revenue streams. These costs were favorably impacted by 4 percentage points of currency variations during the year ended December 31, 2009. For 2009, product cost of sales and other decreased in constant currency terms by $10.1 million as compared to the prior year. Approximately $9.5 million of the decrease is due to the sale of our North American data product sales line in the second quarter of 2008. The remainder of the decrease was a result of a decrease in other complementary revenue streams. Product and other cost of sales were not materially impacted by currency variations, but increased $6.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease as a percentage of revenue primarily reflects the impact of the sale of our North 40 Table of Contents American commodity product sales line, which consisted of the sale of data storage media, imaging products and data center furniture to our physical data protection and recovery services customers. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses are comprised of the following expenses (in thousands): Percentage Change % of Consolidated Revenues Year Ended December 31, Percentage Change (Favorable)/ Unfavorable Dollar Change Constant Currency 2008 2009 Actual 2008 2009 General and Administrative $ 442,852 $ 455,326 $ 12,474 2.8 % 8.0 % 14.5 % 15.1 % 0.6 % Sales, Marketing & Account Management 276,697 261,955 (14,742 ) (5.3 )% (1.4 )% 9.1 % 8.7 % (0.4 )% Information Technology 152,113 145,247 (6,866 ) (4.5 )% (1.9 )% 5.0 % 4.8 % (0.2 )% Bad Debt Expense 10,702 11,831 1,129 10.5 % 11.7 % 0.4 % 0.4 % 0.0 % $ 882,364 $ 874,359 $ (8,005 ) (0.9 )% 3.4 % 28.9 % 29.0 % 0.1 % Percentage Change % of Consolidated Revenues Year Ended December 31, Percentage Change (Favorable)/ Unfavorable Dollar Change Constant Currency 2007 2008 Actual 2007 2008 General and Administrative $ 382,727 $ 442,852 $ 60,125 15.7 % 15.2 % 14.0 % 14.5 % 0.5 % Sales, Marketing & Account Management 249,966 276,697 26,731 10.7 % 10.0 % 9.2 % 9.1 % (0.1 )% Information Technology 135,788 152,113 16,325 12.0 % 11.8 % 5.0 % 5.0 % 0.0 % Bad Debt Expense 2,894 10,702 7,808 269.8 % 257.6 % 0.1 % 0.4 % 0.3 % $ 771,375 $ 882,364 $ 110,989 14.4 % 13.9 % 28.3 % 28.9 % 0.6 % General and Administrative General and administrative expenses were favorably impacted by 5 percentage points of currency variations during the year ended December 31, 2009. In constant currency terms, compensation expense, including medical and other benefits, increased by $17.8 million in 2009 as a result of merit increases and increased headcount. In addition, legal costs and professional fees (related to project and cost saving initiatives) increased $24.7 million in 2009. These increases are offset by lower discretionary spending of $8.8 million for items including recruiting and relocations, telephone, training, postage and supplies, and certain enterprise wide meetings which were held in 2008 but not in 2009. General and administrative expenses were unfavorably impacted by 1 percentage point of currency variations during the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. In constant currency terms, the increase is mainly attributable to increased compensation expense of $33.2 million, reflecting increased headcount due to acquisitions and general business expansion, as well as increases in related office occupancy costs of $6.4 million, professional fees of $8.2 million (related to project and cost saving initiatives) and other overhead of $10.6 million, including such items as insurance, postage and supplies and telephone costs. Included in compensation expense is stock option expense, which increased by $3.1 million in 2008 compared to 2007 due to an increase in the number of stock option grants and the fair value of such grants in 2007. 41 Table of Contents Sales, Marketing & Account Management Sales, marketing and account management expenses were favorably impacted by 4 percentage points of currency variations during the year ended December 31, 2009. In constant currency terms, the decrease of 1.4% in 2009 is primarily related to lower discretionary spending of $4.1 million on items such as travel and entertainment and our enterprise wide sales meeting which was held in 2008 but not in 2009. Commissions expense also declined by $10.2 million in constant currency terms during 2009. These decreases are partially offset by increased investment in personnel in sales and account management and merit increases in our International Physical segment of $4.8 million and increased compensation (other than commissions) of $4.4 million primarily as a result of merit increases in the North American Physical segment. Sales, marketing and account management expenses were unfavorably impacted by 1 percentage point of currency variations during the year ended December 31, 2008. Mostly labor related and comprised of compensation and commissions, these costs are primarily driven by the headcount in each of these departments, which, on average, was higher throughout 2008 compared to 2007. In constant currency terms, compensation expense and commissions increased $18.9 million and $6.5 million, respectively, in 2008 compared to 2007. Information Technology Information technology expenses were favorably impacted by 3 percentage points of currency variations during the year ended December 31, 2009. In constant currency terms, the decrease of 1.9% in information technology expenses for 2009 was due to reduced overhead and discretionary spending, such as recruiting, travel and entertainment, professional fees, and equipment rental costs of $2.3 million and disciplined cost management. Information technology expenses were not materially impacted by currency variations and remained flat as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in constant currency terms in 2008 in information technology expenses is primarily related to a $13.9 million increase in compensation expense, and represents an investment in infrastructure and product development. Bad Debt Expense Consolidated bad debt expense increased $1.1 million to $11.8 million (0.4% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2009 from $10.7 million (0.4% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2008. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts that is calculated based on our past loss experience, current and prior trends in our aged receivables, current economic conditions, and specific circumstances of individual receivable balances. The increase in bad debt expense in 2009 from 2008 is attributable to the worsening economic climate. We continue to monitor our customers payment activity and make adjustments based on their financial condition and in light of historical and expected trends. Consolidated bad debt expense increased $7.8 million to $10.7 million (0.4% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $2.9 million (0.1% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in bad debt expense in 2008 from 2007 is attributable to the worsening economic climate and the resultant deterioration in the aging of our accounts receivable. 42 Table of Contents Depreciation, Amortization, and (Gain) Loss on Disposal/Writedown of Property, Plant and Equipment, Net Depreciation expense increased $29.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily due to additional depreciation expense of approximately $20.2 million resulting from certain vehicle leases which had previously been classified as operating leases, being classified as capital leases upon renewal or at inception for new leases, as well as additional depreciation associated with technology investments in our Worldwide Digital Business segment of $4.1 million. Depreciation expense increased $32.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily due to the additional depreciation expense related to capital expenditures and acquisitions, including storage systems, which include racking, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and software, and buildings. Amortization expense decreased $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily due to decreases resulting from currency variations which were offset by the increased amortization of intangible assets, such as customer relationship intangible assets and intellectual property acquired through business combinations. Amortization expense increased $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily due to amortization of intangible assets, such as customer relationship intangible assets and intellectual property acquired through business combinations. Consolidated loss on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, consisted primarily of a gain on disposal of a building in our International Physical segment of approximately $1.9 million in France, offset by losses on the writedown of certain facilities of approximately $1.0 million in our North American Physical segment, $0.7 million in our International Physical segment, $0.3 million in our Worldwide Digital segment and $0.3 million in Corporate (associated with discontinued products after implementation). Consolidated loss on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, consisted primarily of a $2.3 million impairment of an owned storage facility in North America which we decided to exit in the first quarter of 2008, a $1.3 million impairment of an owned storage facility which we decided to exit in the third quarter of 2008, a $0.5 million write down for an owned storage facility that we had vacated and had classified as available for sale in the third quarter of 2008, a $1.9 million write down of two owned storage facilities in North America and related assets which we decided to exit in the fourth quarter of 2008, as well as a $0.6 million write off of previously deferred software costs in Corporate associated with discontinued products after implementation and other disposal and asset write downs. Consolidated gain on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, consisted primarily of a gain related to insurance proceeds from our property claim of $7.7 million associated with the July 2006 fire in one of our London, England facilities, net of a $1.3 million write off of previously deferred software costs in Corporate associated with a discontinued product after implantation. OPERATING INCOME and ADJUSTED OIBDA As a result of all the foregoing factors, consolidated operating income increased $56.0 million, or 11.4%, to $548.5 million (18.2% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2009 from $492.5 million (16.1% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2008. As a result of all the foregoing factors, consolidated Adjusted OIBDA increased $77.3 million, or 9.8%, to $868.0 million (28.8% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2009 from $790.8 million (25.9% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2008. As a result of all the foregoing factors, consolidated operating income increased $37.8 million, or 8.3%, to $492.5 million (16.1% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2008 from 43 Table of Contents $454.7 million (16.7% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2007. As a result of all the foregoing factors, consolidated Adjusted OIBDA increased $92.2 million, or 13.2%, to $790.8 million (25.9% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $698.5 million (25.6% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2007. OTHER EXPENSES, NET Interest Expense, Net Consolidated interest expense, net decreased $8.8 million to $227.8 million (7.6% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2009 from $236.6 million (7.7% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily due to a reduction in year over year borrowings under our revolving credit facility while our weighted average interest rate remained flat at 7.0% as of December 31, 2009 and 2008. We incurred approximately $3.3 million of additional interest expense on capital leases on certain vehicle leases previously classified as operating leases prior to renewal or upon lease inception. Consolidated interest expense, net increased $8.0 million to $236.6 million (7.7% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $228.6 million (8.4% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily due to the full year impact of borrowings to fund acquisitions completed in 2007, offset by a decrease in our weighted average interest rate to 7.0% as of December 31, 2008 from 7.4% as of December 31, 2007. In addition, as a result of the repayment of IMEs revolving credit facility and term loans with borrowings in the U.S., we had higher than normal interest expense of approximately $4.1 million in the second quarter of 2007. This was a result of the difference in our calendar reporting period and that of IME which is two months in arrears, and had no impact on cash flows.

Gains resulted primarily from changes in the exchange rate of the British pound sterling, Euro, Brazilian Real and Chilean Peso against the U.S. dollar compared to December 31, 2008, as these currencies relate to our intercompany balances with and between our European and Latin American subsidiaries, offset by losses as a result of British pounds sterling and Euro denominated debt and forward foreign currency swap contracts held by our U.S. parent company. 44 Table of Contents Net foreign currency transaction losses of $28.9 million, based on period end exchange rates, were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2008. Losses resulted primarily as a result of the British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar compared to December 31, 2007, as this currency relates to our intercompany balances with and between our U.K. subsidiaries, offset by gains on the marking to market of British pound sterling and Euro denominated debt and forward foreign currency swap contracts held by our U.S. parent company. Net foreign currency transaction losses of $11.3 million based on period end exchange rates were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily due to losses as a result of the Euro and Canadian dollar, offset by gains as a result of the British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar compared to December 31, 2006, as these currencies relate to our intercompany balances with and between our Canadian and European subsidiaries. Additionally, the U.S. parent company incurred losses as a result of primarily marking to market British pounds sterling and Euro denominated debt, offset by gains on Euro for U.S. dollar foreign currency swaps. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we redeemed our 85/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013 (the "85/8% notes") and wrote off $3.0 million in associated deferred financing costs. During 2008, we redeemed the remaining outstanding portion of our 81/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011 and in connection with the reduction in our revolving credit facility availability due to a bankruptcy of one of our lenders, we wrote off $0.4 million in deferred financing costs. During 2007, we wrote off $5.7 million of deferred financing costs related to the early extinguishment of U.S. and U.K. term loans and revolving credit facilities. Other, net in the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily consists of $1.7 million of gains related to certain trading marketable securities held in a trust for the benefit of employees included in a deferred compensation plan we sponsor, in addition to $0.6 million of business interruption proceeds for an owned storage facility in France, which was taken by eminent domain in the first quarter of 2009. Other, net in the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily consists of $1.8 million of write downs related to certain trading marketable securities held in a trust for the benefit of employees included in a deferred compensation plan we sponsor. Other, net in the year ended December 31, 2007 consisted of $12.9 million of business interruption insurance proceeds pertaining to the July 2006 fire in one of our London, England facilities. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009 were 30.9%, 63.6% and 33.2%, respectively. The primary reconciling items between the federal statutory rate of 35% and our overall effective tax rate are state income taxes (net of federal benefit) and differences in the rates of tax at which our foreign earnings are subject. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2009 is primarily due to significant foreign exchange gains and losses in different jurisdictions with different tax rates. For 2009, foreign currency gains were recorded in lower tax jurisdictions associated with the marking to market of intercompany loan positions while foreign currency losses were recorded in higher tax jurisdictions associated with the marking to market of debt and derivative instruments, which reduced the effective tax rate by 4.9% for the year ended December 31, 2009. Discrete items are recorded in the period they occur. The increase in our effective tax rate in 2008 is primarily due to significant foreign exchange gains and losses in different jurisdictions with different tax rates. For 2008, foreign currency gains were recorded in higher tax jurisdictions, associated with our marking to market of debt and derivative instruments, while foreign currency losses were recorded in lower tax jurisdiction, associated with the marking to market of intercompany loan positions, which together increased the 2008 tax rate by 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2008. Meanwhile, for 2007 the opposite occurred, foreign currency losses were recorded in higher tax jurisdictions associated with our marking to market of debt and derivative instruments while foreign currency gains were recorded in lower tax jurisdictions associated with marking to market intercompany loan positions. 45 Table of Contents Our effective tax rate is subject to future variability due to, among other items: (a) changes in the mix of income from foreign jurisdictions; (b) tax law changes; (c) volatility in foreign exchange gains and (losses); and (d) the timing of the establishment and reversal of tax reserves. We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. Although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in changes in our estimates. NET INCOME As a result of all the foregoing factors, consolidated net income for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased $140.4 million, or 171.3%, to $222.3 million (7.4% of consolidated revenues) from net income of $81.9 million (2.7% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in operating income noted above, the foreign currency exchange rate impacts included in other income (expense), net and the impact of our tax rate for 2009, contributed to the increase in net income. For the year ended December 31, 2009, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests resulted in a reduction to net income attributable to Iron Mountain Incorporated of $1.4 million. These represent our noncontrolling partners share of earnings/losses in our majority owned international subsidiaries that are consolidated in our operating results. As a result of all the foregoing factors, consolidated net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased $72.1 million, or 46.8%, to $81.9 million (2.7% of consolidated revenues) from net income of $154.0 million (5.6% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2007. Segment Analysis (in thousands) Beginning January 1, 2009, we changed the composition of our segments to not allocate certain corporate and centrally controlled costs, which primarily relate to executive and staff functions, including finance, human resources, and information technology, as well as all stock based compensation, which benefit the enterprise as a whole. These are now reflected as Corporate costs and are not allocated to our operating segments. Therefore, the presentation of all historical segment reporting has been changed to conform to our new management reporting. Corporate and our operating segments are discussed below. Our reportable operating segments are North American Physical Business, International Physical Business and Worldwide Digital Business. See Note 9 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our North American Physical Business, which consists of the United States and Canada, offers the storage of paper documents, as well as all other non electronic media such as microfilm and microfiche, master audio and videotapes, film, X rays and blueprints, including healthcare information services, vital records services, service and courier operations, and the collection, handling and disposal of sensitive documents for corporate customers ("Hard Copy"); the storage and rotation of backup computer media as part of corporate disaster recovery plans, including service and courier operations ("Data Protection"); information destruction services ("Destruction"); and the storage, assembly, and detailed reporting of customer marketing literature and delivery to sales offices, trade shows and prospective customers sites based on current and prospective customer orders ("Fulfillment"). Our International Physical Business segment offers information management services throughout Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific, including Hard Copy, Data Protection and Destruction (in the U.K.). Our Worldwide Digital Business offers information management services for electronic records conveyed via telecommunication lines and the Internet, including online backup and recovery solutions for server data and personal computers, as well as email archiving, third party intellectual property escrow services that protect intellectual property assets such as software source code, and electronic discovery services for the legal market that offers in depth discovery and data investigation solutions. Corporate consists of costs related to executive and staff functions, including 46 Table of Contents finance, human resources and information technology, which benefit the enterprise as a whole. These costs are primarily related to the general management of these functions on a corporate level and the design and development of programs, policies and procedures that are then implemented in the individual segments, with each segment bearing its own cost of implementation. Corporate also includes stock based employee compensation expense associated with all employee stock based awards.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, revenue in our North American Physical Business segment increased 1.7% over the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily due to internal growth of 3%. Internal growth was due to solid storage internal growth of 6% related to increased Hard Copy and Data Protection revenues and was negatively impacted by depressed service internal growth of negative 2%. Continued organic growth in our core services business of 3% was more than offset by decreased complementary services revenues primarily due to steep declines in recycled paper prices and softness in discretionary special projects and fulfillment services. Additionally, unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations related to Canada resulted in decreased 2009 revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, of 1 percentage point. Adjusted OIBDA as a percentage of segment revenue increased in 2009 due mainly to productivity gains, pricing actions, disciplined cost management, lower vehicle rent expense due to the recharacterization of certain vehicle leases, and increased margin due to the sale of our low margin data products division in 2008, partially offset by a $17.7 million increase in professional fees (related to project and cost savings initiatives). During the year ended December 31, 2008, revenue in our North American Physical Business segment increased 9.4% over 2007, primarily due to solid internal growth supported by increased destruction and data protection revenues, higher recycled paper revenues, and the growing impact of our 2007 acquisitions, primarily ArchivesOne, which contributed $15.3 million, or approximately 0.8%. Adjusted OIBDA as a percent of segment revenue increased in 2008 due mainly to higher recycled paper revenues, fuel surcharges, as well as labor efficiencies, expense management, and facility utilization, offset by increased transportation expenses, such as rising fuel costs. 47 Table of Contents International Physical Business Percentage Change Year Ended December 31, Dollar Change Constant Currency Internal Growth 2008 2009 Actual Segment Revenue $ 764,812 $ 682,684 $ (82,128 ) (10.7 )% 4.8 % 5 % Segment Adjusted OIBDA(1) $ 138,432 $ 125,364 $ (13,068 ) (9.4 )% 8.3 % Segment Adjusted OIBDA(1) as a Percentage of Segment Revenue 18.1 % 18.4 % Percentage Change Year Ended December 31, Dollar Change Constant Currency Internal Growth 2007 2008 Actual Segment Revenue $ 676,749 $ 764,812 $ 88,063 13.0 % 10.7 % 7 % Segment Adjusted OIBDA(1) $ 135,714 $ 138,432 $ 2,718 2.0 % (0.4 )% Segment Adjusted OIBDA(1) as a Percentage of Segment Revenue 20.1 % 18.1 % (1)See Note 9 to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for definition of Adjusted OIBDA and for the basis on which allocations are made and a reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA to income before provision for income taxes. Revenue in our International Physical Business segment decreased 10.7% during the year ended December 31, 2009 over 2008 due to foreign currency fluctuations in 2009, primarily in the United Kingdom, which resulted in decreased 2009 revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, compared to 2008 of approximately 16 percentage points. This decline was offset by total internal revenue growth for the segment of 5%, supported by solid 8% storage internal growth, and service revenue internal growth of 1%. Service revenue internal growth includes an unfavorable year over year comparison due to a large European special project that was completed in the third quarter of 2008 which contributed to complementary revenue internal growth of negative 10%. Adjusted OIBDA as a percentage of segment revenue increased in 2009 primarily due to disciplined cost management and productivity gains, partially offset by the completion of a large, high margin European special project in the third quarter of 2008, increased rent and facility costs and increased compensation expense related to investments in sales and business support during 2008 and 2009. Revenue in our International Physical Business segment increased 13.0% during the year ended December 31, 2008 over 2007, primarily due to internal growth of 7% and the growing impact of our acquisitions in Europe and Asia Pacific, which combined contributed 4% to revenue growth year over year. Further, favorable currency fluctuations during 2008, primarily in Europe, resulted in increased revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, of approximately 2 percentage points compared to 2007. Adjusted OIBDA was favorably impacted by 2 percentage points of currency variations, but decreased in constant currency terms and as a percent of segment revenue in 2008 primarily due to special project revenue in Europe in 2007 that did not repeat in 2008, increased compensation expense due to incentives associated with certain acquisitions, and incremental rental charges related to our decision to exit a leased facility in the U.K. 48 Table of Contents Worldwide Digital Business Percentage Change Year Ended December 31, Dollar Change Constant Currency Internal Growth 2008 2009 Actual Segment Revenue $ 223,006 $ 229,385 $ 6,379 2.9 % 3.6 % 4 % Segment Adjusted OIBDA(1) $ 41,782 $ 50,303 $ 8,521 20.4 % 19.8 % Segment Adjusted OIBDA(1) as a Percentage of Segment Revenue 18.7 % 21.9 % Percentage Change Year Ended December 31, Dollar Change Constant Currency Internal Growth 2007 2008 Actual Segment Revenue $ 163,218 $ 223,006 $ 59,788 36.6 % 36.4 % 12 % Segment Adjusted OIBDA(1) $ 25,662 $ 41,782 $ 16,120 62.8 % 60.7 % Segment Adjusted OIBDA(1) as a Percentage of Segment Revenue 15.7 % 18.7 % (1)See Note 9 to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for definition of Adjusted OIBDA and for the basis on which allocations are made and a reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA to income before provision for income taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2009, revenue in our Worldwide Digital Business segment increased 2.9% over 2008, due to strong performance in our eDiscovery business offset by a decrease in data restoration and license sales in 2009 over 2008. In the year ended December 31, 2009, Adjusted OIBDA in the Worldwide Digital Business segment increased compared to 2008 due to the impact of revenue mix and decreases in commissions and discretionary spending, including recruiting, travel and entertainment. During the year ended December 31, 2008, revenue in our Worldwide Digital Business segment increased 36.6% over 2007, due to the acquisition of Stratify in December 2007 and strong internal growth of 12%. The increase in internal growth is primarily attributable to growth in digital storage revenue from our online backup service offerings, offset by a large license sale that occurred in 2007 and did not repeat in 2008. Adjusted OIBDA in the Worldwide Digital Business segment increased due to our significant year over year revenue gains, and was impacted favorably by 2 percentage points of currency variations. 49 Table of Contents Corporate Dollar Change Percentage Change Year Ended December 31, from 2007 to 2008 from 2008 to 2009 from 2007 to 2008 from 2008 to 2009 2007 2008 2009 Segment Adjusted OIBDA(1) $ (144,068 ) $ (157,986 ) $ (164,406 ) $ (13,918 ) $ (6,420 ) 9.7 % 4.1 % Segment Adjusted OIBDA(1) as a Percentage of Consolidated Revenue (5.3 )% (5.2 )% (5.5 )% (1)See Note 9 to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for definition of Adjusted OIBDA and for the basis on which allocations are made and a reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA to income before provision for income taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2009, expenses in the Corporate segment increased 4.1% over the year ended December 31, 2008, driven primarily by increases in professional fees of $3.7 million related to project and consulting costs, compensation of $2.5 million due primarily to merit increases and charitable contributions of $2.0 million, offset by decreases in other expenses of $1.5 million, which includes much of our discretionary spending, such as travel and entertainment and supplies, and a decrease in stock based compensation expense of $0.3 million. During the year ended December 31, 2008, expenses in Corporate increased 9.7% over 2007 driven mainly by salaries and benefits, which increased $9.6 million, primarily as a result of increased headcount plus our continued investment in information technology, infrastructure and product development, as well as, legal and safety and security. In addition, stock based compensation expense increased $5.1 million as a result of headcount and an increase in the number of stock option grants and the fair value of such grants in 2007, while incentive compensation decreased by $2.1 million. Further, we saw increases in professional fees of $4.2 million, primarily for services in the areas of information technology, infrastructure and product development. Facility costs increased $1.0 million in 2008 compared to 2007, while other expenses, which includes much of our discretionary spending, including supplies and telephone, decreased $3.9 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following is a summary of our cash balances and cash flows (in thousands) as of and for the years ended December 31, 2007 2008 2009 Cash flows from operating activities $ 484,644 $ 537,029 $ 616,911 Cash flows from investing activities (866,635 ) (459,594 ) (324,066 ) Cash flows from financing activities 457,005 87,368 (129,692 ) Cash and cash equivalents at the end of year 125,607 278,370 446,656 Net cash provided by operating activities was $616.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $537.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The 14.9% increase resulted primarily from an increase in net income, excluding non cash charges of $47.9 million and a decrease in the use of working capital of $58.2 million over 2008, offset by an increase in realized foreign exchange losses of $26.2 million over 2008. Due to the nature of our businesses, we make significant capital expenditures and additions to customer acquisition costs. Our capital expenditures are primarily related to growth and include 50 Table of Contents investments in storage systems, information systems and discretionary investments in real estate. Cash paid for our capital expenditures and additions to customer acquisition costs during the year ended December 31, 2009 amounted to $312.8 million and $10.8 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2009, capital expenditures, net and additions to customer acquisition costs were funded with cash flows provided by operating activities and cash equivalents on hand. Excluding acquisitions, we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately $320 million in the year ending December 31, 2010. Included in our estimated capital expenditures for 2010 is approximately $30 million of opportunity driven real estate purchases. Net cash used in financing activities was $129.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we had $539.7 million of proceeds from the sale of senior subordinated notes, gross borrowings under our revolving credit and term loan facilities and other debt of $36.9 million, $24.2 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plan, $5.5 million of excess tax benefits from stock based compensation and $1.1 million in contributions from noncontrolling partners. We used the proceeds from these financing transactions for the early retirement of $447.9 million of our 85/8% notes, to repay $287.7 million on our revolving credit and term loans and other debt and $1.6 million of financing costs. Due to the declining economic environment in 2008, the current fair market values of vans, trucks and mobile shredding units within our vehicle fleet portfolio, which we lease, have declined. As a result, certain vehicle leases that previously met the requirements to be considered operating leases have been classified as capital leases, and certain others will be, upon renewal. The impact of these changes on our consolidated cash flow statement in the year ended December 31, 2009 is that payments related to these leases previously reflected as a use of cash within the operating activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows are now, and will be, reflected as a use of cash within the financing activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows. For 2009, the amount of this impact was $19.1 million. Financial instruments that potentially subject us to market risk consist principally of cash, money market funds and time deposits. As of December 31, 2009, we had significant concentrations of liquid investments with five global banks and ten "Triple A" rated money market funds which we consider to be large, highly rated investment grade institutions. As of December 31, 2009, our cash and cash equivalent balance was $446.7 million, including money market funds and time deposits amounting to $381.6 million. A substantial portion of these money market funds are invested in U.S. treasuries. 51 Table of Contents We are highly leveraged and expect to continue to be highly leveraged for the foreseeable future. Our consolidated debt as of December 31, 2009 was comprised of the following (in thousands): Revolving Credit Facility(1) $ 21,799 Term Loan Facility(1) 400,300 71/4% GBP Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014(2) 238,920 73/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2015(2) 435,856 65/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016(2) 317,035 71/2% CAD Senior Subordinated Notes due 2017(the "Subsidiary Notes")(3) 166,810 83/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018(2) 200,000 8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018(2) 49,749 63/4% Euro Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018(2) 363,166 8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020(2) 300,000 83/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2021(2) 548,002 Real Estate Mortgages, Capital Leases and Other(4) 210,147 Total Long term Debt 3,251,784 Less Current Portion (40,561 ) Long term Debt, Net of Current Portion $ 3,211,223 (1)The capital stock or other equity interests of most of our U.S. subsidiaries, and up to 66% of the capital stock or other equity interests of our first tier foreign subsidiaries, are pledged to secure these debt instruments, together with all intercompany obligations of foreign subsidiaries owed to us or to one of our U.S. subsidiary guarantors. (2)Collectively referred to as the Parent Notes. Iron Mountain Incorporated ("IMI") is the direct obligor on the Parent Notes, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior subordinated basis, by substantially all of its direct and indirect wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries (the "Guarantors"). These guarantees are joint and several obligations of the Guarantors. Iron Mountain Canada Corporation ("Canada Company") and the remainder of our subsidiaries do not guarantee the Parent Notes. (3)Canada Company is the direct obligor on the Subsidiary Notes, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior subordinated basis, by IMI and the Guarantors. These guarantees are joint and several obligations of IMI and the Guarantors. (4)Includes (a) real estate mortgages of $6.6 million, (b) capital lease obligations of $193.7 million, and (c) other various notes and other obligations, which were assumed by us as a result of certain acquisitions, of $9.8 million. Our revolving credit and term loan facilities, as well as our indentures, use earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") based calculations as primary measures of financial performance, including leverage ratios and contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to complete acquisitions, pay cash dividends, incur indebtedness, make investments, sell assets and take certain other corporate actions. The covenants do not contain a rating trigger. Therefore, a change in our debt rating would not trigger a default under the Credit Agreement and our indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness. IMIs revolving credit and term leverage ratio was 3.8 and 3.3 as of December 31, 2008 and 2009, respectively, compared to a maximum allowable ratio of 5.5. Similarly, our bond leverage ratio, per the indentures, was 4.5 and 4.1 as of December 31, 2008 and 2009, respectively, compared to a maximum allowable ratio of 6.5. Noncompliance with these leverage ratios would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity. We were in compliance with all debt covenants in material agreements as of December 31, 2009 and we do not expect the debt covenants and 52 Table of Contents restrictions to limit our recently approved share repurchase program or dividends under our dividend policy as more fully discussed below. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we designated as Excluded Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the indentures), certain of our subsidiaries that own our assets and conduct operations in the United Kingdom. As a result of such designation, these subsidiaries are now subject to substantially all of the covenants for the indentures, except that they are not required to provide a guarantee, and the EBITDA and debt of these subsidiaries is included for purposes of calculation of the leverage ratio. Our ability to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, working capital levels and capital structure, which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors which may be beyond our control. There can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future financings will be available on acceptable terms or in amounts sufficient to enable us to service or refinance our indebtedness, or to make necessary capital expenditures. On April 16, 2007, we entered into a new credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") to replace the existing IMI revolving credit and term loan facilities and the existing IME revolving credit and term loan facilities. The Credit Agreement consists of revolving credit facilities where we can borrow, subject to certain limitations as defined in the Credit Agreement, up to an aggregate amount of $765 million (including Canadian dollar and multi currency revolving credit facilities), and a $410 million term loan facility. Our revolving credit facility is supported by a group of 24 banks. Our subsidiaries, Canada Company and Iron Mountain Switzerland GmbH, may borrow directly under the Canadian revolving credit and multi currency revolving credit facilities, respectively. Additional subsidiary borrowers may be added under the multi currency revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility terminates on April 16, 2012. With respect to the term loan facility, quarterly loan payments of approximately $1.0 million are required through maturity on April 16, 2014, at which time the remaining outstanding principal balance of the term loan facility is due. The interest rate on borrowings under the Credit Agreement varies depending on our choice of interest rate and currency options, plus an applicable margin. IMI guarantees the obligations of each of the subsidiary borrowers under the Credit Agreement, and substantially all of our U.S. subsidiaries guarantee the obligations of IMI and the subsidiary borrowers. The capital stock or other equity interests of most of our U.S. subsidiaries, and up to 66% of the capital stock or other equity interests of our first tier foreign subsidiaries, are pledged to secure the Credit Agreement, together with all intercompany obligations of foreign subsidiaries owed to us or to one of our U.S. subsidiary guarantors. As of December 31, 2009, we had $21.8 million of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility, which were denominated in Euro (EUR 1.8 million), Australian dollars (AUD 9.0 million) and in British pound sterling (GBP 7.0 million); we also had various outstanding letters of credit totaling $43.4 million. The remaining availability, based on IMIs leverage ratio, which is calculated based on the last 12 months EBITDA and other adjustments as defined in the Credit Agreement and current external debt, under the revolving credit facility on December 31, 2009, was $699.8 million. The interest rate in effect under the revolving credit facility and term loan facility was 3.0% and 1.8%, respectively, as of December 31, 2009. In August 2009, we completed an underwritten public offering of $550.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 83/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2021, which were issued at 99.625% of par. Our net proceeds of $539.7 million, after paying the underwriters discounts and commissions, was used to (a) redeem the remaining $447.9 million of aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 85/8% notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, all of which were called for redemption in August 2009, and redeemed in September 2009, (b) repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and (c) for general corporate purposes. We recorded a charge to other expense (income), net of $3.0 million in the third quarter of 2009 related to the early extinguishment of the 85/8% notes, which consists of deferred financing costs and original issue premiums and discounts related to the 85/8% notes. 53 Table of Contents In February, 2010, we acquired Mimosa, a leader in enterprise class digital content archiving solutions, for approximately $112 million in cash. Mimosa, based in Santa Clara, California, provides an on premises integrated archive for email, SharePoint data and files, and complements our existing enterprise class, cloud based digital archive services. NearPoint, Mimosas enterprise archiving platform, has applications for retention and disposition, eDiscovery, compliance supervision, classification, recovery, and end user search, enabling customers to reduce risk, and lower their eDiscovery and storage costs. In February, 2010, our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing up to $150 million in repurchases of our common stock. This represents approximately 3% of our outstanding common stock based on the closing price on February 19, 2010. All purchases are subject to stock price, market conditions, corporate and legal requirements and other factors. In addition, in February, 2010, our board of directors adopted a dividend policy under which we intend to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. The first quarterly dividend of $0.0625 per share will be payable on April 15, 2010 to shareholders of record on March 25, 2010. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors. If we continue the $.0625 per share quarterly dividend we anticipate that the 2010 annual dividend payout will be approximately $50 million based on our total outstanding shares as of February 19, 2010 (of which the fourth quarter 2010 payment would not be paid until January, 2011, if declared). Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 Years Capital Lease Obligations $ 193,738 $ 31,982 $ 68,000 $ 31,313 $ 62,443 Long Term Debt Obligations (excluding Capital Lease Obligations) 3,060,985 8,579 35,906 629,196 2,387,304 Interest Payments(1) 1,812,826 222,311 439,073 415,401 736,041 Operating Lease Obligations(2) 3,012,838 228,950 421,982 383,208 1,978,698 Purchase and Asset Retirement Obligations(3) 66,101 28,487 25,421 978 11,215 Total(4) $ 8,146,488 $ 520,309 $ 990,382 $ 1,460,096 $ 5,175,701 (1)Amounts include variable rate interest payments, which are calculated utilizing the applicable interest rates as of December 31, 2009; see Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Amounts also include interest on capital leases. (2)Amounts are offset by sublease income of $8.9 million in total (including $2.3 million, $2.7 million, $1.8 million and $2.1 million, in less than 1 year, 1 3 years, 3 5 years and more than 5 years, respectively). (3)In connection with some of our acquisitions, we have potential earn out obligations that may be payable in the event businesses we acquired meet certain financial objectives. These payments are based on the future results of these operations, and our estimate of the maximum contingent earn out payments we may be required to make under all such agreements as of December 31, 2009 is approximately $9.6 million. 54 Table of Contents (4)The table above excludes $88.2 million in uncertain tax positions as we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities. We expect to meet our cash flow requirements for the next twelve months from cash generated from operations, existing cash, cash equivalents, borrowings under the Credit Agreement and other financings, which may include secured credit facilities, securitizations and mortgage or capital lease financings. We expect to meet our long term cash flow requirements using the same means described above, as well as the potential issuance of debt or equity securities as we deem appropriate. See Notes 4, 7, and 10 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Regulation S K Item 303(a)(4)(ii). Net Operating Loss and Foreign Tax Credit Carryforwards We have federal net operating loss carryforwards which begin to expire in 2019 through 2025 of $38.6 million ($13.5 million, tax effected) at December 31, 2009 to reduce future federal taxable income. We have an asset for state net operating losses of $16.1 million (net of federal tax benefit), which begins to expire in 2010 through 2025, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 99%. We have assets for foreign net operating losses of $29.7 million, with various expiration dates, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 81%. Additionally, we have federal research credits of $0.9 million which begin to expire in 2010, and foreign tax credits of $59.3 million, which begin to expire in 2014 through 2019. Based on current expectations and plans, we expect to fully utilize our foreign tax credit carryforwards prior to their expiration. Inflation Certain of our expenses, such as wages and benefits, insurance, occupancy costs and equipment repair and replacement, are subject to normal inflationary pressures. Although to date we have been able to offset inflationary cost increases through increased operating efficiencies and the negotiation of favorable long term real estate leases, we can give no assurance that we will be able to offset any future inflationary cost increases through similar efficiencies, leases or increased storage or service charges.  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Market Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to market risk consist principally of cash, money market funds and time deposits. As of December 31, 2009, we had significant concentrations of liquid investments with five global banks and ten "Triple A" rated money market funds which we consider to be large, highly rated investment grade institutions. As of December 31, 2009, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $446.7 million, including money market funds and time deposits amounting to $381.6 million. A substantial portion of these money market funds are invested in U.S. treasuries. Interest Rate Risk Given the recurring nature of our revenues and the long term nature of our asset base, we have the ability and the preference to use long term, fixed interest rate debt to finance our business, thereby helping to preserve our long term returns on invested capital. We target approximately 75% of our debt portfolio to be fixed with respect to interest rates. Occasionally, we will use interest rate swaps as a tool to maintain our targeted level of fixed rate debt. See Notes 3 and 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 55 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2009, we had $430.3 million of variable rate debt outstanding with a weighted average variable interest rate of 2.0%, and $2,821.5 million of fixed rate debt outstanding. As of December 31, 2009, 86.8% of our total debt outstanding was fixed. If the weighted average variable interest rate on our variable rate debt had increased by 1%, our net income for the year ended December 31, 2009 would have been reduced by $2.7 million. See Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K for a discussion of our long term indebtedness, including the fair values of such indebtedness as of December 31, 2009. Currency Risk Our investments in IME, Canada Company, Iron Mountain Mexico, SA de RL de CV, Iron Mountain South America, Ltd., Iron Mountain Australia Pty Ltd., Iron Mountain New Zealand Ltd. and our other international investments may be subject to risks and uncertainties related to fluctuations in currency valuation. Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. However, our international revenues and expenses are generated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate, primarily the Euro, Canadian dollar and British pound sterling. Declines in the value of the local currencies in which we are paid relative to the U.S. dollar will cause revenues in U.S. dollar terms to decrease and dollar denominated liabilities to increase in local currency. The impact of currency fluctuations on our earnings is mitigated significantly by the fact that most operating and other expenses are also incurred and paid in the local currency. We also have several intercompany obligations between our foreign subsidiaries and IMI and our U.S. based subsidiaries. In addition Iron Mountain Switzerland GmbH and our foreign subsidiaries and IME also have intercompany obligations between them. These intercompany obligations are primarily denominated in the local currency of the foreign subsidiary. We have adopted and implemented a number of strategies to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in currency valuations. One strategy is to finance certain of our international subsidiaries with debt that is denominated in local currencies, thereby providing a natural hedge. In determining the amount of any such financing, we take into account local tax strategies among other factors. Another strategy we utilize is for IMI to borrow in foreign currencies to hedge our intercompany financing activities. Finally, on occasion, we enter into currency swaps to temporarily or permanently hedge an overseas investment, such as a major acquisition to lock in certain transaction economics. We have implemented these strategies for our foreign investments in the U.K., Continental Europe and Canada. Specifically, through our 150 million British pounds sterling denominated 71/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 and our 255 million 63/4% Euro Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018, we effectively hedge most of our outstanding intercompany loans denominated in British pounds sterling and Euros. Canada Company has financed its capital needs through direct borrowings in Canadian dollars under the Credit Agreement and its 175 million CAD denominated 71/2% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2017. This creates a tax efficient natural currency hedge. In the third quarter of 2007, we designated a portion of our 63/4% Euro Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018 issued by IMI as a hedge of net investment of certain of our Euro denominated subsidiaries. As a result, we recorded $1.9 million ($1.0 million, net of tax) of foreign exchange gains related to the "marking to market" of such debt to currency translation adjustments which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive items, net included in equity for the year ended December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2009, net gains of $3.4 million are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive items, net associated with this net investment hedge. We have entered into a number of forward contracts to hedge our exposures to British pounds sterling. As of December 31, 2009, we had an outstanding forward contract to purchase $121.3 million U.S. dollars and sell 73.6 million in British pounds sterling to hedge our intercompany exposures with IME. At the time of settlement, we either pay or receive the net settlement amount from the forward contract and recognize this amount in other expense (income), net in the accompanying statement of 56 Table of Contents operations as a realized foreign exchange gain or loss. We have not designated these forward contracts as hedges. At the end of each month, we mark the outstanding forward contracts to market and record an unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss for the mark to market valuation. During the year ended December 31, 2009, there was $2.4 million in net cash disbursements included in cash from operating activities related to settlements associated with these foreign currency forward contracts. We recorded net losses in connection with these forward contracts of $12.0 million, including an unrealized foreign exchange gain of $4.1 million in other expense (income), net in the accompanying statement of operations as of December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2009, except as noted above, our currency exposures to intercompany balances are unhedged. The impact of devaluation or depreciating currency on an entity depends on the residual effect on the local economy and the ability of an entity to raise prices and or reduce expenses. Due to our constantly changing currency exposure and the potential substantial volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange fluctuations on our business. The effect of a change in foreign exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the "Accumulated Other Comprehensive Items, net" component of equity. A 10% depreciation in year end 2009 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction in our equity of approximately $77.1 million.
