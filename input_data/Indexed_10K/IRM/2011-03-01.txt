Effective January 1, 2010, we changed the fiscal year end (and the reporting period for consolidation purposes) of IME to coincide with Iron Mountain Incorporateds fiscal year end of December 31. We believe that the change in accounting principle related to the elimination of the two month reporting lag for IME is preferable because it will result in more contemporaneous reporting of events and results related to IME. In accordance with applicable accounting literature, a change in subsidiary year end is treated as a change in accounting principle and requires retrospective application. The impact of the change was not material to the results of operations for the previously reported annual and interim periods after January 1, 2006, and, thus, those results have not been revised. There is, however, a charge of $4.7 million recorded to other (income) expense, net in the year ended December 31, 2010 to recognize the immaterial difference arising from the change. There were no significant infrequent or unusual items in the IME two month period ended December 31, 2008 and 2009. (2)In conjunction with our implementation of a new enterprise management reporting system in the fourth quarter of 2010, we noted inconsistencies in the mapping of certain revenue accounts between storage and service. As a result, we have adjusted previously reported amounts to reduce storage revenues and increase service revenues by $28,620, $28,805, $29,211, $28,753 and $28,526 for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. There was no change in total consolidated reported revenues and the changes were not material to internal revenue growth calculations.

See Note 2.g. to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 29 Table of Contents (4)In February 2010, our board of directors adopted a dividend policy under which we began paying quarterly dividends on our common stock. See "Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities." (5)Adjusted OIBDA is defined as operating income before depreciation, amortization, goodwill impairment and (gain) loss on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net. Adjusted OIBDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted OIBDA by total revenues. For a more detailed definition and reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA and a discussion of why we believe these measures provide relevant and useful information to our current and potential investors, see "Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Non GAAP Measures." 30  Table of Contents  Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with "Item 6. Selected Financial Data" and the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto and the other financial and operating information included elsewhere in this filing. This discussion contains "forward looking statements," as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and in other federal securities laws. See "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements" on page ii of this filing and "Item 1A. Risk Factors" beginning on page 16 of this filing. Overview Our revenues consist of storage revenues as well as service revenues. Storage revenues, both physical and digital, which are considered a key performance indicator for the information management services industry, consist primarily of recurring periodic charges related to the storage of materials or data (generally on a per unit basis), which are typically retained by customers for many years, and have accounted for over 53% of total consolidated revenues in each of the last five years. Our annual revenues from these fixed periodic storage fees have grown for 22 consecutive years. Service revenues are comprised of charges for related core service activities and a wide array of complementary products and services. Included in core service revenues are: (1) the handling of records, including the addition of new records, temporary removal of records from storage, refiling of removed records, destruction of records, and permanent withdrawals from storage; (2) courier operations, consisting primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request; (3) secure shredding of sensitive documents; and (4) other recurring services, including hybrid services, recurring project revenues and maintenance and support fees associated with software license sales. Our complementary services revenues include special project work, data restoration projects, fulfillment services, consulting services and product sales (including software licenses, specially designed storage containers and related supplies). Our secure shredding revenues include the sale of recycled paper (included in complementary services revenues), the price of which can fluctuate from period to period, adding to the volatility and reducing the predictability of that revenue stream. Our consolidated revenues are also subject to variations caused by the net effect of foreign currency translation on revenue derived from outside the U.S. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, we derived approximately 32%, 30% and 31%, respectively, of our total revenues from outside the U.S. In conjunction with our implementation of a new enterprise management reporting system in the fourth quarter of 2010, we noted inconsistencies in the mapping of certain revenue accounts between storage and service. As a result, we have adjusted previously reported amounts to reduce storage revenues and increase service revenues by approximately $29.2 million, $28.8 million and $28.5 million for the years ending December 31, 2008, 2009, and 2010, respectively. There was no change in total consolidated reported revenues and the changes were not material to internal revenue growth calculations. We recognize revenue when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Storage and service revenues are recognized in the month the respective storage or service is provided and customers are generally billed on a monthly basis on contractually agreed upon terms. Amounts related to future storage or prepaid service contracts, including maintenance and support contracts, for customers where storage fees or services are billed in advance are accounted for as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the applicable storage or service period or when the service is performed. Revenue from the sales of products, which is included as a component of service revenues, is recognized when shipped to the customer and title has passed to the customer. Revenues from the sales of products has historically not been significant. Revenues from sales of software licenses are recognized at the time of product delivery to our customer or reseller, 31 Table of Contents and revenue from maintenance and support agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement. Cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization) consists primarily of wages and benefits for field personnel, facility occupancy costs (including rent and utilities), transportation expenses (including vehicle leases and fuel), other product cost of sales and other equipment costs and supplies. Of these, wages and benefits and facility occupancy costs are the most significant. Trends in total wages and benefits dollars and as a percentage of total consolidated revenue are influenced by changes in headcount and compensation levels, achievement of incentive compensation targets, workforce productivity and variability in costs associated with medical insurance and workers compensation. Trends in facility occupancy costs are impacted by the total number of facilities we occupy, the mix of properties we own versus properties we occupy under operating leases, fluctuations in per square foot occupancy costs, and the levels of utilization of these properties. Due to the declining economic environment in 2008, the then current fair market values of vans, trucks and mobile shredding units within our vehicle fleet portfolio, which we leased, declined. As a result, certain vehicle leases that previously met the requirements to be considered operating leases were classified as capital leases upon renewal, or at lease inception, for new leases. The impact of this change with respect to these leases was to lower vehicle rent expense (a component of transportation costs within cost of sales) by approximately $22.4 million in 2009, offset by an increased amount of combined depreciation (by approximately $20.2 million) and interest expense (by approximately $3.3 million) for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. The expansion of our European, secure shredding and digital services businesses has impacted the major cost of sales components. Our European operations are more labor intensive than our core U.S. physical businesses and, therefore, add incremental labor costs at a higher percentage of segment revenue than our North American core physical business. This trend is more than offset by improvements in domestic labor costs as a percentage of North American revenues. Our secure shredding operations incur less facility costs and higher transportation costs as a percentage of revenues compared to our core physical businesses and our digital services require significantly lower labor and facility costs than our core physical businesses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits for management, administrative, information technology, sales, account management and marketing personnel, as well as expenses related to communications and data processing, travel, professional fees, bad debts, training, office equipment and supplies. Trends in total wage and benefit dollars as a percentage of total consolidated revenue are influenced by changes in headcount and compensation levels, achievement of incentive compensation targets, workforce productivity and variability in costs associated with medical insurance. The overhead structure of our expanding European and Asian operations, as compared to our North American operations, is more labor intensive and has not achieved the same level of overhead leverage, which may result in an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of consolidated revenue, as our European and Asian operations become a more meaningful percentage of our consolidated results. Similarly, our digital services businesses require a higher level of overhead, particularly in the area of information technology, than our core physical businesses. Our depreciation and amortization charges result primarily from the capital intensive nature of our business. The principal components of depreciation relate to storage systems, which include racking, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and software, and buildings. Amortization relates primarily to customer relationship acquisition costs and core technology and is impacted by the nature and timing of acquisitions. During the quarter ended September 30, 2010, prior to our annual goodwill impairment review, we concluded that events occurred and circumstances changed in the Worldwide Digital Business reporting 32 Table of Contents unit that required us to conduct an impairment review. The primary factors contributing to our conclusion that we had a triggering event and a requirement to reassess the Worldwide Digital Business reporting unit goodwill for impairment included: (1) a reduction in forecasted revenue and operating results due to continued pressure on key parts of the business as a result of the weak economy; (2) reduced revenue and profit outlook for our eDiscovery service due to smaller average matter size and lower pricing; (3) a decision to discontinue certain software development projects as more fully discussed below within Depreciation, Amortization, and (Gain) Loss on Disposal/Writedown of Property, Plant and Equipment, Net; and (4) the sale of the domain name management product line of our Worldwide Digital Business reporting unit as more fully discussed below within Other (Income) Expense, Net. As a result of the review, we recorded a provisional goodwill impairment charge associated with our Worldwide Digital Business reporting unit in the amount of $255.0 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2010. We finalized this estimate in the fourth quarter of 2010, and we recorded an additional impairment of $28.8 million, for a total goodwill impairment charge of $283.8 million. Our consolidated revenues and expenses are subject to variations caused by the net effect of foreign currency translation on revenues and expenses incurred by our entities outside the U.S. During 2008, we saw net increases in both revenues and expenses as a result of the strengthening of the Euro, the Brazilian real and the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar, offset by weakening of the British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. In the third quarter of 2008, we saw a dramatic strengthening of the U.S. dollar in comparison to all the major foreign currencies of our most significant international markets, which lead to a decrease in reported revenue and expenses in the fourth quarter of 2008. In 2009, we saw decreases in both revenues and expenses as a result of the weakening of the British pound sterling, the Canadian dollar and the Euro against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. In 2010, we saw increases in both revenues and expenses as a result of the strengthening of the British pound sterling and the Canadian dollar, slightly offset by a weakening of the Euro, against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. It is difficult to predict how much foreign currency exchange rates will fluctuate in the future and how those fluctuations will impact our consolidated statement of operations. Due to the expansion of our international operations, these fluctuations have become material on individual balances. However, because both the revenues and expenses are denominated in the local currency of the country in which they are derived or incurred, the impact of currency fluctuations on our operating income and operating margin is mitigated. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we compare the percentage change in the results from one period to another period in this report using constant currency disclosure. The constant currency growth rates are calculated by translating the 2008 results at the 2009 average exchange rates and the 2009 results at the 2010 average exchange rates. Prior to January 1, 2010, the financial position and results of operations of the operating subsidiaries of Iron Mountain Europe (Group) Limited (collectively referred to as "IME"), our European business, were consolidated based on IMEs fiscal year ended October 31. Effective January 1, 2010, we changed the fiscal year end (and the reporting period for consolidation purposes) of IME to coincide with Iron Mountain Incorporateds ("IMI") fiscal year end of December 31. We believe that the change in accounting principle related to the elimination of the two month reporting lag for IME is preferable because it will result in more contemporaneous reporting of events and results related to IME. In accordance with applicable accounting literature, a change in subsidiary year end is treated as a change in accounting principle and requires retrospective application. The cumulative effect of the change was an increase in retained earnings of $12.2 million as of January 1, 2007. The impact of the change was not material to the results of operations for the previously reported annual and interim periods after January 1, 2008, and, thus, those results have not been revised. There is, however, a charge of $4.7 million recorded to other (income) expense, net in the year 33 Table of Contents ended December 31, 2010 to recognize the immaterial difference arising from the change. There were no significant, infrequent or unusual items in the IME two month period ended December 31, 2008 and 2009. The following table is a comparison of underlying average exchange rates of the foreign currencies that had the most significant impact on our U.S. dollar reported revenues and expenses: Average Exchange Rates for the Year Ended December 31, Percentage (Strengthening)/ Weakening of the U.S. dollar 2009(1) 2010 British pound sterling $ 1.544 $ 1.546 0.1 % Canadian dollar $ 0.880 $ 0.971 10.3 % Euro $ 1.366 $ 1.328 (2.8 )% Average Exchange Rates for the Year Ended December 31, Percentage (Strengthening)/ Weakening of the U.S. dollar 2008(1) 2009(1) British pound sterling $ 1.944 $ 1.544 (20.6 )% Canadian dollar $ 0.944 $ 0.880 (6.8 )% Euro $ 1.497 $ 1.366 (8.8 )% (1)Corresponding to the appropriate periods based on the operating subsidiaries of IMEs fiscal year ended October 31. Non GAAP Measures Adjusted Operating Income Before Depreciation, Amortization and Goodwill Impairment, or Adjusted OIBDA Adjusted OIBDA is defined as operating income before depreciation, amortization, goodwill impairment and (gain) loss on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net. Adjusted OIBDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted OIBDA by total revenues. We use multiples of current or projected Adjusted OIBDA in conjunction with our discounted cash flow models to determine our overall enterprise valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets. We believe Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA Margin provide current and potential investors with relevant and useful information regarding our ability to generate cash flow to support business investment. These measures are an integral part of the internal reporting system we use to assess and evaluate the operating performance of our business. Adjusted OIBDA does not include certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results, specifically: (1) (gains) and losses on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net; (2) goodwill impairment; (3) other (income) expense, net; (4) cumulative effect of change in accounting principle; and (5) net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. Adjusted OIBDA also does not include interest expense, net and the provision (benefit) for income taxes. These expenses are associated with our capitalization and tax structures, which we do not consider when evaluating the operating profitability of our core operations. Finally, Adjusted OIBDA does not include depreciation and amortization expenses, in order to eliminate the impact of capital investments, which we evaluate by comparing capital expenditures to incremental revenue generated and as a percentage of total revenues. Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA Margin should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America 34 Table of Contents ("GAAP"), such as operating or net income (loss) or cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP).

Our management uses this measure when evaluating the operating performance and profitability of our consolidated business. FCF is a useful measure in determining our ability to generate excess cash flows for reinvestment in the business, for discretionary deployment in investments such as real estate or acquisition opportunities, the potential returning of capital to shareholders or the repayment of indebtedness. As such, we believe this measure provides relevant and useful information to our current and potential investors.

We do not believe these excluded items to be indicative of our ongoing operating results and they are not considered when we are forecasting our future results. We believe Adjusted EPS is of value to investors when comparing our results from past, present and future periods.

The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and for the period then ended. On an on going basis, we evaluate the estimates used. We base our estimates on historical experience, actuarial estimates, current conditions and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Our critical accounting policies include the following, which are listed in no particular order: Revenue Recognition Our revenues consist of storage revenues as well as service revenues and are reflected net of sales and value added taxes. Storage revenues, both physical and digital, which are considered a key performance indicator for the information management services industry, consist primarily of recurring periodic charges related to the storage of materials or data (generally on a per unit basis). Service revenues are comprised of charges for related core service activities and a wide array of complementary products and services. Included in core service revenues are: (1) the handling of records, including addition of new records, temporary removal of records from storage, refilling of removed records, destruction of records, and permanent withdrawals from storage; (2) courier operations, consisting primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request; (3) secure shredding of sensitive documents; and (4) other recurring services, including hybrid services, recurring project revenues and maintenance and support fees associated with software license sales. Our complementary services revenues include special project work, data restoration projects, fulfillment services, consulting services 36 Table of Contents and product sales (including software licenses, specially designed storage containers and related supplies). Our secure shredding revenues include the sale of recycled paper (included in complementary services revenues), the price of which can fluctuate from period to period, adding to the volatility and reducing the predictability of that revenue stream. We recognize revenue when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Storage and service revenues are recognized in the month the respective storage or service is provided and customers are generally billed on a monthly basis on contractually agreed upon terms. Amounts related to future storage or prepaid service contracts, including maintenance and support contracts, for customers where storage fees or services are billed in advance are accounted for as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the applicable storage or service period or when the service is performed. Revenue from the sales of products, which is included as a component of service revenues, is recognized when shipped to the customer and title has passed to the customer. Revenues from the sales of products has historically not been significant. Revenues from sales of software licenses are recognized at the time of product delivery to our customer or reseller, and revenue from maintenance and support agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement. Revenues from software license sales and maintenance and support accounted for less than 1% of our annual 2010 consolidated revenues. Within our Worldwide Digital Business segment, in certain instances, we process and host data for customers. In these instances, the processing fees are deferred and recognized over the estimated service period. Accounting for Acquisitions Part of our growth strategy has included the acquisition of numerous businesses. The purchase price of these acquisitions has been determined after due diligence of the acquired business, market research, strategic planning, and the forecasting of expected future results and synergies. Estimated future results and expected synergies are subject to revisions as we integrate each acquisition and attempt to leverage resources. Each acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting as defined under the applicable accounting standards at the date of each acquisition. Accounting for these acquisitions has resulted in the capitalization of the cost in excess of fair value of the net assets acquired in each of these acquisitions as goodwill. We estimated the fair values of the assets acquired in each acquisition as of the date of acquisition and these estimates are subject to adjustment. These estimates are subject to final assessments of the fair value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, operating leases and deferred income taxes. We complete these assessments within one year of the date of acquisition. See Note 6 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Credit Memos We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments and disputes regarding billing and service issues. When calculating the allowance, we consider our past loss experience, current and prior trends in our aged receivables and credit memo activity, current economic conditions, and specific circumstances of individual receivable balances. If the financial condition of our customers were to significantly change, resulting in a significant improvement or impairment of their ability to make payments, an adjustment of the allowance may be required. We consider accounts receivable to be delinquent after such time as reasonable means of collection have been exhausted. We charge off uncollectible balances as circumstances warrant, generally no later than one year past due. As of December 31, 2009 and 2010, our allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos balance totaled $25.5 million and $25.9 million, respectively. 37 Table of Contents Impairment of Tangible and Intangible Assets Assets subject to amortization We review long lived assets and all amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operation to which the assets relate to their carrying amount. The operations are generally distinguished by the business segment and geographic region in which they operate. If the operation is determined to be unable to recover the carrying amount of its assets, then intangible assets are written down first, followed by the other long lived assets of the operation, to fair value. Fair value is based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, depending upon the nature of the assets. Goodwill Assets not subject to amortization: Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. We have selected October 1 as our annual goodwill impairment review date. We performed our annual goodwill impairment review as of October 1, 2008 and 2009 and noted no impairment of goodwill. In making this assessment, we relied on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, anticipated future cash flows, transactions and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. During the quarter ended September 30, 2010, prior to our annual goodwill impairment review, we concluded that events occurred and circumstances changed in the Worldwide Digital Business reporting unit that required us to conduct an impairment review. The primary factors contributing to our conclusion that we had a triggering event and a requirement to reassess the Worldwide Digital Business reporting unit goodwill for impairment included: (1) a reduction in forecasted revenue and operating results due to continued pressure on key parts of the business as a result of the weak economy; (2) reduced revenue and profit outlook for our eDiscovery service due to smaller average matter size and lower pricing; (3) a decision to discontinue certain software development projects as is more fully discussed below within Depreciation, Amortization, and (Gain) Loss on Disposal/Writedown of Property, Plant and Equipment, Net and; (4) the sale of the domain name management product line of our Worldwide Digital Business reporting unit as is more fully discussed below within Other (Income) Expense, Net. As a result of the review, we recorded a provisional goodwill impairment charge associated with our Worldwide Digital Business reporting unit in the amount of $255.0 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2010. We finalized this estimate in the fourth quarter of 2010, and we recorded an additional impairment of $28.8 million, for a total goodwill impairment charge of $283.8 million. We performed our most recent annual goodwill impairment review as of October 1, 2010 and noted no additional impairment of goodwill. As of December 31, 2010, no factors were identified that would alter our October 1, 2010 goodwill assessment. In making this assessment, we relied on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, anticipated future cash flows, transactions and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. Our reporting units at which level we performed our goodwill impairment analysis as of October 1, 2010 were as follows: North America; Europe; Latin America; Australia/New Zealand; Worldwide Digital; Joint Ventures (includes India, the various joint ventures in Southeast Asia and Russia, referred to as the "Joint Ventures") and Business Process Management ("BPM"). Given their similar economic characteristics, products, customers and processes, (1) the United Kingdom, Ireland and Norway and (2) the countries of Continental Europe (excluding joint ventures), each a reporting unit, have been aggregated as Europe and tested as one for goodwill impairment. As of December 31, 2010, the carrying value of goodwill, net amounted to $1,735.0 million, $440.9 million, $29.8 million and $67.1 million for North America, Europe, Latin America and Australia/New Zealand, respectively. Our Joint Ventures and BPM reporting units have no goodwill as of December 31, 2010. Our Worldwide 38 Table of Contents Digital reporting unit goodwill was written down to $51.1 million as of December 31, 2010 as a result of the charges previously discussed above. Our North America, Europe, Latin America, Australia/New Zealand and Worldwide Digital reporting units have estimated fair values as of October 1, 2010 that exceed their carrying value by greater than 20%. Reporting unit valuations have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit or a combined approach based on the present value of future cash flows and market and transaction multiples of revenues and earnings. The income approach incorporates many assumptions including future growth rates, discount factors, expected capital expenditures and income tax cash flows. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods. In conjunction with our annual goodwill impairment reviews, we reconcile the sum of the valuations of all of our reporting units to our market capitalization as of such dates. Accounting for Internal Use Software We develop various software applications for internal use. Computer software costs associated with internal use software are expensed as incurred until certain capitalization criteria are met. Payroll and related costs for employees who are directly associated with, and who devote time to, the development of internal use computer software projects (to the extent time is spent directly on the project) are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the software. Capitalization begins when the design stage of the application has been completed and it is probable that the application will be completed and used to perform the function intended. Depreciation begins when the software is placed in service. Computer software costs that are capitalized are periodically evaluated for impairment. It may be necessary for us to write off amounts associated with the development of internal use software if the project cannot be completed as intended. Our expansion into new technology based service offerings requires the development of internal use software that will be susceptible to rapid and significant changes in technology. We may be required to write off unamortized costs or shorten the estimated useful life if an internal use software program is replaced with an alternative tool prior to the end of the softwares estimated useful life. General uncertainties related to expansion into digital businesses, including the timing of introduction and market acceptance of our services, may adversely impact the recoverability of these assets. As of December 31, 2009 and 2010, capitalized labor net of accumulated depreciation was $41.4 million and $35.3 million, respectively. See Note 2(f) to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, we wrote off $0.6 million (primarily in Corporate), $0.6 million (primarily in Corporate) and $4.9 million (primarily in the Worldwide Digital Business segment), respectively, of previously deferred software costs, primarily internal labor costs, associated with internal use software development projects that were discontinued after implementation, which resulted in a loss on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net. Income Taxes We have recorded a valuation allowance, amounting to $79.9 million as of December 31, 2010, to reduce our deferred tax assets, primarily associated with certain state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credit carryforwards, to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We have federal net operating loss carryforwards which begin to expire in 2020 through 2029 of $84.3 million ($29.5 million, tax effected) at December 31, 2010 to reduce future federal taxable income. We have an asset for state net operating losses of $15.6 million (net of federal tax benefit), which begins to expire in 2011 through 2029, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 75%. We have assets for foreign net operating losses of $38.1 million, with various expiration dates, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 74%. Additionally, we have federal research credits of 39 Table of Contents $2.2 million which begin to expire in 2022 through 2029 and state research credits of $1.1 million (net of federal tax benefit) which have no expiration date, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 19%. We also have foreign tax credits of $60.8 million, which begin to expire in 2014 through 2019, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 65%. U.S. legislative changes in 2010 reduced the expected utilization of foreign tax credits which resulted in the requirement for a valuation allowance. If actual results differ unfavorably from certain of our estimates used, we may not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred income tax assets and foreign tax credit carryforwards and additional valuation allowances may be required. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that our estimates reflected in the tax provisions and accruals will equal our actual results. These differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. The evaluation of an uncertain tax position is a two step process. The first step is a recognition process whereby the company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The second step is a measurement process whereby a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is calculated to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. As of December 31, 2009 and 2010, we had approximately $88.2 million and $59.9 million, respectively, of reserves related to uncertain tax positions. The reversal of these reserves will be recorded as a reduction of our income tax provision if sustained. Although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in favorable or unfavorable changes in our estimates. We are currently under audit by the state of Massachusetts for the 2004 through 2008 tax years. We have not received any assessments to date. However, we may receive a notice of intention to assess in the range of zero to approximately $12.0 million, including interest and penalties. While we are unable to predict the final outcome of the audit at this time, it may result in an assessment of excise tax, which is a component of the income tax provision, or an assessment of net worth tax, which is an operating charge. We intend to defend this case vigorously. We do not expect this audit to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. We have elected to recognize interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as a component of the provision (benefit) for income taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. We recorded $4.5 million, $4.7 million and $(1.6) million for gross interest and penalties for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. We had $12.9 million and $11.6 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties as of December 31, 2009 and 2010, respectively. We have not provided deferred taxes on book basis differences related to certain foreign subsidiaries because such basis differences are not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future and we intend to reinvest indefinitely outside the U.S. These basis differences arose primarily through the undistributed book earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The basis differences could be reversed through a sale of the subsidiaries, the receipt of dividends from subsidiaries and certain other events or actions on our part, which would result in an increase in our provision for income taxes. It is not practicable to calculate the amount of such basis differences. 40 Table of Contents Stock Based Compensation We record stock based compensation expense, utilizing the straight line method, for the cost of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan. Stock based compensation expense, included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010 was $19.0 million ($15.7 million after tax or $0.08 per basic and diluted share), $18.7 million ($14.7 million after tax or $0.07 per basic and diluted shares) and $20.4 million ($15.7 million after tax or $0.08 per basic and diluted shares), respectively. The fair values of option grants are estimated on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model. Expected volatility and the expected term are the input factors to that model which require the most significant management judgment. Expected volatility is calculated utilizing daily historical volatility over a period that equates to the expected life of the option. The expected life (estimated period of time outstanding) of stock options granted is estimated using the historical exercise behavior of employees. Self Insured Liabilities We are self insured up to certain limits for costs associated with workers compensation claims, vehicle accidents, property and general business liabilities, and benefits paid under employee healthcare and short term disability programs. At December 31, 2009 and 2010 there were approximately $41.1 million and $43.9 million, respectively, of self insurance accruals reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. The measurement of these costs requires the consideration of historical cost experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim. We account for these costs primarily through actuarial methods, which develop estimates of the undiscounted liability for claims incurred, including those claims incurred but not reported. These methods provide estimates of future ultimate claim costs based on claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. We believe the use of actuarial methods to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals. However, the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claims involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known. We believe our recorded obligations for these expenses are appropriate. Nevertheless, changes in healthcare costs, severity, and other factors can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued amended guidance on multiple deliverable revenue arrangements and software revenue recognition. The multiple deliverable revenue arrangements updates to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (the "Codification") apply to all deliverables in contractual arrangements in all industries in which a vendor will perform multiple revenue generating activities. The change to the Codification creates a selling price hierarchy that an entity must use as evidence of fair value in separately accounting for all deliverables on a relative selling price basis which qualify for separation. The selling price hierarchy includes: (1) vendor specific objective evidence; (2) third party evidence; and (3) estimated selling price. Broadly speaking, this update to the Codification will result in the possibility for some entities to recognize revenue earlier and more closely align with the economics of certain revenue arrangements if the other criteria for separation (e.g. standalone value to the customer) are met. The software revenue recognition guidance was issued to address factors that entities should consider when determining whether the software and non software components of a product function together to deliver the products essential functionality. The software revenue recognition updates to the Codification will allow revenue arrangements in which software and non software components deliver together a 41 Table of Contents products essential functionality to follow the multiple deliverable revenue recognition criteria as opposed to the criteria applicable to software revenue recognition. Both updates are effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010 and apply prospectively to new or materially modified revenue arrangements after its effective date. We do not expect adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and results of operations.

(2)Our internal revenue growth rate represents the weighted average year over year growth rate of our revenues after removing the effects of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Our consolidated storage revenues increased $64.1 million, or 3.8%, to $1,731.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 and $38.9 million, or 2.4%, to $1,667.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, in comparison to the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2010 is attributable to internal revenue growth of 2.8%. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations added 1.0% to our storage revenue growth rate for the year ended December 31, 2010. Our storage growth rate was moderated in 2010 by current economic factors resulting in lower pricing and longer new sales cycles in our digital business, reduced average net pricing gains in the North American records management business due to the current low inflationary environment, episodic destructions in the physical data protection business and lower new sales and higher destruction rates in our North American records management physical business, which were offset by new sales in international markets. The increase in 2009 over 2008 is attributable to internal revenue growth of 6.4% resulting from strength in our North American Physical and International Physical operating segments, offset by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations of (4.0)%. Consolidated service revenues consisting of core service and complementary services increased $49.9 million, or 3.7%, to $1,395.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $1,346.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Service revenue internal growth was 1.7% as complementary service revenue internal growth of 9.2% in 2010 was offset by negative core service revenue internal growth of 1.2% in 2010. Complementary service revenues increased in 2010 primarily due to $36.8 million more revenue from the sale of recycled paper resulting from higher recycled paper pricing and gains in hybrid service revenues, which more than offset declines in eDiscovery revenues due to reduced average matter size and lower pricing, in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Core service revenue internal growth in the year ended December 31, 2010 was constrained by 43 Table of Contents current economic trends and pressures on activity based service revenues related to the handling and transportation of items in storage. Favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 increased reported service revenues 1.4%. Consolidated service revenues decreased $80.5 million, or (5.6)%, to $1,346.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 from $1,426.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Service revenue internal growth was negative 0.5% as a result of negative complementary service revenue internal growth of 9.4% in 2009, partially offset by core service revenue internal growth of 3.4% over 2008. As expected, complementary service revenues decreased on a year over year basis primarily due to the completion of a large special project in Europe in the third quarter of 2008 and $34.4 million less revenue from the sale of recycled paper revenues resulting from a steep decline in recycled paper pricing. We also experienced softness in 2009 in the more discretionary revenues such as project revenues and fulfillment services. Core service revenue growth was also constrained by current economic trends and pressures on activity based service revenues related to the handling and transportation of items in storage and secure shredding. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations reduced reported service revenues by 4.7% for 2009 compared to 2008. For the reasons stated above, our consolidated revenues increased $114.0 million, or 3.8%, to $3,127.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $3,013.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Internal revenue growth was 2.3% for 2010. We calculate internal revenue growth in local currency for our international operations. For the year ended December 31, 2010, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations increased our reported revenues by 1.2% primarily due to the strengthening of the British pound sterling and the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar, offset by the weakening of the Euro against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. Our consolidated revenues decreased $41.5 million, or (1.4)%, to $3,013.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 from $3,055.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Internal revenue growth was 3.2% and 7.9% in 2009 and 2008, respectively, and acquisitions contributed 0.3% and 3.4% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2009, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations negatively impacted our reported revenues by 4.3% primarily due to the weakening of the British pound sterling, the Canadian dollar and the Euro against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. For the year ended December 31, 2008, net favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that impacted our revenues were 0.6% and were primarily due to the strengthening of the Euro, the Brazilian real and the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar, offset by the weakening of the British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. Internal Growth Eight Quarter Trend 2009 2010 First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Storage Revenue 7.5 % 6.6 % 6.9 % 4.7 % 3.5 % 3.3 % 2.2 % 2.1 % Service Revenue 0.4 % 1.2 % (3.6 )% 0.1 % 4.4 % 1.0 % 1.7 % (0.2 )% Total Revenue 4.2 % 4.1 % 2.0 % 2.6 % 3.9 % 2.2 % 2.0 % 1.1 % We expect our consolidated internal revenue growth for 2011 to be approximately 0% to 2%. During the past eight quarters our storage internal growth rate has ranged between 2.1% and 7.5%. Our storage growth rate was moderated by current economic factors resulting in lower pricing and longer new sales cycles in our digital business, reduced average net pricing gains in the North American records management business due to the current low inflationary environment, episodic destructions in the physical data protection business and lower new sales and higher destruction rates in our North American records management physical business, which were offset by new sales in international markets. The internal growth rate for service revenue is inherently more volatile than the storage 44 Table of Contents revenue internal growth rate due to the more discretionary nature of certain complementary services we offer, such as large special projects, software licenses, and the volatility of prices for recycled paper. These revenues, which are often event driven and impacted to a greater extent by economic downturns as customers defer or cancel the purchase of certain services as a way to reduce their short term costs, may be difficult to replicate in future periods. As a commodity, recycled paper prices are subject to the volatility of that market. The internal growth rate for service revenues reflects the following: (1) pressures on activity based service revenues related to the handling and transportation of items in storage and secure shredding; (2) the expected softness in our complementary service revenues, such as project revenues and fulfillment services, beginning in late 2008; (3) declines in commodity prices for recycled paper and fuel, beginning in late 2008 and into 2009, but improving throughout 2010; and (4) a large public sector contract in Europe that was completed in the third quarter of 2008. OPERATING EXPENSES Cost of Sales Consolidated cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization) is comprised of the following expenses (in thousands): Percentage Change % of Consolidated Revenues Year Ended December 31, Percentage Change (Favorable)/ Unfavorable Dollar Change Constant Currency 2009 2010 Actual 2009 2010 Labor $ 626,751 $ 621,012 $ (5,739 ) (0.9 )% (2.3 )% 20.8 % 19.9 % (0.9 )% Facilities 419,616 417,503 (2,113 ) (0.5 )% (1.8 )% 13.9 % 13.3 % (0.6 )% Transportation 110,285 107,991 (2,294 ) (2.1 )% (3.1 )% 3.7 % 3.5 % (0.2 )% Product Cost of Sales and Other 114,562 107,692 (6,870 ) (6.0 )% (6.4 )% 3.8 % 3.4 % (0.4 )% $ 1,271,214 $ 1,254,198 $ (17,016 ) (1.3 )% (2.6 )% 42.2 % 40.1 % (2.1 )% Percentage Change % of Consolidated Revenues Year Ended December 31, Percentage Change (Favorable)/ Unfavorable Dollar Change Constant Currency 2008 2009 Actual 2008 2009 Labor $ 674,466 $ 626,751 $ (47,715 ) (7.1 )% (2.5 )% 22.1 % 20.8 % (1.3 )% Facilities 424,796 419,616 (5,180 ) (1.2 )% 3.6 % 13.9 % 13.9 % 0.0 % Transportation 152,080 110,285 (41,795 ) (27.5 )% (23.8 )% 5.0 % 3.7 % (1.3 )% Product Cost of Sales and Other 130,677 114,562 (16,115 ) (12.3 )% (8.0 )% 4.3 % 3.8 % (0.5 )% $ 1,382,019 $ 1,271,214 $ (110,805 ) (8.0 )% (3.5 )% 45.2 % 42.2 % (3.0 )% Labor Labor expense decreased to 19.9% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 20.8% for the year ended December 31, 2009. For the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, labor expense was unfavorably impacted by 1.4 percentage points due to currency variations. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, labor expense decreased by 2.3% in 2010 primarily due to productivity gains in our North American Physical Business, lower core service levels and lower incentive compensation expense of $12.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2010. 45 Table of Contents For the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, labor expense was favorably impacted by 4.6 percentage points due to currency variations. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, labor expense decreased by 2.5% in 2009 due primarily to productivity gains in our North American Physical Business, which is reflected in the approximate year over year decline of 8% in employee headcount, offset by merit increases. Facilities Facilities costs decreased to 13.3% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 13.9% for the year ended December 31, 2009. Facilities costs were unfavorably impacted by 1.3 percentage points due to currency variations during the year ended December 31, 2010. The largest component of our facilities cost is rent expense, which decreased on a reported dollar basis to 12.3% of consolidated storage revenues in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 12.7% in the same period in 2009. Other facilities costs decreased by approximately $7.0 million, in constant currency terms, for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to decreases in building maintenance costs of approximately $2.3 million, common area charges of $2.1 million and utilities costs of $2.0 million. Facilities costs were favorably impacted by 4.8 percentage points due to currency variations during the year ended December 31, 2009. The largest component of our facilities cost is rent expense, which decreased on a reported dollar basis from 13.4% of consolidated storage revenues for 2008 to 12.7% of consolidated storage revenues in 2009, mainly as a result of the impact of revenue mix and incremental rent charges incurred in the latter half of 2008 related to our U.K. operations. Other facilities costs for 2009 increased in constant currency terms due to increased common area charges of $8.5 million, property taxes and insurance of $2.4 million, and utilities of $0.3 million related to rising costs. Transportation Transportation expenses were unfavorably impacted by 1.0 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2010. Transportation expenses decreased by $3.5 million in constant currency terms during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. A decrease of $3.3 million in vehicle lease expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009 was due to the capitalization of leased vehicles upon renewal. The lease cost did not change, but the categorization of charges did, resulting in the cost now being allocated to depreciation and interest. Transportation expenses were favorably impacted by 3.7 percentage points due to currency variations during the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the year ended 2008. Certain vehicle leases related to vans, trucks and mobile shredding units in our vehicle lease portfolio previously classified as operating leases in 2008 were classified as capital leases upon renewal or at inception for new leases in 2009. As a result, for 2009 we had lower vehicle rent expense in our North American Physical segment of approximately $22.4 million (offset by an increased amount of combined depreciation of approximately $20.2 million and interest expense of approximately $3.3 million). In addition, fuel costs decreased by $14.1 million during 2009 as compared to 2008. The lower fuel costs were primarily due to lower commodity prices and, to a lesser extent, the benefit of productivity gains from ongoing transportation improvement initiatives. Product Cost of Sales and Other Product cost of sales and other, which includes cartons, media and other service storage and supply costs, is highly correlated to complementary revenue streams. These costs were unfavorably impacted by 0.4 percentage points of currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2010. For 2010, product cost of sales and other decreased by $6.9 million as compared to the prior year on an actual 46 Table of Contents basis, due primarily to a $3.2 million reduction in carton costs in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to costs associated with product sourcing. These costs were favorably impacted by 4.3 percentage points of currency variations during the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. For 2009, product cost of sales and other decreased in constant currency terms by $10.5 million as compared to the prior year primarily due to the sale of our North American data product sales line in the second quarter of 2008.

General and administrative expenses were unfavorably impacted by 0.8 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2010. In constant currency terms, general and administrative expenses increased by $12.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to the same period in 2009. The increase was primarily attributable to increased compensation expense of $5.4 million, increased insurance expenses of $3.2 million and increased professional fees of $4.4 million. The increased compensation during the year ended December 31, 2010 is primarily a result of merit increases, increased medical and other benefits, as well as increased headcount primarily related to our continued investment in our hybrid records management services of $18.2 million, all of which were partially offset by a reduction in incentive compensation of $12.8 million. 47 Table of Contents General and administrative expenses were favorably impacted by 5.5 percentage points due to currency variations during the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. In constant currency terms, compensation expense, including medical and other benefits, increased by $17.8 million in 2009 as a result of merit increases and increased headcount. In addition, legal costs and professional fees (related to project and cost saving initiatives) increased $24.7 million in 2009 as compared to 2008. These increases were offset by lower discretionary spending of $8.8 million for items including recruiting and relocations, telephone, training, postage and supplies, and certain enterprise wide meetings which were held in 2008 but not in 2009. Sales, Marketing & Account Management Sales, marketing and account management expenses were unfavorably impacted by 0.7 percentage points due to currency changes during the year ended December 31, 2010. In constant currency terms, the increase of $18.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 is primarily related to increased compensation of $9.6 million, including $5.8 million of incremental costs related to the acquisition of Mimosa and general merit increases. Additionally, incremental professional fees of $2.0 million and $4.6 million of incremental marketing costs also contributed to the increase. Sales, marketing and account management expenses were favorably impacted by 3.9 percentage points due to currency variations during the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. In constant currency terms, the decrease of 1.4% in 2009 was primarily related to lower discretionary spending of $4.1 million on items such as travel and entertainment and our enterprise wide sales meeting which was held in 2008 but not in 2009. Commissions expense also declined by $10.2 million in constant currency terms during 2009 as compared to 2008. These decreases were partially offset by increased investment in personnel in sales and account management and merit increases in our International Physical segment of $4.8 million and increased compensation (other than commissions) of $4.4 million primarily as a result of merit increases in the North American Physical segment. Information Technology Information technology expenses were unfavorably impacted by 0.5 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2010. In constant currency terms, information technology expenses increased $17.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2010. Compensation increased $6.9 million, primarily associated with the acquisition of Mimosa and increased merit raises, offset by lower incentive compensation. Additionally, overhead expenses increased by $10.5 million, primarily a result of increased corporate expenses, increased professional fees of $4.1 million (related to project and cost saving initiatives) and $2.1 million of incremental costs related to the Mimosa acquisition. Information technology expenses were favorably impacted by 3.0 percentage points due to currency variations during the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to 2008. In constant currency terms, the decrease of 2.3% in information technology expenses for 2009 was due to reduced overhead and discretionary spending, such as recruiting, travel and entertainment, professional fees, and equipment rental costs of $2.3 million and disciplined cost management. Bad Debt Expense Consolidated bad debt expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased $0.4 million to $11.5 million (0.4% of consolidated revenues) from $11.8 million (0.4% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2009. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts that is calculated based on our past loss experience, current and prior trends in our aged receivables, current economic conditions, and specific circumstances of individual receivable balances. We continue to monitor our 48 Table of Contents customers payment activity and make adjustments based on their financial condition and in light of historical and expected trends. Consolidated bad debt expense increased $1.1 million to $11.8 million (0.4% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2009 from $10.7 million (0.4% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in bad debt expense in 2009 from 2008 was attributable to the worsening economic climate. Goodwill Impairment During the quarter ended September 30, 2010, prior to our annual goodwill impairment review, we concluded that events occurred and circumstances changed in the Worldwide Digital Business reporting unit that required us to conduct an impairment review. The primary factors contributing to our conclusion that we had a triggering event and a requirement to reassess the Worldwide Digital Business reporting unit goodwill for impairment included: (1) a reduction in forecasted revenue and operating results due to continued pressure on key parts of the business as a result of the weak economy; (2) reduced revenue and profit outlook for our eDiscovery service due to smaller average matter size and lower pricing; (3) a decision to discontinue certain software development projects as more fully discussed below within Depreciation, Amortization, and (Gain) Loss on Disposal/Writedown of Property, Plant and Equipment, Net; and (4) the sale of the domain name management product line of our Worldwide Digital Business reporting unit as more fully discussed below within Other (Income) Expense, Net. As a result of the review, we recorded a provisional goodwill impairment charge associated with our Worldwide Digital Business reporting unit in the amount of $255.0 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2010. We finalized this estimate in the fourth quarter of 2010, and we recorded an additional impairment of $28.8 million, for a total goodwill impairment charge of $283.8 million. Depreciation, Amortization, and (Gain) Loss on Disposal/Writedown of Property, Plant and Equipment, Net Depreciation expense increased $23.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to additional depreciation expense related to capital expenditures and acquisitions, including storage systems, which include racking, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and software, and buildings. Depreciation expense increased $29.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily due to additional depreciation expense of approximately $20.2 million resulting from certain vehicle leases which had been classified as operating leases in 2008 being classified as capital leases upon renewal or at inception for new leases in 2009, as well as additional depreciation associated with technology investments in our Worldwide Digital Business segment of $4.1 million. Amortization expense increased $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to the increased amortization of intangible assets, such as customer relationship intangible assets and intellectual property acquired through business combinations. Amortization expense decreased $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily due to decreases resulting from currency variations which were offset by the increased amortization of intangible assets, such as customer relationship intangible assets and intellectual property acquired through business combinations. Consolidated gain on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 consisted primarily of a gain of approximately $10.2 million as a result of the settlement with our insurers in connection with a portion of the property component of our claim related to the Chilean earthquake in the third and fourth quarter of 2010, gains of approximately $3.2 million in North America primarily related to the disposition of certain owned 49 Table of Contents equipment and a gain on disposal of a building in our International Physical segment of approximately $1.3 million in the United Kingdom, offset by approximately $1.0 million of asset write downs associated with our Latin American operations, approximately $2.6 million of impairment losses primarily related to certain owned facilities in North America, and an approximately $4.9 million write off in the third and fourth quarters of 2010 of previously deferred software costs related to our Worldwide Digital Business segment associated with certain software development projects that were discontinued after implementation. Consolidated loss on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, consisted primarily of a gain on disposal of a building in our International Physical segment of approximately $1.9 million in France, offset by losses on the writedown of certain facilities of approximately $1.0 million in our North American Physical segment, $0.7 million in our International Physical segment, $0.3 million in our Worldwide Digital segment and $0.3 million in Corporate (associated with discontinued products after implementation). Consolidated loss on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, consisted primarily of a $2.3 million impairment of an owned storage facility in North America which we decided to exit in the first quarter of 2008, a $1.3 million impairment of an owned storage facility which we decided to exit in the third quarter of 2008, a $0.5 million writedown for an owned storage facility that we had vacated and had classified as available for sale in the third quarter of 2008, a $1.9 million writedown of two owned storage facilities in North America and related assets which we decided to exit in the fourth quarter of 2008, as well as a $0.6 million write off of previously deferred software costs in Corporate associated with discontinued products after implementation and other disposal and asset writedowns. OPERATING INCOME and ADJUSTED OIBDA As a result of all the foregoing factors, consolidated operating income decreased $225.0 million, or 41.0%, to $323.6 million (10.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $548.5 million (18.2% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2009. As a result of all the foregoing factors, consolidated Adjusted OIBDA increased $77.5 million, or 8.9%, to $945.5 million (30.2% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $868.0 million (28.8% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2009. As a result of all the foregoing factors, consolidated operating income increased $56.0 million, or 11.4%, to $548.5 million (18.2% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2009 from $492.5 million (16.1% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2008. As a result of all the foregoing factors, consolidated Adjusted OIBDA increased $77.3 million, or 9.8%, to $868.0 million (28.8% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2009 from $790.8 million (25.9% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2008. OTHER EXPENSES, NET Interest Expense, Net Consolidated interest expense, net decreased $6.8 million to $221.0 million (7.1% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $227.8 million (7.6% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to a reduction in year over year short term borrowings on our revolving credit facility, as well as a reduction in our outstanding borrowings due to the early retirement of $200.0 million of our 73/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2015 (the "73/4% Notes") during 2010. Our weighted average interest rate was 6.9% and 7.0% at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Consolidated interest expense, net decreased $8.8 million to $227.8 million (7.6% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2009 from $236.6 million (7.7% of consolidated revenues) 50 Table of Contents for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily due to a reduction in year over year borrowings under our revolving credit facility while our weighted average interest rate remained flat at 7.0% as of December 31, 2009 and 2008. We incurred approximately $3.3 million of additional interest expense on capital leases on certain vehicle leases previously classified as operating leases prior to renewal or upon lease inception. Other (Income) Expense, Net (in thousands) Year Ended December 31, Dollar Change 2009 2010 Foreign currency transaction (gains) losses, net $ (12,477 ) $ 5,305 $ 17,782 Debt extinguishment expense 3,031 1,792 (1,239 ) Other, net (2,633 ) (5,325 ) (2,692 ) $ (12,079 ) $ 1,772 $ 13,851 Year Ended December 31, Dollar Change 2008 2009 Foreign currency transaction losses (gains), net $ 28,882 $ (12,477 ) $ (41,359 ) Debt extinguishment expense 418 3,031 2,613 Other, net 1,728 (2,633 ) (4,361 ) $ 31,028 $ (12,079 ) $ (43,107 ) Net foreign currency transaction losses of $5.3 million, based on period end exchange rates, were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2010. Losses resulted primarily from changes in the exchange rate of the British pound sterling, the Euro and the Russian Ruble, offset by the Brazilian Real, against the U.S. dollar compared to December 31, 2009, as these currencies relate to our intercompany balances with and between our European and Latin American subsidiaries, and gains associated with our British pound sterling forward contracts, British pound sterling denominated debt and Euro denominated debt. Net foreign currency transaction gains of $12.5 million, based on period end exchange rates, were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2009. Gains resulted primarily from changes in the exchange rate of the British pound sterling, Euro, Brazilian Real and Chilean Peso against the U.S. dollar compared to December 31, 2008, as these currencies relate to our intercompany balances with and between our European and Latin American subsidiaries, offset by losses as a result of British pounds sterling and Euro denominated debt and forward foreign currency swap contracts held by our U.S. parent company. Net foreign currency transaction losses of $28.9 million, based on period end exchange rates, were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2008. Losses resulted primarily as a result of the British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar compared to December 31, 2007, as this currency relates to our intercompany balances with and between our U.K. subsidiaries, offset by gains on the marking to market of British pound sterling and Euro denominated debt and forward foreign currency swap contracts held by our U.S. parent company. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we redeemed $200.0 million of the $431.3 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 73/4% Notes at a redemption price of $1,012.92 for each one thousand dollars of principal amount of the notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We recorded a charge to other expense (income), net of $1.8 million in the third quarter of 2010 related to the early extinguishment of the 73/4% Notes being redeemed. This charge consists of the call premium 51 Table of Contents and deferred financing costs, net of original issue premiums related to the 73/4% Notes that were redeemed. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we redeemed our 85/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013 and wrote off $3.0 million in associated deferred financing costs. During 2008, we redeemed the remaining outstanding portion of our 81/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011 and, in connection with the reduction in our revolving credit facility availability due to a bankruptcy of one of our lenders, we wrote off $0.4 million in deferred financing costs. Other, net in the year ended December 31, 2010 was a $5.3 million gain. In August 2010, we divested the domain name management product line of our Worldwide Digital Business segment for approximately $11.4 million in cash at closing, resulting in a pretax gain of approximately $6.9 million ($2.8 million after tax) in 2010. The assets sold primarily consisted of customer contracts. Also included in the gain for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $1.2 million of gains related to certain trading marketable securities held in a trust for the benefit of employees included in a deferred compensation plan we sponsor. Offsetting these gains was $4.7 million of losses related to the impact of the change in IMEs fiscal year end. Since its inception, IME had operated with an October 31 fiscal year end. IMEs financial results had historically been consolidated with IMIs results with a two month lag. In order to better align our European processes with the enterprise, effective January 1, 2010, the IME fiscal year end was changed to December 31 to match the Companys fiscal year end. The $4.7 million charge represents the net impact of this change for the two years ended December 31, 2009. Other, net in the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily consisted of $1.7 million of gains related to certain trading marketable securities held in a trust for the benefit of employees included in a deferred compensation plan we sponsor, in addition to $0.6 million of business interruption proceeds for an owned storage facility in France, which was taken by eminent domain in the first quarter of 2009.

Provision for Income Taxes Our effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010 were 63.6%, 33.2% and 148.6%, respectively. The primary reconciling items between the federal statutory rate of 35% and our overall effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2010 is a goodwill impairment charge, of which a majority was non deductible for tax purposes. U.S. legislative changes in 2010 reduced the expected utilization of foreign tax credits. Certain previously unrecognized tax benefits were recognized in 2010 due to expirations of statute of limitation periods and settlements with tax authorities in various worldwide jurisdictions. In 2009 and 2008, we had significant unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses on intercompany loans and on debt and derivative instruments in different jurisdictions with different tax rates. For 2009, foreign currency gains were recorded in lower tax jurisdictions associated with the marking to market of intercompany loan positions while foreign currency losses were recorded in higher tax jurisdictions associated with the marking to market of debt and derivative instruments, which reduced the effective tax rate by 4.9% for the year ended December 31, 2009. Our effective tax rate is higher than the statutory rate in 2008 primarily due to significant foreign exchange gains and losses in different jurisdictions with different tax rates. For 2008, foreign currency gains were recorded in higher tax jurisdictions, associated with our marking to market of debt and derivative instruments, while foreign currency losses were recorded in lower tax jurisdictions, associated with the marking to market of intercompany loan positions, which together increased the 2008 tax rate by 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2008. Our effective tax rate is subject to variability in the future due to, among other items: (1) changes in the mix of income from foreign jurisdictions; (2) tax law changes; (3) volatility in foreign exchange gains and (losses); (4) the timing of the establishment and reversal of tax reserves; and (5) our ability to utilize foreign tax credits that we generate. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous 52 Table of Contents foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. Although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in changes in our estimates. Discrete items are recorded in the period they occur. NET INCOME As a result of all the foregoing factors, consolidated net income for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased $271.3 million, or 122.0%, to a net loss of $49.0 million (negative 1.6% of consolidated revenues) from net income of $222.3 million (7.4% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease in operating income noted above is primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge associated with our Worldwide Digital Business segment, as well as, foreign currency exchange rate impacts and the impact of the change in IMEs fiscal year end included in other income (expense), net and the impact of our tax rate for 2010 and the resulting increase in the provision for income taxes described above contributed to the decrease in net income, and were partially offset by the recorded gain associated with the divestiture of the domain name management product line of our Worldwide Digital Business segment. For the year ended December 31, 2010, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests resulted in a decrease in net income attributable to Iron Mountain Incorporated of $4.9 million. These represent our noncontrolling partners share of earnings/losses in our majority owned international subsidiaries that are consolidated in our operating results. As a result of all the foregoing factors, consolidated net income for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased $140.4 million, or 171.3%, to $222.3 million (7.4% of consolidated revenues) from net income of $81.9 million (2.7% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in operating income noted above, the foreign currency exchange rate impacts included in other income (expense), net and the impact of our tax rate for 2009 contributed to the increase in net income. For the year ended December 31, 2009, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests resulted in a reduction to net income attributable to Iron Mountain Incorporated of $1.4 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue in our North American Physical Business segment increased 3.3% over the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to internal growth of 2.3%. Total revenue internal growth was comprised of storage internal growth of 2.3% related to increased Hard Copy and Data Protection revenues and service internal growth of 2.3%. Current economic factors have led to a moderation in our storage growth rate as a result of reduced average net pricing gains due to the current low inflationary environment, episodic destructions in the physical data protection business and lower new sales and higher destruction rates in our physical business over the past year. Core service revenue growth was also constrained by current economic trends and pressures on activity based services revenues related to the handling and transportation of items in storage. Our core services business yielded negative internal growth of 2.3%, which was more than offset by complementary services revenues internal growth of 16.3%, due primarily to higher recycled paper prices and gains in hybrid service revenues. Additionally, favorable foreign currency rate changes related to Canada resulted in increased 2010 revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, of 1.0%. Adjusted OIBDA as a percentage of segment revenue increased in 2010 due mainly to productivity gains and disciplined cost management, partially offset by a $6.3 million increase in general and administrative compensation and a $1.2 million increase in bad debt expense. During the year ended December 31, 2009, revenue in our North American Physical Business segment increased 1.7% over the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily due to internal growth of 2.8%. Total revenue internal growth was due to solid storage internal growth of 6.2% related to increased Hard Copy and Data Protection revenues and was negatively impacted by depressed service 54 Table of Contents internal growth of negative 1.5%. Organic growth in our core services business of 2.9% was more than offset by decreased complementary services revenues primarily due to steep declines in recycled paper prices and softness in discretionary special projects and fulfillment services. Additionally, unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations related to Canada resulted in decreased 2009 revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, of 0.6%. Adjusted OIBDA as a percentage of segment revenue increased in 2009 due mainly to productivity gains, pricing actions, disciplined cost management, lower vehicle rent expense due to the recharacterization of certain vehicle leases, and increased margin due to the sale of our low margin data products division in 2008, partially offset by a $17.7 million increase in professional fees (related to project and cost savings initiatives).

Revenue in our International Physical Business segment increased 6.2% during the year ended December 31, 2010 over 2009 due to internal revenue growth of 3.8% supported by solid 5.9% storage internal growth and core services internal growth of 1.6%. The impact of acquisitions increased reported revenue by 0.2% in 2010. Foreign currency fluctuations in 2010, primarily in Europe, resulted in increased 2010 revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, of approximately 2.2% as compared to 2009. Adjusted OIBDA as a percentage of segment revenue in the year ended December 31, 2010 was flat compared to the same period in 2009 due to increased compensation expense of $8.5 million, primarily related to investments in our hybrid records management services, as well as one time cost accruals recorded in 2010 of approximately $7.4 million, offset by increased operating income from productivity gains, pricing actions and disciplined cost management. Revenue in our International Physical Business segment decreased 10.7% during the year ended December 31, 2009 over 2008 due to foreign currency fluctuations in 2009, primarily in the United Kingdom, which resulted in decreased 2009 revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, compared to 2008 of approximately 15.8%. This decline was offset by total internal revenue growth for the segment of 4.6%, supported by solid 8.3% storage internal growth and service revenue internal growth of 1.0%. Acquisitions increased reported revenue by 0.5% in 2009. Service revenue internal growth includes an 55 Table of Contents unfavorable year over year comparison due to a large European special project that was completed in the third quarter of 2008 which contributed to complementary revenue internal growth of negative 9.8%. Adjusted OIBDA as a percentage of segment revenue increased in 2009 primarily due to disciplined cost management and productivity gains, partially offset by the completion of a large, high margin European special project in the third quarter of 2008, increased rent and facility costs and increased compensation expense related to investments in sales and business support during 2008 and 2009.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue in our Worldwide Digital Business segment increased 0.9% over 2009. Mimosa, which we acquired in February 2010, contributed $10.8 million, or a 4.7% increase in revenue. This increase was offset by lower pricing and longer new sales cycles in our digital business and soft demand for eDiscovery services. The sale of our domain name management product line in August 2010 decreased 2010 reported revenues by 0.9% as compared to 2009. In the year ended December 31, 2010, Adjusted OIBDA in the Worldwide Digital Business segment decreased compared to 2009 due to the impact of revenue mix and increased costs associated with the integration of Mimosa. During the year ended December 31, 2009, revenue in our Worldwide Digital Business segment increased 2.9% over 2008, due to strong performance in our eDiscovery business offset by a decrease in data restoration and license sales in 2009 over 2008. In the year ended December 31, 2009, Adjusted OIBDA in the Worldwide Digital Business segment increased compared to 2008 due to the impact of revenue mix and decreases in commissions and discretionary spending, including recruiting, travel and entertainment. 56 Table of Contents Corporate Dollar Change Percentage Change Year Ended December 31, from 2008 to 2009 from 2009 to 2010 from 2008 to 2009 from 2009 to 2010 2008 2009 2010 Segment Adjusted OIBDA(1) $ (157,986 ) $ (164,406 ) $ (176,900 ) $ (6,420 ) $ (12,494 ) 4.1 % 7.6 % Segment Adjusted OIBDA(1) as a Percentage of Consolidated Revenue (5.2 )% (5.5 )% (5.7 )% (1)See Note 9 to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for definition of Adjusted OIBDA and for the basis on which allocations are made and a reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA to income (loss) before provision (benefit) for income taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2010, expenses in the Corporate segment increased 7.6% over 2009. This increase was primarily driven by increased information technology expenses of $4.4 million, higher professional fees of $2.2 million related to productivity and cost saving initiatives, an insurance deductible of $2.8 million associated with the recent Chilean and New Zealand earthquakes, increased stock based compensation of $1.7 million and increased marketing expenses, partially offset by a reduction in incentive compensation. During the year ended December 31, 2009, expenses in the Corporate segment increased 4.1% over the year ended December 31, 2008, driven primarily by increases in professional fees of $3.7 million related to project and consulting costs, compensation of $2.5 million due primarily to merit increases and charitable contributions of $2.0 million, offset by decreases in other expenses of $1.5 million, which included much of our discretionary spending, such as travel and entertainment and supplies, and a decrease in stock based compensation expense of $0.3 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following is a summary of our cash balances and cash flows (in thousands) as of and for the years ended December 31, 2008 2009 2010 Cash flows from operating activities $ 537,029 $ 616,911 $ 625,140 Cash flows from investing activities (459,594 ) (324,066 ) (432,670 ) Cash flows from financing activities 87,368 (129,692 ) (381,234 ) Cash and cash equivalents at the end of year 278,370 446,656 258,693 Net cash provided by operating activities was $625.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $616.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The 1.3% increase resulted primarily from an increase in net income, excluding non cash charges of $72.4 million, offset by uses in working capital and decreases in realized foreign exchange gains of $60.3 million and $3.9 million, respectively, over the same period last year. Working capital decreases are primarily related to increases in year over year amounts paid for income taxes and incentive compensation, offset by improved cash collection associated with customer accounts receivable. Our business requires significant capital expenditures to support our expected revenue growth and ongoing operations as well as new products and services and increased profitability. These expenditures are included in cash flows from investing activities. As the nature of our business has evolved over time, so has the nature of our capital expenditures. Every year we expend capital to support a number 57 Table of Contents of different objectives. The majority of our capital goes to support business line growth and our ongoing operations. We also expend capital to support the development and improvement of products and services and projects designed to increase our profitability. These expenditures are generally smaller and more discretionary in nature. Cash paid for our capital expenditures, cash paid for acquisitions (net of cash acquired) and additions to customer acquisition costs during the year ended December 31, 2010 amounted to $277.6 million, $129.4 million and $13.2 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2010, capital expenditures, net, cash paid for acquisitions (net of cash acquired) and additions to customer acquisition costs were funded with cash flows provided by operating activities and cash equivalents on hand. Excluding potential future acquisitions, we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately $245.0 million in the year ending December 31, 2011. Included in our estimated capital expenditures for 2011 is approximately $20.0 million of real estate purchases. Net cash used in financing activities was $381.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. During 2010, we had $18.2 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plan and $2.3 million of excess tax benefits from stock based compensation. We used the proceeds from these financing transactions and cash on hand for the early retirement of senior subordinated notes of $202.6 million, to repay $49.8 million on our revolving credit and term loans and other debt, net, to repurchase $111.6 million of our common stock and to pay dividends in the amount of $37.9 million on our common stock. In February 2010, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $150.0 million in repurchases of our common stock and in October 2010, our board of directors authorized up to an additional $200.0 million of such purchases, for a total of $350.0 million. This represented less than 10% of our outstanding common stock based on the closing price on the dates the programs were announced. All purchases are subject to stock price, market conditions, corporate and legal requirements and other factors. In addition, in February 2010, our board of directors adopted a dividend policy under which we began paying quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. The first quarterly dividend of $0.0625 per share was paid on April 15, 2010 to stockholders of record on March 25, 2010 in the aggregate amount of $12.7 million. The second quarterly dividend of $0.0625 per share was paid on July 15, 2010 to stockholders of record on June 25, 2010 in the aggregate amount of $12.6 million. The third quarterly dividend of $0.0625 per share was paid on October 15, 2010 to stockholders of record on September 28, 2010 in the aggregate amount of $12.5 million. The fourth quarterly dividend of $0.1875 per share was paid on January 14, 2011 to stockholders of record on December 27, 2010 in the aggregate amount of $37.5 million. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors. If we continue the $0.1875 per share quarterly dividend we anticipate that the 2011 annual dividend payout will be approximately $150.0 million based on our total outstanding shares as of the end of 2010 (of which the fourth quarter 2011 payment would not be paid until January, 2012, if declared). The following table is a summary of our repurchase activity under all of our share repurchase programs during 2010: 2010 Shares Amount (In thousands) Prior year authorization as of January 1, $ Authorizations 350,000 Repurchases paid 4,764,023 (111,468 ) Repurchases unsettled Authorization remaining as of December 31, $ 238,532 58 Table of Contents Due to the declining economic environment in 2008, the current fair market value of vans, trucks and mobile shredding units within our vehicle fleet portfolio, which we lease, have declined. As a result, certain vehicle leases that previously met the requirements to be considered operating leases have been classified as capital leases, and certain others will be, upon renewal. The impact of these changes on our consolidated cash flow statement in the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2010 is that payments related to these leases previously reflected as a use of cash within the operating activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows are now, and will be, reflected as a use of cash within the financing activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows. For 2009 and 2010, the amount of this impact was $19.1 million and $21.9 million, respectively. Financial instruments that potentially subject us to market risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds and time deposits). As of December 31, 2010, we had significant concentrations of liquid investments with seven global banks and four "Triple A" rated money market funds which we consider to be large, highly rated investment grade institutions. As of December 31, 2010, our cash and cash equivalent and restricted cash balance was $293.8 million, including money market funds and time deposits amounting to $241.2 million. A substantial portion of these money market funds are invested in U.S. treasuries. We are highly leveraged and expect to continue to be highly leveraged for the foreseeable future. Our consolidated debt as of December 31, 2010 was comprised of the following (in thousands): Revolving Credit Facility(1) $ Term Loan Facility(1) 396,200 71/4% GBP Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014(2) 232,530 73/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2015(2) 233,234 65/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016(2) 317,529 71/2% CAD Senior Subordinated Notes due 2017 (the "Subsidiary Notes")(3) 175,306 83/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018(2) 200,000 8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018(2) 49,777 63/4% Euro Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018(2) 338,129 8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020(2) 300,000 83/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2021(2) 548,174 Real Estate Mortgages, Capital Leases and Other(4) 218,576 Total Long term Debt 3,009,455 Less Current Portion (96,990 ) Long term Debt, Net of Current Portion $ 2,912,465 (1)The capital stock or other equity interests of most of our U.S. subsidiaries, and up to 66% of the capital stock or other equity interests of our first tier foreign subsidiaries, are pledged to secure these debt instruments, together with all intercompany obligations of foreign subsidiaries owed to us or to one of our U.S. subsidiary guarantors. (2)Collectively referred to as the Parent Notes. Iron Mountain Incorporated ("IMI") is the direct obligor on the Parent Notes, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior subordinated basis, by substantially all of its direct and indirect 100% owned U.S. subsidiaries (the "Guarantors"). These guarantees are joint and several obligations of the Guarantors. Iron Mountain Canada Corporation ("Canada Company") and the remainder of our subsidiaries do not guarantee the Parent Notes. (3)Canada Company is the direct obligor on the Subsidiary Notes, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior subordinated basis, by IMI and the Guarantors. These guarantees are joint and several obligations of IMI and the Guarantors. 59 Table of Contents (4)Includes (a) real estate mortgages of $7.5 million, (b) capital lease obligations of $201.9 million, and (c) other various notes and other obligations, which were assumed by us as a result of certain acquisitions, of $9.2 million. Our credit facility consists of (i) revolving credit facilities under which we can borrow, subject to certain limitations as defined in the credit agreement we entered into on April 16, 2007 governing this facility (the "Credit Agreement"), up to an aggregate amount of $765.0 million (including Canadian dollar and multi currency revolving credit facilities), and (ii) a $410.0 million term loan facility. Our revolving credit facility is supported by a group of 24 banks. Our subsidiaries, Canada Company and Iron Mountain Switzerland GmbH, may borrow directly under the Canadian revolving credit and multi currency revolving credit facilities, respectively. Additional subsidiary borrowers may be added under the multi currency revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility terminates on April 16, 2012. With respect to the term loan facility, quarterly loan payments of approximately $1.0 million are required through maturity on April 16, 2014, at which time the remaining outstanding principal balance of the term loan facility is due. The interest rate on borrowings under the Credit Agreement varies depending on our choice of interest rate and currency options, plus an applicable margin. IMI guarantees the obligations of each of the subsidiary borrowers under the Credit Agreement, and substantially all of our U.S. subsidiaries guarantee the obligations of IMI and the subsidiary borrowers. The capital stock or other equity interests of most of our U.S. subsidiaries, and up to 66% of the capital stock or other equity interests of our first tier foreign subsidiaries, are pledged to secure the Credit Agreement, together with all intercompany obligations of foreign subsidiaries owed to us or to one of our U.S. subsidiary guarantors. As of December 31, 2010, we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility; we had various outstanding letters of credit totaling $2.5 million. The remaining availability, based on IMIs leverage ratio, which is calculated based on the last 12 months earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), and other adjustments as defined in the Credit Agreement and current external debt, under the revolving credit facility on December 31, 2010, was $762.5 million. The interest rate in effect under the term loan facility was 1.8% as of December 31, 2010. The Credit Agreement, our indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to complete acquisitions, pay cash dividends, incur indebtedness, make investments, sell assets and take certain other corporate actions. The covenants do not contain a rating trigger. Therefore, a change in our debt rating would not trigger a default under the Credit Agreement, our indentures or other agreements governing our indebtedness. Our revolving credit and term loan facilities, as well as our indentures, use EBITDA based calculations as primary measures of financial performance, including leverage ratios. IMIs revolving credit and term leverage ratio was 3.3 and 2.9 as of December 31, 2009 and 2010, respectively, compared to a maximum allowable ratio of 5.5. Similarly, our bond leverage ratio, per the indentures, was 4.1 and 3.4 as of December 31, 2009 and 2010, respectively, compared to a maximum allowable ratio of 6.5. Noncompliance with these leverage ratios would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we designated as Excluded Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the indentures), certain of our subsidiaries that own our assets and conduct our operations in the United Kingdom. As a result of such designation, these subsidiaries are now subject to substantially all of the covenants of the indentures, except that they are not required to provide a guarantee, and the EBITDA and debt of these subsidiaries is included for purposes of calculating the leverage ratio. Our ability to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, working capital levels and capital structure, which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors which may be beyond our control. There can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future 60 Table of Contents financings will be available on acceptable terms or in amounts sufficient to enable us to service or refinance our indebtedness, or to make necessary capital expenditures. In February 2010, we acquired the stock of Mimosa, a provider of enterprise class digital content archiving solutions, for approximately $112.0 million in cash and approximately $2.0 million in fair value of options issued. Mimosa, based in Santa Clara, California, provides an on premises integrated archive for email, SharePoint&reg; data and files, and complements IMIs existing enterprise class, cloud based digital archive services. NearPoint&reg;, Mimosas enterprise archiving platform, has applications for retention and disposition, eDiscovery, compliance supervision, classification, recovery, and end user search, enabling customers to reduce risk, and lower their eDiscovery and storage costs. In September 2010, we redeemed $200.0 million of the $431.3 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 73/4% Notes at a redemption price of $1,012.92 for each one thousand dollars of principal amount of the notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We recorded a charge to other expense (income), net of $1.8 million in the third quarter of 2010 related to the early extinguishment of the 73/4% Notes being redeemed. This charge consists of the call premium and deferred financing costs, net of original issue premiums related to the 73/4% Notes that were redeemed. In January 2011, we redeemed the remaining $231.3 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 73/4% Notes at a redemption price of $1,000 for each one thousand dollars of principal amount of notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We will record a gain to other expense (income), net of approximately $0.8 million in the first quarter of 2011 related to the early extinguishment of the 73/4% Notes being redeemed. This gain consists of original issue premiums, net of deferred financing costs related to the 73/4% Notes that were redeemed. In January 2011, we acquired the remaining 80% interest of our joint venture in Poland (Iron Mountain Poland Holdings Limited) in a stock transaction for an estimated purchase price of $69.5 million, including an initial cash purchase price of $35.0 million. As a result, we now own 100% of our Polish operations, which provide storage and records management services. The terms of the purchase and sale agreement requires a second payment based upon the audited financial results of the joint venture for the period April 1, 2010 through March 31, 2011. This payment is based upon a formula defined in the purchase and sale agreement and is expected to be paid in the second quarter of 2011. Our current estimate of the second payment is approximately $32.0 million. Additionally, the purchase and sale agreement provides for the payment of up to a maximum of $2.5 million of contingent consideration to be paid in July 2012 based upon meeting certain performance criteria. The carrying value of the 20% interest that we owned and accounted for under the equity method of accounting amounted to approximately $5.5 million as of December 31, 2010. We will calculate the fair value of such interest on the date of the acquisition of the additional 80% interest and will record a gain during the first quarter of 2011 to other (income) expense, net included in the consolidated statement of operations. One of the members of our board of directors and several of his family members hold an indirect equity interest in one of the shareholders that will receive proceeds in connection with this transaction. As a result of this equity interest, our board member together with several of his family members will receive approximately 24% of the purchase price that we pay in connection with this transaction. 61 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 Years Capital Lease Obligations $ 201,857 $ 34,531 $ 66,148 $ 26,103 $ 75,075 Long Term Debt Obligations (excluding Capital Lease Obligations) 2,812,193 62,459 13,142 798,014 1,938,578 Interest Payments(1) 1,455,156 188,871 365,869 321,171 579,245 Operating Lease Obligations(2) 2,917,267 223,671 419,600 381,064 1,892,932 Purchase and Asset Retirement Obligations(3) 46,814 28,116 6,704 1,848 10,146 Total(4) $ 7,433,287 $ 537,648 $ 871,463 $ 1,528,200 $ 4,495,976 (1)Amounts include variable rate interest payments, which are calculated utilizing the applicable interest rates as of December 31, 2010; see Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Amounts also include interest on capital leases. (2)Amounts are offset by sublease income of $11.2 million in total (including $2.7 million, $3.8 million, $2.8 million and $1.9 million, in less than 1 year, 1 3 years, 3 5 years and more than 5 years, respectively). (3)In connection with some of our acquisitions, we have potential earn out obligations that may be payable in the event businesses we acquired meet certain financial objectives. These payments are based on the future results of these operations, and our estimate of the maximum contingent earn out payments we may be required to make under all such agreements as of December 31, 2010 is approximately $2.0 million. (4)The table above excludes $59.9 million in uncertain tax positions as we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities. We expect to meet our cash flow requirements for the next twelve months from cash generated from operations, existing cash, cash equivalents, borrowings under the Credit Agreement and other financings, which may include secured credit facilities, securitizations and mortgage or capital lease financings. We expect to meet our long term cash flow requirements using the same means described above, as well as the potential issuance of debt or equity securities as we deem appropriate. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Regulation S K Item 303(a)(4)(ii). Net Operating Losses, Research Credits and Foreign Tax Credit Carryforwards We have federal net operating loss carryforwards which begin to expire in 2020 through 2029 of $84.3 million ($29.5 million, tax effected) at December 31, 2010 to reduce future federal taxable income. We have an asset for state net operating losses of $15.6 million (net of federal tax benefit), which begins to expire in 2011 through 2029, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 75%. We have assets for foreign net operating losses of $38.1 million, with various expiration dates, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 74%. Additionally, we have federal research credits of $2.2 million which begin to expire in 2022 through 2029 and state research credits of $1.1 million (net 62 Table of Contents of federal tax benefit) which have no expiration date, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 19%. We also have foreign tax credits of $60.8 million, which begin to expire in 2014 through 2019, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 65%. U.S. legislative changes in 2010 reduced the expected utilization of foreign tax credits which resulted in the requirement for a valuation allowance. Inflation Certain of our expenses, such as wages and benefits, insurance, occupancy costs and equipment repair and replacement, are subject to normal inflationary pressures. Although to date we have been able to offset inflationary cost increases through increased operating efficiencies and the negotiation of favorable long term real estate leases, we can give no assurance that we will be able to offset any future inflationary cost increases through similar efficiencies, leases or increased storage or service charges.  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Market Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to market risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds and time deposits). As of December 31, 2010, we had significant concentrations of liquid investments with seven global banks and four "Triple A" rated money market funds which we consider to be large, highly rated investment grade institutions. As of December 31, 2010, our cash and cash equivalent and restricted cash balance was $293.8 million, including money market funds and time deposits amounting to $241.2 million. A substantial portion of these money market funds are invested in U.S. treasuries. Interest Rate Risk Given the recurring nature of our revenues and the long term nature of our asset base, we have the ability and the preference to use long term, fixed interest rate debt to finance our business, thereby helping to preserve our long term returns on invested capital. We target approximately 75% of our debt portfolio to be fixed with respect to interest rates. Occasionally, we will use interest rate swaps as a tool to maintain our targeted level of fixed rate debt. See Notes 3 and 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2010, we had $399.0 million of variable rate debt outstanding with a weighted average variable interest rate of approximately 2%, and $2,610.5 million of fixed rate debt outstanding. As of December 31, 2010, approximately 87% of our total debt outstanding was fixed. After taking into account the January 2011 redemption of the remaining 73/4% Notes, which was funded with approximately $180.0 million of borrowings under the revolving credit facility and cash on hand, approximately 80% of our total debt outstanding was fixed on a pro forma basis. If the weighted average variable interest rate on our variable rate debt had increased by 1%, our net income for the year ended December 31, 2010 would have been reduced by $2.4 million. See Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K for a discussion of our long term indebtedness, including the fair values of such indebtedness as of December 31, 2010. Currency Risk Our investments in IME, Canada Company, Iron Mountain Mexico, SA de RL de CV, Iron Mountain South America, Ltd., Iron Mountain Australia Pty Ltd., Iron Mountain New Zealand Ltd. and our other international investments may be subject to risks and uncertainties related to fluctuations in currency valuation. Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. However, our international revenues and expenses are generated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate, primarily the Euro, Canadian dollar and British pound sterling. Declines in the value of the local currencies in which we 63 Table of Contents are paid relative to the U.S. dollar will cause revenues in U.S. dollar terms to decrease and dollar denominated liabilities to increase in local currency. The impact of currency fluctuations on our earnings is mitigated significantly by the fact that most operating and other expenses are also incurred and paid in the local currency. We also have several intercompany obligations between our foreign subsidiaries and IMI and our U.S. based subsidiaries. In addition, Iron Mountain Switzerland GmbH and our foreign subsidiaries and IME also have intercompany obligations between them. These intercompany obligations are primarily denominated in the local currency of the foreign subsidiary. We have adopted and implemented a number of strategies to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in currency valuations. One strategy is to finance certain of our international subsidiaries with debt that is denominated in local currencies, thereby providing a natural hedge. In determining the amount of any such financing, we take into account local tax strategies, among other factors. Another strategy we utilize is for IMI to borrow in foreign currencies to hedge our intercompany financing activities. Finally, on occasion, we enter into currency swaps to temporarily or permanently hedge an overseas investment, such as a major acquisition to lock in certain transaction economics. We have implemented these strategies for our foreign investments in the U.K., Continental Europe and Canada. Specifically, through our 150.0 million British pounds sterling denominated 71/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 and our 255 million 63/4% Euro Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018, we effectively hedge most of our outstanding intercompany loans denominated in British pounds sterling and Euros. Canada Company has financed its capital needs through direct borrowings in Canadian dollars under the Credit Agreement and its 175.0 million CAD denominated 71/2% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2017. This creates a tax efficient natural currency hedge. In the third quarter of 2007, we designated a portion of our 63/4% Euro Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018 issued by IMI as a hedge of net investment of certain of our Euro denominated subsidiaries. As a result, we recorded $7.4 million ($4.6 million, net of tax) of foreign exchange gains related to the "marking to market" of such debt to currency translation adjustments which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive items, net included in equity for the year ended December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, net gains of $8.0 million are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive items, net associated with this net investment hedge. We have entered into a number of forward contracts to hedge our exposures to British pounds sterling. As of December 31, 2010, we had an outstanding forward contract to purchase $196.2 million U.S. dollars and sell 125.0 million in British pounds sterling to hedge our intercompany exposures with IME. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2010 we entered into a forward contract to hedge our exposures in Australian dollars. As of December 31, 2010, we had an outstanding forward contract to purchase 54.7 million Euros and sell 75.0 million Australian dollars to hedge our intercompany exposures with our Australian subsidiary. At the maturity of the forward contracts, we may enter into new forward contracts to hedge movements in the underlying currencies. At the time of settlement, we either pay or receive the net settlement amount from the forward contract and recognize this amount in other expense (income), net in the accompanying statement of operations as a realized foreign exchange gain or loss. We have not designated these forward contracts as hedges. At the end of each month, we mark the outstanding forward contracts to market and record an unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss for the mark to market valuation. During the year ended December 31, 2010, there was $2.0 million in net cash receipts included in cash from operating activities related to settlements associated with these foreign currency forward contracts. We recorded net losses in connection with these forward contracts of $2.0 million, including an unrealized foreign exchange gain of $2.5 million related to the British pound sterling forward contract and an unrealized foreign exchange loss of $2.4 million related to the Australian dollar forward contract in other expense (income), net in the accompanying statement of operations as of December 31, 2010, respectively. As 64 Table of Contents of December 31, 2010, except as noted above, our currency exposures to intercompany balances are unhedged. The impact of devaluation or depreciating currency on an entity depends on the residual effect on the local economy and the ability of an entity to raise prices and or reduce expenses. Due to our constantly changing currency exposure and the potential substantial volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange fluctuations on our business. The effect of a change in foreign exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the "Accumulated Other Comprehensive Items, net" component of equity. A 10% depreciation in year end 2010 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction in our equity of approximately $80.4 million.  
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with "Item 6. Selected Financial Data" and the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto and the other financial and operating information included elsewhere in this filing. This discussion contains "forward looking statements," as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and in other federal securities laws. See "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements" on page ii of this filing and "Item 1A. Risk Factors" beginning on page 16 of this filing. Overview Our revenues consist of storage revenues as well as service revenues. Storage revenues, both physical and digital, which are considered a key performance indicator for the information management services industry, consist primarily of recurring periodic charges related to the storage of materials or data (generally on a per unit basis), which are typically retained by customers for many years, and have accounted for over 53% of total consolidated revenues in each of the last five years. Our annual revenues from these fixed periodic storage fees have grown for 22 consecutive years. Service revenues are comprised of charges for related core service activities and a wide array of complementary products and services. Included in core service revenues are: (1) the handling of records, including the addition of new records, temporary removal of records from storage, refiling of removed records, destruction of records, and permanent withdrawals from storage; (2) courier operations, consisting primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request; (3) secure shredding of sensitive documents; and (4) other recurring services, including hybrid services, recurring project revenues and maintenance and support fees associated with software license sales. Our complementary services revenues include special project work, data restoration projects, fulfillment services, consulting services and product sales (including software licenses, specially designed storage containers and related supplies). Our secure shredding revenues include the sale of recycled paper (included in complementary services revenues), the price of which can fluctuate from period to period, adding to the volatility and reducing the predictability of that revenue stream. Our consolidated revenues are also subject to variations caused by the net effect of foreign currency translation on revenue derived from outside the U.S. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, we derived approximately 32%, 30% and 31%, respectively, of our total revenues from outside the U.S. In conjunction with our implementation of a new enterprise management reporting system in the fourth quarter of 2010, we noted inconsistencies in the mapping of certain revenue accounts between storage and service. As a result, we have adjusted previously reported amounts to reduce storage revenues and increase service revenues by approximately $29.2 million, $28.8 million and $28.5 million for the years ending December 31, 2008, 2009, and 2010, respectively. There was no change in total consolidated reported revenues and the changes were not material to internal revenue growth calculations. We recognize revenue when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Storage and service revenues are recognized in the month the respective storage or service is provided and customers are generally billed on a monthly basis on contractually agreed upon terms. Amounts related to future storage or prepaid service contracts, including maintenance and support contracts, for customers where storage fees or services are billed in advance are accounted for as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the applicable storage or service period or when the service is performed. Revenue from the sales of products, which is included as a component of service revenues, is recognized when shipped to the customer and title has passed to the customer. Revenues from the sales of products has historically not been significant. Revenues from sales of software licenses are recognized at the time of product delivery to our customer or reseller, 31 Table of Contents and revenue from maintenance and support agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement. Cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization) consists primarily of wages and benefits for field personnel, facility occupancy costs (including rent and utilities), transportation expenses (including vehicle leases and fuel), other product cost of sales and other equipment costs and supplies. Of these, wages and benefits and facility occupancy costs are the most significant. Trends in total wages and benefits dollars and as a percentage of total consolidated revenue are influenced by changes in headcount and compensation levels, achievement of incentive compensation targets, workforce productivity and variability in costs associated with medical insurance and workers compensation. Trends in facility occupancy costs are impacted by the total number of facilities we occupy, the mix of properties we own versus properties we occupy under operating leases, fluctuations in per square foot occupancy costs, and the levels of utilization of these properties. Due to the declining economic environment in 2008, the then current fair market values of vans, trucks and mobile shredding units within our vehicle fleet portfolio, which we leased, declined. As a result, certain vehicle leases that previously met the requirements to be considered operating leases were classified as capital leases upon renewal, or at lease inception, for new leases. The impact of this change with respect to these leases was to lower vehicle rent expense (a component of transportation costs within cost of sales) by approximately $22.4 million in 2009, offset by an increased amount of combined depreciation (by approximately $20.2 million) and interest expense (by approximately $3.3 million) for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. The expansion of our European, secure shredding and digital services businesses has impacted the major cost of sales components. Our European operations are more labor intensive than our core U.S. physical businesses and, therefore, add incremental labor costs at a higher percentage of segment revenue than our North American core physical business. This trend is more than offset by improvements in domestic labor costs as a percentage of North American revenues. Our secure shredding operations incur less facility costs and higher transportation costs as a percentage of revenues compared to our core physical businesses and our digital services require significantly lower labor and facility costs than our core physical businesses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits for management, administrative, information technology, sales, account management and marketing personnel, as well as expenses related to communications and data processing, travel, professional fees, bad debts, training, office equipment and supplies. Trends in total wage and benefit dollars as a percentage of total consolidated revenue are influenced by changes in headcount and compensation levels, achievement of incentive compensation targets, workforce productivity and variability in costs associated with medical insurance. The overhead structure of our expanding European and Asian operations, as compared to our North American operations, is more labor intensive and has not achieved the same level of overhead leverage, which may result in an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of consolidated revenue, as our European and Asian operations become a more meaningful percentage of our consolidated results. Similarly, our digital services businesses require a higher level of overhead, particularly in the area of information technology, than our core physical businesses. Our depreciation and amortization charges result primarily from the capital intensive nature of our business. The principal components of depreciation relate to storage systems, which include racking, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and software, and buildings. Amortization relates primarily to customer relationship acquisition costs and core technology and is impacted by the nature and timing of acquisitions. During the quarter ended September 30, 2010, prior to our annual goodwill impairment review, we concluded that events occurred and circumstances changed in the Worldwide Digital Business reporting 32 Table of Contents unit that required us to conduct an impairment review. The primary factors contributing to our conclusion that we had a triggering event and a requirement to reassess the Worldwide Digital Business reporting unit goodwill for impairment included: (1) a reduction in forecasted revenue and operating results due to continued pressure on key parts of the business as a result of the weak economy; (2) reduced revenue and profit outlook for our eDiscovery service due to smaller average matter size and lower pricing; (3) a decision to discontinue certain software development projects as more fully discussed below within Depreciation, Amortization, and (Gain) Loss on Disposal/Writedown of Property, Plant and Equipment, Net; and (4) the sale of the domain name management product line of our Worldwide Digital Business reporting unit as more fully discussed below within Other (Income) Expense, Net. As a result of the review, we recorded a provisional goodwill impairment charge associated with our Worldwide Digital Business reporting unit in the amount of $255.0 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2010. We finalized this estimate in the fourth quarter of 2010, and we recorded an additional impairment of $28.8 million, for a total goodwill impairment charge of $283.8 million. Our consolidated revenues and expenses are subject to variations caused by the net effect of foreign currency translation on revenues and expenses incurred by our entities outside the U.S. During 2008, we saw net increases in both revenues and expenses as a result of the strengthening of the Euro, the Brazilian real and the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar, offset by weakening of the British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. In the third quarter of 2008, we saw a dramatic strengthening of the U.S. dollar in comparison to all the major foreign currencies of our most significant international markets, which lead to a decrease in reported revenue and expenses in the fourth quarter of 2008. In 2009, we saw decreases in both revenues and expenses as a result of the weakening of the British pound sterling, the Canadian dollar and the Euro against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. In 2010, we saw increases in both revenues and expenses as a result of the strengthening of the British pound sterling and the Canadian dollar, slightly offset by a weakening of the Euro, against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. It is difficult to predict how much foreign currency exchange rates will fluctuate in the future and how those fluctuations will impact our consolidated statement of operations. Due to the expansion of our international operations, these fluctuations have become material on individual balances. However, because both the revenues and expenses are denominated in the local currency of the country in which they are derived or incurred, the impact of currency fluctuations on our operating income and operating margin is mitigated. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we compare the percentage change in the results from one period to another period in this report using constant currency disclosure. The constant currency growth rates are calculated by translating the 2008 results at the 2009 average exchange rates and the 2009 results at the 2010 average exchange rates. Prior to January 1, 2010, the financial position and results of operations of the operating subsidiaries of Iron Mountain Europe (Group) Limited (collectively referred to as "IME"), our European business, were consolidated based on IMEs fiscal year ended October 31. Effective January 1, 2010, we changed the fiscal year end (and the reporting period for consolidation purposes) of IME to coincide with Iron Mountain Incorporateds ("IMI") fiscal year end of December 31. We believe that the change in accounting principle related to the elimination of the two month reporting lag for IME is preferable because it will result in more contemporaneous reporting of events and results related to IME. In accordance with applicable accounting literature, a change in subsidiary year end is treated as a change in accounting principle and requires retrospective application. The cumulative effect of the change was an increase in retained earnings of $12.2 million as of January 1, 2007. The impact of the change was not material to the results of operations for the previously reported annual and interim periods after January 1, 2008, and, thus, those results have not been revised. There is, however, a charge of $4.7 million recorded to other (income) expense, net in the year 33 Table of Contents ended December 31, 2010 to recognize the immaterial difference arising from the change. There were no significant, infrequent or unusual items in the IME two month period ended December 31, 2008 and 2009. The following table is a comparison of underlying average exchange rates of the foreign currencies that had the most significant impact on our U.S. dollar reported revenues and expenses: Average Exchange Rates for the Year Ended December 31, Percentage (Strengthening)/ Weakening of the U.S. dollar 2009(1) 2010 British pound sterling $ 1.544 $ 1.546 0.1 % Canadian dollar $ 0.880 $ 0.971 10.3 % Euro $ 1.366 $ 1.328 (2.8 )% Average Exchange Rates for the Year Ended December 31, Percentage (Strengthening)/ Weakening of the U.S. dollar 2008(1) 2009(1) British pound sterling $ 1.944 $ 1.544 (20.6 )% Canadian dollar $ 0.944 $ 0.880 (6.8 )% Euro $ 1.497 $ 1.366 (8.8 )% (1)Corresponding to the appropriate periods based on the operating subsidiaries of IMEs fiscal year ended October 31. Non GAAP Measures Adjusted Operating Income Before Depreciation, Amortization and Goodwill Impairment, or Adjusted OIBDA Adjusted OIBDA is defined as operating income before depreciation, amortization, goodwill impairment and (gain) loss on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net. Adjusted OIBDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted OIBDA by total revenues. We use multiples of current or projected Adjusted OIBDA in conjunction with our discounted cash flow models to determine our overall enterprise valuation and to evaluate acquisition targets. We believe Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA Margin provide current and potential investors with relevant and useful information regarding our ability to generate cash flow to support business investment. These measures are an integral part of the internal reporting system we use to assess and evaluate the operating performance of our business. Adjusted OIBDA does not include certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results, specifically: (1) (gains) and losses on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net; (2) goodwill impairment; (3) other (income) expense, net; (4) cumulative effect of change in accounting principle; and (5) net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. Adjusted OIBDA also does not include interest expense, net and the provision (benefit) for income taxes. These expenses are associated with our capitalization and tax structures, which we do not consider when evaluating the operating profitability of our core operations. Finally, Adjusted OIBDA does not include depreciation and amortization expenses, in order to eliminate the impact of capital investments, which we evaluate by comparing capital expenditures to incremental revenue generated and as a percentage of total revenues. Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA Margin should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America 34 Table of Contents ("GAAP"), such as operating or net income (loss) or cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP).

Our management uses this measure when evaluating the operating performance and profitability of our consolidated business. FCF is a useful measure in determining our ability to generate excess cash flows for reinvestment in the business, for discretionary deployment in investments such as real estate or acquisition opportunities, the potential returning of capital to shareholders or the repayment of indebtedness. As such, we believe this measure provides relevant and useful information to our current and potential investors.

We do not believe these excluded items to be indicative of our ongoing operating results and they are not considered when we are forecasting our future results. We believe Adjusted EPS is of value to investors when comparing our results from past, present and future periods.

The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and for the period then ended. On an on going basis, we evaluate the estimates used. We base our estimates on historical experience, actuarial estimates, current conditions and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Our critical accounting policies include the following, which are listed in no particular order: Revenue Recognition Our revenues consist of storage revenues as well as service revenues and are reflected net of sales and value added taxes. Storage revenues, both physical and digital, which are considered a key performance indicator for the information management services industry, consist primarily of recurring periodic charges related to the storage of materials or data (generally on a per unit basis). Service revenues are comprised of charges for related core service activities and a wide array of complementary products and services. Included in core service revenues are: (1) the handling of records, including addition of new records, temporary removal of records from storage, refilling of removed records, destruction of records, and permanent withdrawals from storage; (2) courier operations, consisting primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request; (3) secure shredding of sensitive documents; and (4) other recurring services, including hybrid services, recurring project revenues and maintenance and support fees associated with software license sales. Our complementary services revenues include special project work, data restoration projects, fulfillment services, consulting services 36 Table of Contents and product sales (including software licenses, specially designed storage containers and related supplies). Our secure shredding revenues include the sale of recycled paper (included in complementary services revenues), the price of which can fluctuate from period to period, adding to the volatility and reducing the predictability of that revenue stream. We recognize revenue when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Storage and service revenues are recognized in the month the respective storage or service is provided and customers are generally billed on a monthly basis on contractually agreed upon terms. Amounts related to future storage or prepaid service contracts, including maintenance and support contracts, for customers where storage fees or services are billed in advance are accounted for as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the applicable storage or service period or when the service is performed. Revenue from the sales of products, which is included as a component of service revenues, is recognized when shipped to the customer and title has passed to the customer. Revenues from the sales of products has historically not been significant. Revenues from sales of software licenses are recognized at the time of product delivery to our customer or reseller, and revenue from maintenance and support agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement. Revenues from software license sales and maintenance and support accounted for less than 1% of our annual 2010 consolidated revenues. Within our Worldwide Digital Business segment, in certain instances, we process and host data for customers. In these instances, the processing fees are deferred and recognized over the estimated service period. Accounting for Acquisitions Part of our growth strategy has included the acquisition of numerous businesses. The purchase price of these acquisitions has been determined after due diligence of the acquired business, market research, strategic planning, and the forecasting of expected future results and synergies. Estimated future results and expected synergies are subject to revisions as we integrate each acquisition and attempt to leverage resources. Each acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting as defined under the applicable accounting standards at the date of each acquisition. Accounting for these acquisitions has resulted in the capitalization of the cost in excess of fair value of the net assets acquired in each of these acquisitions as goodwill. We estimated the fair values of the assets acquired in each acquisition as of the date of acquisition and these estimates are subject to adjustment. These estimates are subject to final assessments of the fair value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, operating leases and deferred income taxes. We complete these assessments within one year of the date of acquisition. See Note 6 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Credit Memos We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments and disputes regarding billing and service issues. When calculating the allowance, we consider our past loss experience, current and prior trends in our aged receivables and credit memo activity, current economic conditions, and specific circumstances of individual receivable balances. If the financial condition of our customers were to significantly change, resulting in a significant improvement or impairment of their ability to make payments, an adjustment of the allowance may be required. We consider accounts receivable to be delinquent after such time as reasonable means of collection have been exhausted. We charge off uncollectible balances as circumstances warrant, generally no later than one year past due. As of December 31, 2009 and 2010, our allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos balance totaled $25.5 million and $25.9 million, respectively. 37 Table of Contents Impairment of Tangible and Intangible Assets Assets subject to amortization We review long lived assets and all amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operation to which the assets relate to their carrying amount. The operations are generally distinguished by the business segment and geographic region in which they operate. If the operation is determined to be unable to recover the carrying amount of its assets, then intangible assets are written down first, followed by the other long lived assets of the operation, to fair value. Fair value is based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, depending upon the nature of the assets. Goodwill Assets not subject to amortization: Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. We have selected October 1 as our annual goodwill impairment review date. We performed our annual goodwill impairment review as of October 1, 2008 and 2009 and noted no impairment of goodwill. In making this assessment, we relied on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, anticipated future cash flows, transactions and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. During the quarter ended September 30, 2010, prior to our annual goodwill impairment review, we concluded that events occurred and circumstances changed in the Worldwide Digital Business reporting unit that required us to conduct an impairment review. The primary factors contributing to our conclusion that we had a triggering event and a requirement to reassess the Worldwide Digital Business reporting unit goodwill for impairment included: (1) a reduction in forecasted revenue and operating results due to continued pressure on key parts of the business as a result of the weak economy; (2) reduced revenue and profit outlook for our eDiscovery service due to smaller average matter size and lower pricing; (3) a decision to discontinue certain software development projects as is more fully discussed below within Depreciation, Amortization, and (Gain) Loss on Disposal/Writedown of Property, Plant and Equipment, Net and; (4) the sale of the domain name management product line of our Worldwide Digital Business reporting unit as is more fully discussed below within Other (Income) Expense, Net. As a result of the review, we recorded a provisional goodwill impairment charge associated with our Worldwide Digital Business reporting unit in the amount of $255.0 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2010. We finalized this estimate in the fourth quarter of 2010, and we recorded an additional impairment of $28.8 million, for a total goodwill impairment charge of $283.8 million. We performed our most recent annual goodwill impairment review as of October 1, 2010 and noted no additional impairment of goodwill. As of December 31, 2010, no factors were identified that would alter our October 1, 2010 goodwill assessment. In making this assessment, we relied on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, anticipated future cash flows, transactions and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. Our reporting units at which level we performed our goodwill impairment analysis as of October 1, 2010 were as follows: North America; Europe; Latin America; Australia/New Zealand; Worldwide Digital; Joint Ventures (includes India, the various joint ventures in Southeast Asia and Russia, referred to as the "Joint Ventures") and Business Process Management ("BPM"). Given their similar economic characteristics, products, customers and processes, (1) the United Kingdom, Ireland and Norway and (2) the countries of Continental Europe (excluding joint ventures), each a reporting unit, have been aggregated as Europe and tested as one for goodwill impairment. As of December 31, 2010, the carrying value of goodwill, net amounted to $1,735.0 million, $440.9 million, $29.8 million and $67.1 million for North America, Europe, Latin America and Australia/New Zealand, respectively. Our Joint Ventures and BPM reporting units have no goodwill as of December 31, 2010. Our Worldwide 38 Table of Contents Digital reporting unit goodwill was written down to $51.1 million as of December 31, 2010 as a result of the charges previously discussed above. Our North America, Europe, Latin America, Australia/New Zealand and Worldwide Digital reporting units have estimated fair values as of October 1, 2010 that exceed their carrying value by greater than 20%. Reporting unit valuations have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit or a combined approach based on the present value of future cash flows and market and transaction multiples of revenues and earnings. The income approach incorporates many assumptions including future growth rates, discount factors, expected capital expenditures and income tax cash flows. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods. In conjunction with our annual goodwill impairment reviews, we reconcile the sum of the valuations of all of our reporting units to our market capitalization as of such dates. Accounting for Internal Use Software We develop various software applications for internal use. Computer software costs associated with internal use software are expensed as incurred until certain capitalization criteria are met. Payroll and related costs for employees who are directly associated with, and who devote time to, the development of internal use computer software projects (to the extent time is spent directly on the project) are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the software. Capitalization begins when the design stage of the application has been completed and it is probable that the application will be completed and used to perform the function intended. Depreciation begins when the software is placed in service. Computer software costs that are capitalized are periodically evaluated for impairment. It may be necessary for us to write off amounts associated with the development of internal use software if the project cannot be completed as intended. Our expansion into new technology based service offerings requires the development of internal use software that will be susceptible to rapid and significant changes in technology. We may be required to write off unamortized costs or shorten the estimated useful life if an internal use software program is replaced with an alternative tool prior to the end of the softwares estimated useful life. General uncertainties related to expansion into digital businesses, including the timing of introduction and market acceptance of our services, may adversely impact the recoverability of these assets. As of December 31, 2009 and 2010, capitalized labor net of accumulated depreciation was $41.4 million and $35.3 million, respectively. See Note 2(f) to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, we wrote off $0.6 million (primarily in Corporate), $0.6 million (primarily in Corporate) and $4.9 million (primarily in the Worldwide Digital Business segment), respectively, of previously deferred software costs, primarily internal labor costs, associated with internal use software development projects that were discontinued after implementation, which resulted in a loss on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net. Income Taxes We have recorded a valuation allowance, amounting to $79.9 million as of December 31, 2010, to reduce our deferred tax assets, primarily associated with certain state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credit carryforwards, to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We have federal net operating loss carryforwards which begin to expire in 2020 through 2029 of $84.3 million ($29.5 million, tax effected) at December 31, 2010 to reduce future federal taxable income. We have an asset for state net operating losses of $15.6 million (net of federal tax benefit), which begins to expire in 2011 through 2029, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 75%. We have assets for foreign net operating losses of $38.1 million, with various expiration dates, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 74%. Additionally, we have federal research credits of 39 Table of Contents $2.2 million which begin to expire in 2022 through 2029 and state research credits of $1.1 million (net of federal tax benefit) which have no expiration date, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 19%. We also have foreign tax credits of $60.8 million, which begin to expire in 2014 through 2019, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 65%. U.S. legislative changes in 2010 reduced the expected utilization of foreign tax credits which resulted in the requirement for a valuation allowance. If actual results differ unfavorably from certain of our estimates used, we may not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred income tax assets and foreign tax credit carryforwards and additional valuation allowances may be required. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that our estimates reflected in the tax provisions and accruals will equal our actual results. These differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. The evaluation of an uncertain tax position is a two step process. The first step is a recognition process whereby the company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The second step is a measurement process whereby a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is calculated to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. As of December 31, 2009 and 2010, we had approximately $88.2 million and $59.9 million, respectively, of reserves related to uncertain tax positions. The reversal of these reserves will be recorded as a reduction of our income tax provision if sustained. Although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in favorable or unfavorable changes in our estimates. We are currently under audit by the state of Massachusetts for the 2004 through 2008 tax years. We have not received any assessments to date. However, we may receive a notice of intention to assess in the range of zero to approximately $12.0 million, including interest and penalties. While we are unable to predict the final outcome of the audit at this time, it may result in an assessment of excise tax, which is a component of the income tax provision, or an assessment of net worth tax, which is an operating charge. We intend to defend this case vigorously. We do not expect this audit to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. We have elected to recognize interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as a component of the provision (benefit) for income taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. We recorded $4.5 million, $4.7 million and $(1.6) million for gross interest and penalties for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. We had $12.9 million and $11.6 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties as of December 31, 2009 and 2010, respectively. We have not provided deferred taxes on book basis differences related to certain foreign subsidiaries because such basis differences are not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future and we intend to reinvest indefinitely outside the U.S. These basis differences arose primarily through the undistributed book earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The basis differences could be reversed through a sale of the subsidiaries, the receipt of dividends from subsidiaries and certain other events or actions on our part, which would result in an increase in our provision for income taxes. It is not practicable to calculate the amount of such basis differences. 40 Table of Contents Stock Based Compensation We record stock based compensation expense, utilizing the straight line method, for the cost of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan. Stock based compensation expense, included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010 was $19.0 million ($15.7 million after tax or $0.08 per basic and diluted share), $18.7 million ($14.7 million after tax or $0.07 per basic and diluted shares) and $20.4 million ($15.7 million after tax or $0.08 per basic and diluted shares), respectively. The fair values of option grants are estimated on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model. Expected volatility and the expected term are the input factors to that model which require the most significant management judgment. Expected volatility is calculated utilizing daily historical volatility over a period that equates to the expected life of the option. The expected life (estimated period of time outstanding) of stock options granted is estimated using the historical exercise behavior of employees. Self Insured Liabilities We are self insured up to certain limits for costs associated with workers compensation claims, vehicle accidents, property and general business liabilities, and benefits paid under employee healthcare and short term disability programs. At December 31, 2009 and 2010 there were approximately $41.1 million and $43.9 million, respectively, of self insurance accruals reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. The measurement of these costs requires the consideration of historical cost experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim. We account for these costs primarily through actuarial methods, which develop estimates of the undiscounted liability for claims incurred, including those claims incurred but not reported. These methods provide estimates of future ultimate claim costs based on claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. We believe the use of actuarial methods to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals. However, the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claims involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known. We believe our recorded obligations for these expenses are appropriate. Nevertheless, changes in healthcare costs, severity, and other factors can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued amended guidance on multiple deliverable revenue arrangements and software revenue recognition. The multiple deliverable revenue arrangements updates to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (the "Codification") apply to all deliverables in contractual arrangements in all industries in which a vendor will perform multiple revenue generating activities. The change to the Codification creates a selling price hierarchy that an entity must use as evidence of fair value in separately accounting for all deliverables on a relative selling price basis which qualify for separation. The selling price hierarchy includes: (1) vendor specific objective evidence; (2) third party evidence; and (3) estimated selling price. Broadly speaking, this update to the Codification will result in the possibility for some entities to recognize revenue earlier and more closely align with the economics of certain revenue arrangements if the other criteria for separation (e.g. standalone value to the customer) are met. The software revenue recognition guidance was issued to address factors that entities should consider when determining whether the software and non software components of a product function together to deliver the products essential functionality. The software revenue recognition updates to the Codification will allow revenue arrangements in which software and non software components deliver together a 41 Table of Contents products essential functionality to follow the multiple deliverable revenue recognition criteria as opposed to the criteria applicable to software revenue recognition. Both updates are effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010 and apply prospectively to new or materially modified revenue arrangements after its effective date. We do not expect adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and results of operations.

(2)Our internal revenue growth rate represents the weighted average year over year growth rate of our revenues after removing the effects of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Our consolidated storage revenues increased $64.1 million, or 3.8%, to $1,731.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 and $38.9 million, or 2.4%, to $1,667.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, in comparison to the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2010 is attributable to internal revenue growth of 2.8%. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations added 1.0% to our storage revenue growth rate for the year ended December 31, 2010. Our storage growth rate was moderated in 2010 by current economic factors resulting in lower pricing and longer new sales cycles in our digital business, reduced average net pricing gains in the North American records management business due to the current low inflationary environment, episodic destructions in the physical data protection business and lower new sales and higher destruction rates in our North American records management physical business, which were offset by new sales in international markets. The increase in 2009 over 2008 is attributable to internal revenue growth of 6.4% resulting from strength in our North American Physical and International Physical operating segments, offset by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations of (4.0)%. Consolidated service revenues consisting of core service and complementary services increased $49.9 million, or 3.7%, to $1,395.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $1,346.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Service revenue internal growth was 1.7% as complementary service revenue internal growth of 9.2% in 2010 was offset by negative core service revenue internal growth of 1.2% in 2010. Complementary service revenues increased in 2010 primarily due to $36.8 million more revenue from the sale of recycled paper resulting from higher recycled paper pricing and gains in hybrid service revenues, which more than offset declines in eDiscovery revenues due to reduced average matter size and lower pricing, in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Core service revenue internal growth in the year ended December 31, 2010 was constrained by 43 Table of Contents current economic trends and pressures on activity based service revenues related to the handling and transportation of items in storage. Favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 increased reported service revenues 1.4%. Consolidated service revenues decreased $80.5 million, or (5.6)%, to $1,346.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 from $1,426.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Service revenue internal growth was negative 0.5% as a result of negative complementary service revenue internal growth of 9.4% in 2009, partially offset by core service revenue internal growth of 3.4% over 2008. As expected, complementary service revenues decreased on a year over year basis primarily due to the completion of a large special project in Europe in the third quarter of 2008 and $34.4 million less revenue from the sale of recycled paper revenues resulting from a steep decline in recycled paper pricing. We also experienced softness in 2009 in the more discretionary revenues such as project revenues and fulfillment services. Core service revenue growth was also constrained by current economic trends and pressures on activity based service revenues related to the handling and transportation of items in storage and secure shredding. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations reduced reported service revenues by 4.7% for 2009 compared to 2008. For the reasons stated above, our consolidated revenues increased $114.0 million, or 3.8%, to $3,127.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $3,013.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Internal revenue growth was 2.3% for 2010. We calculate internal revenue growth in local currency for our international operations. For the year ended December 31, 2010, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations increased our reported revenues by 1.2% primarily due to the strengthening of the British pound sterling and the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar, offset by the weakening of the Euro against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. Our consolidated revenues decreased $41.5 million, or (1.4)%, to $3,013.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 from $3,055.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Internal revenue growth was 3.2% and 7.9% in 2009 and 2008, respectively, and acquisitions contributed 0.3% and 3.4% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2009, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations negatively impacted our reported revenues by 4.3% primarily due to the weakening of the British pound sterling, the Canadian dollar and the Euro against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. For the year ended December 31, 2008, net favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that impacted our revenues were 0.6% and were primarily due to the strengthening of the Euro, the Brazilian real and the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar, offset by the weakening of the British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar, based on an analysis of weighted average rates for the comparable periods. Internal Growth Eight Quarter Trend 2009 2010 First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Storage Revenue 7.5 % 6.6 % 6.9 % 4.7 % 3.5 % 3.3 % 2.2 % 2.1 % Service Revenue 0.4 % 1.2 % (3.6 )% 0.1 % 4.4 % 1.0 % 1.7 % (0.2 )% Total Revenue 4.2 % 4.1 % 2.0 % 2.6 % 3.9 % 2.2 % 2.0 % 1.1 % We expect our consolidated internal revenue growth for 2011 to be approximately 0% to 2%. During the past eight quarters our storage internal growth rate has ranged between 2.1% and 7.5%. Our storage growth rate was moderated by current economic factors resulting in lower pricing and longer new sales cycles in our digital business, reduced average net pricing gains in the North American records management business due to the current low inflationary environment, episodic destructions in the physical data protection business and lower new sales and higher destruction rates in our North American records management physical business, which were offset by new sales in international markets. The internal growth rate for service revenue is inherently more volatile than the storage 44 Table of Contents revenue internal growth rate due to the more discretionary nature of certain complementary services we offer, such as large special projects, software licenses, and the volatility of prices for recycled paper. These revenues, which are often event driven and impacted to a greater extent by economic downturns as customers defer or cancel the purchase of certain services as a way to reduce their short term costs, may be difficult to replicate in future periods. As a commodity, recycled paper prices are subject to the volatility of that market. The internal growth rate for service revenues reflects the following: (1) pressures on activity based service revenues related to the handling and transportation of items in storage and secure shredding; (2) the expected softness in our complementary service revenues, such as project revenues and fulfillment services, beginning in late 2008; (3) declines in commodity prices for recycled paper and fuel, beginning in late 2008 and into 2009, but improving throughout 2010; and (4) a large public sector contract in Europe that was completed in the third quarter of 2008. OPERATING EXPENSES Cost of Sales Consolidated cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization) is comprised of the following expenses (in thousands): Percentage Change % of Consolidated Revenues Year Ended December 31, Percentage Change (Favorable)/ Unfavorable Dollar Change Constant Currency 2009 2010 Actual 2009 2010 Labor $ 626,751 $ 621,012 $ (5,739 ) (0.9 )% (2.3 )% 20.8 % 19.9 % (0.9 )% Facilities 419,616 417,503 (2,113 ) (0.5 )% (1.8 )% 13.9 % 13.3 % (0.6 )% Transportation 110,285 107,991 (2,294 ) (2.1 )% (3.1 )% 3.7 % 3.5 % (0.2 )% Product Cost of Sales and Other 114,562 107,692 (6,870 ) (6.0 )% (6.4 )% 3.8 % 3.4 % (0.4 )% $ 1,271,214 $ 1,254,198 $ (17,016 ) (1.3 )% (2.6 )% 42.2 % 40.1 % (2.1 )% Percentage Change % of Consolidated Revenues Year Ended December 31, Percentage Change (Favorable)/ Unfavorable Dollar Change Constant Currency 2008 2009 Actual 2008 2009 Labor $ 674,466 $ 626,751 $ (47,715 ) (7.1 )% (2.5 )% 22.1 % 20.8 % (1.3 )% Facilities 424,796 419,616 (5,180 ) (1.2 )% 3.6 % 13.9 % 13.9 % 0.0 % Transportation 152,080 110,285 (41,795 ) (27.5 )% (23.8 )% 5.0 % 3.7 % (1.3 )% Product Cost of Sales and Other 130,677 114,562 (16,115 ) (12.3 )% (8.0 )% 4.3 % 3.8 % (0.5 )% $ 1,382,019 $ 1,271,214 $ (110,805 ) (8.0 )% (3.5 )% 45.2 % 42.2 % (3.0 )% Labor Labor expense decreased to 19.9% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 20.8% for the year ended December 31, 2009. For the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, labor expense was unfavorably impacted by 1.4 percentage points due to currency variations. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, labor expense decreased by 2.3% in 2010 primarily due to productivity gains in our North American Physical Business, lower core service levels and lower incentive compensation expense of $12.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2010. 45 Table of Contents For the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, labor expense was favorably impacted by 4.6 percentage points due to currency variations. Excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations, labor expense decreased by 2.5% in 2009 due primarily to productivity gains in our North American Physical Business, which is reflected in the approximate year over year decline of 8% in employee headcount, offset by merit increases. Facilities Facilities costs decreased to 13.3% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 13.9% for the year ended December 31, 2009. Facilities costs were unfavorably impacted by 1.3 percentage points due to currency variations during the year ended December 31, 2010. The largest component of our facilities cost is rent expense, which decreased on a reported dollar basis to 12.3% of consolidated storage revenues in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 12.7% in the same period in 2009. Other facilities costs decreased by approximately $7.0 million, in constant currency terms, for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to decreases in building maintenance costs of approximately $2.3 million, common area charges of $2.1 million and utilities costs of $2.0 million. Facilities costs were favorably impacted by 4.8 percentage points due to currency variations during the year ended December 31, 2009. The largest component of our facilities cost is rent expense, which decreased on a reported dollar basis from 13.4% of consolidated storage revenues for 2008 to 12.7% of consolidated storage revenues in 2009, mainly as a result of the impact of revenue mix and incremental rent charges incurred in the latter half of 2008 related to our U.K. operations. Other facilities costs for 2009 increased in constant currency terms due to increased common area charges of $8.5 million, property taxes and insurance of $2.4 million, and utilities of $0.3 million related to rising costs. Transportation Transportation expenses were unfavorably impacted by 1.0 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2010. Transportation expenses decreased by $3.5 million in constant currency terms during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. A decrease of $3.3 million in vehicle lease expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009 was due to the capitalization of leased vehicles upon renewal. The lease cost did not change, but the categorization of charges did, resulting in the cost now being allocated to depreciation and interest. Transportation expenses were favorably impacted by 3.7 percentage points due to currency variations during the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the year ended 2008. Certain vehicle leases related to vans, trucks and mobile shredding units in our vehicle lease portfolio previously classified as operating leases in 2008 were classified as capital leases upon renewal or at inception for new leases in 2009. As a result, for 2009 we had lower vehicle rent expense in our North American Physical segment of approximately $22.4 million (offset by an increased amount of combined depreciation of approximately $20.2 million and interest expense of approximately $3.3 million). In addition, fuel costs decreased by $14.1 million during 2009 as compared to 2008. The lower fuel costs were primarily due to lower commodity prices and, to a lesser extent, the benefit of productivity gains from ongoing transportation improvement initiatives. Product Cost of Sales and Other Product cost of sales and other, which includes cartons, media and other service storage and supply costs, is highly correlated to complementary revenue streams. These costs were unfavorably impacted by 0.4 percentage points of currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2010. For 2010, product cost of sales and other decreased by $6.9 million as compared to the prior year on an actual 46 Table of Contents basis, due primarily to a $3.2 million reduction in carton costs in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to costs associated with product sourcing. These costs were favorably impacted by 4.3 percentage points of currency variations during the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. For 2009, product cost of sales and other decreased in constant currency terms by $10.5 million as compared to the prior year primarily due to the sale of our North American data product sales line in the second quarter of 2008.

General and administrative expenses were unfavorably impacted by 0.8 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2010. In constant currency terms, general and administrative expenses increased by $12.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to the same period in 2009. The increase was primarily attributable to increased compensation expense of $5.4 million, increased insurance expenses of $3.2 million and increased professional fees of $4.4 million. The increased compensation during the year ended December 31, 2010 is primarily a result of merit increases, increased medical and other benefits, as well as increased headcount primarily related to our continued investment in our hybrid records management services of $18.2 million, all of which were partially offset by a reduction in incentive compensation of $12.8 million. 47 Table of Contents General and administrative expenses were favorably impacted by 5.5 percentage points due to currency variations during the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. In constant currency terms, compensation expense, including medical and other benefits, increased by $17.8 million in 2009 as a result of merit increases and increased headcount. In addition, legal costs and professional fees (related to project and cost saving initiatives) increased $24.7 million in 2009 as compared to 2008. These increases were offset by lower discretionary spending of $8.8 million for items including recruiting and relocations, telephone, training, postage and supplies, and certain enterprise wide meetings which were held in 2008 but not in 2009. Sales, Marketing & Account Management Sales, marketing and account management expenses were unfavorably impacted by 0.7 percentage points due to currency changes during the year ended December 31, 2010. In constant currency terms, the increase of $18.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2010 is primarily related to increased compensation of $9.6 million, including $5.8 million of incremental costs related to the acquisition of Mimosa and general merit increases. Additionally, incremental professional fees of $2.0 million and $4.6 million of incremental marketing costs also contributed to the increase. Sales, marketing and account management expenses were favorably impacted by 3.9 percentage points due to currency variations during the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. In constant currency terms, the decrease of 1.4% in 2009 was primarily related to lower discretionary spending of $4.1 million on items such as travel and entertainment and our enterprise wide sales meeting which was held in 2008 but not in 2009. Commissions expense also declined by $10.2 million in constant currency terms during 2009 as compared to 2008. These decreases were partially offset by increased investment in personnel in sales and account management and merit increases in our International Physical segment of $4.8 million and increased compensation (other than commissions) of $4.4 million primarily as a result of merit increases in the North American Physical segment. Information Technology Information technology expenses were unfavorably impacted by 0.5 percentage points due to currency rate changes during the year ended December 31, 2010. In constant currency terms, information technology expenses increased $17.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2010. Compensation increased $6.9 million, primarily associated with the acquisition of Mimosa and increased merit raises, offset by lower incentive compensation. Additionally, overhead expenses increased by $10.5 million, primarily a result of increased corporate expenses, increased professional fees of $4.1 million (related to project and cost saving initiatives) and $2.1 million of incremental costs related to the Mimosa acquisition. Information technology expenses were favorably impacted by 3.0 percentage points due to currency variations during the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to 2008. In constant currency terms, the decrease of 2.3% in information technology expenses for 2009 was due to reduced overhead and discretionary spending, such as recruiting, travel and entertainment, professional fees, and equipment rental costs of $2.3 million and disciplined cost management. Bad Debt Expense Consolidated bad debt expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased $0.4 million to $11.5 million (0.4% of consolidated revenues) from $11.8 million (0.4% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2009. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts that is calculated based on our past loss experience, current and prior trends in our aged receivables, current economic conditions, and specific circumstances of individual receivable balances. We continue to monitor our 48 Table of Contents customers payment activity and make adjustments based on their financial condition and in light of historical and expected trends. Consolidated bad debt expense increased $1.1 million to $11.8 million (0.4% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2009 from $10.7 million (0.4% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in bad debt expense in 2009 from 2008 was attributable to the worsening economic climate. Goodwill Impairment During the quarter ended September 30, 2010, prior to our annual goodwill impairment review, we concluded that events occurred and circumstances changed in the Worldwide Digital Business reporting unit that required us to conduct an impairment review. The primary factors contributing to our conclusion that we had a triggering event and a requirement to reassess the Worldwide Digital Business reporting unit goodwill for impairment included: (1) a reduction in forecasted revenue and operating results due to continued pressure on key parts of the business as a result of the weak economy; (2) reduced revenue and profit outlook for our eDiscovery service due to smaller average matter size and lower pricing; (3) a decision to discontinue certain software development projects as more fully discussed below within Depreciation, Amortization, and (Gain) Loss on Disposal/Writedown of Property, Plant and Equipment, Net; and (4) the sale of the domain name management product line of our Worldwide Digital Business reporting unit as more fully discussed below within Other (Income) Expense, Net. As a result of the review, we recorded a provisional goodwill impairment charge associated with our Worldwide Digital Business reporting unit in the amount of $255.0 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2010. We finalized this estimate in the fourth quarter of 2010, and we recorded an additional impairment of $28.8 million, for a total goodwill impairment charge of $283.8 million. Depreciation, Amortization, and (Gain) Loss on Disposal/Writedown of Property, Plant and Equipment, Net Depreciation expense increased $23.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to additional depreciation expense related to capital expenditures and acquisitions, including storage systems, which include racking, building and leasehold improvements, computer systems hardware and software, and buildings. Depreciation expense increased $29.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily due to additional depreciation expense of approximately $20.2 million resulting from certain vehicle leases which had been classified as operating leases in 2008 being classified as capital leases upon renewal or at inception for new leases in 2009, as well as additional depreciation associated with technology investments in our Worldwide Digital Business segment of $4.1 million. Amortization expense increased $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to the increased amortization of intangible assets, such as customer relationship intangible assets and intellectual property acquired through business combinations. Amortization expense decreased $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily due to decreases resulting from currency variations which were offset by the increased amortization of intangible assets, such as customer relationship intangible assets and intellectual property acquired through business combinations. Consolidated gain on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 consisted primarily of a gain of approximately $10.2 million as a result of the settlement with our insurers in connection with a portion of the property component of our claim related to the Chilean earthquake in the third and fourth quarter of 2010, gains of approximately $3.2 million in North America primarily related to the disposition of certain owned 49 Table of Contents equipment and a gain on disposal of a building in our International Physical segment of approximately $1.3 million in the United Kingdom, offset by approximately $1.0 million of asset write downs associated with our Latin American operations, approximately $2.6 million of impairment losses primarily related to certain owned facilities in North America, and an approximately $4.9 million write off in the third and fourth quarters of 2010 of previously deferred software costs related to our Worldwide Digital Business segment associated with certain software development projects that were discontinued after implementation. Consolidated loss on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, consisted primarily of a gain on disposal of a building in our International Physical segment of approximately $1.9 million in France, offset by losses on the writedown of certain facilities of approximately $1.0 million in our North American Physical segment, $0.7 million in our International Physical segment, $0.3 million in our Worldwide Digital segment and $0.3 million in Corporate (associated with discontinued products after implementation). Consolidated loss on disposal/writedown of property, plant and equipment, net of $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, consisted primarily of a $2.3 million impairment of an owned storage facility in North America which we decided to exit in the first quarter of 2008, a $1.3 million impairment of an owned storage facility which we decided to exit in the third quarter of 2008, a $0.5 million writedown for an owned storage facility that we had vacated and had classified as available for sale in the third quarter of 2008, a $1.9 million writedown of two owned storage facilities in North America and related assets which we decided to exit in the fourth quarter of 2008, as well as a $0.6 million write off of previously deferred software costs in Corporate associated with discontinued products after implementation and other disposal and asset writedowns. OPERATING INCOME and ADJUSTED OIBDA As a result of all the foregoing factors, consolidated operating income decreased $225.0 million, or 41.0%, to $323.6 million (10.3% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $548.5 million (18.2% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2009. As a result of all the foregoing factors, consolidated Adjusted OIBDA increased $77.5 million, or 8.9%, to $945.5 million (30.2% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $868.0 million (28.8% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2009. As a result of all the foregoing factors, consolidated operating income increased $56.0 million, or 11.4%, to $548.5 million (18.2% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2009 from $492.5 million (16.1% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2008. As a result of all the foregoing factors, consolidated Adjusted OIBDA increased $77.3 million, or 9.8%, to $868.0 million (28.8% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2009 from $790.8 million (25.9% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2008. OTHER EXPENSES, NET Interest Expense, Net Consolidated interest expense, net decreased $6.8 million to $221.0 million (7.1% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $227.8 million (7.6% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to a reduction in year over year short term borrowings on our revolving credit facility, as well as a reduction in our outstanding borrowings due to the early retirement of $200.0 million of our 73/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2015 (the "73/4% Notes") during 2010. Our weighted average interest rate was 6.9% and 7.0% at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Consolidated interest expense, net decreased $8.8 million to $227.8 million (7.6% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2009 from $236.6 million (7.7% of consolidated revenues) 50 Table of Contents for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily due to a reduction in year over year borrowings under our revolving credit facility while our weighted average interest rate remained flat at 7.0% as of December 31, 2009 and 2008. We incurred approximately $3.3 million of additional interest expense on capital leases on certain vehicle leases previously classified as operating leases prior to renewal or upon lease inception. Other (Income) Expense, Net (in thousands) Year Ended December 31, Dollar Change 2009 2010 Foreign currency transaction (gains) losses, net $ (12,477 ) $ 5,305 $ 17,782 Debt extinguishment expense 3,031 1,792 (1,239 ) Other, net (2,633 ) (5,325 ) (2,692 ) $ (12,079 ) $ 1,772 $ 13,851 Year Ended December 31, Dollar Change 2008 2009 Foreign currency transaction losses (gains), net $ 28,882 $ (12,477 ) $ (41,359 ) Debt extinguishment expense 418 3,031 2,613 Other, net 1,728 (2,633 ) (4,361 ) $ 31,028 $ (12,079 ) $ (43,107 ) Net foreign currency transaction losses of $5.3 million, based on period end exchange rates, were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2010. Losses resulted primarily from changes in the exchange rate of the British pound sterling, the Euro and the Russian Ruble, offset by the Brazilian Real, against the U.S. dollar compared to December 31, 2009, as these currencies relate to our intercompany balances with and between our European and Latin American subsidiaries, and gains associated with our British pound sterling forward contracts, British pound sterling denominated debt and Euro denominated debt. Net foreign currency transaction gains of $12.5 million, based on period end exchange rates, were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2009. Gains resulted primarily from changes in the exchange rate of the British pound sterling, Euro, Brazilian Real and Chilean Peso against the U.S. dollar compared to December 31, 2008, as these currencies relate to our intercompany balances with and between our European and Latin American subsidiaries, offset by losses as a result of British pounds sterling and Euro denominated debt and forward foreign currency swap contracts held by our U.S. parent company. Net foreign currency transaction losses of $28.9 million, based on period end exchange rates, were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2008. Losses resulted primarily as a result of the British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar compared to December 31, 2007, as this currency relates to our intercompany balances with and between our U.K. subsidiaries, offset by gains on the marking to market of British pound sterling and Euro denominated debt and forward foreign currency swap contracts held by our U.S. parent company. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we redeemed $200.0 million of the $431.3 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 73/4% Notes at a redemption price of $1,012.92 for each one thousand dollars of principal amount of the notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We recorded a charge to other expense (income), net of $1.8 million in the third quarter of 2010 related to the early extinguishment of the 73/4% Notes being redeemed. This charge consists of the call premium 51 Table of Contents and deferred financing costs, net of original issue premiums related to the 73/4% Notes that were redeemed. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we redeemed our 85/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013 and wrote off $3.0 million in associated deferred financing costs. During 2008, we redeemed the remaining outstanding portion of our 81/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011 and, in connection with the reduction in our revolving credit facility availability due to a bankruptcy of one of our lenders, we wrote off $0.4 million in deferred financing costs. Other, net in the year ended December 31, 2010 was a $5.3 million gain. In August 2010, we divested the domain name management product line of our Worldwide Digital Business segment for approximately $11.4 million in cash at closing, resulting in a pretax gain of approximately $6.9 million ($2.8 million after tax) in 2010. The assets sold primarily consisted of customer contracts. Also included in the gain for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $1.2 million of gains related to certain trading marketable securities held in a trust for the benefit of employees included in a deferred compensation plan we sponsor. Offsetting these gains was $4.7 million of losses related to the impact of the change in IMEs fiscal year end. Since its inception, IME had operated with an October 31 fiscal year end. IMEs financial results had historically been consolidated with IMIs results with a two month lag. In order to better align our European processes with the enterprise, effective January 1, 2010, the IME fiscal year end was changed to December 31 to match the Companys fiscal year end. The $4.7 million charge represents the net impact of this change for the two years ended December 31, 2009. Other, net in the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily consisted of $1.7 million of gains related to certain trading marketable securities held in a trust for the benefit of employees included in a deferred compensation plan we sponsor, in addition to $0.6 million of business interruption proceeds for an owned storage facility in France, which was taken by eminent domain in the first quarter of 2009.

Provision for Income Taxes Our effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010 were 63.6%, 33.2% and 148.6%, respectively. The primary reconciling items between the federal statutory rate of 35% and our overall effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2010 is a goodwill impairment charge, of which a majority was non deductible for tax purposes. U.S. legislative changes in 2010 reduced the expected utilization of foreign tax credits. Certain previously unrecognized tax benefits were recognized in 2010 due to expirations of statute of limitation periods and settlements with tax authorities in various worldwide jurisdictions. In 2009 and 2008, we had significant unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses on intercompany loans and on debt and derivative instruments in different jurisdictions with different tax rates. For 2009, foreign currency gains were recorded in lower tax jurisdictions associated with the marking to market of intercompany loan positions while foreign currency losses were recorded in higher tax jurisdictions associated with the marking to market of debt and derivative instruments, which reduced the effective tax rate by 4.9% for the year ended December 31, 2009. Our effective tax rate is higher than the statutory rate in 2008 primarily due to significant foreign exchange gains and losses in different jurisdictions with different tax rates. For 2008, foreign currency gains were recorded in higher tax jurisdictions, associated with our marking to market of debt and derivative instruments, while foreign currency losses were recorded in lower tax jurisdictions, associated with the marking to market of intercompany loan positions, which together increased the 2008 tax rate by 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 2008. Our effective tax rate is subject to variability in the future due to, among other items: (1) changes in the mix of income from foreign jurisdictions; (2) tax law changes; (3) volatility in foreign exchange gains and (losses); (4) the timing of the establishment and reversal of tax reserves; and (5) our ability to utilize foreign tax credits that we generate. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous 52 Table of Contents foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by tax authorities and provide for these matters as appropriate. Although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in changes in our estimates. Discrete items are recorded in the period they occur. NET INCOME As a result of all the foregoing factors, consolidated net income for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased $271.3 million, or 122.0%, to a net loss of $49.0 million (negative 1.6% of consolidated revenues) from net income of $222.3 million (7.4% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease in operating income noted above is primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge associated with our Worldwide Digital Business segment, as well as, foreign currency exchange rate impacts and the impact of the change in IMEs fiscal year end included in other income (expense), net and the impact of our tax rate for 2010 and the resulting increase in the provision for income taxes described above contributed to the decrease in net income, and were partially offset by the recorded gain associated with the divestiture of the domain name management product line of our Worldwide Digital Business segment. For the year ended December 31, 2010, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests resulted in a decrease in net income attributable to Iron Mountain Incorporated of $4.9 million. These represent our noncontrolling partners share of earnings/losses in our majority owned international subsidiaries that are consolidated in our operating results. As a result of all the foregoing factors, consolidated net income for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased $140.4 million, or 171.3%, to $222.3 million (7.4% of consolidated revenues) from net income of $81.9 million (2.7% of consolidated revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in operating income noted above, the foreign currency exchange rate impacts included in other income (expense), net and the impact of our tax rate for 2009 contributed to the increase in net income. For the year ended December 31, 2009, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests resulted in a reduction to net income attributable to Iron Mountain Incorporated of $1.4 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue in our North American Physical Business segment increased 3.3% over the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to internal growth of 2.3%. Total revenue internal growth was comprised of storage internal growth of 2.3% related to increased Hard Copy and Data Protection revenues and service internal growth of 2.3%. Current economic factors have led to a moderation in our storage growth rate as a result of reduced average net pricing gains due to the current low inflationary environment, episodic destructions in the physical data protection business and lower new sales and higher destruction rates in our physical business over the past year. Core service revenue growth was also constrained by current economic trends and pressures on activity based services revenues related to the handling and transportation of items in storage. Our core services business yielded negative internal growth of 2.3%, which was more than offset by complementary services revenues internal growth of 16.3%, due primarily to higher recycled paper prices and gains in hybrid service revenues. Additionally, favorable foreign currency rate changes related to Canada resulted in increased 2010 revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, of 1.0%. Adjusted OIBDA as a percentage of segment revenue increased in 2010 due mainly to productivity gains and disciplined cost management, partially offset by a $6.3 million increase in general and administrative compensation and a $1.2 million increase in bad debt expense. During the year ended December 31, 2009, revenue in our North American Physical Business segment increased 1.7% over the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily due to internal growth of 2.8%. Total revenue internal growth was due to solid storage internal growth of 6.2% related to increased Hard Copy and Data Protection revenues and was negatively impacted by depressed service 54 Table of Contents internal growth of negative 1.5%. Organic growth in our core services business of 2.9% was more than offset by decreased complementary services revenues primarily due to steep declines in recycled paper prices and softness in discretionary special projects and fulfillment services. Additionally, unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations related to Canada resulted in decreased 2009 revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, of 0.6%. Adjusted OIBDA as a percentage of segment revenue increased in 2009 due mainly to productivity gains, pricing actions, disciplined cost management, lower vehicle rent expense due to the recharacterization of certain vehicle leases, and increased margin due to the sale of our low margin data products division in 2008, partially offset by a $17.7 million increase in professional fees (related to project and cost savings initiatives).

Revenue in our International Physical Business segment increased 6.2% during the year ended December 31, 2010 over 2009 due to internal revenue growth of 3.8% supported by solid 5.9% storage internal growth and core services internal growth of 1.6%. The impact of acquisitions increased reported revenue by 0.2% in 2010. Foreign currency fluctuations in 2010, primarily in Europe, resulted in increased 2010 revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, of approximately 2.2% as compared to 2009. Adjusted OIBDA as a percentage of segment revenue in the year ended December 31, 2010 was flat compared to the same period in 2009 due to increased compensation expense of $8.5 million, primarily related to investments in our hybrid records management services, as well as one time cost accruals recorded in 2010 of approximately $7.4 million, offset by increased operating income from productivity gains, pricing actions and disciplined cost management. Revenue in our International Physical Business segment decreased 10.7% during the year ended December 31, 2009 over 2008 due to foreign currency fluctuations in 2009, primarily in the United Kingdom, which resulted in decreased 2009 revenue, as measured in U.S. dollars, compared to 2008 of approximately 15.8%. This decline was offset by total internal revenue growth for the segment of 4.6%, supported by solid 8.3% storage internal growth and service revenue internal growth of 1.0%. Acquisitions increased reported revenue by 0.5% in 2009. Service revenue internal growth includes an 55 Table of Contents unfavorable year over year comparison due to a large European special project that was completed in the third quarter of 2008 which contributed to complementary revenue internal growth of negative 9.8%. Adjusted OIBDA as a percentage of segment revenue increased in 2009 primarily due to disciplined cost management and productivity gains, partially offset by the completion of a large, high margin European special project in the third quarter of 2008, increased rent and facility costs and increased compensation expense related to investments in sales and business support during 2008 and 2009.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, revenue in our Worldwide Digital Business segment increased 0.9% over 2009. Mimosa, which we acquired in February 2010, contributed $10.8 million, or a 4.7% increase in revenue. This increase was offset by lower pricing and longer new sales cycles in our digital business and soft demand for eDiscovery services. The sale of our domain name management product line in August 2010 decreased 2010 reported revenues by 0.9% as compared to 2009. In the year ended December 31, 2010, Adjusted OIBDA in the Worldwide Digital Business segment decreased compared to 2009 due to the impact of revenue mix and increased costs associated with the integration of Mimosa. During the year ended December 31, 2009, revenue in our Worldwide Digital Business segment increased 2.9% over 2008, due to strong performance in our eDiscovery business offset by a decrease in data restoration and license sales in 2009 over 2008. In the year ended December 31, 2009, Adjusted OIBDA in the Worldwide Digital Business segment increased compared to 2008 due to the impact of revenue mix and decreases in commissions and discretionary spending, including recruiting, travel and entertainment. 56 Table of Contents Corporate Dollar Change Percentage Change Year Ended December 31, from 2008 to 2009 from 2009 to 2010 from 2008 to 2009 from 2009 to 2010 2008 2009 2010 Segment Adjusted OIBDA(1) $ (157,986 ) $ (164,406 ) $ (176,900 ) $ (6,420 ) $ (12,494 ) 4.1 % 7.6 % Segment Adjusted OIBDA(1) as a Percentage of Consolidated Revenue (5.2 )% (5.5 )% (5.7 )% (1)See Note 9 to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for definition of Adjusted OIBDA and for the basis on which allocations are made and a reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA to income (loss) before provision (benefit) for income taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2010, expenses in the Corporate segment increased 7.6% over 2009. This increase was primarily driven by increased information technology expenses of $4.4 million, higher professional fees of $2.2 million related to productivity and cost saving initiatives, an insurance deductible of $2.8 million associated with the recent Chilean and New Zealand earthquakes, increased stock based compensation of $1.7 million and increased marketing expenses, partially offset by a reduction in incentive compensation. During the year ended December 31, 2009, expenses in the Corporate segment increased 4.1% over the year ended December 31, 2008, driven primarily by increases in professional fees of $3.7 million related to project and consulting costs, compensation of $2.5 million due primarily to merit increases and charitable contributions of $2.0 million, offset by decreases in other expenses of $1.5 million, which included much of our discretionary spending, such as travel and entertainment and supplies, and a decrease in stock based compensation expense of $0.3 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following is a summary of our cash balances and cash flows (in thousands) as of and for the years ended December 31, 2008 2009 2010 Cash flows from operating activities $ 537,029 $ 616,911 $ 625,140 Cash flows from investing activities (459,594 ) (324,066 ) (432,670 ) Cash flows from financing activities 87,368 (129,692 ) (381,234 ) Cash and cash equivalents at the end of year 278,370 446,656 258,693 Net cash provided by operating activities was $625.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $616.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The 1.3% increase resulted primarily from an increase in net income, excluding non cash charges of $72.4 million, offset by uses in working capital and decreases in realized foreign exchange gains of $60.3 million and $3.9 million, respectively, over the same period last year. Working capital decreases are primarily related to increases in year over year amounts paid for income taxes and incentive compensation, offset by improved cash collection associated with customer accounts receivable. Our business requires significant capital expenditures to support our expected revenue growth and ongoing operations as well as new products and services and increased profitability. These expenditures are included in cash flows from investing activities. As the nature of our business has evolved over time, so has the nature of our capital expenditures. Every year we expend capital to support a number 57 Table of Contents of different objectives. The majority of our capital goes to support business line growth and our ongoing operations. We also expend capital to support the development and improvement of products and services and projects designed to increase our profitability. These expenditures are generally smaller and more discretionary in nature. Cash paid for our capital expenditures, cash paid for acquisitions (net of cash acquired) and additions to customer acquisition costs during the year ended December 31, 2010 amounted to $277.6 million, $129.4 million and $13.2 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2010, capital expenditures, net, cash paid for acquisitions (net of cash acquired) and additions to customer acquisition costs were funded with cash flows provided by operating activities and cash equivalents on hand. Excluding potential future acquisitions, we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately $245.0 million in the year ending December 31, 2011. Included in our estimated capital expenditures for 2011 is approximately $20.0 million of real estate purchases. Net cash used in financing activities was $381.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. During 2010, we had $18.2 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plan and $2.3 million of excess tax benefits from stock based compensation. We used the proceeds from these financing transactions and cash on hand for the early retirement of senior subordinated notes of $202.6 million, to repay $49.8 million on our revolving credit and term loans and other debt, net, to repurchase $111.6 million of our common stock and to pay dividends in the amount of $37.9 million on our common stock. In February 2010, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $150.0 million in repurchases of our common stock and in October 2010, our board of directors authorized up to an additional $200.0 million of such purchases, for a total of $350.0 million. This represented less than 10% of our outstanding common stock based on the closing price on the dates the programs were announced. All purchases are subject to stock price, market conditions, corporate and legal requirements and other factors. In addition, in February 2010, our board of directors adopted a dividend policy under which we began paying quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. The first quarterly dividend of $0.0625 per share was paid on April 15, 2010 to stockholders of record on March 25, 2010 in the aggregate amount of $12.7 million. The second quarterly dividend of $0.0625 per share was paid on July 15, 2010 to stockholders of record on June 25, 2010 in the aggregate amount of $12.6 million. The third quarterly dividend of $0.0625 per share was paid on October 15, 2010 to stockholders of record on September 28, 2010 in the aggregate amount of $12.5 million. The fourth quarterly dividend of $0.1875 per share was paid on January 14, 2011 to stockholders of record on December 27, 2010 in the aggregate amount of $37.5 million. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors. If we continue the $0.1875 per share quarterly dividend we anticipate that the 2011 annual dividend payout will be approximately $150.0 million based on our total outstanding shares as of the end of 2010 (of which the fourth quarter 2011 payment would not be paid until January, 2012, if declared). The following table is a summary of our repurchase activity under all of our share repurchase programs during 2010: 2010 Shares Amount (In thousands) Prior year authorization as of January 1, $ Authorizations 350,000 Repurchases paid 4,764,023 (111,468 ) Repurchases unsettled Authorization remaining as of December 31, $ 238,532 58 Table of Contents Due to the declining economic environment in 2008, the current fair market value of vans, trucks and mobile shredding units within our vehicle fleet portfolio, which we lease, have declined. As a result, certain vehicle leases that previously met the requirements to be considered operating leases have been classified as capital leases, and certain others will be, upon renewal. The impact of these changes on our consolidated cash flow statement in the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2010 is that payments related to these leases previously reflected as a use of cash within the operating activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows are now, and will be, reflected as a use of cash within the financing activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows. For 2009 and 2010, the amount of this impact was $19.1 million and $21.9 million, respectively. Financial instruments that potentially subject us to market risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds and time deposits). As of December 31, 2010, we had significant concentrations of liquid investments with seven global banks and four "Triple A" rated money market funds which we consider to be large, highly rated investment grade institutions. As of December 31, 2010, our cash and cash equivalent and restricted cash balance was $293.8 million, including money market funds and time deposits amounting to $241.2 million. A substantial portion of these money market funds are invested in U.S. treasuries. We are highly leveraged and expect to continue to be highly leveraged for the foreseeable future. Our consolidated debt as of December 31, 2010 was comprised of the following (in thousands): Revolving Credit Facility(1) $ Term Loan Facility(1) 396,200 71/4% GBP Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014(2) 232,530 73/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2015(2) 233,234 65/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016(2) 317,529 71/2% CAD Senior Subordinated Notes due 2017 (the "Subsidiary Notes")(3) 175,306 83/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018(2) 200,000 8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018(2) 49,777 63/4% Euro Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018(2) 338,129 8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020(2) 300,000 83/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2021(2) 548,174 Real Estate Mortgages, Capital Leases and Other(4) 218,576 Total Long term Debt 3,009,455 Less Current Portion (96,990 ) Long term Debt, Net of Current Portion $ 2,912,465 (1)The capital stock or other equity interests of most of our U.S. subsidiaries, and up to 66% of the capital stock or other equity interests of our first tier foreign subsidiaries, are pledged to secure these debt instruments, together with all intercompany obligations of foreign subsidiaries owed to us or to one of our U.S. subsidiary guarantors. (2)Collectively referred to as the Parent Notes. Iron Mountain Incorporated ("IMI") is the direct obligor on the Parent Notes, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior subordinated basis, by substantially all of its direct and indirect 100% owned U.S. subsidiaries (the "Guarantors"). These guarantees are joint and several obligations of the Guarantors. Iron Mountain Canada Corporation ("Canada Company") and the remainder of our subsidiaries do not guarantee the Parent Notes. (3)Canada Company is the direct obligor on the Subsidiary Notes, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior subordinated basis, by IMI and the Guarantors. These guarantees are joint and several obligations of IMI and the Guarantors. 59 Table of Contents (4)Includes (a) real estate mortgages of $7.5 million, (b) capital lease obligations of $201.9 million, and (c) other various notes and other obligations, which were assumed by us as a result of certain acquisitions, of $9.2 million. Our credit facility consists of (i) revolving credit facilities under which we can borrow, subject to certain limitations as defined in the credit agreement we entered into on April 16, 2007 governing this facility (the "Credit Agreement"), up to an aggregate amount of $765.0 million (including Canadian dollar and multi currency revolving credit facilities), and (ii) a $410.0 million term loan facility. Our revolving credit facility is supported by a group of 24 banks. Our subsidiaries, Canada Company and Iron Mountain Switzerland GmbH, may borrow directly under the Canadian revolving credit and multi currency revolving credit facilities, respectively. Additional subsidiary borrowers may be added under the multi currency revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility terminates on April 16, 2012. With respect to the term loan facility, quarterly loan payments of approximately $1.0 million are required through maturity on April 16, 2014, at which time the remaining outstanding principal balance of the term loan facility is due. The interest rate on borrowings under the Credit Agreement varies depending on our choice of interest rate and currency options, plus an applicable margin. IMI guarantees the obligations of each of the subsidiary borrowers under the Credit Agreement, and substantially all of our U.S. subsidiaries guarantee the obligations of IMI and the subsidiary borrowers. The capital stock or other equity interests of most of our U.S. subsidiaries, and up to 66% of the capital stock or other equity interests of our first tier foreign subsidiaries, are pledged to secure the Credit Agreement, together with all intercompany obligations of foreign subsidiaries owed to us or to one of our U.S. subsidiary guarantors. As of December 31, 2010, we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility; we had various outstanding letters of credit totaling $2.5 million. The remaining availability, based on IMIs leverage ratio, which is calculated based on the last 12 months earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), and other adjustments as defined in the Credit Agreement and current external debt, under the revolving credit facility on December 31, 2010, was $762.5 million. The interest rate in effect under the term loan facility was 1.8% as of December 31, 2010. The Credit Agreement, our indentures and other agreements governing our indebtedness contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to complete acquisitions, pay cash dividends, incur indebtedness, make investments, sell assets and take certain other corporate actions. The covenants do not contain a rating trigger. Therefore, a change in our debt rating would not trigger a default under the Credit Agreement, our indentures or other agreements governing our indebtedness. Our revolving credit and term loan facilities, as well as our indentures, use EBITDA based calculations as primary measures of financial performance, including leverage ratios. IMIs revolving credit and term leverage ratio was 3.3 and 2.9 as of December 31, 2009 and 2010, respectively, compared to a maximum allowable ratio of 5.5. Similarly, our bond leverage ratio, per the indentures, was 4.1 and 3.4 as of December 31, 2009 and 2010, respectively, compared to a maximum allowable ratio of 6.5. Noncompliance with these leverage ratios would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we designated as Excluded Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the indentures), certain of our subsidiaries that own our assets and conduct our operations in the United Kingdom. As a result of such designation, these subsidiaries are now subject to substantially all of the covenants of the indentures, except that they are not required to provide a guarantee, and the EBITDA and debt of these subsidiaries is included for purposes of calculating the leverage ratio. Our ability to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, working capital levels and capital structure, which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors which may be beyond our control. There can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future 60 Table of Contents financings will be available on acceptable terms or in amounts sufficient to enable us to service or refinance our indebtedness, or to make necessary capital expenditures. In February 2010, we acquired the stock of Mimosa, a provider of enterprise class digital content archiving solutions, for approximately $112.0 million in cash and approximately $2.0 million in fair value of options issued. Mimosa, based in Santa Clara, California, provides an on premises integrated archive for email, SharePoint&reg; data and files, and complements IMIs existing enterprise class, cloud based digital archive services. NearPoint&reg;, Mimosas enterprise archiving platform, has applications for retention and disposition, eDiscovery, compliance supervision, classification, recovery, and end user search, enabling customers to reduce risk, and lower their eDiscovery and storage costs. In September 2010, we redeemed $200.0 million of the $431.3 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 73/4% Notes at a redemption price of $1,012.92 for each one thousand dollars of principal amount of the notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We recorded a charge to other expense (income), net of $1.8 million in the third quarter of 2010 related to the early extinguishment of the 73/4% Notes being redeemed. This charge consists of the call premium and deferred financing costs, net of original issue premiums related to the 73/4% Notes that were redeemed. In January 2011, we redeemed the remaining $231.3 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 73/4% Notes at a redemption price of $1,000 for each one thousand dollars of principal amount of notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We will record a gain to other expense (income), net of approximately $0.8 million in the first quarter of 2011 related to the early extinguishment of the 73/4% Notes being redeemed. This gain consists of original issue premiums, net of deferred financing costs related to the 73/4% Notes that were redeemed. In January 2011, we acquired the remaining 80% interest of our joint venture in Poland (Iron Mountain Poland Holdings Limited) in a stock transaction for an estimated purchase price of $69.5 million, including an initial cash purchase price of $35.0 million. As a result, we now own 100% of our Polish operations, which provide storage and records management services. The terms of the purchase and sale agreement requires a second payment based upon the audited financial results of the joint venture for the period April 1, 2010 through March 31, 2011. This payment is based upon a formula defined in the purchase and sale agreement and is expected to be paid in the second quarter of 2011. Our current estimate of the second payment is approximately $32.0 million. Additionally, the purchase and sale agreement provides for the payment of up to a maximum of $2.5 million of contingent consideration to be paid in July 2012 based upon meeting certain performance criteria. The carrying value of the 20% interest that we owned and accounted for under the equity method of accounting amounted to approximately $5.5 million as of December 31, 2010. We will calculate the fair value of such interest on the date of the acquisition of the additional 80% interest and will record a gain during the first quarter of 2011 to other (income) expense, net included in the consolidated statement of operations. One of the members of our board of directors and several of his family members hold an indirect equity interest in one of the shareholders that will receive proceeds in connection with this transaction. As a result of this equity interest, our board member together with several of his family members will receive approximately 24% of the purchase price that we pay in connection with this transaction. 61 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 Years Capital Lease Obligations $ 201,857 $ 34,531 $ 66,148 $ 26,103 $ 75,075 Long Term Debt Obligations (excluding Capital Lease Obligations) 2,812,193 62,459 13,142 798,014 1,938,578 Interest Payments(1) 1,455,156 188,871 365,869 321,171 579,245 Operating Lease Obligations(2) 2,917,267 223,671 419,600 381,064 1,892,932 Purchase and Asset Retirement Obligations(3) 46,814 28,116 6,704 1,848 10,146 Total(4) $ 7,433,287 $ 537,648 $ 871,463 $ 1,528,200 $ 4,495,976 (1)Amounts include variable rate interest payments, which are calculated utilizing the applicable interest rates as of December 31, 2010; see Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Amounts also include interest on capital leases. (2)Amounts are offset by sublease income of $11.2 million in total (including $2.7 million, $3.8 million, $2.8 million and $1.9 million, in less than 1 year, 1 3 years, 3 5 years and more than 5 years, respectively). (3)In connection with some of our acquisitions, we have potential earn out obligations that may be payable in the event businesses we acquired meet certain financial objectives. These payments are based on the future results of these operations, and our estimate of the maximum contingent earn out payments we may be required to make under all such agreements as of December 31, 2010 is approximately $2.0 million. (4)The table above excludes $59.9 million in uncertain tax positions as we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities. We expect to meet our cash flow requirements for the next twelve months from cash generated from operations, existing cash, cash equivalents, borrowings under the Credit Agreement and other financings, which may include secured credit facilities, securitizations and mortgage or capital lease financings. We expect to meet our long term cash flow requirements using the same means described above, as well as the potential issuance of debt or equity securities as we deem appropriate. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in Regulation S K Item 303(a)(4)(ii). Net Operating Losses, Research Credits and Foreign Tax Credit Carryforwards We have federal net operating loss carryforwards which begin to expire in 2020 through 2029 of $84.3 million ($29.5 million, tax effected) at December 31, 2010 to reduce future federal taxable income. We have an asset for state net operating losses of $15.6 million (net of federal tax benefit), which begins to expire in 2011 through 2029, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 75%. We have assets for foreign net operating losses of $38.1 million, with various expiration dates, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 74%. Additionally, we have federal research credits of $2.2 million which begin to expire in 2022 through 2029 and state research credits of $1.1 million (net 62 Table of Contents of federal tax benefit) which have no expiration date, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 19%. We also have foreign tax credits of $60.8 million, which begin to expire in 2014 through 2019, subject to a valuation allowance of approximately 65%. U.S. legislative changes in 2010 reduced the expected utilization of foreign tax credits which resulted in the requirement for a valuation allowance. Inflation Certain of our expenses, such as wages and benefits, insurance, occupancy costs and equipment repair and replacement, are subject to normal inflationary pressures. Although to date we have been able to offset inflationary cost increases through increased operating efficiencies and the negotiation of favorable long term real estate leases, we can give no assurance that we will be able to offset any future inflationary cost increases through similar efficiencies, leases or increased storage or service charges.  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Market Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to market risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds and time deposits). As of December 31, 2010, we had significant concentrations of liquid investments with seven global banks and four "Triple A" rated money market funds which we consider to be large, highly rated investment grade institutions. As of December 31, 2010, our cash and cash equivalent and restricted cash balance was $293.8 million, including money market funds and time deposits amounting to $241.2 million. A substantial portion of these money market funds are invested in U.S. treasuries. Interest Rate Risk Given the recurring nature of our revenues and the long term nature of our asset base, we have the ability and the preference to use long term, fixed interest rate debt to finance our business, thereby helping to preserve our long term returns on invested capital. We target approximately 75% of our debt portfolio to be fixed with respect to interest rates. Occasionally, we will use interest rate swaps as a tool to maintain our targeted level of fixed rate debt. See Notes 3 and 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2010, we had $399.0 million of variable rate debt outstanding with a weighted average variable interest rate of approximately 2%, and $2,610.5 million of fixed rate debt outstanding. As of December 31, 2010, approximately 87% of our total debt outstanding was fixed. After taking into account the January 2011 redemption of the remaining 73/4% Notes, which was funded with approximately $180.0 million of borrowings under the revolving credit facility and cash on hand, approximately 80% of our total debt outstanding was fixed on a pro forma basis. If the weighted average variable interest rate on our variable rate debt had increased by 1%, our net income for the year ended December 31, 2010 would have been reduced by $2.4 million. See Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10 K for a discussion of our long term indebtedness, including the fair values of such indebtedness as of December 31, 2010. Currency Risk Our investments in IME, Canada Company, Iron Mountain Mexico, SA de RL de CV, Iron Mountain South America, Ltd., Iron Mountain Australia Pty Ltd., Iron Mountain New Zealand Ltd. and our other international investments may be subject to risks and uncertainties related to fluctuations in currency valuation. Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. However, our international revenues and expenses are generated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate, primarily the Euro, Canadian dollar and British pound sterling. Declines in the value of the local currencies in which we 63 Table of Contents are paid relative to the U.S. dollar will cause revenues in U.S. dollar terms to decrease and dollar denominated liabilities to increase in local currency. The impact of currency fluctuations on our earnings is mitigated significantly by the fact that most operating and other expenses are also incurred and paid in the local currency. We also have several intercompany obligations between our foreign subsidiaries and IMI and our U.S. based subsidiaries. In addition, Iron Mountain Switzerland GmbH and our foreign subsidiaries and IME also have intercompany obligations between them. These intercompany obligations are primarily denominated in the local currency of the foreign subsidiary. We have adopted and implemented a number of strategies to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in currency valuations. One strategy is to finance certain of our international subsidiaries with debt that is denominated in local currencies, thereby providing a natural hedge. In determining the amount of any such financing, we take into account local tax strategies, among other factors. Another strategy we utilize is for IMI to borrow in foreign currencies to hedge our intercompany financing activities. Finally, on occasion, we enter into currency swaps to temporarily or permanently hedge an overseas investment, such as a major acquisition to lock in certain transaction economics. We have implemented these strategies for our foreign investments in the U.K., Continental Europe and Canada. Specifically, through our 150.0 million British pounds sterling denominated 71/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 and our 255 million 63/4% Euro Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018, we effectively hedge most of our outstanding intercompany loans denominated in British pounds sterling and Euros. Canada Company has financed its capital needs through direct borrowings in Canadian dollars under the Credit Agreement and its 175.0 million CAD denominated 71/2% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2017. This creates a tax efficient natural currency hedge. In the third quarter of 2007, we designated a portion of our 63/4% Euro Senior Subordinated Notes due 2018 issued by IMI as a hedge of net investment of certain of our Euro denominated subsidiaries. As a result, we recorded $7.4 million ($4.6 million, net of tax) of foreign exchange gains related to the "marking to market" of such debt to currency translation adjustments which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive items, net included in equity for the year ended December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, net gains of $8.0 million are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive items, net associated with this net investment hedge. We have entered into a number of forward contracts to hedge our exposures to British pounds sterling. As of December 31, 2010, we had an outstanding forward contract to purchase $196.2 million U.S. dollars and sell 125.0 million in British pounds sterling to hedge our intercompany exposures with IME. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2010 we entered into a forward contract to hedge our exposures in Australian dollars. As of December 31, 2010, we had an outstanding forward contract to purchase 54.7 million Euros and sell 75.0 million Australian dollars to hedge our intercompany exposures with our Australian subsidiary. At the maturity of the forward contracts, we may enter into new forward contracts to hedge movements in the underlying currencies. At the time of settlement, we either pay or receive the net settlement amount from the forward contract and recognize this amount in other expense (income), net in the accompanying statement of operations as a realized foreign exchange gain or loss. We have not designated these forward contracts as hedges. At the end of each month, we mark the outstanding forward contracts to market and record an unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss for the mark to market valuation. During the year ended December 31, 2010, there was $2.0 million in net cash receipts included in cash from operating activities related to settlements associated with these foreign currency forward contracts. We recorded net losses in connection with these forward contracts of $2.0 million, including an unrealized foreign exchange gain of $2.5 million related to the British pound sterling forward contract and an unrealized foreign exchange loss of $2.4 million related to the Australian dollar forward contract in other expense (income), net in the accompanying statement of operations as of December 31, 2010, respectively. As 64 Table of Contents of December 31, 2010, except as noted above, our currency exposures to intercompany balances are unhedged. The impact of devaluation or depreciating currency on an entity depends on the residual effect on the local economy and the ability of an entity to raise prices and or reduce expenses. Due to our constantly changing currency exposure and the potential substantial volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange fluctuations on our business. The effect of a change in foreign exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the "Accumulated Other Comprehensive Items, net" component of equity. A 10% depreciation in year end 2010 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction in our equity of approximately $80.4 million.
